https://openalex.org/W2884276823,"Satellite data and aerial photos have proved to be useful in efficient conservation and management of mangrove ecosystems. However, there have been only very few attempts to demonstrate the ability of drone images, and none so far to observe vegetation (species-level) mapping. The present study compares the utility of drone images (DJI-Phantom-2 with SJ4000 RGB and IR cameras, spatial resolution: 5cm) and satellite images (Pleiades-1B, spatial resolution: 50cm) for mangrove mapping-specifically in terms of image quality, efficiency and classification accuracy, at the Setiu Wetland in Malaysia. Both object- and pixel-based classification approaches were tested (QGIS v.2.12.3 with Orfeo Toolbox). The object-based classification (using a manual rule-set algorithm) of drone imagery with dominant land-cover features (i.e. water, land, Avicennia alba, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata and Casuarina equisetifolia) provided the highest accuracy (overall accuracy (OA): 94.0±0.5% and specific producer accuracy (SPA): 97.0±9.3%) as compared to the Pleiades imagery (OA: 72.2±2.7% and SPA: 51.9±22.7%). In addition, the pixel-based classification (using a maximum likelihood algorithm) of drone imagery provided better accuracy (OA: 90.0±1.9% and SPA: 87.2±5.1%) compared to the Pleiades (OA: 82.8±3.5% and SPA: 80.4±14.3%). Nevertheless, the drone provided higher temporal resolution images, even on cloudy days, an exceptional benefit when working in a humid tropical climate. In terms of the user-costs, drone costs are much higher, but this becomes advantageous over satellite data for long-term monitoring of a small area. Due to the large data size of the drone imagery, its processing time was about ten times greater than that of the satellite image, and varied according to the various image processing techniques employed (in pixel-based classification, drone >50 hours, Pleiades <5 hours), constituting the main disadvantage of UAV remote sensing. However, the mangrove mapping based on the drone aerial photos provided unprecedented results for Setiu, and was proven to be a viable alternative to satellite-based monitoring/management of these ecosystems. The improvements of drone technology will help to make drone use even more competitive in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2883179103,"As antiretroviral therapy (ART) expands in resource-limited settings, understanding the impact of ART on pregnancy outcomes is critical. We analyzed women who became pregnant on ART while enrolled in a clinical trial (HPTN 052, ACTG A5208, and ACTG A5175); the majority of women were from Africa, with a median age of 29 years. Eligible women were on ART at conception and had a documented date of a last menstrual period and a pregnancy outcome. The primary outcome was non-live birth (stillbirth; spontaneous abortion; elective termination; or ectopic pregnancy) versus live birth. Preterm birth (<37 weeks completed gestation) was a secondary outcome. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models with time-varying covariates. 359 women became pregnant, of whom 253 (70%) met inclusion criteria: 127 (50%) were on NNRTI-based ART, 118 (47%) on PI-based ART, and 8 (3%) on 3-NRTIs at conception. There were 160 (63%) live births (76 term and 84 preterm), 11 (4%) stillbirths, 51 (20%) spontaneous abortions, 28 (11%) elective terminations, and 3 (1%) ectopic pregnancies. In multivariable analysis adjusted for region, parent study, and pre-pregnancy ART class, only older age was associated with increased hazard of preterm birth [HR: 2.49 for age 25–30 years; 95% CI: 1.18–5.26; p = 0.017]. Women conceiving on ART had high rates of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Despite the benefits of ART, studies designed to investigate the effects of preconception ART on pregnancy outcomes are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2883134749,"Keratoconus (KC) is a common multifactorial ectatic corneal disease with unknown onset. KC most commonly appears in adolescence and affects approximately 1:400 people worldwide. Treatment options, for advanced KC cases, are collagen cross-linking (CXL) and corneal transplants. CXL is a new KC treatment that helps arrest the disease. Unfortunately, only a fraction of KC patients will qualify for CXL treatment. Our goal, in this study, was to begin to understand how CXL affects the corneal microenvironment and pave the way towards a more patient-driven CXL treatment.Primary human corneal fibroblasts from healthy and KC donors were plated on transwell polycarbonate membranes and stimulated by a stable vitamin C. At 4 weeks, riboflavin was added followed by UVA irradiation. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and western blots were used to assess the effect of CXL on the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the resident cells, pre- and post CXL.Data shows CXL improved lamellar organization showing more organized collagen fibrils decorated with proteoglycans (PGs). The distribution of the collagen fibrils and interfibrillar spacing was also visibly improved, post-CXL. Lumican, mimecan, and decorin were the dominant PGs and were significantly upregulated in post-CXL cultures. ECM degradation proteins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP-1, -3, and -9, but not MMP-2, were significantly downregulated post-CXL. TIMP-1 and -2 were not modulated by CXL.The unknown effects of CXL on the human corneal microenvironment have hampered our ability to make CXL available to all KC patients. Our current study provides a deeper understanding on CXL activity, using our unique 3D in vitro model."
https://openalex.org/W2883950069,"Ganoderma is a large, diverse and globally-distributed genus in the Basidiomycota that includes species causing a white rot form of wood decay on a variety of tree species. For the past century, many studies of Ganoderma in North America and other regions of the world have used the name G. lucidum sensu lato for any laccate (shiny or varnished) Ganoderma species growing on hardwood trees or substrates. Molecular studies have established that G. lucidum sensu stricto (Curtis) Karst is native to Europe and some parts of China. To determine the species of the laccate Ganoderma that are present in the United States, we studied over 500 collections from recently collected samples and herbarium specimens from hardwoods, conifers, and monocots. A multilocus phylogeny using ITS, tef1α, rpb1 and rpb2 revealed three well-supported clades, similar to previously reported findings. From the U.S. collections, thirteen taxa representing twelve species were identified, including: G. curtisii, G. lucidum sensu stricto, G. martinicense, G. oregonense, G. polychromum, G. ravenelii, G. sessile, G. tsugae, G. tuberculosum, G. cf. weberianum, G. zonatum, and Tomophagus colossus (syn. G. colossus). The species G. meredithiae is synonymized with G. curtisii, and considered a physiological variant that specializes in decay of pines. The designation G. curtisii f.sp. meredithiae forma specialis nov. is proposed. Species such as G. curtisii and G. sessile, once considered as G. lucidum sensu lato, were found to be divergent from one another, and highly divergent from G. lucidum sensu stricto. Morphological characteristics such as context tissue color and features (e.g. melanoid bands), basidiospore shape and size, geographic location, and host preference were found to aid in species identification. Surprisingly, G. lucidum sensu stricto was found in the U.S., but only in geographically restricted areas of northern Utah and California. These collections appear to have resulted from the introduction of this species into the United States possibly from mushroom growers producing G. lucidum outdoors. Overall, this study clarifies the chaotic taxonomy of the laccate Ganoderma in the United States, and will help to remove ambiguities from future studies focusing on the North American species of laccate Ganoderma."
https://openalex.org/W2883150584,"The world's largest terrestrial animals (megafauna) can play profound roles in seed dispersal. Yet, the term 'megafauna' is often used to encompass a diverse range of body sizes and physiologies of, primarily, herbivorous animals. To determine the extent to which these animals varied in their seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE), we compared the contribution of different megafauna for the large-fruited Platymitra macrocarpa (Annonaceae), in a tropical evergreen forest in Thailand. We quantified 'seed dispersal effectiveness' by measuring the quantity and quality contributions of all consumers of P. macrocarpa fruit. Seed dispersal quantity was the proportion of the crop consumed by each species. Quality was defined as the proportion of seeds handled by each animal taxon that survived to produce a 2-month seedling. Megafauna (elephants, sambar deer, bears) dispersed 78% of seeds that produced seedlings, with 21% dispersed by gibbons (a medium-sized frugivore). The main megafaunal consumers displayed different dispersal strategies. Elephants were the most effective dispersers (37% of seedlings) and they achieved this by being high-quality and low-quantity dispersers. Bears displayed a similar strategy but were especially rare visitors to the trees (24% of the total seedlings produced). Sambar were high-quantity dispersers, but most seeds they handled did not survive and they were responsible for only 17% of seedlings. Gibbons displayed a high SDE relative to their body size, but they probably cannot match the role of elephants despite being more regular consumers of the fruit. The low density and poor regeneration of P. macrocarpa in the study site suggest that current dispersal rates by megafauna are insufficient, possibly reflecting reduced or missing megafauna populations. We show that different megafaunal species disperse seeds in different ways and may make unique contributions to the reproductive success of the plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2884136582,"Usnic acid is a unique polyketide produced by lichens. To characterize usnic acid biosynthesis, the transcriptome of the usnic-acid-producing lichen-forming fungus Nephromopsis pallescens was sequenced using Illumina NextSeq technology. Seven complete non-reducing polyketide synthase genes and nine highly-reducing polyketide synthase genes were obtained through transcriptome analysis. Gene expression results obtained by qPCR and usnic acid detection with LCMS-IT-TOF showed that Nppks7 is probably involved in usnic acid biosynthesis in N. pallescens. Nppks7 is a non-reducing polyketide synthase with a MeT domain that also possesses beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, acyl transferase, product template, acyl carrier protein, C-methyltransferase, and Claisen cyclase domains. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Nppks7and other polyketide synthases from lichens form a unique monophyletic clade. Taken together, our data indicate that Nppks7 is a novel PKS in N. pallescens that is likely involved in usnic acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2883824312,"Several scholars have concluded that ethnic diversity has negative consequences for social trust. However, recent research has called into question whether ethnic diversity per se has detrimental effects, or whether lower levels of trust in diverse communities simply reflect a higher concentration of less trusting groups, such as poor people, minorities, or immigrants. Drawing upon a nationally representative sample of the German population (GSOEP), we make two contributions to this debate. First, we examine how ethnic diversity at the neighborhood level–specifically the proportion of immigrants in the neighborhood–is linked to social trust focusing on the compositional effect of poverty. Second, in contrast to the majority of current research on ethnic diversity, we use a behavioral measure of trust in combination with fine-grained (zip-code level) contextual measures of ethnic composition and poverty. Furthermore, we are also able to compare the behavioral measure to a standard attitudinal trust question. We find that household poverty partially accounts for lower levels of trust, and that after controlling for income, German and non-German respondents are equally trusting. However, being surrounded by neighbors with immigrant background is also associated with lower levels of social trust."
https://openalex.org/W2884328330,"The microbiome plays a vital role in human health and disease. Interaction between human hosts and the microbiome occurs through a number of mechanisms, including transcriptomic regulation by microRNA (miRNA). In animal models, circadian variations in miRNA and microbiome elements have been described, but patterns of co-expression and potential diurnal interaction in humans have not. We investigated daily oscillations in salivary miRNA and microbial RNA to explore relationships between these components of the gut-brain-axis and their implications in human health. Nine subjects provided 120 saliva samples at designated times, on repeated days. Samples were divided into three sets for exploration and cross-validation. Identification and quantification of host miRNA and microbial RNA was performed using next generation sequencing. Three stages of statistical analyses were used to identify circadian oscillators: 1) a two-way analysis of variance in the first two sample sets identified host miRNAs and microbial RNAs whose abundance varied with collection time (but not day); 2) multivariate modeling identified subsets of these miRNAs and microbial RNAs strongly-associated with collection time, and evaluated their predictive ability in an independent hold-out sample set; 3) regulation of circadian miRNAs and microbial RNAs was explored in data from autistic children with disordered sleep (n = 77), relative to autistic peers with typical sleep (n = 63). Eleven miRNAs and 11 microbial RNAs demonstrated consistent diurnal oscillation across sample sets and accurately predicted collection time in the hold-out set. Associations among five circadian miRNAs and four circadian microbial RNAs were observed. We termed the 11 miRNAs CircaMiRs. These CircaMiRs had 1,127 predicted gene targets, with enrichment for both circadian gene targets and metabolic signaling processes. Four CircaMiRs had ""altered"" expression patterns among children with disordered sleep. Thus, novel and correlated circadian oscillations in human miRNA and microbial RNA exist and may have distinct implications in human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2884499574,"The contamination of pathogenic bacteria through irrigation water is a recognized risk factor for fresh produce. Irrigation water disinfection is an intervention strategy that could be applied to reduce the probability of microbiological contamination of crops. Disinfection treatments should be applied ensuring minimum effective doses, which are efficient in inhibiting the microbial contamination while avoiding formation and accumulation of chemical residues. Among disinfection technologies available for growers, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) represents, after sodium hypochlorite, an alternative disinfection treatment, which is commercially applied by growers in the USA and Spain. However, in most of the cases, the suitability of this treatment has been tested against pathogenic bacteria and low attention have been given to the impact of chemical residues on the bacterial community of the vegetable tissue. The aim of this study was to (i) to evaluate the continual application of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as a water disinfection treatment of irrigation water during baby spinach growth in commercial production open fields, and (ii) to determine the subsequent impact of these treatments on the bacterial communities in water, soil, and baby spinach. To gain insight into the changes in the bacterial community elicited by ClO2, samples of treated and untreated irrigation water as well as the irrigated soil and baby spinach were analyzed using Miseq® Illumina sequencing platform. Next generation sequencing and multivariate statistical analysis revealed that ClO2 treatment of irrigation water did not affect the diversity of the bacterial community of water, soil and crop, but significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of specific bacterial genera. This demonstrates the different susceptibility of the bacteria genera to the ClO2 treatment. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that the phyllosphere bacterial community of baby spinach was more influenced by the soil bacteria community rather than that of irrigation water. In the case of baby spinach, the use of low residual ClO2 concentrations (approx. 0.25 mg/L) to treat irrigation water decreased the relative abundance of Pseudomonaceae (2.28-fold) and Enterobacteriaceae (2.5-fold) when comparing treated versus untreated baby spinach. Members of these two bacterial families are responsible for food spoilage and foodborne illnesses. Therefore, a reduction of these bacterial families might be beneficial for the crop and for food safety. In general it can be concluded that the constant application of ClO2 as a disinfection treatment for irrigation water only caused changes in two bacterial families of the baby spinach and soil microbiota, without affecting the major phyla and classes. The significance of these changes in the bacterial community should be further evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2884377942,"The mortality and neurologic sequelae associated with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) remain high despite advances in medical care. The main aim of this study was to evaluate short-term outcome in patients treated as bacterial meningitis at a teaching hospital in Ethiopia to identify factors that could be focused on to improve outcome in this setting.A hospital based longitudinal study was conducted at Jimma University Hospital in southwest Ethiopia from March 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Participants of this study were patients of age 18 years and older who were treated as confirmed or possible cases of ABM. Patients were followed throughout their hospital stay for change in their clinical course and predefined end points. A multivariable analysis was done to identify factors associated with unfavorable outcomes.90 patients admitted with diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis were included in the study; cerebrospinal fluid was analysed for 85 (94.4%) of them. Causative bacteria were isolated in 26 (28.9%) patients only; most of these isolates (84.6%) were either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis. Patients managed as cases of ABM at the hospital suffered from a high rate of unfavorable outcome (36.7%) and an overall mortality rate of 22.2%. Impaired level of consciousness (AOR = 0.766, 95% CI = 0.589-0.995), dexamethasone therapy (AOR = 4.676, 95% CI = 1.12-19.50) and fever persisting after two days of admission (AOR = 24.226, 95% CI = 5.24-111.96) were found to be independently associated with unfavorable outcome.Outcome in patients treated for ABM at the hospital was found to be poor. Impaired mentation, treatment with adjunctive dexamethasone and persistent fever were found to be associated with poor outcome. Thus, development of clinical guidelines for treatment of ABM that suit the local context is essential to improve patient management and outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2884404516,"Animal movements are typically driven by areas of supply and demand for animal products and by the seasonality of production and demand. As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aïd el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale."
https://openalex.org/W2884989756,"Surveying terrestrial species across diverse habitats is important for predicting species' distributions and implementing conservation actions. For vocalising species, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is increasing in popularity; however, survey design rarely considers the factors influencing the timing and occurrence of vocalisations and in turn, how they may influence detectability of the species. Here, we use the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) as a case study to show how PAM can be used to first examine the factors influencing vocalisations, and then use occupancy modelling to make recommendations on survey design for the species. We used automated recording units to monitor koala vocalisations at ten sites between August 2016 and January 2017. The timing of male koala vocalisations was linked to time of sunset with vocalisations increasing two hours prior to sunset and peaking at four hours after sunset. Vocalisations had a seasonal trend, increasing from the early to middle stage of the breeding season. Koala population density and stage of the breeding season had more influence on detection probability than daily sampling schedule. Where population density was low, and during the early stage of the breeding season, 7 survey nights (recording for 6 hours from 20:00h to 02:00h; i.e. the period of peak bellowing activity) were required to be 95% confident of a site-specific absence. Our study provides an approach for designing effective passive acoustic surveys for terrestrial species."
https://openalex.org/W2883728402,"Considerable research has been done on the complex stock market, however, there is very little systematic work on the impact of crisis on global stock markets. For filling in these gaps, we propose a complex network method, which analyzes the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis on global main stock index from 2005 to 2010. Firstly, we construct three weighted networks. The physics-derived technique of minimum spanning tree is utilized to investigate the networks of three stages. Regional clustering is found in each network. Secondly, we construct three average threshold networks and find the small-world property in the network before and during the crisis. Finally, the dynamical change of the network community structure is deeply analyzed with different threshold. The result indicates that for large thresholds, the network before and after the crisis has a significant community structure. Though this analysis, it would be helpful to investors for making decisions regarding their portfolios or to regulators for monitoring the key nodes to ensure the overall stability of the global stock market."
https://openalex.org/W2883775566,"Emerging sexually transmitted hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported worldwide, with higher HCV infection rates among those who are HIV-infected. This study aims to determine prevalence of recent and chronic HCV infections among community-recruited MSM in New York City (NYC), map HCV infections by home, social, and sexual neighborhoods, and identify clusters of genetically linked HCV variants using phylogenetic analysis. The NYC M2M study recruited MSM via modified time-space, venue-based sampling and internet/mobile app-based recruitment during 2010–13. Participants completed a Google Earth map on neighborhoods of where they lived, socialized, and had sex in the last 3 months, an ACASI questionnaire, and a sexual network inventory about their sex partners. The men received HIV testing and provided serum samples. Testing on stored serum samples included HCV antibody and RNA viral load, HCV antibody avidity assay (avidity index <30% with positive viral load is considered recently infected), and HCV RNA extraction and amplification to generate a 432 base-pair region of Core/E1 for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Historic local controls were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Of 1,028 MSM, 79.7% were HIV-negative and 20.3% HIV-positive. Twenty nine MSM (2.8%) were HCV antibody-positive. MSM who were HCV antibody-positive reported a median of 2 male sex partners in last 3 months, with 6.9% aged 18–24, 17.2% 25–29, 13.8% 30–39, and 62.1% 40 and over. 8.1% of HIV-positive MSM were HCV antibody-positive vs. 1.5% of HIV-negative men (p<0.0001). Of 29 HCV-antibody positive MSM, 12 (41%) were HCV RNA-positive (11 subtype 1a and 1 subtype 1b). Two of 12 HCV RNA-positive participants had low antibody avidity values, suggesting recent HCV infection. HCV antibody seropositivity was significantly associated with older age >40 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.56 (95% CI 1.57, 8.08), HIV-positive serostatus, aOR 3.18 (95% CI 1.40, 7.22), any sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the last 3 months, aOR 2.81 (95% CI 1.11, 7.13), and injection drug use (IDU) ever, aOR 4.34 (95% CI 1.69, 11.17). Mapping of HCV infections differed slightly by home, social, and sexual neighborhoods. Based on phylogenetic analysis from 12 HCV RNA-positive samples, no evidence of a clustered HCV epidemic was found. Overall HCV seroprevalence was 2.8% among community-recruited MSM in NYC, with higher prevalence among HIV-positive MSM compared to HIV-negative MSM. Only two participants were found to have recent HCV infection, with no evidence of a clustered HCV epidemic based on phylogenetic analysis. Our results support testing of HCV infection among HIV-negative MSM if they report having a recent STI and IDU in the past rather than universal HCV testing in all HIV-negative MSM."
https://openalex.org/W2883918852,"Recently emerged fungal diseases, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) are an increasing threat to amphibians worldwide. In Europe, the threat of Bsal to salamander populations is demonstrated by the rapid decline of fire salamander populations in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Although most European urodelans are susceptible to infection in infection trials, recent evidence suggests marked interspecific differences in the course of infection, with potentially far reaching implications for salamander conservation. As a salamander’s skin is the first line of defense against such pathogens, interspecific differences in innate immune function of the skin may explain differential susceptibility. Here we investigate if compounds present on a salamander’s skin can kill Bsal spores and if there is variation among species. We used a non-invasive assay to compare killing ability of salamander mucosomes of four different species (captive and wild Salamandra salamandra and captive Ichtyosaura alpestris, Cynops pyrrhogaster and Lissotriton helveticus) by exposing Bsal zoospores to salamander mucosomes and determining spore survival. In all samples, zoospores were killed when exposed to mucosomes. Moreover, we saw a significant variation in this Bsal killing ability of mucosomes between different salamander host species. Our results indicate that mucosomes of salamanders might provide crucial skin protection against Bsal, and could explain why some species are more susceptible than others. This study represents a step towards better understanding host species variation in innate immune function and disease susceptibility in amphibians."
https://openalex.org/W2884255178,"Background Zimbabwe adopted voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) as a priority HIV prevention strategy in 2007 and began implementation in 2009. We evaluated the costs and impact of this VMMC program to date and in future. Methods Three mathematical models describing Zimbabwe’s HIV epidemic and program evolution were calibrated to household survey data on prevalence and risk behaviors, with circumcision coverage calibrated to program-reported VMMCs. We compared trends in new infections and costs to a counterfactual without VMMC. Input assumptions were agreed in workshops with national stakeholders in 2015 and 2017. Results The VMMC program averted 2,600–12,200 infections (among men and women combined) by the end of 2016. This impact will grow as circumcised men are protected lifelong, and onward dynamic transmission effects, which protect women via reduced incidence and prevalence in their male partners, increase over time. If other prevention interventions remain at 2016 coverages, the VMMCs already performed will avert 24,400–69,800 infections (2.3–5% of all new infections) through 2030. If coverage targets are achieved by 2021 and maintained, the program will avert 108,000–171,000 infections (10–13% of all new infections) by 2030, costing $2,100–3,250 per infection averted relative to no VMMC. Annual savings from averted treatment needs will outweigh VMMC maintenance costs once coverage targets are reached. If Zimbabwe also achieves ambitious UNAIDS targets for scaling up treatment and prevention efforts, VMMC will reduce the HIV incidence remaining at 2030 by one-third, critically contributing to the UNAIDS goal of 90% incidence reduction. Conclusions VMMC can substantially impact Zimbabwe’s HIV epidemic in the coming years; this investment will save costs in the longer term."

Understanding how individuals undergoing preconception expanded carrier screening value this information is important. The NextGen study evaluated the use of genome sequencing for expanded carrier screening and reporting secondary findings, and we measured participants' willingness to pay for this approach to understand how it is valued by women and couples planning a pregnancy.We assessed 277 participants' willingness to pay for genome sequencing reporting carrier results for 728 gene/condition pairs and results for 121 secondary findings. We explored the association between attitudes and demographic factors and willingness to pay for expanded carrier screening using genome sequencing and conducted interviews with 58 of these participants to probe the reasoning behind their preferences.Most participants were willing to pay for expanded carrier screening using genome sequencing. Willingness to pay was associated with income level and religiosity, but not risk status for a condition in the carrier panel. Participants willing to pay nothing or a small amount cited issues around financial resources, whereas those willing to pay higher amounts were motivated by ""peace of mind"" from carrier results.Women and couples planning a pregnancy value genome sequencing. The potentially high out-of-pocket cost of this service could result in healthcare disparities, since maximum amounts that participants were willing to pay were higher than a typical copay and related to income."
https://openalex.org/W2884440330,"Like DIP-STR markers (deletion/insertion polymorphism-short tandem repeat combinations), SNP-STR markers (single nucleotide polymorphism-STR combinations) are also valuable in forensic DNA mixture analysis. In this study, eight SNP-STRs were selected, and a stable and sensitive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for amplifying these SNP-STRs and the Amelogenin gender marker according to the principle of amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). This novel multiplex set allows detection of the minor DNA contributor in a DNA mixture of any gender and cellular origin with high resolution (beyond a DNA ratio of 1:20). In addition, SNP-STR haplotype frequencies were estimated based on a survey of 350 unrelated individuals from Chinese Han population, and the combined power of discrimination (PD) and power of exclusion (PE) of the eight SNP-STRs were calculated as 0.99999999965 and 0.9996, which were obviously higher than that of the eight STR loci: 0.9999999954 and 0.9989 respectively. The results indicated that the SNP-STR compound markers have higher application value in forensic identification compared to standard autosomal STRs, especially in the analysis of imbalanced DNA mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W2884295103,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the differences in energy system contributions and temporal variables between offensive and all-round playing styles. Fifteen male table tennis players (Offensive players: N = 7; All-round players: N = 8) participated in the study. Matches were monitored by a portable gas analyzer and the blood lactate responses was also measured. The contributions of the oxidative (WOXID), phosphagen (WPCr), and glycolytic (W[La]) energy systems were assumed as the oxygen consumption measured during the matches above of baseline value, the fast component of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOCFAST) measured after the matches, and the net of blood lactate concentration (Δ[La]), respectively. Energy systems contributions were not significantly different between the offensive and all-round playing styles (WOXID: 96.1±2.0 and 97.0±0.6%, P = 0.86; WPCr: 2.7±1.7 and 2.0±0.6%, P = 0.13; W[La]: 1.2±0.5 and 1.0±0.7%, P = 0.95; respectively), however, magnitude-based analysis of WPCr presented Likely higher contribution for offensive compared to all-round players. Regarding temporal variables, only rate of shots presented higher values for offensive when compared to all-round players (P = 0.03), while the magnitude-based analysis presented Very likely lower, Likely lower and Likely higher outcomes of rate of shots, WPCr and maximal oxygen consumption, respectively, for all-round players. Strong negative correlation was verified for offensive players between number of shots and WPCr (r = -0.86, P = 0.01), while all-round players showed strong correlations between rally duration, WOXID (r = 0.76, P = 0.03) and maximal oxygen consumption (r = 0.81, P = 0.03).

As part of a cross-sectional study, we examined factors associated with symptomatic LSS (sLSS) in the general population of Japan.We evaluated 968 participants (men, 319; women, 649) between 2008 and 2010. Orthopedic surgery specialists diagnosed sLSS using interview results, medical examinations, and imaging findings. LSS was radiographically graded using a 4-level scale. Additionally, we examined basic anthropometry, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, ankle-brachial index values (ABI), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. We grouped patients with moderate and severe radiographic LSS, and compared the indicated factors on the basis of the presence/absence of sLSS. Data were evaluated using multiple logistic regression analyses.Radiographically, 451 participants had moderate and 288 severe stenosis. Clinically, 92 participants were diagnosed with sLSS, including 36 with moderate and 52 with severe stenosis. In the moderate stenosis group, participants with sLSS had significantly higher rates of diabetes mellitus (DM) and lower ABIs than did non-LSS participants. Although sLSS participants tended to be older (p = 0.19), there were no significant differences in the sex distribution, body mass index values, or in the percentages of participants who were drinkers/smokers. In the severe stenosis group, there were no differences in any of the evaluated factors. Multiple logistic regression showed that DM (odds ratio [OR], 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-9.34]) and low ABI (1 SD = 0.09; OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.04-1.81) were significantly associated with LSS in the moderate stenosis group.DM and low ABIs are significantly associated with sLSS in patients with moderate radiographic stenosis. Neither factor is associated with sLSS in patients with severe stenosis. Notably, the effects of intrinsic factors on symptomology may be masked when anatomic stenosis is severe."
https://openalex.org/W2883903560,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a severe contagious disease in a broad range of hosts. This is the first study to genetically characterise CDV strains from four different wildlife species in South Africa. The phylogenetic diversity of CDV is examined, using the haemagglutinin gene. The South African wildlife CDV isolates showed a high degree of similarity to CDV in South African domestic dogs. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of 12 geographical lineages with CDV strains from South African wildlife falling within the Southern African lineage. The study reveals two possible co-circulating sub-genotypes corresponding to the northern and southern regions of South Africa respectively. CDV strains from the non-canid species were distinct, but similar to CDV isolates from domestic dog and wild canids. Residues at amino acid sites of the SLAM binding region support the notion that CDV strains encoding 519I / 549H are better adapted to non-canid species than canid species. The amino acids present at site 530 are conserved regardless of host species. Strains from South African wild carnivores showed no difference between host species with all strains presenting 530N. All non-canid strains in this study presented the combination 519I/549H. No evidence of host adaptation or lineage grouping was observed for the Nectin-4 binding region. Further studies should include CDV strains isolated from various hosts from a wider geographical range in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2884237873,"Over 400 million years ago, the evolution of vertebrates gave rise to a life cycle in which the organism began to live longer particularly as an adult. To accommodate such a longer lifespan, the organism underwent adaptation, developing a mechanism for long-lived cellular homeostasis. This adaptation required a population of long-lived relatively quiescent somatic stem cells (SSCs) along with a more proliferative differentiated daughter cell population, and was necessary to safeguard the genetic attributes with which SSCs were endowed. Intriguingly, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and E1A-binding protein, 300 kDa (p300), the highly homologous Kat3 coactivators had diverged, through duplication of ancestral Kat3, immediately preceding the evolution of vertebrates, given that both CBP and p300 have been detected in nearly all vertebrates versus non-vertebrates. We now demonstrate that a relatively small, highly evolutionarily conserved, amino terminal 9 amino acid deletion in CBP versus p300, plays a critical role in allowing for both robust maintenance of genomic integrity in stem cells and the initiation of a feed-forward differentiation mechanism by tightly controlling the interaction of the nuclear receptor family with the Wnt signaling cascade in either an antagonistic or synergistic manner."
https://openalex.org/W2883155272,"The incidence of thyroid cancer has risen dramatically in the past few decades. The cause of this is unclear, but several lines of evidence indicate it is largely due to overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of tumors that would have never manifest clinically if untreated. Practices leading to overdiagnosis may relate to defensive medicine. In this study, we evaluated the association between malpractice climate and incidence of thyroid, breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancer in U.S. states from 1999-2012 using publicly available government data. State-level malpractice risk was quantified as malpractice payout rate, the number of malpractice payouts per 100,000 people per state per year. Associations between state-level cancer incidence, malpractice payout rate, and several cancer risk factors were evaluated. Risk factors included several social determinants of health, including factors predicting healthcare access. States with higher malpractice payout rate had higher thyroid cancer incidence, on both univariate analysis (r = 0.51, P = 0.009, Spearman) and multivariate analysis (P<0.001, multilevel model). In contrast, state-level malpractice payout rate was not associated with incidence of any other cancer type. Malpractice climate may be a social determinant for being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This may be a product of greater defensive medicine in states with higher malpractice risk, which leads to increased diagnostic testing of patients with thyroid nodules and potential overdiagnosis. Alternatively, malpractice risk may be a proxy for another, unmeasured risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2883532868,"This study investigates the effect of a new computer-based visual search training (VST) that was adapted for children with homonymous hemianopia (HH).22 children with HH (median age 11 years, 8 months: 6y6m-19y2m) trained at home for 15 minutes twice/day, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks. To assess performance before training (T1), directly after training (T2) and 6 weeks after the end of training (T3), we measured search times (STs) during on-screen search (with eye tracking), and in a real life search task. Additional variables analyzed during on-screen search were numbers, amplitudes, and durations of saccades, their directional patterns and the proportional number of saccades into the non-seeing field. The latter was the main variable during free viewing. Sixteen healthy age-matched children, who did not undergo the training, served as comparison group. Quality of Life (QoL)-questionnaires were also applied.STs of the patients decreased significantly during the training and all search performance tests. This improvement persisted 6 weeks after the end of the training. Saccade amplitudes increased, total number of saccades to find the target decreased, and the proportional number of saccades to the non-seeing side increased. These changes were maintained at T3. Saccade durations did not change. During free viewing, saccades were equally distributed to both sides before and after training. Patients reported improvements in QoL and activities of daily living. Performance in the healthy children did not change by simply repeating the visual search test.The improvement in STs in all search tasks, larger and fewer saccades, and an improved search strategy after VST suggests that the children with HH benefited from the training. The maintained improvement at T3 and the improvement in the real life search task indicate that the newly developed search strategy persists and can be applied to everyday life."
https://openalex.org/W2787922519,"Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) has been linked to many different behavioral tendencies. However, not all of these correlations have replicated well across samples. Arnocky et al. (in press, Archives of Sexual Behavior) recently reported that sexual desire was correlated with fWHR. The current study aimed to test this relationship in a large sample of women. fWHR was measured from face images of 754 women. Each woman completed the Sexual Desire Inventory, which measures total, dyadic, and solitary sexual desire. Analyses revealed no significant correlations between fWHR and any of our measures of sexual desire. These null results do not support the hypothesis that fWHR is related to women’s sexual desire. Additionally, we found no evidence that women’s face-shape sexual dimorphism was related to their sociosexual orientation."

The results indicate that the two original methods introduced in this paper and the Exponential Natural Evolutionary Strategy method largely outperform the other methods with respect to all considered criteria. The results collected in different experimental conditions also reveal the importance of regulating the selective pressure and the importance of exposing evolving agents to variable environmental conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2884272725,"Periptychus is the archetypal genus of Periptychidae, a clade of prolific Paleocene ‘condylarth’ mammals from North America that were among the first placental mammals to radiate after the end-Cretaceous extinction, remarkable for their distinctive dental anatomy. A comprehensive understanding of the anatomy of Periptychus has been hindered by a lack of cranial and postcranial material and only cursory description of existing material. We comprehensively describe the cranial, dental and postcranial anatomy of Periptychus carinidens based on new fossil material from the early Paleocene (Torrejonian) of New Mexico, USA. The cranial anatomy of Periptychus is broadly concurrent with the inferred plesiomorphic eutherian condition, albeit more robust in overall construction. The rostrum is moderately elongate with no constriction, the facial region is broad, and the braincase is small with a well-exposed mastoid on the posterolateral corner and tall sagittal and nuchal crests. The dentition of Periptychus is characterized by strongly crenulated enamel, enlarged upper and lower premolars with a tall centralised paracone/protoconid. The postcranial skeleton of Periptychus is that of a robust, medium-sized (~20 Kg) stout-limbed animal that was incipiently mediportal and adopted a plantigrade stance. The structure of the fore- and hindlimb of Periptychus corresponds to that of a typically terrestrial mammal, while morphological features of the forelimb such as the low tubercles of the humerus, long and prominent deltopectoral crest, pronounced medial epicondyle, and hemispherical capitulum indicate some scansorial and/or fossorial ability. Most striking is the strongly dorsoplantarly compressed astragalus of Periptychus, which in combination with the distal crus and calcaneal morphology indicates a moderately mobile cruropedal joint. The anatomy of Periptychus is unique and lacks any extant analogue; it combines a basic early placental body plan with numerous unique specializations in its dental, cranial and postcranial anatomy that exemplify the ability of mammals to adapt and evolve following catastrophic environmental upheaval."
https://openalex.org/W2884715807,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of high b-value (2000 sec/mm2) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) by using Readout Segmentation of Long Variable Echo-trains (RESOLVE) in differentiating papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) from benign thyroid nodules.Consecutive patients with thyroid nodules scheduled for surgery underwent high b-value DWI with 3 b-values: 0, 800 and 2000 sec/mm2. Signal intensity ratios (SIRs) of thyroid nodules to adjacent normal thyroid tissue on DWI were measured as: SIRb0, SIRb800 and SIRb2000. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values based on the 3 different b-values were acquired as: ADCb0-800, ADCb0-2000, and ADCb0-800-2000. The 6 diagnostic indicators were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and diagnostic ability was compared between high b-value DWI and Ultrasound (US).A total of 52 PTCs including 33 PTMCs (38 patients, 8 men and 30 women, aged 45.68 ± 11.93 years) and 62 benign thyroid nodules (46 patients, 7 men and 39 women, aged 48.73 ± 11.98 years) were enrolled into the final statistical analysis. ADCb0-800-2000 had the highest diagnostic ability in differentiating PTCs from benign thyroid nodules with area under curve (AUC) of 0.944, sensitivity of 96.15% and specificity of 85.48%, and PTMCs from benign thyroid nodules with AUC of 0.940, sensitivity of 93.94% and specificity of 85.48%. On the strength of lower false-positive rates than US (14.52% vs. 32.26% for PTCs and 14.52% vs. 32.26% for PTMCs), ADCb0-800-2000 had significantly better diagnostic ability in PTCs (P = 0.002) and PTMCs (P = 0.005).High b-value (2000 sec/mm2) DWI can contribute to differentiating PTCs and PTMCs from benign thyroid nodules and can be potentially used as an active surveillance imaging method for PTMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2884817886,"Introduction Green tea extract has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects which improve dyslipidemia and decrease adipose tissue depots associated with hyperlipidic diet consumption. Objective To evaluate the effect of green tea extract consumption by rats during pregnancy and lactation on the metabolism of their offspring that received control or high-fat diet with water during 10 weeks after weaning. Methods Wistar rats received water (W) or green tea extract diluted in water (G) (400 mg/kg body weight/day), and control diet (10 animals in W and G groups) during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, offspring received water and a control (CW) or a high-fat diet (HW), for 10 weeks. One week before the end of treatment, oral glucose tolerance test was performed. The animals were euthanized and the samples were collected for biochemical, hormonal and antioxidant enzymes activity analyses. In addition, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were quantified by ELISA while p-NF-κBp50 was analyzed by Western Blotting. Repeated Measures ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test were used to find differences between data (p < 0.05). Results The consumption of high-fat diet by rats for 10 weeks after weaning promoted hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and increased fat depots. The ingestion of a high-fat diet by the offspring of mothers who consumed green tea extract during pregnancy and lactation decreased the inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue, while the ingestion of a control diet increased the same cytokines. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that prenatal consumption of green tea associated with consumption of high-fat diet by offspring after weaning prevented inflammation. However, maternal consumption of the green tea extract induced a proinflammatory status in the adipose tissue of the adult offspring that received the control diet after weaning."
https://openalex.org/W2952654989,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in many cellular processes. Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods.We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, recent methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information. The database interface representing our results is accessible from https://rostlab.org/services/ppipair/. The data can also be downloaded from https://figshare.com/collections/ProfPPI-DB/4141784."
https://openalex.org/W2884703258,"Maternal mortality in Mozambique has not declined significantly in the last 10-15 years, plateauing around 480 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Good quality antenatal care and routine and emergency intrapartum care are critical to reducing preventable maternal and newborn deaths.We compare the findings from two national cross-sectional facility-based assessments conducted in 2007 and 2012. Both were designed to measure the availability, use and quality of emergency obstetric and neonatal care. Indicators for monitoring emergency obstetric care were used as were descriptive statistics.The availability of facilities providing the full range of obstetric life-saving procedures (signal functions) decreased. However, an expansion in the provision of individual signal functions was highly visible in health centers and health posts, but in hospitals, performance was less satisfactory, with proportionally fewer hospitals providing assisted vaginal delivery, obstetric surgery and blood transfusions. All other key indicators showed signs of improvements: the institutional delivery rate, the cesarean delivery rate, met need for emergency obstetric care (EmOC), institutional stillbirth and early neonatal death rates, and cause-specific case fatality rates (CFRs). CFRs for most major obstetric complications declined between 17% and 69%. The contribution of direct causes to maternal deaths decreased while the proportion of indirect causes doubled during the five-year interval.The indicator of EmOC service availability, often used for planning and developing EmONC networks, requires close examination. The standard definition can mask programmatic weaknesses and thus, fails to inform decision makers of what to target. In this case, the decline in the use of assisted vaginal delivery explained much of the difference in this indicator between the two surveys, as did faltering hospital performance. Despite this backsliding, many signs of improvement were also observed in this 5-year period, but indicator levels continue below recommended thresholds. The quality of intrapartum care and the adverse consequences from infectious diseases during pregnancy point to priority areas for programmatic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2884976020,"Background Patients with end-stage renal disease have very high mortality. In individuals on hemodialysis, cardiovascular deaths account for ~50% of all deaths in this population, mostly due to arrhythmia. To determine the causes of these arrhythmic deaths is essential in order to adopt preventive strategies. The main objective of this study was to investigate whether, the presence of QTc interval alterations, from electrolyte abnormalities or presence of rare genetic variants, could have a relationship with sudden arrhythmogenic deaths in end-stage renal disease patients. Methods We recorded the pre- and post-dialysis QTc interval in 111 patients undergoing hemodialysis. In 47 of them, we analyzed 24 SCD-related genes including the most prevalent genes associated with long QT syndrome using a custom resequencing panel. Results We found a positive although not significant association between the presence of long QTc and mortality in a subset of end-stage renal disease patients. In addition, in five patients with long QTc only after dialysis (21.7%) we detected rare potentially pathogenic genetic variants. Three out of these five carriers subsequently died suddenly. Conclusions Genetic background may be determinant in the risk of sudden cardiac death in these patients. We recommend evaluating the QTc interval before and after hemodialysis, and performing a genetic analysis of individuals with long QTc after hemodialysis."

The technique allows for quick and accurate species identification using only minimal amounts of tissue samples taken from any organism at any developmental phase. DNA barcoding has many practical applications including furthering the study of taxonomy and monitoring biodiversity. In addition to these uses, DNA barcoding is a powerful tool to empower, engage, and educate students in the scientific method while conducting productive and creative research. The study presented here provides the first assessment of Marine Park (Brooklyn, New York, USA) biodiversity using DNA barcoding. New York City citizen scientists (high school students and their teachers) were trained to identify species using DNA barcoding during a two-week long institute. By performing NCBI GenBank BLAST searches, students taxonomically identified 187 samples (1 fungus, 70 animals and 116 plants) and also published 12 novel DNA barcodes on GenBank. Students also identified 7 ant species and demonstrated the potential of DNA barcoding for identification of this especially diverse group when coupled with traditional taxonomy using morphology. Here we outline how DNA barcoding allows citizen scientists to make preliminary taxonomic identifications and contribute to modern biodiversity research."

https://openalex.org/W2883838567,"Even though chronic stress is a pervasive problem in contemporary societies and is known to potentially precede both adverse psychological as well as physiological conditions, its effects on decision making have not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we focus on the relation between self-reported chronic stress and self-reported as well as behaviorally shown social preferences. We measured chronic stress with the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress. To determine social preferences, participants played a double anonymous dictator game. In order to control for the robustness of social preferences we employed a 2x2x2x2 design where we manipulated four variables: the frame (Give to Recipient vs. Take from Recipient), the decision maker’s gender (Female vs. Male), the recipient’s gender (Female vs. Male), and the nature of the reward (Real vs. Hypothetical). Results show that perceived chronic stress is not significantly related to social preferences in monetarily rewarded dictator decisions for either gender. However, women’s displayed preferences for hypothetical rewards are negatively correlated to chronic stress levels. This indicates that higher chronic stress in women is associated with lower hypothetical transfers but not with altered actual behavior as compared to non-stressed women. For men, we do not observe such effects. Our findings suggest that, while chronic stress leaves social preferences unaffected in an incentive compatible task, it might foster what could be interpreted as a decrease in self-image promotion in women. Thus, we conclude that in a thoroughly controlled behavioral task differences in reported chronic stress do not entail differences in social preferences, but relate to variation in hypothetical decisions for women."

https://openalex.org/W2883065321,"Background and aim Pancreatic cancer is one of the common cancers in US and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The objectives of our study were to look at the recent trends in the number of hospitalizations with pancreatic cancer. Methods We identified patients with a discharge diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in the National Inpatient Sample from 2007 to 2011 using International Classification of Diseases—Clinical Modification, 9th revision (ICD-9-CM) codes. We looked at the yearly trend in the hospitalizations with pancreatic cancer and the outcomes which included length of stay (LOS), hospital charges and in-hospital mortality. We also performed multivariate analysis to look for the predictors of mortality. Results There were 450, 414 patients with discharge diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. There was 18% increase in hospitalizations with pancreatic cancer in 2011 compared to 2007. Most of the patients were Caucasian (63%) with the mean age of 68 ± 0.14 years, had Medicare (57%) as primary insurance, were from Southern region (35%) and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (87% with CCI > = 5). 6% underwent Whipple’s procedure in the index hospitalization. After the adjustment for inflation, the mean hospital charges increased from $ 47,331 in 20007 to $ 53, 854 in 2011 (p = 0.01). LOS decreased from 7.31 ± 0.11 days in 2007 to 6.70 ± 0.09 days in 2011 (<0.001). Despite the increase in the number of hospitalizations of patients with pancreatic cancer, mortality decreased from 9.8% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2011 (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, the independent factors associated with higher mortality were older age, male sex African-American race, insurance status other than Medicare, higher CCI and enrollment in palliative care. There was regional variation in mortality. Whipple’s procedure conferred lower mortality. Conclusions Our study showed downward trends in LOS and in-hospital mortality despite increasing hospitalizations with pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2883623335,"Attention has been theorized to play a key role in the experience of pain and associated task interference. Training attention away from pain via attention bias modification (ABM) training techniques has been proposed to improve pain-related outcomes, but evidence is inconsistent. In an experimental study, we investigated the impact of a single session ABM training -using a visual probe paradigm with idiosyncratic pain words- on cold pressor test (CPT) pain experience and task interference by pain. Fifty-eight healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to an ABM training group (N = 28; attending away from pain) and a sham training group (N = 30; no training direction). At pre-training, participants performed a baseline Random-Interval-Repetition (RIR) task and the CPT. Participants reported on sensations they experienced during the baseline CPT. Relevant descriptors were integrated in the visual probe paradigm during the training phase. At post-training, participants completed the RIR task again while experiencing CPT pain. Participants also reported on the extent they attended to the pain and the intensity/unpleasantness of the pain. Results indicated that, in contrast with our hypotheses, ABM training did also not reduce task interference due to CPT pain. Furthermore, ABM training did not change self-reported attending to CPT pain. Finally, ABM training did not reduce CPT pain intensity or pain unpleasantness. Overall, the current study provides no support for the effectiveness of a single session ABM training in improving pain-related outcomes. Future research addressing the conditions under which ABM training improves or fails to improve pain-related outcomes is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2884526601,"Introduction Ventilation system filters process recirculated indoor air along with outdoor air. This function inspires the idea of using the filter as an indoor bioaerosol sampler. While promising, there remains a need to investigate several factors that could limit the accuracy of such a sampling approach. Among the important factors are the dynamics of microbial assemblages on filter surfaces over time and the differential influence of outdoor versus recirculated indoor air. Methods This study collected ventilation system filter samples from an air handling unit on a regular schedule over a 21-week period and analyzed the accumulation patterns of biological particles on the filter both quantitatively (using fluorometry and qPCR) and in terms of microbial diversity (using 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing). Results The quantitative result showed that total and bacterial DNA accumulated monotonically, rising to 41 ng/cm2 for total DNA and to 2.8 ng/cm2 for bacterial DNA over the 21-week period. The accumulation rate of bacterial DNA correlated with indoor occupancy level. Fungal DNA first rose to 4.0 ng/cm2 before showing a dip to 1.4 ng/cm2 between weeks 6 and 10. The dip indicated a possible artifact of this sampling approach for quantitative analysis as DNA may not be conserved on the filter over the months-long service period. The sequencing results indicate major contributions from outdoor air for fungi and from recirculated indoor air for bacteria. Despite the quantitative changes, the community structure of the microbial assemblages was stable throughout the 21-week sampling period, highlighting the robustness of this sampling method for microbial profiling. Conclusion This study supports the use of ventilation system filters as indoor bioaerosol samplers, but with caveats: 1) an outdoor reference is required to properly understand the contribution of outdoor bioaerosols; and 2) there is a need to better understand the persistence and durability of the targeted organisms on ventilation system filters."
https://openalex.org/W2884773664,"Background Informing residents in long term care facilities (LTCFs) about their prognosis can help them prepare for the end of life. This study aimed to examine which proportion of European LTCF residents, close to death, are accurately prognosticated and consequently informed about their prognosis; and to examine factors related to accurate prognostication and discussion of prognosis. Methods A subsample of SHELTER study data was used, consisting of: 500 residents from 5 European countries, who died within 6 months after their last assessment, and had a valid answer on the item ‘End stage disease, 6 or fewer months to live’. This item was used to indicate whether an accurate prognosis was established and discussed with residents. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine factors related to establishment and discussion of accurate prognosis. Results 86.4% of residents close to death did not receive an accurate prognosis. Residents with cancer; fatigue; dehydration; and normal mode of nutritional intake were more likely to have an accurate prognosis established and discussed. Accurate prognostication and prognosis discussion was less likely for residents who: had a diagnosis under ‘other’; initiated interactions; and residents from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Conclusions The great majority of residents close to death did not receive an accurate prognosis. Prognostication tools might help clinicians to increase their prognostic accuracy and communication training might help to discuss prognosis with residents."
https://openalex.org/W2883903005,"Objectives Studies on dental plaque removal by chewing an apple are scarce and dated, with conflicting findings. This study aimed to determine whether chewing an apple produced mechanical removal of dental plaque or had any effect on salivary bacterial viability. Methods The study group consisted of 20 healthy adults with good oral health status who were randomly assigned to brush their teeth or eat an apple. After 2 weeks, the experiment was repeated with the order reversed. Plaque index (PI) and the bacterial viability (BV) in a sample of whole saliva (spit) were determined before brushing or apple eating (baseline, B), immediately afterward (A) and 24 hours afterward (24). Results After chewing an apple, PI-A was significantly higher than both PI-B (P < .001) and PI-24 (P < .001). BV-A was significantly lower than BV-B (P < .001), with a return to baseline values at the BV-24 measurement. Conclusions Chewing an apple does not remove dental plaque, and may favor plaque regrowth during the first 24 hours, but it does produce an immediate reduction in salivary bacterial viability similar to that after tooth brushing."
https://openalex.org/W2884113595,"Saddle slip, defined as a progressive lateral displacement of the saddle during ridden exercise, has recently been given attention in the scientific press as a potential sign of lameness.

Data from seven Warmblood dressage horses competing at Grand Prix (n = 6) or FEI Intermediate (n = 1) level, ridden by their usual riders, were used. Simultaneous kinetic, kinematic and saddle pressure measurements were conducted during sitting and rising trot on a force-measuring treadmill. The maximum lateral movement of the caudal part of the saddle relative to the horse's spine (MAX) was determined for each diagonal step. A mixed model was applied, with MAX as outcome, and T6 and S3 vertical position, rigid body rotation angles (roll, pitch, yaw) of the horse's and rider's pelvis, vertical ground reaction forces, saddle force, and rider position (rising in rising trot, sitting in rising trot or sitting in sitting trot) as explanatory variables. The least square means for MAX were 14.3 (SE 4.7) mm and 23.9 (SE 4.7) mm for rising and sitting in rising trot, and 20.3 (SE 4.7) mm for sitting trot. A 10 mm increase in maximum pelvic height at push off increased MAX by 1.4 mm (p<0.0001). One degree increase in rider pelvis roll decreased MAX 1.1 mm, and one degree increase in rider pelvis yaw increased MAX 0.7 mm (both p<0.0001). The linear relationships found between MAX and movements of both horse and rider implies that both horse and rider movement asymmetries are reflected in the lateral movements or oscillations of the saddle in non-lame horses."
https://openalex.org/W2884755930,"The performance of density based clustering algorithms may be greatly influenced by the chosen parameter values, and achieving optimal or near optimal results very much depends on empirical knowledge obtained from previous experiments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel density based clustering algorithm called the Density Propagation based Adaptive Multi-density clustering (DPAM) algorithm. DPAM can adaptively cluster spatial data. In order to avoid manual intervention when choosing parameters of density clustering and still achieve high performance, DPAM performs clustering in three stages: (1) generate the micro-clusters graph, (2) density propagation with redefinition of between-class margin and intra-class cohesion, and (3) calculate regional density. Experimental results demonstrated that DPAM could achieve better performance than several state-of-the-art density clustering algorithms in most of the tested cases, the ability of no parameters needing to be adjusted enables the proposed algorithm to achieve promising performance."
https://openalex.org/W2883205569,"Acoustic communication plays a pivotal role in conspecific recognition in numerous animal taxa. Vocalizations must therefore have discrete acoustic signatures to facilitate intra-specific communication and to avoid misidentification. Here we investigate the potential role of echolocation in communication in horseshoe bats. Although it has been demonstrated that echolocation can be used to discriminate among con- and hetero-specifics, the specific acoustic cues used in discrimination are still relatively unknown. Furthermore, the Acoustic Communication Hypothesis proposes that in multispecies assemblages, in which echolocation frequencies are likely to overlap, bats partition acoustic space along several dimensions so that each species occupies a discrete communication domain. Thus, multiple echolocation variables may be used in discrimination. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of various echolocation variables to function as discriminatory cues in echolocation-based species discrimination. Using habituation-dishabituation playback experiments, we firstly tested the ability of Rhinolophus clivosus to discriminate between echolocation pulses of heterospecifics with either discrete or overlapping frequencies. Secondly, to determine whether R. clivosus could use echolocation variables other than frequency, we investigated its ability to discriminate among echolocation pulses differing in only one manipulated parameter. These test variables were identified by their contribution to the dissimilarity among pulses. Our results suggest that R. clivosus could discriminate readily between species using echolocation pulses with discrete frequencies. When frequencies overlapped, the ability of bats to discriminate was dependant on additional acoustic variables that defined the acoustic space occupied by the test signal. These additional acoustic variables included, but may not be restricted to, sweep rate of the FM and duty cycle. Thus, when echolocation pulses share a similar acoustic domain, bats use several cues to reliably discriminate among heterospecifics."
https://openalex.org/W2884099125,"In this study, Saussurea bogedaensis Yu-J. Wang & Jie Chen, a new species from Bogeda Mountain in the eastern part of the Tianshan Mountains, is described and discussed based on evidence in terms of both morphological and genetic data. S. bogedaensis is morphologically similar to S. involucrata, which is distributed in the western part of the Tianshan Mountains, and it is well known because of its beauty, rarity, and medicinal value. The new species is also similar to S. orgaadayi, which is distributed in the nearby Altai Mountains. Our genetic data support the close relationships among these three species. According to their allopathic distributions, we suggest that these three species are derived from the same ancestor but that they differentiated after reaching their current range. In addition, we propose that the new species might serve as an alternative to S. involucrata in medicine due to their very high similarity. However, this species appears to be rare because we only found six mature individuals in the field despite extensive investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2883797865,"""Double-hit"" and ""double-expressor"" lymphomas represent distinct but overlapping subsets of aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The high rates of bone marrow involvement by these lymphomas pose a major therapeutic challenge due to the chemotherapy-resistant nature of the bone marrow microenvironment and the limited utility of rituximab-based salvage regimens in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. Preclinical studies utilizing high-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab have recently shown promise in the treatment of intramedullary disease, and a Phase I human trial is now underway. In support of such efforts, here we perform CD52 target validation on a series of double-hit (n = 40) and double-expressor (n = 58) lymphomas using immunohistochemistry. CD52 expression levels varied considerably across samples, however positive staining was observed in 75% of both double-hit and double-expressor lymphomas. Similarly, high levels of CD52 expression were seen in patients whose disease was associated with high-risk clinical features, including primary refractory status (73%), higher IPI score (76%), and bone marrow involvement (74%). CD52 expression was not significantly correlated with diagnostically relevant pathologic features such as morphology, cytogenetic findings or other immunophenotypic features, but was notably present in all cases lacking CD20 expression (n = 6). We propose that CD52 expression status be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to guide eligibility for clinical trial enrollment."
https://openalex.org/W2883623392,"Background and objectives High monocyte counts are related to adverse outcomes in cardiovascular disease. Their role in prognostication in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown. We investigated whether monocyte counts are useful as a marker of prognosis in patients with AF. Methods Monocyte counts were obtained from blood samples in 881 AF patients. Study outcomes were (i) all-cause death; (ii) major adverse cardiovascular events; (iii) stroke, TIA or other systemic embolism (SSE); and (iv) major bleeding. Results Median follow up was 7.2 years; 44% of patients died, 48% developed MACE; 9% had SSE and 5% had major bleeding. On Cox regression, after adjustment for CHA2DS2-VASc score, the highest quartile of monocyte counts (i.e., ≥580 μL vs. other quartiles) was associated with increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–2.05, p<0.001) and MACE (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28–1.96, p<0.001). Persistent monocyte levels ≥580 per μL during follow up were associated with further increase in risk of death (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10–2.11, p = 0.01) and MACE (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13–2.09, p = 0.006). Persistent monocyte levels ≥580 per μL during were associated with a significant increase in major bleeding events (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.36–5.67, p = 0.005, after adjustment for HAS-BLED score). Conclusion High monocyte counts independently predict the occurrence of MACE, major bleeding and mortality, but not SSE. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved would help understand the relationships between monocytes, and adverse thrombotic and bleeding outcomes in AF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2883988228,"Heavy drinkers of alcohol are reported to use hospitals more than non-drinkers, but it is unclear whether light-to-moderate drinkers use hospitals more than non-drinkers.We examined the relationship between alcohol consumption in 10,883 men and 12,857 women aged 40-79 years in the general population and subsequent admissions to hospital and time spent in hospital.Participants from the EPIC-Norfolk prospective population-based study were followed for ten years (1999-2009) using record linkage.Compared to current non-drinkers, men who reported any alcohol drinking had a lower risk of spending more than twenty days in hospital multivariable adjusted OR 0.80 (95%CI 0.68-0.94) after adjusting for age, smoking status, education, social class, body mass index and prevalent diseases. Women who were current drinkers were less likely to have any hospital admissions multivariable adjusted OR 0.84 (95%CI 0.74-0.95), seven or more admissions OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.88) or more than twenty hospital days OR 0.70 (95%CI 0.62-0.80). However, compared to lifelong abstainers, men who were former drinkers had higher risk of any hospital admissions multivariable adjusted OR 2.22 (95%CI 1.51-3.28) and women former drinkers had higher risk of seven or more admissions OR 1.30 (95%CI 1.01-1.67).Current alcohol consumption was associated with lower risk of future hospital usage compared with non-drinkers in this middle aged and older population. In men, this association may in part be due to whether former drinkers are included in the non-drinker reference group but in women, the association was consistent irrespective of the choice of reference group. In addition, there were few participants in this cohort with very high current alcohol intake. The measurement of past drinking, the separation of non-drinkers into former drinkers and lifelong abstainers and the choice of reference group are all influential in interpreting the risk of alcohol consumption on future hospitalisation."
https://openalex.org/W2884192184,"Embodied cognition research suggests that bodily experiences might ground mental representations of emotional valence in the vertical dimension of space (i.e., positive is up and negative is down). Accordingly, recent studies show that upward and downward arm movements may also influence the evaluation of valence-laden stimuli, suggesting that upward (downwards) movements lead to more positive (negative) evaluations. Interestingly, these studies typically did not investigate paradigms that require a direct hand interaction with the stimuli. With the advent of touchscreen devices and their use for experimental environments, however, a direct and more natural hand interaction with the stimuli has come to the fore. In this regard, the goal of the present study is to examine how direct hand interaction with valence-laden stimuli on a touchscreen monitor affects their perceived valence. To do so, participants evaluated emotional pictures after touching and moving them either upwards or downwards across a vertically mounted touchscreen. In contrast to previous findings, the results suggest that positive pictures were evaluated as more positive after downward movements while negative pictures were evaluated as less negative following upward movements. This finding may indicate that a matching between the pictures' valence and the valence associated with their vertical touch location leads to more positive evaluations. Thus, the present study extends earlier results by an important point: Touching the emotional pictures during movement may influence their valence processing."
https://openalex.org/W2883797004,"Objective The attempt of a woman to deliver vaginally after having had a caesarean in a previous pregnancy is increasingly common in current obstetric practice. During a trial of labour after caesarean, gynaecologists consider whether continuing vaginal birth is safe or, alternately, whether a repeat caesarean is advised. There is large variation in the success rates of women with comparable medical risk factors, requiring better insight in how this assessment is made. As a window of opportunity to intervene in this unexplained variation in practice in specific, and in the globally rising caesarean rate in general, our aim was to increase understanding of gynaecologists’ decision-making during trial of labour. Study design We conducted a constructivist grounded theory study, interviewing Dutch gynaecologists. Data collection and analysis were performed concurrently. Initial convenience sampling shifted to theoretical sampling as the study progressed. Data collection continued until theoretical sufficiency was reached. We applied open and axial codes to transcripts of the interviews, and then assembled the axial codes into themes that built up to an emerging theoretical framework. Results Nine gynaecologists were interviewed. Data indicated they continuously weighed the chance of a successful outcome of trial of labour against the likelihood of adversities. Patients’ opinions, aspects of progress of labour and gynaecologists’ personal stances regarding trial of labour played a role in the decision-making process; these factors are influenced by organisational affordances and culture. Variation in the assessment of individuals’ chances of success and variable thresholds for a repeat caesarean added to the complexity of the decision-making. Conclusion This study pieced together patient-, delivery-, physician- and society-related factors that result in vitally important decisions during trial of labour after caesarean; it reveals the complexity as well as the repetitive patterns involved in this process. Exposing these factors offers opportunities to incorporate the decision-making process in targeted educational interventions, with the aim of modifying the underlying assumptions and concepts in order to reduce practice variation."
