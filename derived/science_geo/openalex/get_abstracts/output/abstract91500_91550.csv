https://openalex.org/W2064735501,"We have found that the myc oncogene has been modified by abortive recombination with the alpha heavy-chain immunoglobulin constant-region (C alpha) gene in five different mouse plasmacytoma lines. Recombination occurred approximately 0.8-2.0 kb to the 5' side of two distinct coding regions, defined by sequence homology between the chicken cellular and plasmacytoma myc genes. The myc and C alpha genes were always in opposite transcriptional orientation, with the recombination site within the C alpha switch region sequences. DNA recombination was found to correlate with the production of a novel 2.1 kb species of myc RNA that was 0.4 kb shorter than the normal cellular transcript. No elevated levels of myc RNA were evident, suggesting that DNA rearrangements have altered the myc oncogene product. This oncogene activation corresponds to the chromosomal translocations found in nearly all plasmacytomas."

https://openalex.org/W1548528866,"Gamma irradiation of DNA in aqueous solution produces single strand breaks with two types of 3'-termini. These termini have been identified as a simple phosphoryl group and a glycolate moiety attached to the 3'-phosphoryl group via the 2-OH of glycolic acid. Irradiation of 5'-end labeled poly(dG) produces compounds that comigrate with authentic 3',5'-dGDP and 2'-deoxyguanosine-3'-(phospho-2-O-glycolic acid-5'-monophosphate by thin layer chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Irradiation of poly(dGdC) followed by digestion to 3'-nucleotides produces 2'-deoxyguanosine-3'-(phospho-2-O-glycolic acid). The presence of glycolate termini at some strand breaks may affect intracellular repair of these lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1630076867,"When platelets are stimulated by thrombin, a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C produces a transient rise in 1,2-diacylglycerol. We have now characterized the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol by platelet membranes using doubly isotopically labeled substrates of defined fatty acid composition. We find that the fatty acid at sn-1 is hydrolyzed faster than that at sn-2 thereby producing a 2-monoacylglycerol intermediate. If hydrolysis had occurred at either position randomly, 1-monoacylglycerol would also be produced. That none was detected indicates that either the sn-1 fatty acid must be cleaved first or that 1-monoacylglycerol is hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipase much faster than 2-monoacylglyceol. The latter possibility was excluded by the finding that 1-monoacylglycerol and 2-monoacylglycerol are hydrolyzed at equal rates by platelet membranes. The diacylglycerol lipase cleaves diacylglycerols with sn-1 palmitate as rapidly as those with sn-1 stearate. Arachidonate at sn-2 is cleaved twice as fast as sn-2 oleate by monoacylglycerol lipase. The two activities probably represent discrete enzymes since monoacylglycerol lipase activity can be separated from diacylglycerol lipase by fractionation on DEAE-Sepharose, although both are contained in the membrane fraction of platelets. That the sequential breakdown of 1,2-diacylglycerol also occurs in intact platelets is indicated by our finding of a transient rise in arachidonoyl-monoacylglycerol in thrombin-stimulated platelets. This provides further evidence for a role of the phospholipase C-diacylglycerol lipase pathway in the release of arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2029406027,"In order to create an alternative to the customary letter-series representation of nucleotide sequences a novel method was developed based on computer graphics. In this new method, the information content of a nucleotide sequence is mapped into a three-dimensional space function (H curve) which can be displayed and manipulated conveniently. Even very long nucleotide sequences can be represented by compact H curves. Such curves are not only characteristic fingerprints of complex genetic messages but also embody important parameters concerning the distribution of nucleotides. H curves appear to be particularly suitable for the visual analysis and comprehension of both the local and the global features of long DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2036196095,"We have isolated four recessive male sterile mutations in the structural gene for the testis-specific Drosophila beta 2-tubulin. Each of these mutations encodes a variant beta 2-tubulin subunit synthesized at normal levels, but which is subsequently unstable and rapidly degraded within the testis. In such testes, the normal alpha tubulins are also synthesized at normal levels and then degraded. Thus in mutant males the testis tubulin pool is drastically reduced relative to wild-type. In males homozygous for any of the recessive beta 2-tubulin mutations, the early mitotic divisions, which are completed before the time of synthesis of beta 2-tubulin, are normal. Thereafter, however, all microtubule-mediated events subsequent to the expression of the altered subunit are defective: meiosis, nuclear shaping and assembly of the axoneme all fail to occur. We thus conclude that the beta 2-tubulin subunit that forms the Drosophila sperm axoneme is not functionally restricted but serves multiple functions in spermatogenesis, including the assembly of both singlet and doublet tubules."
https://openalex.org/W2010299494,"Most of a 9 kb region of the Drosophila genome containing genes for several cuticle proteins has been sequenced. Five cuticle-gene-like sequences have been identified and mapped. Amino acid sequences of four of the five major third instar cuticle proteins have been determined. These four sequences are identical with those predicted from the sequences of four of the five genes. Two cuticle genes are transcribed in one direction and two in the opposite direction. The fifth cuticle-like gene is judged to be a pseudogene because several features of its structure and the absence of detectable transcripts suggest it is nonfunctional. Sequence comparisons indicate that it arose by an unequal crossing-over event involving two closely related and adjacent cuticle genes. Each of the four cuticle genes contains a signal peptide coding sequence interrupted by a short intervening sequence (about 60 bp) at a conserved site. Conserved sequences occur in the 5' mRNA untranslated region, in the adjacent 35 bp of upstream flanking sequence and at -200 bp from the mRNA start position in each of the cuticle genes. We discuss the structure, organization and evolution of these cuticle genes as a model small gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1529279456,"Peptide analogs of angiotensin were phosphorylated in vitro by the src gene product, pp60src, of Rous sarcoma virus. The Km for the phosphorylation reaction varied from 1 to 5 mM and the Vmax varied from 2 to 10 nmol/min/mg. Tyrosine was the only residue phosphorylated in all analogs that were examined. The peptides were phosphorylated by tyrosyl protein kinases associated with several avian sarcoma viruses and by the epidermal growth factor-receptor kinase of A431 cells. Peptide substrate also was used to investigate the effectiveness of three different phosphatase inhibitors. Assay of tyrosyl kinase activities in whole cell lysates indicated that both p-nitrophenyl phosphate and sodium vanadate were potent inhibitors of phosphotyrosine phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1996777633,"The Drosophila melanogaster gene Sgs4 encodes one of the glue polypeptides, sgs-4, synthesized in the larval salivary gland. We have examined the structure and expression of Sgs4 in five strains that produce abundant amounts of sgs-4 and its mRNA and in four that do not. The nonproducers include three Japanese strains that accumulate trace amounts of mRNA and one strain, BER-1, that contains no detectable Sgs4 RNA. Sgs4 carries a tandem array of repeated 21 bp elements within its coding sequence. The number of elements per array varies, causing considerable differences in the lengths of Sgs4 and its mRNA among the strains. These differences in length are not correlated with differences in mRNA abundance; rather, the low or zero abundance in nonproducers correlates with the loss of DNA upstream from the gene. The Japanese nonproducers carry a 52 bp deletion 305 bp upstream from the 5′ end of Sgs4, and BER-1 carries a 95 bp deletion 392 bp upstream. Curiously, each deletion encompasses one or more of the salivary-gland-specific DNAase I-hypersensitive sites which are known to flank the Sgs4 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1517753813,"The purification of sterol carrier protein2 (SCP2), purified 1500-fold to homogeneity from the 303,000 x g supernatant (S303) of rat liver, has recently been described (Noland, B. J., Arebalo, R. E., Hansbury, E., and Scallen T. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem, 255, 4282-4289). Since SCP2 is required for the synthesis of cholesterol by microsomal membranes, it was decided to test the hypothesis that SCP2 might also participate in enzymatic reactions which utilize cholesterol as a substrate. The reaction studied in the present investigation was the conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol ester (acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase) by rat liver microsomes. The results show that when exogenously added [4-14C]cholesterol is the substrate, SCP2 produces a striking increase in cholesterol ester biosynthesis by rat liver microsomes. Although the effect of SCP2 was most clearly seen with exogenously added cholesterol, it was also demonstrated when [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA was the labeled substrate and the incorporation of labeled oleate into cholesterol ester was determined. Although it was demonstrated that microsomes could bind large amounts of cholesterol in the absence of SCP2, the bound cholesterol was ineffective as a substrate for microsomal acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase. However, the microsomally bound cholesterol became an effective substrate for the enzyme upon the addition of SCP2. The results demonstrate that SCP2 participates in the utilization of cholesterol via the microsomal conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol ester. We also conclude that SCP2 may participate in the intracellular transport of cholesterol, in particular, the delivery of either exogenous (dietary) cholesterol or endogenous cholesterol to acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1673910058,"Mechanisms responsible for diabetes-induced alterations in liver protein synthesis were investigated in vivo and in perfused liver using Bio-Breeding Worcester (BB/W) control rats, spontaneously diabetic BB/W rats maintained on insulin therapy, and diabetic BB/W rats withdrawn from insulin therapy for 48 h. Withdrawal of insulin therapy in the diabetic rats resulted in marked alterations in a number of parameters related to liver protein synthesis compared to BB/W control or insulin-maintained diabetic rats. Alterations seen in vivo following withdrawal of insulin included changes in the relative concentrations of several plasma proteins, a 40% reduction in total liver RNA relative to DNA, a 5-fold reduction in albumin synthesis relative to the synthesis of total liver proteins, a 5-fold reduction in albumin mRNA relative to total RNA, reductions in the relative abundance of mRNAs for at least four plasma proteins other than albumin, and a relative increase in mRNA for at least one plasma protein. Alterations observed in perfused liver included reductions in total liver protein synthesis (60% of control), albumin production (24% of control), and total secretory protein production (44% of control). All parameters studied were essentially unchanged from BB/W control values when the diabetic rats were maintained on insulin therapy. The results indicate that insulin deficiency leads to marked reductions in liver protein synthesis, particularly the synthesis of albumin and other plasma proteins. The mechanisms responsible for these alterations include changes in the relative abundance of specific mRNAs and a decrease in total cellular RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2121444888,"An antiserum directed specifically against ZP2, the major glycoprotein of the mouse egg's extracellular coat (zona pellucida), has been used to immunoprecipitate intracellular precursors of ZP2 that were synthesized by growing mouse oocytes cultured in vitro. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the immediate precursor of mature, 120 kilodalton (kd) ZP2 is a 91 kd species that unlike mature ZP2, is sensitive to digestion by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and is converted by the endoglycosidase into an 81 kd species. An 81 kd species is only found intracellularly when growing oocytes are cultured in the presence of tunicamycin. These results suggest that ZP2 is synthesized as an 81 kd polypeptide chain that is first ""core""-glycosylated at asparagine residues with high-mannose-type oligosaccharides, giving rise to a 91 kd intermediate (Endo-H-sensitive), and then processed to complex-type oligosaccharides prior to secretion as mature, 120 kd ZP2 (Endo H-insensitive). Furthermore, electrophoretic analyses of mature ZP2, ZP2 precursor (91 kd) and Endo H-treated ZP2 precursor (81 kd) suggest that there are six N-linked oligosaccharides per molecule and that the extreme heterogeneity of mature ZP2 is a consequence of the oligosaccharides and not the polypeptide chain itself."
https://openalex.org/W1981191264,"Growing lymphocytes perform a novel chemical modification of a single protein (Hy+: ∼18 kd, pI ∼5.1), resulting in the formation of the unusual amino acid, hypusine (Nϵ-[4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl]lysine). This posttranslational event occurs only following activation of lymphocyte growth. Hypusine formation increases at a rate parallel to protein synthesis during the first 24 hr of growth stimulation, beginning before 6 hr of growth. At all times, hypusine is restricted primarily to the single protein, Hy+. In resting cells, the unmodified substrate protein, Hyo, is continuously synthesized and maintained in a steady-state pool of significant size. In several other cell lines, hypusine formation was also observed in a single protein of ∼18 kd, pI ∼5.1, indistinguishable electrophoretically from the lymphocyte protein. Thus Hy+ is a ubiquitous protein showing significant conservation among divergent species. Maintenance by resting lymphocytes of a pool of unmodified protein and early activation during growth of the hypusine-forming enzyme system suggest that this posttranslational modification may be of importance to lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1667721025,"The steady state relationship between intra- and extramitochondrial free Ca2+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane has been investigated in isolated liver mitochondria. The extramitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration was essentially independent of the mitochondrial calcium content above 4 nmol/mg of protein. Below this value, a decrease in the mitochondrial calcium content was accompanied by a decrease in the extramitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration. The experimental data are compatible with a model in which the steady state distribution of calcium is described in terms of the kinetic parameters of the separate carriers catalyzing Ca2+ influx and efflux across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The corresponding relationship between cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and the amounts of calcium in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum was investigated in isolated river cells over a range of cellular Ca2+ contents by using a nondisruptive technique based on the selective release of calcium from mitochondrial and total cellular pools by addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and A23187, respectively. A net increase in cell calcium from 1 to 5 nmol/mg dry weight, increased the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration from 0.1 to about 0.3 microM and increased the calcium contents of both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Above 5 nmol of calcium/mg cell dry weight, the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pool became filled, and further increases in calcium content were accounted for by increases of the mitochondrial pool but no further increase of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. These studies and experiments with mixtures of isolated microsomes and mitochondria suggest that, in cells as normally isolated (containing 5 to 6 nmol of calcium/mg dry weight), the endoplasmic reticulum is saturated with calcium and is unlikely to play a major role as an intracellular calcium buffer. The in situ mitochondrial calcium content is sufficiently high (approximately 16 nmol/mg of protein) for these organelles to buffer effectively the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration at a value of about 0.3 microM. In addition, it may be concluded that intramitochondrial Ca2+-dependent enzymes will be exposed to saturating concentrations of free Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1581933912,"L-Cysteinesulfinate, a quantitatively important catabolite of L-cysteine, is a substrate of both cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase. The former enzyme initiates a pathway leading to taurine; the latter enzyme forms beta-sulfinyl-pyruvate, which spontaneously decomposes to pyruvate and SO2. In the present studies, the in vivo partitioning of cysteinesulfinate between these two pathways was evaluated by administering to mice L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfinate, which is metabolized to 14CO2 by both pathways, or L-[3-14C]cysteinesulfinate, which is converted to 14CO2 only if taurine is not formed. Within 6 h, respiratory 14CO2 accounted for 90% of the [1-14C]cysteinesulfinate injected, whereas only 18% of administered [3-14C]cysteinesulfinate was recovered as 14CO2. When the data are corrected for differences in the formation of 14CO2 from [1-14C]- and [3-14C]pyruvate and for a small formation of 14CO2 from radiolabeled hypotaurine, it is concluded that approximately 85% of administered cysteinesulfinate is decarboxylated to hypotaurine, whereas approximately 15% is transaminated. Of the hypotaurine formed, approximately 90% is oxidized to taurine. beta-Methylene-DL-aspartate, an irreversible inhibitor of glutamate-oxal-oacetate transaminase (Cooper, A.J.L., Fitzpatrick, S. M., Kaufman, C., and Dowd, P. (1982) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104, 332-334) was given to mice with the expectation that conversion of cysteinesulfinate to hypotaurine would be increased. Surprisingly, the extent of cysteinesulfinate transamination increased about 3-fold. Additional studies indicate that beta-methyleneaspartate is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of purified rat liver cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase and that inactivation of the decarboxylase predominates over inactivation of the transaminase in vivo. Highly purified cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase is also shown to decarboxylate L-aspartate to beta-alanine and, very slowly, glutamate to gamma-aminobutyrate. The enzyme is not active toward alpha-methylcysteinesulfinate or alpha-methylaspartate; alpha-methyl-DL-[1-14C]cysteinesulfinate is not metabolized by the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1487291733,"The level of carboxyl methylation of membrane proteins has been measured in intact human erythrocyte populations of different ages separated by density gradient centrifugation. Age separation was confirmed by measurement of cytosolic pyruvate kinase specific activity in each fraction. When cells of different ages were incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine, the steady state level of 3H radioactivity covalently bound to membrane proteins is observed to be at least 3-fold higher in older erythrocytes. Because the specific radioactivity of the methyl group donor S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine was identical in all age fractions, this represents an increase in the extent of modification of membrane proteins by carboxyl methylation. Of the three major methylated erythrocyte membrane proteins, this increase in carboxyl methylation with age is 4 to 7-fold for bands 2.1 and 3, while the increase in band 4.1 is 3 to 4-fold. This increase in the steady state level of methylation with age cannot be explained by changes in either the intrinsic rate of methyl transfer or by changes in the rate constant of methyl turnover. We, therefore, propose that the age-dependent change in carboxyl methylation is due to an increase in the number of available acceptor sites as the erythrocyte ages in vivo. Since methylation of acidic residues on erythrocyte membrane proteins has been detected exclusively on D-aspartic acid residues (McFadden, P. N., and Clarke, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2460-2464), these results are consistent with an accumulation of D-aspartic acid in membrane protein due to spontaneous racemization a the cell ages. The relationship of these observations to possible functions of erythrocyte membrane protein carboxyl methylation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575185153,"A procedure was developed to vary the cholesterol-to-phospholipid (Ch/PL) ratio of synaptic plasma membranes and synaptosomes using a nonspecific lipid transfer protein so that membrane lipid composition could be correlated with presynaptic function. In synaptic plasma membranes, Ch/PL molar ratios from 0.21 to 1.19 were produced from a normal value of 0.52 +/- 0.01 by incubation with the transfer protein and an excess of either phosphatidylcholine or cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine liposomes for 60 min at 32 degrees C. In synaptosomes, Ch/PL ratios from 0.16 to 0.81 were similarly produced from a normal value of 0.38 +/- 0.04. Cholesterol loading or depletion of the membranes was accompanied by a decrease or increase, respectively in the phospholipid-to-protein ratio. The fluidity of the synaptic plasma membrane, as estimated by 1,6-diphenylhexatriene anisotropy measurements, was increased by lowering the Ch/PL ratio and decreased by raising the Ch/PL ratio. Decreasing the Ch/PL ratio of synaptosomes and synaptic plasma membrane vesicles resulted in loss of sodium-dependent gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake (70-100% loss at Ch/PL ratios decreased to 40% of normal) and reduction in the number of accessible GABA-binding sites. Choline uptake was not affected in these same preparations. GABA uptake was restored by reinserting cholesterol into the membrane. Synaptosomal membrane potential and synaptic plasma membrane sodium permeability were not affected by changing the Ch/PL ratio. Increase in the Ch/PL ratio above normal had no effect on either choline or GABA uptake. Both the decrease in the Ch/PL ratio and the increase in the lipid-to-protein ratio increase membrane fluidity, lipid-to-protein ratio increase membrane fluidity, which may modulate the vertical displacement and motional characteristics of the GABA transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1530787719,"We describe a technique for examining the ability of one important class of cell surface complex carbohydrates, glycosphingolipids, to mediate carbohydrate-specific cell recognition and adhesion. Analogs of natural glycosphingolipids were synthesized, consisting of 1-glycosyl derivatives of 3-deoxyceramide (N-palmitoyl-2-aminostearol) radiolabeled in the fatty acid portion. Methods were developed to efficiently adsorb both these synthetic glycolipids and natural glycosphingolipids (including gangliosides) from aqueous ethanol solution onto plastic wells. The glycolipids remained firmly attached to the surface in aqueous solutions, but could be recovered using detergents or organic solvents. The ability of the adsorbed glycolipids to elicit specific adhesion of intact hepatocytes was tested using specific adhesion of intact hepatocytes was tested using a cell adhesion assay based on that of McClay, D. R., Wessel, G. M., and Marchase, R. B. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4975-4979. When otherwise nonadhesive plastic surfaces were adsorbed with N-acetylglucosaminyl 3-deoxyceramide, they supported adhesion of 80-95% of the chicken hepatocytes added to the well. No adhesion above background levels (10-25%) was observed to surfaces adsorbed with other synthetic glycolipids including glucosyl, galactosyl, mannosyl, or lactosyl 3-deoxyceramide, 3-deoxyceramide, or to the naturally occurring glycosphingolipids, lactosyl ceramide or ganglioside GM1. Chicken hepatocyte adhesion to surfaces adsorbed with N-acetylglucosaminyl 3-deoxyceramide was inhibited by soluble N-acetylglucosamine (IC50 = 3 m M), but not by other soluble sugars. Rat hepatocytes adhered preferentially to surfaces adsorbed with lactosyl 3-deoxyceramide, but not to surfaces adsorbed with the N-acetylglucosaminyl derivative. These studies demonstrate the ability of adsorbed glucolipids to mediate carbohydrate- and cell-specific adhesion from intact cells. Using these techniques, the ability of naturally occurring complex glycosphingolipids to elicit specific cellular responses from a variety of cell types can be examined."
https://openalex.org/W1575998074,"D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is a lipid-requiring enzyme which is localized on the inner face of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The apoenzyme has been purified to homogeneity from beef heart; it is devoid of lipid and inactive. It can be functionally reconstituted with lecithin or phospholipid mixtures containing lecithin. The active form of the enzyme is the enzyme-phospholipid complex. Classical target analysis of radiation-inactivation data has now been used to determine the molecular size of the enzyme both in the native membrane (submitochondrial vesicles) and in the reconstituted enzyme inserted into phospholipid vesicles containing lecithin. For both forms of the enzyme, we find the same molecular size, approximately 110,00 daltons. This size is consistent with a tetramer. Radiation results in fragmentation of the polypeptide and the destruction of the polypeptide correlates with loss of enzymic function. A similar size is obtained when purified D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is inserted into a nonactivating mixture of phospholipid (i.e. in the absence of lecithin). We conclude that: 1) the native enzyme in submitochondrial vesicles and the purified active enzyme in phospholipid vesicles are the same size, approximating a tetramer; 2) radiation of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase results in loss of activity and fragmentation of the polypeptide; and 3) the role of lecithin in activation of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is unrelated to determining oligomeric size of the enzymes since both active and nonactive forms exhibit the same structural size."
https://openalex.org/W1538228837,"We previously reported the initial characterization of a polymorphic major cell surface glycoprotein of about 80,000 daltons from mouse embryo 3T3 cells. This glycoprotein has now been purified 1800-fold to apparent homogeneity by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The purified molecule retained the total antigenic activity of the cell, as determined by antibody binding assays. The quantity of the glycoprotein, 0.06% of the total protein of the crude cell extract, confirmed its presence as a major constituent of the cell plasma membrane. The monoclonal antibody was also used to detect related antigens in cells and tissues of C57BL/6J mice. The antigen was present in high concentration in macrophages and subpopulations of bone marrow and blood polymorphonuclear cells. Much lower concentrations of antigen were detected in spleen cells, thymocytes, and extracts of solid tissues. The apparent Mr of the target antigen of myeloid cells was 92,000. This molecule was a major surface constituent of myeloid cells with 10(6) antibody binding sites per cell containing 10% of total 125I incorporated by the lactoperoxidase procedure. The macrophage glycoprotein labeled on the cell surface with 125I was highly sensitive to trypsin, yielding an antigenically active soluble glycopolypeptide of about 65,000 daltons, that contained all of the incorporated 125I. A similar 65,000-dalton glycopeptide was released from 3T3 cells by trypsin cleavage. These data indicate that a major cell surface constituent of mouse myeloid cells is a 92,000-dalton glycoprotein closely related to the 80,000-dalton glycoprotein of mouse embryo 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1552024924,"The kinetic properties of pyridoxamine (pyridoxine)-5'-phosphate oxidase have been studied using the physiological substrates pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) at 25 degrees C and pH 8.0. Under steady-state conditions with different concentrations of PNP and O2, a series of parallel lines and competitive substrate inhibition with a KI of 50 microM are seen in double reciprocal plots. This is suggestive of a binary complex mechanism. Secondary plots yield a turnover number of 42 min-1 and Km values for both PNP (8.2 microM) and O2 (182 microM). A large deuterium isotope effect, VH/VD of 6.5, was observed with [4',4'-2H]PNP. In analogous studies using PMP, a turnover number of 6.2 min-1 and respective Km values for PMP and O2 of 3.6 and 85 microM were calculated. No significant substrate inhibition and a small deuterium isotope effect (VH/VD = 1.1) were observed with PMP. Anaerobic stopped flow data showed that the enzyme-bound flavin was reduced at a rate similar to catalytic turnover with PNP as a substrate, whereas with PMP, the rate of enzyme reduction is 500-fold faster than turnover. Stopped flow kinetic data also showed the reduced enzyme to react with O2 at rates at least 10(2)-10(3) faster than turnover. These results indicate that enzyme reduction is rate-limiting when the alcohol form (PNP) is the substrate, but in the case of the amine (PMP), the rate-limiting step in catalysis occurs subsequent to reduction. With PMP as substrate, release of product from the complex with reduced enzyme is 15-fold slower than turnover, and thus, it is suggested that oxygen reacts with the complex. The pH dependence of the deuterium isotope effect and the Km for PMP showed substantial change in the pH range between 6.0 and 7.5, whereas little or no pH dependence was observed for PNP. These data show that the kinetic mechanism of pyridoxamine (pyridoxine)-5'-phosphate oxidase can function via either a binary or ternary complex mechanism, depending upon the nature of the substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1552689720,"An immunoprecipitation technique has been used to determine the subunit specificity of two of the monoclonal antibodies to bovine Factor V(Va) developed by this laboratory. One of the antibodies is specific for the 74,000-dalton subunit (the E chain) of Factor Va, and the other antibody is specific for the 94,000-dalton subunit (the D chain). The binding of Factor Va to phospholipid was studied by light scattering, and the interaction of Factor Xa with phospholipid-bound Factor Va was examined using 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-Xa (Dns-EGR-Xa). Neither the antibody specific for the E chain nor the antibody specific for the D chain inhibit the binding of Factor Va to phospholipid vesicles. The antibody specific for the E chain blocks the increase in fluorescence polarization seen when Factor Va is added to a solution of Dns-EGR-Xa, phospholipid vesicles and calcium. This antibody also inhibits the association of Dns-EGR-Xa with phospholipid-bound Factor Va as determined by gel-exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography. The antibody specific for the D chain of Factor Va does not block the increase in polarization seen when Factor Va is added to a solution of Dns-EGR-Xa, phospholipid, and calcium. It was concluded that the antibody specific for the E chain of Factor Va binds at or near the Factor Xa-binding site on the E chain and that the Factor Va E chain plays a significant role in binding Factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W1523456195,"Based on boronic acid chromatography, a rapid method was developed for the purification of polyadenosine diphosphoribose oligomers of various chain lengths. Polyadenosine diphosphoribose oligomers obtained by the new method were distinguished on the basis of spectral criteria. The purity of polyadenosine diphosphoribose was determined by high performance liquid chromatography, which is a highly sensitive method for the detection of contamination by nucleotides derived from other nucleic acids. The A280/A260 ratio, which has been used in the past as one of the criteria of purity of oligomers, was found to be an unsuitable index of purity because it significantly varied as a function of temperature or ionic strength, exhibiting characteristics of temperature- and ionic strength-dependent hypochromicity. Hypochromicity was highly significant at 260 nm but not at 280 nm. The A280/A260 ratio showed a correlation with the oligomer chain length, significantly diminishing below a chain length of 9 adenosine diphosphoribose units, with concomitant loss of hypochromicity. The increase in A280/A260 ratio above a chain length of nine was small and gradual. Circular dichroism of long, medium, and short oligomers was determined at varying temperatures (5-72 degrees C). For long chains, a temperature-dependent change of the major negative theta value and a red shift occurred from 249.5 to 267.5 nm. With medium chain length oligomers, there was no decrease in the theta value at 249.5 nm, only a red shift. In the case of short chain oligomers the major negative theta value was at 267.5 nm and its position was temperature-independent with only a small temperature-related decrease in size. At 72 degrees C, the different patterns of circular dichroism of the three groups of oligomers of differing chain lengths became indistinguishable. These results were interpreted to indicate a significant secondary structure of polyadenosine diphosphoribose of long chain length."
https://openalex.org/W2047765920,"Antibodies are composed of two identical heavyand light-chain polypeptides. Each heavy and light chain contains an amino-terminal variable (V) region, responsible for antigen recognition, and a carboxy-proximal constant(C) region, which participates in a variety of immunological processes, including effector-cell recognition and complement fixation. The variable regions are encoded by several hundred germ-line genes, while a limited member of genes encode the constant regions. The mouse CH gene locus resides on the distal arm of chromosome 12 and consists of eight genes (p, 6, 73, yl , y2b, y2a, E and a) that span close to 200 kb of DNA (see figure) (Shimizu et al., Cell 28, 499-506, 1982). The mouse CH gene cluster contains no well conserved pseudo-& genes. &-coding regions are composed of either two (6) three (~3, yl , y2b, (II) or four (cl and E) structural domains, each consisting of -100 amino acids that are separated by small introns. Antibodies of immature B lymphocytes possess hydrophobic carboxy-terminal CH extensions, allowing these molecules to function as transmembrane proteins. Hydrophobic membrane domains are separated from the secreted termini of CH genes by a -2 kb intron (Early et al., Cell 20, 313-319, 1980). Membrane-bound or secreted antibody is thought to be expressed first by regulation of the site of transcriptional termination or poly(A) addition and then by sitespecific RNA splicing (Early et al., op. cit.; Rogers et al., Cell 26, 19-27, 1981). The human CH gene family consists of at least nine functional members (p, 6, yl , 72, y3,y4, c, al and a2). As in the mouse, the human CS gene is located several kilobases 3’ of C,” (Rabbitts et al., NAR 9,4509-4524, 1981). The four human gamma genes display more extensive homology to each other than is observed among the mouse gamma genes, and at least two Minireviews"
https://openalex.org/W1615644104,"The chemical structure of an equine hematoside, which contained an ester group and comprised 72% of the total erythrocyte gangliosides, was determined by means of nondestructive and destructive procedures. A 400-MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the ganglioside in perdeuterodimethyl sulfoxide demonstrated three protons due to a methyl group of an acetyl moiety, as well as amide and anomeric protons which were compatible with those of the ordinary hematoside. The spin decoupling difference spectroscopy of the ganglioside revealed the presence of the following structures. [formula: see text]. A mass spectrum obtained by direct probe analysis of the permethylated ganglioside demonstrated the presence of an O-acetyl-N-glycolylneuraminic acid moiety (m/z 434). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of the sialic acid, derivatives from the periodate-oxidized ganglioside, and derivatives from acetalized ganglioside prepared under controlled conditions indicated that the sialic acid of the ganglioside was 4-O-acetyl-N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Thus, the structure of the equine ganglioside was determined as 4-O-acetyl-N-glycolylneuraminyl alpha 2-3 galactosyl beta 1-4 glucosyl beta 1-ceramide. The antigenic properties of this ganglioside were examined. In contrast to ordinary hematoside, which reacted strongly with Hanganutziu-Deicher (H-D) antibodies of a heterophile type in human, this ganglioside did not exhibit any H-D antigenicity. Therefore, a free hydroxy group at C-4 of the N-glycolylneuraminyl moiety in gangliosides appears to be absolutely required for the manifestation of H-D antigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1493306598,"The kinetics of the heparin-dependent antithrombin/protease reaction were consistent with an ordered sequential two-substrate reaction model under all circumstances tested. In this model, heparin is the catalyst; while antithrombin is the first substrate and the protease is the second substrate. The first step in this reaction, the heparin-antithrombin interaction, has a KD of 25 nM but a diffusionally determined Km of about 150 nM regardless of protease substrate. The second step of the reaction, protease interaction with the heparin-antithrombin complex, was fast with a rate constant of 6.8 X 10(6) M-1.s-1 for Factor Xa and greater than 8 X 10(7) M-1.ls-1 for thrombin. Differences between thrombin and Factor Xa at low (nanomolar) concentrations of heparin were evident in this rate constant and the relative affinities for the heparin-antithrombin complex (Km for Factor Xa = 100 nM; Km for thrombin less than or equal to 2 nM). In agreement with this difference in Km, regardless of protease substrate, active site-blocked thrombin was a potent inhibitor of the antithrombin reaction; while active site-blocked Factor Xa was an ineffective inhibitor. At high heparin concentrations (micromolar), the kinetic parameters for Factor Xa were unchanged but the Km for thrombin increased dramatically to 100 nM. Other kinetic parameters were also estimated. Overall, the two-substrate reaction model provides a versatile approach for studying heparin function."

https://openalex.org/W1536856196,"The lower limit for the first order rate constant for dissociation of GDP from the tubulin E-site has been determined to be 0.14 s-1; this corresponds to a reaction with a half-life of 5 s. Using this rate constant and the previously determined equilibrium constant for GDP dissociation, equal to 6.1 X 10(-8) M (Zeeberg, B., and Caplow, M. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 3880-3886), the calculated association rate constant is 2.2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. The tubulin E-site is highly reactive and it is calculated that: the half-life is 5 s for quantitative displacement of E-site bound radioactive GDP, by added excess nonradioactive GDP; the half-life is about 260 ms for isotopic equilibration when a trace amount of radioactive GDP is added to 20 microM tubulin-GDP; the half-life is about 850 ms for re-establishing the equilibrium for GDP binding, when 20 microM tubulin is diluted 20-fold. Thus, tubulin-GDP nucleotide exchange is rapid, so that added radioactive guanine nucleotides can be used in studies of relatively rapid reactions involving the tubulin subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1543822102,"Mouse myeloma immunoglobulin IgM heavy chains were cleaved with cyanogen bromide into nine peptide fragments, four of which contain asparagine-linked sites of glycosylation. Three of these glycopeptides contain a single site located at asparagines 171, 403, and 563 in the sequence of the intact heavy chain. Another glycopeptide contains two sites of glycosylation at asparagines 332 and 364. All sites contain multiple oligosaccharide structures with a trend towards increased processing from the COOH to the NH2 terminus. Structures present at asparagine 563, located only exclusively high mannose oligosaccharides. Asparagine 403, located penultimate to the COOH terminus, has a major component that is of a complex nature but is incompletely processed. Other sites contain predominantly complex structures consisting of biantennary or triantennary branches. The unusual structure found at asparagine 403 contains fucose even though only one branch has been processed to a terminal galactose. These studies suggest that each site has a unique set of heterogeneous oligosaccharides derived from a complex processing system which utilizes a combination of position completeness and polypeptide structure to determine final carbohydrate structure."
https://openalex.org/W1594323616,"Neutral soluble collagen was extracted from lathyritic rat skin under proteolysis-inhibited conditions. Purified solutions were characterized by electric birefringence and heterodyne beat quasi-elastic light-scattering techniques under conditions where the monomeric form was stable (at 4 degrees C in 0.032 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.04). Solutions were then heated and the birefringence and light scattering followed during the fibrillogenesis reaction. The monomer presents a translational diffusion coefficient of 0.85 X 10(-7) cm2/s and a rotary diffusion coefficient of 1150 +/- 50 s-1; these values are consistent with a rodlike molecular model of 220 +/- 10 nm length and 4 +/- 1 nm diameter, substantially different from electron microscopic values of 290 and 1.5 nm, respectively. We propose that at pH 7.04 and relatively high ionic strength, the collagen monomer unit must exhibit substantial deviation from a completely rigid and extended rodlike structure. During the entire lag phase in a thermally induced fibrillogenesis reaction, the relaxation times for both translational and rotational motion remain virtually unchanged. The monomer polarity is also unchanged, as shown by reverse pulse birefringence data. No intermediate size soluble aggregates, such as dimers or trimers, have been detected between monomer and very large aggregates or fibrils during the process, although early multistep assembly products (dimers, trimers) could have been seen if present. These data suggest a model for fibrillogenesis emphasizing a monomer-related nucleation event, such as internal stiffening or conformational transition, followed by a rapid continuous growth up to large fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1520349278,"Poly(A)-containing mRNA has been prepared from the polyribosomes and post-polyribosomal mRNP fraction of duck reticulocytes. The coding capacity of the respective mRNA populations has been examined by translation in vitro followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the 35S-labeled polypeptides. A detailed analysis of these results is given elsewhere (Imaizumi-Scherrer, M.-T., Maundrell, K., Civelli, O., and Scherrer, K. (1982) Dev. Biol. 93, 126-138). Here, we focus on one of these translation products which migrates as a slightly basic protein of 73,000 molecular weight. By two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis and partial peptide mapping, we show that this protein is indistinguishable from the poly(A)-binding protein. We conclude that the majority of the coding sequences for this protein are translationally repressed in the reticulocyte cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1524917006,"Dentin and predentin matrices contain Type I collagen and phosphophoryns as major constituents. A collagen-phosphophoryn conjugate is also present in small amounts. This conjugate has been implicated in the deposition of mineral. Its formation has been followed in rat incisors. Rats were labeled for varied time intervals with [3H]proline, followed by a 2-h pulse of [3H] serine. The soluble alpha- and beta-phosphophoryns were extracted under conditions minimizing degradation. The tooth residue was CNBr-treated and the collagen CNBr peptides alpha 1(I)CB7 and alpha 1(I)CB8 were collected along with the solubilized conjugate fraction. Each component was purified and the specific activities in [3H] proline, [3H]hydroxyproline, [3H]serine, and [3H]phosphoserine were determined. The collagen and alpha-phosphophoryn accumulated proline label linearly at the same rate over the entire period of labeling. Entry of [3H]proline into the conjugate fraction was delayed by approximately 9-10 h and then the label accumulated also linearly at the same rate. [3H]Serine was present at a different but constant level in each fraction; the conjugate had the lowest activity. These data indicate an extracellular formation of the conjugate at the mineralization front from precursors which followed different secretory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1518913367,"Choleragen and beta-adrenergic agonists, both of which activate turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase, have been reported to accelerate release of bound [3H]guanyl nucleotides from turkey erythrocyte membranes. We have now obtained evidence that choleragen- or isoproterenol-stimulated release reflects a change in the affinity of the regulatory subunit (G/F) of adenylate cyclase for guanyl nucleotides. Solubilized preparations of turkey erythrocytes that had bound radiolabeled GTP were chromatographed on Ultrogel AcA 34. The protein from which guanyl nucleotide was released upon incubation with choleragen or isoproterenol was co-eluted with G/F activity. Furthermore, this protein appears to be the same size as the complex containing the 42,000-dalton peptide, ADP*-ribosylated by choleragen, which is presumably a subunit of G/F. ADP ribosylation of the 42,000-dalton subunit of G/F by choleragen occurred with a half-time of about 5 min, whereas choleragen-stimulated release of guanyl nucleotides was much slower (t1/2 greater than or equal to 60 min). When membranes were treated with choleragen and NAD, the delay in activation of adenylate cyclase by guanylyl imidodiphosphate was decreased but not abolished, a finding consistent with the idea that release of endogenously bound nucleotide (and subsequent binding of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) occurs only slowly following ADP ribosylation. In contrast, activation of the adenylate cyclase of either toxin-treated or untreated membranes in the presence of isoproterenol and guanylyl imidodiphosphate was very rapid. These data support the hypothesis that isoproterenol and choleragen may activate adenylate cyclase, at least in part, by increasing the rate of release of guanyl nucleotides from G/F."
https://openalex.org/W2043941389,Cultures of porcine heart valves and aorta secrete a factor that stimulates the degradation of cartilage matrix in a fashion similar to that displayed by synovial catabolin. The heart valve factor also induces the release of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyproline from isolated heart valve cultures. The present observations support the hypothesis that tissues producing catabolic factors (catabolins) may well be responsive to them and that these messengers may play a role in the cellular regulation of the degradation of intercellular macromolecules.

https://openalex.org/W1637203278,"A gelatin-binding protein was isolated from porcine blood plasma by affinity chromatography in sequence on columns of Sepharose 4B coupled with gelatin, arginine, and heparin and by gel filtration through Sephadex G-200. The protein was bound strongly to the arginine column and thus could be separated from fibronectin. It reacted with concanavalin A and contained about 5% carbohydrate consisting of neutral sugars (2.6% by weight), hexosamine (1.5%), and sialic acid (0.55%). The glycoprotein also showed an interaction with hyaluronic acid, but not with unsubstituted Sepharose 4B. It consisted of 8 to 10 disulfide-linked subunits of about 47,000 daltons and contained more glycine and less proline than fibronectin. Thus we tentatively named this glycoprotein glycine-rich gelatin-binding protein (GGP). GGP did not react with antifibronectin antiserum. These results indicate that GGP is a glycoprotein which is distinct from fibronectin. However, there remains a possibility that GGP may be derived in vivo from fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2104591352,"Binding of adenosine to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1.) and partial conversion of bound adenosine to a substance liberating adenine has been demonstrated under conditions of enzymatic synthesis and hydrolysis of ADoHcy (Ueland, P. M., and Helland, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7722-7727). Gel filtration of cytosol from isolated rat hepatocytes treated with [14C]adenosine on a high performance liquid chromatography protein column showed that labeled adenine/adenosine eluted as a peak which co-chromatographed exactly with AdoHcy hydrolase. Formation of this peak was inhibited by exposure of the cells to compounds (ara-A, 3-deazaadenosine, and homocysteine) interacting with the catalytic site of the enzyme. Furthermore, the adenine/adenosine-protein complex and AdoHcy hydrolase focused at exactly the same pH (pI = 5.76) in a granulated bed. On this basis it was concluded that labeled adenosine formed a stable complex with AdoHcy hydrolase. A substantial portion (about 50%) of endogenous adenosine in rat hepatocytes seemed to be associated with AdoHcy hydrolase, and this portion equaled the amount of cellular adenosine which was not readily mobilized by high level of extracellular adenosine deaminase. Exposure of the hepatocytes to compounds which block the formation of the adenosine-AdoHcy hydrolase complex (ara-A, 3-deazaadenosine, and homocysteine) for 1 to 2.5 h only slightly reduced the amount of adenosine associated with the enzyme, indicating a slow turnover of the complex under the conditions of the experiment. It was concluded that adenosine is sequestered in rat hepatocytes through the interaction with AdoHcy hydrolase. The physiological implication of this process may be related to the metabolism and biological effects of adenosine as well as the regulation of AdoHcy hydrolase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1572445772,"The two steroidal 17 beta-oxiranes, spiro-17 beta-oxiranyl-delta 4-androsten-3-one (4 beta) and spiro-17 beta-oxiranylestra-1,3,5(10),6,8-pentaene-3-ol (5 beta) are active site-directed irreversible inhibitors of bacterial delta 5-3-ketosteroid isomerase. For each inhibitor, a stoichiometry of one molecule of steroid to one enzyme subunit was found. The inhibited enzyme was denatured and subjected to digestion by trypsin. The tryptic maps show two distinct steroid-bound peptides for both 4 beta- and 5 beta-inhibited isomerase. In each case, the two modified peptides are derived from residues 14 to 45 of the isomerase. Each of the steroid-bound peptides of the 4 beta-inhibited enzyme was subjected to further proteolytic digestion and the site of steroid attachment was found to be Asp-38 in each of the inactivation products. These results are interpreted to indicate that backwards is an important feature of the binding of steroids to delta 5-3-ketosteroid isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1617018491,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase functions within human erythrocytes at a rate far less than expected from kinetic properties of the purified enzyme and from estimated concentrations of enzyme, substrates, and products. Several investigators have proposed that activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is less than maximal because the enzyme is regulated by equilibration between an active dimeric form of the enzyme and an inactive monomer. The phenomenon of Lyonization provided an opportunity for this proposal to be tested. Erythrocytes of a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase A/B heterozygous woman were gently lysed and resealed so that each erythrocyte contained the two homodimers AA and BB. Subsequent lysis and electrophoresis revealed no heterodimer. This finding indicates that intracellular factors other than reversible dissociation account for the restraint of human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1532151893,"The effects of N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-valerate on the uptake of [3H]thymidine and its incorporation into DNA of human P3HR-1 lymphoma cells were studied. In the absence of the drug, at 0 degrees C, [3H]thymidine was transported into the cells but not incorporated into DNA, as determined by both the trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -precipitable counts obtained with the cells. At 37 degrees C, [3H]thymidine was readily transported into the cells and incorporated into DNA. In the presence of the drug, both [3H]thymidine uptake (as shown by acid-soluble counts) and the amount of its incorporation into acid-precipitable materials were markedly reduced. However, the uptake of [3H]thymidine at 0 degrees C was found to be equally sensitive to drug inhibition as at 37 degrees C. The incorporation at 37 degrees C of [3H]thymidine into acid-precipitable materials of the cells, which had been prelabeled at 0 degrees C with [3H]thymidine, was found to be insensitive to inhibition by the drug. The in vitro activities of DNA polymerases alpha and beta purified from human P3HR-1 cells were also found not to be susceptible to inhibition. Nuclei purified from cells pretreated with the drug continued to synthesize DNA. The cytofluorograms of the cells treated with the drug indicated that the treated cells accumulated at the G2/M phase, whereas the S phase of the cells was not arrested. These results suggest that N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-valerate inhibits [3H]thymidine uptake but not cellular DNA synthesis in human P3HR-1 lymphoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W1479757344,"1H NMR spectroscopy at 200 MHz was used to study triglyceride crystalline leads to liquid transitions which occurred on heating between 10 and 50 degrees C in very low density lipoprotein and subfractionated chylomicron particles from nonhuman primates fed a saturated fat (butter fat) diet. Model system studies of pure triglycerides (triolein, tripalmitin and a 1:1 mixture) and emulsion particles consisting of these triglycerides with a surface of egg phosphatidylcholine showed that high resolution spectra were obtained only from liquid triglycerides. In lipoprotein spectra, changes in 1H NMR peak intensities and line widths accompanied the solid leads to liquid transition of the constituent triglycerides. Peak areas of fatty acyl resonances were proportional to the percentage of melted triglyceride determined by differential scanning calorimetry. NMR peak area measurements showed that the calorimetric transition involved the melting of relatively greater numbers of saturated fatty acyl chains than unsaturated chains; at temperatures well below the solid leads to liquid transition, the lipoproteins contained a significant fraction (approximately 33%) of liquid triglycerides which were relatively enriched in unsaturated fatty acyl chains. For model systems containing mixtures of solid and liquid triglycerides, the temperature dependence of line widths of fatty acyl resonances demonstrated that solid triglycerides decreased the mobility of the liquid triglycerides. A similar temperature dependence for the lipoprotein resonances suggested that solid and liquid species are co-mixed in individual lipoprotein particles within a purified subfraction. Temperature-dependent line width and intensity changes were observed for the phospholipid-choline methyl resonance in lipoprotein spectra and were apparently independent of the core transition."
https://openalex.org/W1547851876,"Abstract Attempts were made to isolate a 74,000-dalton protein which specifically and competitively blocked platelet aggregation by thrombin (Ganguly, P., and Fossett, N. G. (1981) Blood 57, 343-352) by two independent affinity chromatography methods. The protein isolates showed a main band migrating slightly faster than albumin in gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, electrophoresis of protein preparations consistently revealed the presence of four polypeptides of 74,000, 55,000, 27,000, and 20,000 daltons. The results suggest that these polypeptides are probably present as a multiprotein complex in platelets. The 55,000-dalton protein, like the 74,000-dalton protein, inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, while aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate or trypsin was not significantly affected. However, incubation of the 55,000-dalton protein with the 74,000-dalton protein prior to the addition of thrombin did not inhibit platelet aggregation by thrombin, while the individual components under the same conditions did. In fact, the two proteins in combination could significantly enhance platelet aggregation by thrombin. These results suggest the existence of a multiprotein complex in human platelets, the components of which may modulate the action of thrombin on platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1525153459,"The effect of mitomycin C on the synthesis of recA protein in Escherichia coli has been analyzed in a variety of conditions, using an immunoradiometric assay (Paoletti, C., Salles, B., and Giacomoni, P. U. (1982) Biochimie 64, 239-246). In exponentially growing cultures of E. coli AB 1157, the addition of mitomycin C (5 micrograms/ml) promotes a 15-fold increase of the content of recA protein with respect to the basal level. Kinetic analysis of this induction shows that the maximum is reached 60 to 90 min after the addition of the drug and then the level decreases. In an uvrA mutant treated with mitomycin C the level of recA protein reaches a maximum within an hour and afterwards it does not decrease. Treatment of exponentially growing cells with EDTA and lysozyme induces a 3-fold increase of recA protein content, in comparison to the basal level. When such spheroplasts are added with mitomycin or nalidixic acid, a striking increase of the recA protein content in the spheroplast suspension is observed, which tends to level off an hour and a half after the addition of the drugs. The maximum level of recA protein content is five times the level measured after lysozyme treatment, i.e. 15 times the basal level in exponentially growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561533380,"Vitamin K epoxide can occur as a pair of optical isomers due to the asymmetry of the oxirane ring substituents. The stereoselectivity of vitamin K-epoxide reductase for the oxirane ring configuration was determined by recovery of the partially resolved unreacted substrate following incubations of racemic vitamin K epoxide with rat liver microsomes. The substrate ws enriched for the (--)-enantiomer, but selectivity for the biologically relevant (+)-enantiomer was low. This result was confirmed by direct comparison of the rates of reaction for the racemic substrate and (+)-vitamin K epoxide. The selectivity of vitamin K-epoxide reductase for the cis- or trans-phytyl configuration of the vitamin K side chain was also low. These results suggest an enzyme-active site which is open toward the 2,3-positions and is able to bind the substrate in two opposite orientations with respect to the positions of the methyl and phytyl side chain substituents."

Thus, tubulins are among the proteins of Physarum selectively synthesized before nuclear division. A third species P, prominently labeled in premitotic plasmodia, is distinct from the two myxamoebal tubulins even though it co-polymerizes with microtubules. The nature of P remains unknown. Two rat monoclonal antibodies directed against yeast tubulin were found to bind selectively to the alpha tubulin of porcine brain.

https://openalex.org/W1594843477,"DNase VIII is an exonuclease purified from human placenta trophoblast nuclei. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 9.5 and requires a divalent cation. It is inhibited by salt and stimulated by Triton X-100. Glycerol gradient analysis of the activity indicates a sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S (31,000 daltons if globular). This enzyme initiates hydrolysis from 5'-phosphorylated termini of single-stranded DNA and acts at internal phosphodiester bonds liberating 5'-phosphorylated oligonucleotides. It degrades polynucleotides of repeating base sequence as well as single-stranded DNA, yielding oligonucleotides of even number, in which the main reaction products are dinucleotides. The activity on denatured DNA is not inhibited by the presence of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts. DNase VIII can also initiate hydrolysis at those distorted termini produced by the action of Micrococcus luteus dimer specific endonuclease on duplex DNA, which contains cyclobutane dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2151149482,"A deoxyribonuclease has been purified 570-fold from the 14-day-old chick embryos. The purified enzyme requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions for maximum activity. The optimum pH is 9.0 in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Its isoelectric point is 6.7. NaCl and N-ethylmaleimide strongly inhibit the reaction. An apparent molecular weight of 45,000 is determined by sedimentation in a glycerol density gradient. The enzyme hydrolyzes denatured DNA 50 to 100 times more rapidly than duplex DNA. RNA and synthetic polyribonucleotides are not substrate for the enzyme. DNase A catalyzes the endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages of single-stranded DNA. The enzyme produces DNA fragments having 70 to 100 nucleotides long at early time of reaction and then degrades these DNA fragments to acid-soluble materials, of which more than 70% is mononucleotides. In the exonucleolytic attack, the enzyme initiates hydrolysis of a single-stranded DNA from 5' to 3' direction. Chick embryo DNA-binding protein gives an intensive effect on the DNase A reaction by inhibiting the endonuclease activity rather than exonuclease activity under the standard assay conditions."
