It explains why states arose where they did, and why they failed to arise elsewhere. It shows the state to be a predictable response to certain specific cultural, demographic, and ecological conditions. Thus, it helps to elucidate what was undoubtedly the most important single step ever taken in the political evolution of mankind."
https://openalex.org/W1992743639,"Experimental phase diagrams for the systems gabbro-water and peridotite-water indicate that, if there is any water in the upper mantle, then traces of hydrous interstitial silicate magma will be produced at depths corresponding to the beginning of the low-velocity zone. This explanation for the zone is more satisfactory than others proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2080325579,"The Apollo 12 magnetometer has measured a steady magnetic field of 36 ± 5 gammas on the lunar surface. Surface gradient measurements and data from a lunar orbiting satellite indicate that this steady field is localized rather than global in its extent. These data suggest that the source is a large, magnetized body which acquired a field during an epoch in which the inducing field was much stronger than any that presently exists at the moon."

https://openalex.org/W2084529631,"Locally, Early Holocene (Atlanticum) oöids, dated with carbon-14, form the major compound in the Recent near-shore sediments of the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia, Mediterranean Sea). They are reworked from coastal oölites and are not forming today. The Holocene oölites crop out at the seaward side of a coastal terrace, while the oölitic rocks from the inland side give a straightforward carbon-14 age of 20,000 to 30,000 years before the present. The entire terrace was formerly dated as Tyrrhenian III (= last interglacial time)."
https://openalex.org/W2083152836,"Chromite, zircon, and quartz crystals (identified by x-ray diffraction) have been recovered from a 2.07-gram sample of Muong Nong-type tektite. The absence of eskolaite (Cr2O3) and baddeleyite (ZrO2) supports a previous conclusion that Muong Nong-type tektites were not heated as intensely as other tektite groups. X-ray asterism studies indicate that the crystals are shocked, which supports an impact origin. The presence of chromite and zircon together suggests that the Muong Nong-type tektite was produced from sedimentary material."

Obsidian from these deposits compares favorably in physical characteristics and sodium-manganese ratio with the archeological obsidian, and there is evidence that the deposits have been ""mined"" in the past."

https://openalex.org/W1964410956,"The Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, one of the nation's most distinguished scientific institutions, has been struck by a series of ""free speech"" controversies in recent months. The laboratory, which is operated by the University of California and is almost entirely funded by the Atomic Energy Commission, has facilities in two California locations, Berkeley and Livermore. Each has been under fire for allegedly stifling open discussion of controversial issues. The Berkeley facility, a leading center for the study of high-energy physics and fundamental nuclear science, has been split by an internal debate over the right of scientists to hold formal political discussions at the laboratory during their lunch hours. The controversy has led to the banning of meetings, the circulating of petitions and counterpetitions bearing hundreds of names, the publishing of an underground newspaper, and the suspension of a controversial physicist. The Livermore facility, a major center for developing nuclear weapons, has been accused of trying to muzzle two staff scientists who contend that existing radiation standards are too lax to protect the public from nuclear radiation hazards. Livermore has also been the target of demonstrations and of a lawsuit seeking to open the weapons laboratory to allow discussions between outsiders and staff scientists concerning the implications of weapons research. The article below discusses the controversy at the Berkeley laboratory, where only unclassified research is performed. A subsequent article will discuss the conflict at security-conscious Livermore."
