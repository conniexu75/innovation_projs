https://openalex.org/W2194186986,"The KDM5/JARID1 family of Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent demethylases remove methyl groups from tri- and dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3. Accumulating evidence from primary tumors and model systems supports a role for KDM5A (JARID1A/RBP2) and KDM5B (JARID1B/PLU1) as oncogenic drivers. The KDM5 family is unique among the Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases in that there is an atypical insertion of a DNA-binding ARID domain and a histone-binding PHD domain into the Jumonji domain, which separates the catalytic domain into two fragments (JmjN and JmjC). Here we demonstrate that internal deletion of the ARID and PHD1 domains has a negligible effect on in vitro enzymatic kinetics of the KDM5 family of enzymes. We present a crystal structure of the linked JmjN-JmjC domain from KDM5A, which reveals that the linked domain fully reconstitutes the cofactor (metal ion and α-ketoglutarate) binding characteristics of other structurally characterized Jumonji domain demethylases. Docking studies with GSK-J1, a selective inhibitor of the KDM6/KDM5 subfamilies, identify critical residues for binding of the inhibitor to the reconstituted KDM5 Jumonji domain. Further, we found that GSK-J1 inhibited the demethylase activity of KDM5C with 8.5-fold increased potency compared with that of KDM5B at 1 mm α-ketoglutarate. In contrast, JIB-04 (a pan-inhibitor of the Jumonji demethylase superfamily) had the opposite effect and was ∼8-fold more potent against KDM5B than against KDM5C. Interestingly, the relative selectivity of JIB-04 toward KDM5B over KDM5C in vitro translates to a ∼10–50-fold greater growth-inhibitory activity against breast cancer cell lines. These data define the minimal requirements for enzymatic activity of the KDM5 family to be the linked JmjN-JmjC domain coupled with the immediate C-terminal helical zinc-binding domain and provide structural characterization of the linked JmjN-JmjC domain for the KDM5 family, which should prove useful in the design of KDM5 demethylase inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity. The KDM5/JARID1 family of Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent demethylases remove methyl groups from tri- and dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3.

It is now well established that cancer arises in part from an altered “epigenome,” with widespread alterations in chromatin modifications (in both DNA and histones) contributing to altered gene expression programs and a progressive loss of genome stability (1Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. The epigenomics of cancer.Cell. 2007; 128: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3648) Google Scholar). Many epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3A), 5-methylcytosine dioxygenases (TET2), histone methyltransferases (EZH2 and MLL1/2/3), histone demethylases (UTX and KDM5A/B/C), ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (ATRX and CHD1/4), and even the histone proteins themselves (histone H3.3), undergo somatic mutations and/or are misexpressed in human cancers (2Ryan R.J.

Targeting epigenetic readers in cancer.New Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that epigenetic dysregulation is not simply a characteristic of cancer cells but probably plays a direct causal role in the development and progression of the disease. Accordingly, there is a great deal of interest in targeting epigenetic regulators as a therapeutic approach in cancer treatment and prevention with the goal of “reprogramming” the cancer epigenome. Thus far, the clinical application of epigenetic therapy has been limited to inhibitors of the DNA methyltransferases (5Yoo C.B. Jones P.A. Epigenetic therapy of cancer: past, present and future.Nat.

Histone lysine demethylases, on the other hand, remain a relatively untapped source of potential “druggable targets.” A few pan-inhibitors of the Jumonji family of demethylases have been identified.

JIB-04 was identified using a cell-based screen for epigenetic modulators of a GFP-linked transgene and was found to function as a pan-inhibitor of the Jumonji family of histone demethylases (19Wang L.

Oncol. 2011; 38: 1267-1277PubMed Google Scholar). More recent data indicate that KDM5B negatively regulates leukemogenesis in murine and human mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting a crucial role for the histone H3 Lys-4 “methylome” in determining leukemic stem cell fate (41Wong S.H.

KDM5C (JARID1C or SMCX) is located on the X chromosome and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (42Vashishtha M. Ng C.W. Yildirim F. Gipson T.A. Kratter I.H. Bodai L. Song W. Lau A. Labadorf A. Vogel-Ciernia A. Troncosco J. Ross C.A. Bates G.P. Krainc D. Sadri-Vakili G. Finkbeiner S. Marsh J.L. Housman D.E. Fraenkel E. Thompson L.M. Targeting H3K4 trimethylation in Huntington disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E3027-E3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of kdm5c in primary neurons reduced the toxicity from mutant Huntingtin expression, restored the level of key neuronal genes, and was neuroprotective in murine and Drosophila Huntington disease models. As such, KDM5A, -B, and -C all have potential as drug targets. The KDM5 family is unique among Jumonji-containing histone demethylases in that the catalytic domain has an atypical insertion of an ARID and PHD1 domain separating it into two subdomains, JmjN and JmjC (46Pilka E.S. James T. Lisztwan J.H. Structural definitions of Jumonji family demethylase selectivity.Drug Discov. Today. 2015; 20: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). Previously, we and others have shown that recombinant protein containing the N-terminal half of KDM5C (residues 1–839), KDM5B (residues 1–769), or KDM5A (residues 1–797) is enzymatically active (43Upadhyay A.K.

Kuchenbecker K.M. Nnadi C.I. Fletterick R.J. Kelly M.J. Fujimori D.G. Histone demethylase KDM5A is regulated by its reader domain through a positive-feedback mechanism.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rice Jumonji demethylase JMJ703 has KDM5-like activity on trimethylated histone H3 Lys-4 but contains no insertion within the catalytic domain (47Chen Q. Chen X. Wang Q. Zhang F. Lou Z. Zhang Q. Zhou D.X. Structural basis of a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase required for stem elongation in rice.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the impact of the ARID and PHD domains on the in vitro enzymatic activity of the KDM5 demethylase family. We find that the ARID and PHD1 domains are dispensable for enzymatic activity of KDM5 family members, whereas the immediate C-terminal helical zinc-binding domain is not. Despite the lack of activity, the structure of the linked JmjN-JmjC domain alone of KDM5A demonstrated that the reconstituted domain utilizes the exact same binding mode to engage metal and α-ketoglutarate, the two reaction cofactors, as that of other structurally characterized Jumonji demethylases. Our data establish the reconstituted, linked Jumonji domain and the helical zinc-binding domain as the minimal domains required for catalytic activity of the KDM5 family. N-terminal fragments of human KDM5A, -C, and -D were PCR-amplified from human cDNA clones obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (GenBankTM number BC110916 for KDM5A, BC054499 for KDM5C, and BC144102 for KDM5D) and KDM5B (a gift of Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou of King's College London; GenBankTM number BC157031) using VENT or Phusion DNA polymerase and cloned into a pET28 plasmid containing an N-terminal His-SUMO tag sequence (48Lan F. Collins R.E. De Cegli R. Alpatov R. Horton J.R. Shi X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Shi Y.

The internal deletion constructs, deleting ARID and PHD1 domains (ΔAP), were made by PCR. Primers corresponding to regions flanking the ARID and PHD1 domains plus the linker sequences were used for PCR of the entire parental plasmid except the ARID-PHD1. After DpnI digestion, the PCR fragment was purified, end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ligated by T4 ligase to form the deletion construct used for expression. Recombinant constructs (Fig. 1b) were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)C+ for protein expression. Typically 2-liter (for Jumonji domain only) or 12-liter (for Jumonji + helical zinc-binding domain) LB cultures were inoculated with starting culture and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4 to 0.8, at which point the temperature was reduced to 16 °C. After 1–2 h, 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce the expression of recombinant protein overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (the KDM5 storage buffer). Cells were broken using a French press and then limited sonication. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for ∼1 h, and the soluble portion was loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column and eluted with an imidazole gradient (12–300 mm). The His-SUMO tag was cleaved overnight at 6 °C by Ulp-1 protease (in-house) digestion (48Lan F. Collins R.E. De Cegli R. Alpatov R. Horton J.R. Shi X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Shi Y.

The protein was further purified by anion exchange (Hitrap Q, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex S200, GE Healthcare) chromatography. The final sizing column was equilibrated with the KDM5 storage buffer, and the eluted protein was concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin concentrator for crystallization or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for later use. Two 1-liter LB cultures of E. coli strain BH249 cells containing a His-tagged Pseudomonas putida FDH construct (a gift of Ashok S. Bhagwat, Wayne State University) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 between 0.4 and 0.6 when the temperature of the shaker was set at 16 °C. After ∼1 h, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added (0.4 mm) to induce expression overnight. Except for the requirement of Ulp-1 protease, the purification of FDH was carried out exactly as described above for the KDM5 proteins, including the buffers and columns used. After the S200 sizing column, purity of FDH was >99% based on SDS-PAGE. The final FDH protein was concentrated to about 10 mg/ml using a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin concentrator. Purified protein was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored in 30 μl aliquots at −80 °C. Purified FDH enzyme and APAD+ (a more stable analogue of NAD+; Sigma-Aldrich A5251) were utilized in a fluorescence-based formaldehyde release assay (49Roy T.W. Bhagwat A.S. Kinetic studies of Escherichia coli AlkB using a new fluorescence-based assay for DNA demethylation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e147Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, a and b) to determine the kinetic characteristics of KDM5B(1–755)ΔAP or KDM5C(1–789)ΔAP with various concentrations of αKG or H3K4 methylated peptides. Standards of formaldehyde concentrations were made fresh and used to calibrate fluorescence intensities to determine initial velocities (Fig. 2c). The turnover number of FDH is fast enough to ensure that the clearance of formaldehyde from the demethylation catalysis is not delayed by FDH conversion. Reactions were performed in a 40-μl volume at room temperature (∼21 °C) for 10 min under the conditions of 0.5 μm [E], 15 μm H3(1–24)K4me3 [S] with variable αKG concentration (0–100 μm) or 1 mm αKG with variable peptide [S] concentration (0–50 μm) in the KDM5 reaction buffer (2 mm ascorbic acid, 50 μm (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 7.5 mm NaCl (carried over from the enzyme stock), 0.6 mm APAD+, and 10 μg (3 μm tetramer) FDH) (50 mm MES, pH 6.6, for KDM5C). All assay components were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of αKG or peptide and APAD+ to initiate the reaction. A BioTek SynergyTM 4 hybrid microplate reader was used to monitor the reaction using 380/20 excitation and 460/40 emission filters with a 400-nm dichroic mirror. Initial veloc"
https://openalex.org/W2189965838,"Integral membrane proteins known as porins are the major pathway by which hydrophilic antibiotics cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Single point mutations in porins can decrease the permeability of an antibiotic, either by reduction of channel size or modification of electrostatics in the channel, and thereby confer clinical resistance. Here, we investigate four mutant OmpC proteins from four different clinical isolates of Escherichia coli obtained sequentially from a single patient during a course of antimicrobial chemotherapy. OmpC porin from the first isolate (OmpC20) undergoes three consecutive and additive substitutions giving rise to OmpC26, OmpC28, and finally OmpC33. The permeability of two zwitterionic carbapenems, imipenem and meropenem, measured using liposome permeation assays and single channel electrophysiology differs significantly between OmpC20 and OmpC33. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the antibiotics must pass through the constriction zone of porins with a specific orientation, where the antibiotic dipole is aligned along the electric field inside the porin. We identify that changes in the vector of the electric field in the mutated porin, OmpC33, create an additional barrier by ""trapping"" the antibiotic in an unfavorable orientation in the constriction zone that suffers steric hindrance for the reorientation needed for its onward translocation. Identification and understanding the underlying molecular details of such a barrier to translocation will aid in the design of new antibiotics with improved permeation properties in Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2192802072,"Despite the enthusiasm for bioengineering of functional renal tissues for transplantation, many obstacles remain before the potential of this technology can be realized in a clinical setting. Viable tissue engineering strategies for the kidney require identification of the necessary cell populations, efficient scaffolds, and the 3D culture conditions to develop and support the unique architecture and physiological function of this vital organ. Our studies have previously demonstrated that decellularized sections of rhesus monkey kidneys of all age groups provide a natural extracellular matrix (ECM) with sufficient structural properties with spatial and organizational influences on human embryonic stem cell (hESC) migration and differentiation. To further explore the use of decellularized natural kidney scaffolds for renal tissue engineering, pluripotent hESC were seeded in whole- or on sections of kidney ECM and cell migration and phenotype compared with the established differentiation assays for hESC. Results of qPCR and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated upregulation of renal lineage markers when hESC were cultured in decellularized scaffolds without cytokine or growth factor stimulation, suggesting a role for the ECM in directing renal lineage differentiation. hESC were also differentiated with growth factors and compared when seeded on renal ECM or a new biologically inert polysaccharide scaffold for further maturation. Renal lineage markers were progressively upregulated over time on both scaffolds and hESC were shown to express signature genes of renal progenitor, proximal tubule, endothelial, and collecting duct populations. These findings suggest that natural scaffolds enhance expression of renal lineage markers particularly when compared to embryoid body culture. The results of these studies show the capabilities of a novel polysaccharide scaffold to aid in defining a protocol for renal progenitor differentiation from hESC, and advance the promise of tissue engineering as a source of functional kidney tissue."

Here we present a cross-sectional survey conducted among people in Kuala Lumpur and surrounds to assess the links between knowledge, attitudes, and practices in relation to the transboundary haze episodes. Of 305 respondents, 125 were amateur athletes participating in a duathlon event and the remainder were surveyed in an inner-city shopping mall. Across the whole sample, people who possessed more factual information about the haze phenomenon showed significantly higher levels of concern. Duathletes were more knowledgeable than non-duathletes and also more concerned about the negative effects of haze, especially on health. For all people who regularly practice outdoor sports (including people interviewed at the shopping mall), higher levels of knowledge and concerned attitudes translated into a greater likelihood of engaging in protective practices, such as cancelling their outdoor training sessions, while those with greater knowledge were more likely to check the relevant air pollution index on a daily basis. Our results indicate that the provision of accurate and timely information about air quality to residents will translate into beneficial practices, at least among particularly exposed individuals, such as amateur athletes who regularly practice outdoor sports."
https://openalex.org/W2194373439,"Presynaptic calcium influx triggers synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and modulates subsequent SV endocytosis. A number of calcium clearance mechanisms are present in central nerve terminals that regulate intracellular free calcium levels both during and after stimulation. During action potential stimulation, mitochondria rapidly accumulate presynaptic calcium via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). The role of mitochondrial calcium uptake in modulating SV recycling has been debated extensively, but a definitive conclusion has not been achieved. To directly address this question, we manipulated the expression of the MCU channel subunit in primary cultures of neurons expressing a genetically encoded reporter of SV turnover. Knockdown of MCU resulted in ablation of activity-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake but had no effect on the rate or extent of SV exocytosis. In contrast, the rate of SV endocytosis was increased in the absence of mitochondrial calcium uptake and slowed when MCU was overexpressed. MCU knockdown did not perturb activity-dependent increases in presynaptic free calcium, suggesting that SV endocytosis may be controlled by calcium accumulation and efflux from mitochondria in their immediate vicinity."

Here, we uncovered a novel function of AA in promoting muscle cell proliferation. Notably, the functional role of AA in regulating muscle cell function is further evidenced by its capability to accelerate muscle regeneration in normal mice, and it ameliorates muscular dystrophy in mdx mice. Mechanistically, our data from multiparameter analyses consistently support the notion that AA plays a non-metabolic role in regulating muscle cell function. Finally, we show that AA exerts its function through activation of the MEK1-ERK1/2-cyclin D1 pathway, revealing a novel mechanism in which AA serves as a signaling metabolite in mediating muscle cell function. Our findings highlight the profound functions of a small metabolite as signaling molecule in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2193013178,"Parkinson disease and other progressive neurodegenerative conditions are characterized by the intracerebral presence of Lewy bodies, containing amyloid fibrils of α-synuclein. We used cryo-electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to study in vitro-assembled fibrils. These fibrils are highly polymorphic. Focusing on twisting fibrils with an inter-crossover spacing of 77 nm, our reconstructions showed them to consist of paired protofibrils. STEM mass per length data gave one subunit per 0.47 nm axial rise per protofibril, consistent with a superpleated β-structure. The STEM images show two thread-like densities running along each of these fibrils, which we interpret as ladders of metal ions. These threads confirmed the two-protofibril architecture of the 77-nm twisting fibrils and allowed us to identify this morphotype in STEM micrographs. Some other, but not all, fibril morphotypes also exhibit dense threads, implying that they also present a putative metal binding site. We propose a molecular model for the protofibril and suggest that polymorphic variant fibrils have different numbers of protofibrils that are associated differently."
https://openalex.org/W2269311077,"Diagnostic delay frequently occurs in Crohn's disease (CD) patients because of diagnostic limitations. However, diagnostic delay and its related factors remain poorly defined. Therefore, we aimed to identify the predictors associated with diagnostic delay and to evaluate the impact of diagnostic delay on clinical course in a Korean CD patient cohort. We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of 1,047 CD patients registered in the Crohn's Disease Clinical Network and Cohort study in Korea. The mean interval of diagnostic delay was 16.0 ± 33.1 months. Multivariate analysis showed that older age at diagnosis (≥40 years) (p = 0.014), concomitant upper gastrointestinal (UGI) disease (p = 0.012) and penetrating disease behavior at diagnosis (p = 0.001) were positively associated with long diagnostic delay (≥18 months). During the longitudinal follow-up, long diagnostic delay was independently predictive of further development of intestinal stenosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.93; p = 0.017), internal fistulas (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12-2.33; p = 0.011), and perianal fistulas (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.80; p = 0.016). However, as for the risk of abscess formation, bowel perforation, and CD-related abdominal surgery, no significant association with diagnostic delay was observed. Older age at diagnosis, UGI involvement, and penetrating behavior are associated with long diagnostic delay in Korean CD patients. Moreover, diagnostic delay is associated with an increased risk of CD-related complications such as intestinal stenosis, internal fistulas, and perianal fistulas."
https://openalex.org/W2189997014,"Cell signaling pathways are noisy communication channels, and statistical measures derived from information theory can be used to quantify the information they transfer. Here we use single cell signaling measures to calculate mutual information as a measure of information transfer via gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors (GnRHR) to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). This revealed mutual information values <1 bit, implying that individual GnRH-responsive cells cannot unambiguously differentiate even two equally probable input concentrations. Addressing possible mechanisms for mitigation of information loss, we focused on the ERK pathway and developed a stochastic activation model incorporating negative feedback and constitutive activity. Model simulations revealed interplay between fast (min) and slow (min-h) negative feedback loops with maximal information transfer at intermediate feedback levels. Consistent with this, experiments revealed that reducing negative feedback (by expressing catalytically inactive ERK2) and increasing negative feedback (by Egr1-driven expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5)) both reduced information transfer from GnRHR to ERK. It was also reduced by blocking protein synthesis (to prevent GnRH from increasing DUSP expression) but did not differ for different GnRHRs that do or do not undergo rapid homologous desensitization. Thus, the first statistical measures of information transfer via these receptors reveals that individual cells are unreliable sensors of GnRH concentration and that this reliability is maximal at intermediate levels of ERK-mediated negative feedback but is not influenced by receptor desensitization."

This study aimed to evaluate both in vitro and in vivo, the potential probiotic properties of Lactobacillus species isolated from fecal samples of healthy humans in Iran. Methods and Results A total of 470 LAB were initially isolated from 53 healthy individual and characterized to species level. Of these, 88 (86%) were Lactobacillus species. Biochemical and genetic fingerprinting with Phene-Plate system (PhP-LB) and RAPD-PCR showed that the isolates were highly diverse consisted of 67(76.1%) and 75 (85.2%) single types (STs) and a diversity indices of 0.994 and 0.997, respectively. These strains were tested for production of adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibacterial activity, production of B12, anti-proliferative effect and interleukin-8 induction on gut epithelial cell lines and antibiotic resistance against 9 commonly used antibiotics. Strains showing the characteristics consistent with probiotic strains, were further tested for their anti-inflammatory effect in mouse colitis model. Only one L. brevis; one L. rhamnosus and two L. plantarum were shown to have significant probiotic properties. These strains showed shortening the length of colon compared to dextran sulfate sodium and disease activity index (DAI) was also significantly reduced in mouse. Conclusion Low number of LAB with potential probiotic activity as well as high diversity of lactobacilli species was evident in Iranian population. It also suggest that specific strains of L. plantarum, L. brevis and L. rhamnosus with anti-inflammatory effect in mouse model of colitis could be used as a potential probiotic candidate in inflammatory bowel disease to decrease the disease activity index."
https://openalex.org/W2274258910,"The 14-3-3 family of proteins are multifunctional proteins that interact with many of their cellular targets in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Here, we determined that 14-3-3 proteins interact with phosphorylated forms of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and modulate its function. With the exception of σ, all 14-3-3 isoforms were abundantly expressed in mouse kidney and mouse kidney collecting duct cells (mpkCCD14). Long-term treatment of mpkCCD14 cells with the type 2 vasopressin receptor agonist dDAVP increased mRNA and protein levels of AQP2 alongside 14-3-3β and -ζ, whereas levels of 14-3-3η and -θ were decreased. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies in mpkCCD14 cells uncovered an AQP2/14-3-3 interaction that was modulated by acute dDAVP treatment. Additional co-IP studies in HEK293 cells determined that AQP2 interacts selectively with 14-3-3ζ and -θ. Use of phosphatase inhibitors in mpkCCD14 cells, co-IP with phosphorylation deficient forms of AQP2 expressed in HEK293 cells, or surface plasmon resonance studies determined that the AQP2/14-3-3 interaction was modulated by phosphorylation of AQP2 at various sites in its carboxyl terminus, with Ser-256 phosphorylation critical for the interactions. shRNA-mediated knockdown of 14-3-3ζ in mpkCCD14 cells resulted in increased AQP2 ubiquitylation, decreased AQP2 protein half-life, and reduced AQP2 levels. In contrast, knockdown of 14-3-3θ resulted in increased AQP2 half-life and increased AQP2 levels. In conclusion, this study demonstrates phosphorylation-dependent interactions of AQP2 with 14-3-3θ and -ζ. These interactions play divergent roles in modulating AQP2 trafficking, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and degradation."

A wealth of observational data accrued in a variety of clinical settings over several decades suggests that modulating high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism may be a viable therapeutic strategy for complementing low density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering treatments (2Rader D.J. Hovingh G.K. HDL and cardiovascular disease.Lancet. 2014; 384: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The sizable unmet medical need has driven intensive drug discovery and development activities to target an array of factors that regulate HDL metabolism, including apolipoprotein (apoA-I) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (3Kingwell B.A. Chapman M.J. Kontush A. Miller N.E. HDL-targeted therapies: progress, failures and future.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 445-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, clinical trials and failures over the past several years in these arenas suggest that HDL therapeutic approaches need to go beyond simply raising circulating HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Importantly, modulating HDL metabolism by well defined mechanisms of action to promote efflux of cholesterol from existing atherosclerotic plaque lesions in the vessel walls is a key consideration for target validation, biomarker evaluation, and proof of concept (4Duffy D. Rader D.J. Update on strategies to increase HDL quantity and function.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2009; 6: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). LCAT (EC 2.3.1.43) is one of the key factors that impacts HDL metabolism. It is the only enzyme in the blood that catalyzes esterification of free cholesterol (FC) to form cholesteryl ester (CE) and lipidates apoA-I and HDL (5Glomset J.A. The plasma lecithins:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction.J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By converting FC into CE, which subsequently is sequestered to the core of HDL particles for further transport and metabolism, LCAT plays an essential role in the formation and maturation of HDL particles as well as in the maintenance of plasma levels of apoA-I and HDL-C (6Calabresi L. Franceschini G. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, high-density lipoproteins, and atheroprotection in humans.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2010; 20: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Not only does LCAT promote generation of larger and spherical α-HDL particles; its enzymatic activity creates an irreversible gradient of FC between peripheral tissues and HDL particles in both the blood and tissue liquids. As a result, LCAT facilitates the transfer of cholesterol from peripheral tissues and cell membranes to apoA-I and HDL particles (7Glomset J.A. Janssen E.T. Kennedy R. Dobbins J. Role of plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins.J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 638-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this role, the LCAT activity provides a driving force for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a pathway that describes flux of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion (8Rousset X. Shamburek R. Vaisman B. Amar M. Remaley A.T. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase: an anti- or pro-atherogenic factor?.Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2011; 13: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By promptly and appropriately lipidating apoA-I, LCAT activity also prevents loss of the lipid-free apoA-I and small HDL particles via kidney filtration. These activities distinguish LCAT from several other HDL-regulating factors, including CETP. Evidence that supports LCAT activity in driving RCT and preventing atherogenesis has evolved from a number of preclinical studies in which LCAT activity was increased by various means in animals expressing CETP (hamsters, rabbits, or monkeys). For instance, rabbits with LCAT overexpression showed strong resistance to developing atherosclerosis when fed a high cholesterol diet (9Hoeg J.M. Santamarina-Fojo S. Bérard A.M. Cornhill J.F. Herderick E.E. Feldman S.H. Haudenschild C.C. Vaisman B.L. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Demosky Jr., S.J. Kauffman R.D. Hazel C.M. Marcovina S.M. Brewer Jr., H.B.

U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11448-11453Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In another study, transgenic rabbits that lacked either one or both copies of a functional LDL receptor revealed that LCAT may have the ability to affect atherosclerosis through the LDL receptor pathway (10Brousseau M.E. Kauffman R.D. Herderick E.E. Demosky Jr., S.J. Evans W. Marcovina S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Hoeg J.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, adenovirus-mediated LCAT overexpression in rabbits was associated with a roughly 2-fold increase in HDL-C, inhibition of atherosclerosis, and increased cholesterol unloading from atherosclerotic lesions (11Van Craeyveld E. Lievens J. Jacobs F. Feng Y. Snoeys J. De Geest B. Apolipoprotein A-I and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase transfer induce cholesterol unloading in complex atherosclerotic lesions.Gene Ther. 2009; 16: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated LCAT gene transfer to hamsters led to increased cholesterol excretion in feces (12Zhang A.H. Gao S. Fan J.L. Huang W. Zhao T.Q. Liu G. Increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels and biliary cholesterol excretion in hamster by LCAT overexpression.FEBS Lett. 2004; 570: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies performed in rodent species that lack CETP showed inconsistent results with LCAT intervention, presumably because CETP plays a role in the RCT pathway at a step immediately downstream of LCAT action to transfer CE from HDL to the apoB-containing lipoproteins toward the liver portal (13Bérard A.M.

On the other hand, studies of CVD in patients with genetic LCAT deficiency were inconclusive. LCAT genetic deficiency leads to two rare autosomal recessive disorders, familial LCAT deficiency (17Norum K.R. Gjone E. Familial serum-cholesterol esterification failure: a new inborn error of metabolism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 144: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and fish eye disease (18Carlson L.A. Philipson B. Fish-eye disease: a new familial condition with massive corneal opacities and dyslipoproteinaemia.Lancet. 1979; 2: 922-924PubMed Google Scholar). Both phenotypes exhibit very low plasma HDL-C levels and corneal opacities. Renal failure appears to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. CVD risk has been reported in both types of LCAT-deficient patients (19Kuivenhoven J.A. Stalenhoef A.F. Hill J.S. Demacker P.N. Errami A. Kastelein J.J. Pritchard P.H. Two novel molecular defects in the LCAT gene are associated with fish eye disease.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but in several cases, clinical CVD manifestations are not readily apparent and are perhaps complicated by reduced LDL-cholesterol levels associated with LCAT deficiency in these cases. A study of 47 heterozygotes for LCAT gene mutations revealed low plasma HDL-C levels, elevated triglycerides, and high sensitive C-reactive protein levels and increased carotid intima media thickness (20Hovingh G.K.

Compromised LCAT function is associated with increased atherosclerosis.Circulation. 2005; 112: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Similar findings were reported from an unrelated LCAT-deficient cohort in Canada (21Ayyobi A.F. McGladdery S.H. Chan S. John Mancini G.B. Hill J.S. Frohlich J.J.

Interestingly, the same 13 Italian families were evaluated again 4 years later, but carotid intima media thickness measurement in 40 patients with LCAT deficiency was not increased compared with unrelated control subjects selected from a blood donor database (23Calabresi L.

Sampietro T. et al.Functional lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase is not required for efficient atheroprotection in humans.Circulation. 2009; 120: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Potential limitations of this study include differences in ultrasound methodology within the carrier cohort and lack of a familial relationship of the controls with the carriers. Several epidemiological and clinical studies in the general population revealed a correlation between plasma LCAT enzyme activity and CVD risk. A 48–58% decrease of plasma LCAT activity was associated with acute myocardial infarction and CVD in 90 patients (24Solajić-Bozicević N. Stavljenić A. Sesto M. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease.Artery. 1991; 18: 326-340PubMed Google Scholar). Another study in subjects with ischemic heart disease revealed a strong association of ischemic heart disease with low plasma LCAT activity, suggesting that LCAT activity might be useful as a biomarker for identifying patients at risk for CVD (25Sethi A.A. Sampson M. Warnick R. Muniz N. Vaisman B. Nordestgaard B.G. Tybjaerg-Hansen A. Remaley A.T.

Chem. 2010; 56: 1128-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A few other studies failed to capture an association between low LCAT levels and increased atherosclerosis or, conversely, an association of increased LCAT activity with lower CVD risk (26Dullaart R.P. Perton F. Sluiter W.J. de Vries R. van Tol A. Plasma lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase activity is elevated in metabolic syndrome and is an independent marker of increased carotid artery intima media thickness.J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 416-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Limitations of these studies include a narrow window of LCAT activity variation among the cohorts and lack of a robust and consistent methodology in clinical laboratories for determining LCAT enzyme activity in serum samples. We propose that LCAT activation represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis through the mechanism of favorably modulating HDL metabolism and promoting RCT. Experimental evidence in support of this notion includes our previous study in which supplementation of a modified recombinant LCAT protein accelerated cholesterol mobilization in vivo and attenuated atherogenesis in rabbits fed with a high cholesterol diet (28Zhou M. Sawyer J. Kelley K. Fordstrom P. Chan J. Tonn G. Carlson T. Retter M. Meininger D. Cheng J. Gates A. Woodward A. Delaney J. Zhang R. Tang J. Liu Q. Cao P. Luchoomun J. Voogt J. Turner S. Shan B. Boone. T. Rudel L. Schwarz M. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase promotes reverse cholesterol transport and attenuates atherosclerosis progression in New Zealand white rabbits.Circulation. 2009; 120: S1175Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the endogenous LCAT enzyme can be activated by a synthesized small molecule (29..Zhou M, F. P., Zhang J, Meininger D, Schwarz M, Kayser F, Shan B., (2008) Novel small molecule LCAT activators raise HDL levels in rodent models, in arteriosclerosis. in Thrombosis and Vascular Biology Annual Conference, June 14–17, p. e65, Atlanta, Georgia.Google Scholar). We reasoned further that endogenous LCAT in the bloodstream could be activated by an agonistic antibody, which would lead to the desirable pharmacological effectiveness. This study established a novel strategy for successful discovery of agonistic antibodies for human LCAT and demonstrated the feasibility of developing a human anti-human LCAT antibody therapy with favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in non-human primates. Full-length human LCAT-coding region was cloned from liver and brain cDNAs (BioChain Institute, Inc., Hayward, CA) and subcloned into the expression vector pDSRa25. Mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant human wild type LCAT proteins (rLCAT) were generated from a serum-free, suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DXB-11 cell line designated CHO/CS9. Production cultures were seeded in serum-free culture medium with 0.5 mm sodium butyrate at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in 125-ml shake flasks and incubated at 31 °C for 5 days. Purification of rLCAT was performed using an anti-human LCAT affinity column generated by cross-linking in-house generated mouse anti-human LCAT 9B14.A2 monoclonal antibody to a Protein A affinity medium, MabSelect SuRE (GE HealthCare). For generation of cynomolgus monkey LCAT proteins, the full-length cynomolgus LCAT-coding region was cloned from cynomolgus liver cDNAs (BioChain Institute, Inc., Hayward, CA), and was constructed into the expression vector pTT5 with a His6 tag at the C terminus of the recombinant protein. Purification of cynomolgus LCAT proteins (cynoLCAT) was performed by concentrating cynoLCAT-His6-containing cell culture supernatant on a Millipore PrepScale TFF 10,000 molecular weight cut-off cartridge and buffer-exchanging into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. Concentrated supernatant was then loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF (GE HealthCare) column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.2). After loading, the column was washed with the equilibrating buffer, and cynoLCAT was eluted with a 5CV gradient to 300 mm imidazole in the equilibrating buffer. Subsequent gel filtration purification was performed using HiLoad Superdex 200 26/60 equilibrated in formulation buffer (PBS, 10% glycerol, 50 μm EDTA, pH 7.2) to isolate purified proteins. Monoclonal antibodies were generated using the XenoMouseTM technology according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 08/759,620 (30..Schreiber, J. R., and Kamboj, K. K., (July 21, 2011) Human antibodies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS derived from transgenic XenoMouse, U.S. Patent Application 08/759,620,Google Scholar) and International Patent Applications WO 98/24893 (31..Belmont, W., Wong, H.C., Wittman, V.

G., (December 21, 2000) Transgenic animals for producing specific isotypes of human antibodies via non-cognate switch regions, International Patent Application WO 00/76310,Google Scholar). Soluble rLCAT and a modified human LCAT protein with a single point mutation, C31Y, designated as rLCAT(C31Y), were used as immunogens. Following the initial immunization, subsequent boost immunizations of immunogen (5 μg/mouse of soluble LCAT proteins) were administered on a schedule and for the duration necessary to induce a suitable titer of anti-LCAT antibody resulting in a total of 12 immunizations over a period of approximately 2 months, which generated a panel of 23,000 hybridomas. Lymphocytes from animals exhibiting suitable titers were obtained from draining lymph nodes. B cells were selected from this population and fused with non-secretory myeloma fusion partner P3X63Ag8.653 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1580) (33Kearney J.F. Radbruch A. Liesegang B. Rajewsky K. A new mouse myeloma cell line that has lost immunoglobulin expression but permits the construction of antibody-secreting hybrid cell lines.J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1548-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using PGE/DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich). The fused cells were gently pelleted and resuspended in selection medium containing azaserine and hypoxanthine and cultured for 3 to 4 days. Cells were distributed into 96-well plates using standard techniques to maximize clonality of the resulting colonies. After several days of culture, supernatants were collected and subjected to screening assays as detailed below, including confirmation of binding to human LCAT, cross-reactivity with LCAT of other species (cynomolgus monkey, rabbit, and murine), and ability to agonize LCAT enzymes. Positive cells were further selected and subjected to standard cloning and subcloning techniques. Clonal lines were expanded for generating hybridoma culture supernatants. The primary binding screen to identify human LCAT binders was performed by examining the hybridoma culture supernatants using ELISA as follows. Microtiter plates (Costar 3702) were incubated with neutravidin (Thermo 31000) at 10 μg/ml and with a volume of 40 μl/well overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed for three cycles with 1× PBS and then blocked with 1% nonfat skim milk in 1× PBS (90 μl/well) for at least 30 min at room temperature. After wash, 40 μl of 1 μg/ml biotinylated rLCAT was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed as before, and hybridoma culture supernatants were added to wells diluted in 1× PBS containing 1% nonfat skim milk for a final concentration of 20% and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, goat anti-human IgG Fc HRP was added at 100 ng/ml in 1× PBS containing 1% nonfat skim milk at 40 μl/well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The absorbance at 450 nm was read after adding 40 μl/well 1 m hydrochloric acid. Primary activity screening for identification of human anti-human LCAT-agonistic antibodies was performed using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) to first filter out LCAT antagonistic antibodies. This SPA used 0.5 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant samples to incubate with rLCAT(C31Y) at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml protein in the reaction mixture containing 1% human serum albumin (fatty acid-free), 7 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The LCAT reaction substrates consisted of human apoA-I proteoliposomes containing 210 μm l-α-phosphatidylcholine type XVI-E (Sigma), 13 μm cholesterol, 28 μm [1,2-3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 56 μg/ml purified human apoA-I protein (Meridian Life Sciences). Reactions were conducted in quadruplicate in 384-well plates and incubated at room temperature for 5 h. LCAT activity on cholesterol esterification was determined by adding 25 mg/ml 2-OH-β-cyclodextrin to block non-reacted cholesterol and then adding 5 mg/ml Ysi-SPA beads to bind and detect CE-contained proteoliposomes. The signal from the SPA beads was quantified using a TopCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plate reader. Antibody containing hybridoma exhaust supernatants that did not bind to LCAT were used as non-inhibiting controls. Hybridoma samples with activity above one S.D. of average control activity were selected as “non-antagonistic” antibodies and subjected to confirmation assays to further identify agonistic antibodies. The non-antagonistic antibodies selected by the SPA assay were examined using another LCAT activity assay with thin layer chromatography (TLC) to quantify the rate of cholesterol esterification in reconstituted HDL particles (34Chen C.H. Albers J.J. Characterization of proteoliposomes containing apoprotein A-I: a new substrate for the measurement of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase activity.J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this assay, 10 μl of hybridoma exhaust supernatants were incubated with purified wild type rLCAT protein at a concentration of 0.8 μg/ml protein in the presence of 1% human serum albumin, 7 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. LCAT reaction substrates consisted of human apoA-I proteoliposomes containing 67 μm l-α-phosphatidylcholine type XVI-E, 8 μm cholesterol, 4 μm [4-14C]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 12 μg/ml apoA-I. Reactions were run in triplicate and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h. Following the reaction, lipids were extracted with a 10-fold volume addition of 100% ethanol. Lipids containing supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and then dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, resuspended in chloroform, and spotted on TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Whatman). FC and CE were separated by running plates in a TLC chamber with petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid (100:20:0.5, v/v/v). FC and CE bands were detected by exposing to image plates and subsequent reading on a FujiFilm FLA-5100 fluorescent image analyzer. Ratios of FC/CE were determined using ImageQuant software (Fujifilm). Agonistic activity was confirmed in selected medium samples by a volumetric dose response using 0, 0.4, 2, and 10 μl with the same assay conditions. Antibodies that showed dose-dependent LCAT-agonizing activity with an increased rate of cholesterol esterification in this assay were reconfirmed upon purification in dose-titration experiments. Characterization of identified agonistic antibodies upon modulating the phospholipase A2 activity of LCAT (LCAT-PLA2) was performed using a commercially available LCAT-phospholipase activity assay kit (Millipore). The kit provides non-hydrolyzed substrates that, upon hydrolysis by LCAT-PLA2 activity, generate fluorescence signals at 390 nm. rLCAT protein was preincubated with identified antibodies prior to the incubation with this substrate. LCAT-PLA2-mediated hydrolysis was assessed by measuring the emission at 390 nm after 4 h of incubation with rLCAT-antibody complex at 37 °C. Two concentrations of antibodies (1 and 10 nm) were tested with two different rLCAT concentrations (1 and 10 nm) in the reactions. A small molecule agonist of LCAT was used at 3 μm as a control (29..Zhou M, F.

This study focuses on improvement of the predictive model interpretability based on simple logical features representing comorbidities. We use group lasso based feature interaction discovery followed by a post-processing step, where simple logic terms are added. In the final step, we reduce the feature set by applying lasso logistic regression to obtain a compact set of non-zero coefficients that represent a more comprehensible predictive model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated on a pediatric hospital discharge dataset that was used to build a readmission risk estimation model. The evaluation of the proposed method demonstrates a reduction of the initial set of features in a regression model by 72%, with a slight improvement in the Area Under the ROC Curve metric from 0.763 (95% CI: 0.755–0.771) to 0.769 (95% CI: 0.761–0.777). Additionally, our results show improvement in comprehensibility of the final predictive model using simple comorbidity based terms for logistic regression."
https://openalex.org/W2192831474,"Denervation-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy results from the loss of electric stimulation and leads to protein degradation, which is critically regulated by the well-confirmed transcriptional co-activator peroxisome proliferator co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). No adequate treatments of muscle wasting are available. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a naturally occurring antioxidant component with multiple functions including mitochondrial modulation, demonstrates the ability to protect against muscle dysfunction. However, it remains unclear whether PQQ enhances PGC-1α activation and resists skeletal muscle atrophy in mice subjected to a denervation operation. This work investigates the expression of PGC-1α and mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle of denervated mice administered PQQ. The C57BL6/J mouse was subjected to a hindlimb sciatic axotomy. A PQQ-containing ALZET® osmotic pump (equivalent to 4.5 mg/day/kg b.w.) was implanted subcutaneously into the right lower abdomen of the mouse. In the time course study, the mouse was sacrificed and the gastrocnemius muscle was prepared for further myopathological staining, energy metabolism analysis, western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR studies. We observed that PQQ administration abolished the denervation-induced decrease in muscle mass and reduced mitochondrial activities, as evidenced by the reduced fiber size and the decreased expression of cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-tetrazolium reductase. Bioenergetic analysis demonstrated that PQQ reprogrammed the denervation-induced increase in the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and led to an increase in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a measurement of the glycolytic metabolism. The protein levels of PGC-1α and the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes were also increased by treatment with PQQ. Furthermore, PQQ administration highly enhanced the expression of oxidative fibers and maintained the type II glycolytic fibers. This pre-clinical in vivo study suggests that PQQ may provide a potent therapeutic benefit for the treatment of denervation-induced atrophy by activating PGC-1α and maintaining the mitochondrial ETC complex in skeletal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2268456743,"The plasticity of macrophages is evident in helminthic parasite infections, providing protection from inflammation. Previously we demonstrated that the micronutrient selenium induces a phenotypic switch in macrophage activation from a classically activated (pro-inflammatory; M1/CAM) toward an alternatively activated (anti-inflammatory; M2/AAM) phenotype, where cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent cyclopentenone prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) plays a key role. Here, we hypothesize that dietary selenium modulates macrophage polarization toward an AAM phenotype to assist in the increasing clearance of adult Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a gastrointestinal nematode parasite. Mice on a selenium-adequate (0.08 ppm) diet significantly augmented intestinal AAM presence while decreasing adult worms and fecal egg production when compared with infection of mice on selenium-deficient (<0.01 ppm) diet. Further increase in dietary selenium to supraphysiological levels (0.4 ppm) had very little or no impact on worm expulsion. Normal adult worm clearance and enhanced AAM marker expression were observed in the selenium-supplemented Trsp(fl/fl)Cre(WT) mice that express selenoproteins driven by tRNA(Sec) (Trsp), whereas N. brasiliensis-infected Trsp(fl/fl)Cre(LysM) selenium-supplemented mice showed a decreased clearance, with lowered intestinal expression of several AAM markers. Inhibition of the COX pathway with indomethacin resulted in delayed worm expulsion in selenium-adequate mice. This was rescued with 15d-PGJ2, which partially recapitulated the effect of selenium supplementation on fecal egg output in addition to increasing markers of AAMs in the small intestine. Antagonism of PPARγ blocked the effect of selenium. These results suggest that optimal expression of selenoproteins and selenium-dependent production of COX-derived endogenous prostanoids, such as Δ(12)-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2, may regulate AAM activation to enhance anti-helminthic parasite responses."

https://openalex.org/W2192547290,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the serial change of isokinetic muscle strength of the knees before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in physically active males and to estimate the time of return to full physical fitness. Extension and flexion torques were measured for the injured and healthy limbs at two angular velocities approximately 1.5 months before the surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months after ACLR. Significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in peak knee extension and flexion torques, hamstring/quadriceps (H/Q) strength ratios, uninvolved/involved limb peak torque ratios, and the normalized work of these muscles between the four stages of rehabilitation were identified. Significant differences between extension peak torques for the injured and healthy limbs were also detected at all stages. The obtained results showed that 12 months of rehabilitation were insufficient for the involved knee joint to recover its strength to the level of strength of the uninvolved knee joint. The results helped to evaluate the progress of the rehabilitation and to implement necessary modifications optimizing the rehabilitation training program. The results of the study may also be used as referential data for physically active males of similar age."
https://openalex.org/W2195393428,"Treatment of stroke, especially during the first hours or days, is still lacking. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a cerebroprotective agent with short life time, may help if administered early with a sustain delivery while avoiding intensive reduction in blood pressure. We developed in situ forming implants (biocompatible biodegradable copolymer) and microparticles (same polymer and solvent emulsified with an external oily phase) of GSNO to lengthen its effects and allow cerebroprotection after a single subcutaneous administration to Wistar rats. Arterial pressure was recorded for 3 days (telemetry, n = 14), whole-blood platelet aggregation up to 13 days (aggregometry, n = 58), and neurological score, cerebral infarct size and edema volume for 2 days after obstruction of the middle cerebral artery by autologous blood clots (n = 30). GSNO-loaded formulations (30 mg/kg) induced a slighter and longer hypotension (-10 vs. -56 ± 6 mmHg mean arterial pressure, 18 h vs. 40 min) than free GSNO at the same dose. The change in pulse pressure (-50%) lasted even up to 42 h for microparticles. GSNO-loaded formulations (30 mg/kg) prevented the transient 24 h hyper-aggregability observed with free GSNO and 7.5 mg/kg-loaded formulations. When injected 2 h after stroke, GSNO-loaded microparticles (30 mg/kg) reduced neurological score at 24 (-62%) and 48 h (-75%) vs. empty microparticles and free GSNO 7.5 mg/kg and, compared to free GSNO, divided infarct size by 10 and edema volume by 8 at 48 h. Corresponding implants reduced infarct size and edema volume by 2.5 to 3 times. The longer (at least 2 days) but slight effects on arterial pressures show sustained delivery of GSNO-loaded formulations (30 mg/kg), which prevent transient platelet hyper-responsiveness and afford cerebroprotection against the consequences of stroke. In conclusion, in situ GSNO-loaded formulations are promising candidates for the treatment of stroke."

https://openalex.org/W2289843961,"Allopolyploids, formed by hybridization and chromosome doubling, face the immediate challenge of having duplicated nuclear genomes that interact with the haploid and maternally inherited cytoplasmic (plastid and mitochondrial) genomes. Most of our knowledge of the genomic consequences of allopolyploidy has focused on the fate of the duplicated nuclear genes without regard to their potential interactions with cytoplasmic genomes. As a step toward understanding the fates of nuclear-encoded subunits that are plastid-targeted, here we examine the retention and expression of the gene encoding the small subunit of Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; rbcS) in multiple populations of allotetraploid Tragopogon miscellus (Asteraceae). These polyploids formed recently (~80 years ago) and repeatedly from T. dubius and T. pratensis in the northwestern United States. Examination of 79 T. miscellus individuals from 10 natural populations, as well as 25 synthetic allotetraploids, including reciprocally formed plants, revealed a low percentage of naturally occurring individuals that show a bias in either gene (homeolog) loss (12%) or expression (16%), usually toward maintaining the maternal nuclear copy of rbcS. For individuals showing loss, seven retained the maternally derived rbcS homeolog only, while three had the paternally derived copy. All of the synthetic polyploid individuals examined (S0 and S1 generations) retained and expressed both parental homeologs. These results demonstrate that cytonuclear coordination does not happen immediately upon polyploid formation in Tragopogon miscellus."
https://openalex.org/W2190370833,"Dietary triglycerides (TG) are absorbed by the enterocytes of the small intestine after luminal hydrolysis into monacylglycerol and fatty acids. Before secretion on chylomicrons, these lipids are reesterified into TG, primarily through the monoacylglycerol pathway. However, targeted deletion of the primary murine monoacylglycerol acyltransferase does not quantitatively affect lipid absorption, suggesting the existence of alternative pathways. Therefore, we investigated the role of the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway in dietary lipid absorption. The expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT3) was examined throughout the small intestine. To evaluate the role for GPAT3 in lipid absorption, mice harboring a disrupted GPAT3 gene (Gpat3−/−) were subjected to an oral lipid challenge and fed a Western-type diet to characterize the role in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. Additional mechanistic studies were performed in primary enterocytes. GPAT3 was abundantly expressed in the apical surface of enterocytes in the small intestine. After an oral lipid bolus, Gpat3−/− mice exhibited attenuated plasma TG excursion and accumulated lipid in the enterocytes. Electron microscopy studies revealed a lack of lipids in the lamina propria and intercellular space in Gpat3−/− mice. Gpat3−/− enterocytes displayed a compensatory increase in the synthesis of phospholipid and cholesteryl ester. When fed a Western-type diet, hepatic TG and cholesteryl ester accumulation was significantly higher in Gpat3−/− mice compared with the wild-type mice accompanied by elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver injury. Dysregulation of bile acid metabolism was also evident in Gpat3-null mice. These studies identify GPAT3 as a novel enzyme involved in intestinal lipid metabolism."

The quantity and quality of particulate organic matter (POM) and potentially mineralizable-N (PMN) contents were measured in soils from 16 paired rice-rapeseed (RR)/cotton-rapeseed (CR) rotations sites in Hubei province, central China. Then four paired soils encompassing low (10th percentile), intermediate (25th and 75th percentiles), and high (90th percentile) levels of soil PMN were selected to further study the effects of POM on soil N mineralization by quantifying the net N mineralization in original soils and soils from which POM was removed. Both soil POM carbon (POM-C) and N (POM-N) contents were 45.8% and 55.8% higher under the RR rotation compared to the CR rotation, respectively. The PMN contents were highly correlated with the POM contents. The PMN and microbial biomass N (MBN) contents concurrently and significantly decreased when POM was removed. The reduction rate of PMN was positively correlated with changes in MBN after the removal of POM. The reduction rates of PMN and MBN after POM removal are lower under RR rotations (38.0% and 16.3%, respectively) than CR rotations (45.6% and 19.5%, respectively). Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy indicated that compounds with low-bioavailability accumulated (e.g., aromatic recalcitrant materials) in the soil POM fraction under the RR rotation but not under the CR rotation. The results of the present study demonstrated that POM plays a vital role in soil N mineralization under different rotation systems. The discrepancy between POM content and composition resulting from different crop rotation systems caused differences in N mineralization in soils."
https://openalex.org/W2292744327,"Two α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α4β2-nAChR) isoforms exist with (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2 subunit stoichiometries and high versus low agonist sensitivities (HS and LS), respectively. Both isoforms contain a pair of α4(+)/(−)β2 agonist-binding sites. The LS isoform also contains a unique α4(+)/(−)α4 site with lower agonist affinity than the α4(+)/(−)β2 sites. However, the relative roles of the conserved α4(+)/(−)β2 agonist-binding sites in and between the isoforms have not been studied. We used a fully linked subunit concatemeric nAChR approach to express pure populations of HS or LS isoform α4β2*-nAChR. This approach also allowed us to mutate individual subunit interfaces, or combinations thereof, on each isoform background. We used this approach to systematically mutate a triplet of β2 subunit (−)-face E-loop residues to their non-conserved α4 subunit counterparts or vice versa (β2HQT and α4VFL, respectively). Mutant-nAChR constructs (and unmodified controls) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Acetylcholine concentration-response curves and maximum function were measured using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. Surface expression was measured with 125I-mAb 295 binding and was used to define function/nAChR. If the α4(+)/(−)β2 sites contribute equally to function, making identical β2HQT substitutions at either site should produce similar functional outcomes. Instead, highly differential outcomes within the HS isoform, and between the two isoforms, were observed. In contrast, α4VFL mutation effects were very similar in all positions of both isoforms. Our results indicate that the identity of subunits neighboring the otherwise equivalent α4(+)/(−)β2 agonist sites modifies their contributions to nAChR activation and that E-loop residues are an important contributor to this neighbor effect."
https://openalex.org/W2193203990,"Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protein of the complement lectin pathway, resembles thrombin in terms of structural features and substrate specificity. Due to its interplay with several coagulation factors, it has the ability to induce fibrin clot formation independent of the usual coagulation activation pathways. We have recently shown that MASP-1 activates prothrombin and identified arginine (R) 155, R271, and R393 as potential cleavage sites. FXa cleaves R320 instead of R393, and thrombin cleaves R155 and R284 in prothrombin. Here we have used three arginine-to-glutamine mutants of prothrombin, R271Q, R320Q, R393Q and the serine-to-alanine active site mutant S525A to investigate in detail the mechanism of MASP-1 mediated prothrombin activation. Prothrombin wildtype and mutants were digested with MASP-1 and the cleavage products were analysed by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. A functional clotting assay was performed by thrombelastography. We have found that MASP-1 activates prothrombin via two simultaneous pathways, either cleaving at R271 or R393 first. Both pathways result in the formation of several active alternative thrombin species. Functional studies confirmed that both R393 and R320 are required for prothrombin activation by MASP-1, whereas R155 is not considered to be an important cleavage site in this process. In conclusion, we have described for the first time a detailed model of prothrombin activation by MASP-1."
https://openalex.org/W2189866517,"Children's emotion word comprehension (EWC) has constantly received a great deal of attention in developmental science. However, since previous reports focused on only English emotion vocabulary, researchers thus far remained unclear as to the developmental trajectories of EWC (to Chinese emotion words) in Chinese children, let alone the cross-cultural difference of EWC in different languages (i.e., English V.S. Chinese). Furthermore, the influence of valence on EWC, as well as the interaction mechanism between EWC and empathy, has not been fully investigated. Finding answers to these research gaps has become the main motivation of the current study. For this purpose, a Chinese emotion vocabulary was first constructed to estimate EWC of Chinese children (ages 2-13 years old). Then, the valence of each emotion word was evaluated using the standard 9-point scale approach. After that, the Chinese children's EWC and empathy were measured in terms of parental ratings. Finally, all data collected were statistically analyzed to reveal the influence of the valence of EWC, the relation between EWC and empathy, and the cross-cultural difference of children's EWC between China and UK from the viewpoint of developmental science. The main results of the current study included the following: (i) EWC in general increased with age for Chinese children ages 2-13 years old, however, there was a dramatic increase during ages 6-8 years old; (ii) EWC of positive emotion words in general developed better than that of negative and neutral ones for Chinese children (ages 2-13 years old); and the disadvantage of EWC to negative emotion words over neutral ones was gradually observed with the increase of age, even though there were no significant differences between them from the beginning; (iii) EWC completely mediated the effect of age on empathy; and (iv) EWC of children in UK developed better than Chinese counterparts during the early childhood period (ages 4-6 years old), then Chinese counterparts developed better during the middle childhood period (ages 7-10 years old), however, there was no significant difference of EWC between both groups during the late childhood period (ages 11-12 years old)."
https://openalex.org/W2192020045,"Background Recent clinical trials using c-kit+ human cardiac stem cells (CSCs) demonstrated promising results in increasing cardiac function and improving quality of life. However, CSC efficiency is low, likely due to limited cell survival and engraftment after transplantation. The Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632, significantly increased cell survival rate, adhesion, and migration in numerous types of cells, including stem cells, suggesting a common feature of the ROCK-mediated apoptotic pathway that may also exist in human CSCs. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that pretreatment of human CSCs with Y-27632 protects cells from Doxorubicin (Dox) induced apoptosis. Methods and Results c-kit+ CSCs were cultured in CSC medium for 3–5 days followed by 48hr treatment with 0 to 10μM Y-27632 alone, 0 to 1.0μM Dox alone, or Y-27632 followed by Dox (48hrs). Cell viability, toxicity, proliferation, morphology, migration, Caspase-3 activity, expression levels of apoptotic-related key proteins and c-kit+ were examined. Results showed that 48hr treatment with Y-27632 alone did not result in great changes in c-kit+ expression, proliferation, Caspase-3 activity, or apoptosis; however cell viability was significantly increased and cell migration was promoted. These effects likely involve the ROCK/Actin pathways. In contrast, 48hr treatment with Dox alone dramatically increased Caspase-3 activity, resulting in cell death. Although Y-27632 alone did not affect the expression levels of apoptotic-related key factors (p-Akt, Akt, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, cleaved Caspase-3, and Caspase-3) under basal conditions, it significantly inhibited the Dox-induced increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and reduced cell death under Dox treatment. Conclusions We conclude that preconditioning human CSCs with Y-27632 significantly reduces Dox-induced cell death and possibly involves the cleaved Caspase-3 and ROCK/Actin pathways. The beneficial effects of Y-27632 may be applied to stem cell-based therapy to increase cell survival rates after transplantation or to act as a cardiac protective agent for Dox-treated cancer patients."

The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathologic and computed tomography (CT) features of small bowel stromal tumors located in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In total, 197 patients (109 male, 88 female) with small bowel GISTs were retrospectively reviewed. All tumors had definite anatomic sites in the small bowel tract with surgical confirmation. The clinicopathologic variables included age, sex, onset of symptoms, and tumor risk category. CT variables included tumor size, degree enhancement, enhancement pattern (region of necrosis), adjacent tissue involvement, lymphadenopathy, and distant metastasis. We assessed any possible differences according to different GIST site of origin. Based on tumor size and mitotic count, the risk categories in different anatomic sites did not differ significantly between duodenal and jejunal GISTs. However, high risk ileum GISTs accounted for 66.0% of ileal cases, which was higher than duodenum cases (36.8%, P = 0.002) and jejunum cases (43.9%, P = 0.004). The mean size of GISTs in the ileum was 9.77 cm, which was significantly larger than in the duodenum (7.41 cm, P = 0.043), and in the jejunum (8.14 cm, P = 0.027). On CT images, enhancement degree appeared to gradually increase from the duodenum to the ileum in the portal phase, and the enhancement pattern presented a tendency for heterogeneity. In Conclusions, the clinicopathologic and CT features of small bowel GISTs can differ according to different primary anatomic sites."
https://openalex.org/W2191353358,"The loss of biodiversity following fragmentation and degradation of habitat is a major issue in conservation biology. As competition for resources increases following habitat loss and fragmentation, severe population declines may occur even in common, highly mobile species; such demographic decline may cause changes within the population structure of the species. The regent honeyeater, Anthochaera phrygia, is a highly nomadic woodland bird once common in its native southeast Australia. It has experienced a sharp decline in abundance since the late 1970s, following clearing of large areas of its preferred habitat, box-ironbark woodland, within the last 200 years. A captive breeding program has been established as part of efforts to restore this species. This study used genetic data to examine the range-wide population structure of regent honeyeaters, including spatial structure, its change through time, sex differences in philopatry and mobility, and genetic differences between the captive and wild populations. There was low genetic differentiation between birds captured in different geographic areas. Despite the recent demographic decline, low spatial structure appears to have some temporal consistency. Both sexes appear to be highly mobile, and there does not seem to be significant genetic differentiation between the captive and wild populations. We conclude that management efforts for survival of this species, including habitat protection, restoration, and release of captive-bred birds into the wild, can treat the species as effectively a single genetic population."

Conversely, lysis of TLF-1-treated T. brucei brucei was increased by the addition of peroxides or thiol-conjugating agents. Previously, the Hpr-Hb complex was postulated to be a source of free radicals during TLF-1 lysis. However, we found that the iron-containing heme of the Hpr-Hb complex was not involved in TLF-1 lysis. Furthermore, neither high concentrations of transferrin nor knock-out of cytosolic lipid peroxidases prevented TLF-1 lysis. Instead, purified ApoL1 was sufficient to induce lysis, and ApoL1 lysis was inhibited by the antioxidant DPPD.

In support of ApoL1 forming a sodium channel at the plasma membrane, TLF-1 lysis of T. brucei brucei is decreased in a sodium-free buffer (15Molina-Portela Mdel P. Lugli E.B. Recio-Pinto E. Raper J.

The role of oxidative processes in the mechanism of TLF-1 lysis is also controversial. In favor of an oxidative mechanism of TLF-1-induced lysis, increased lipid peroxides were observed in TLF-1-treated versus control cells (16Bishop J.R. Shimamura M. Hajduk S.L.

Also, the addition of exogenous catalase or the antioxidant DPPD decreased lysis caused by TLF-1 (16Bishop J.R. Shimamura M. Hajduk S.L.

Within the lysosome, the Hpr-Hb complex has been proposed to act as the TLF-1 peroxidase, initiating oxidative damage to the lysosomal membrane (13Widener J. Nielsen M.J. Shiflett A. Moestrup S.K.

In contrast, another group found no evidence for peroxide formation during TLF-1 lysis (18Molina Portela M.P. Raper J. Tomlinson S. An investigation into the mechanism of trypanosome lysis by human serum factors.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The research presented here addresses the origin and role of oxidative stress in TLF-1-induced trypanosome lysis. We show that Hpr-Hb mediated lysosomal lipid peroxidation is not required for killing. Rather, we propose that oxidation of free thiols in T. brucei brucei treated with TLF-1 leads to osmotic de-regulation and osmotic lysis. Bloodstream form T. brucei brucei Lister 427(MiTat 1.2) cells were grown in cell culture medium made from HMI-9 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% Serum-Plus (Sigma-Aldrich). Cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase I and II double knock-out T. brucei brucei 449 cells, strain Lister 427 (Px KO) were generously donated by Luise Krauth-Siegel (Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany) (19Diechtierow M.

Unless otherwise noted, all trypanosomes assays were performed in culture medium with mid-log phase cells grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. TLF-1_and ApoL1 were purified as described previously (22Shiflett A.M. Bishop J.R. Pahwa A. Hajduk S.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32578-32585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, TLF-1 was purified from human HDLs from single donors. HDLs were eluted from an anti-Hpr column, dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline solution with EDTA (PBSE), and concentrated by Centricon filtration with a 100-kDa cutoff size (Millipore). For ApoL1 purification, purified TLF-1 was solubilized in CHAPS, eluted from an anti-ApoL1 column, dialyzed into PBSE, and concentrated. SDS-PAGE gels and Western blots against Hpr and ApoL1 confirmed the identity and purity of TLF-1 and ApoL1 preparations. Most lysis assays were performed as previously reported with 1 × 107 trypanosomes/ml in serum-containing cell culture medium (13Widener J. Nielsen M.J. Shiflett A. Moestrup S.K. Hajduk S. Hemoglobin is a co-factor of human trypanosome lytic factor.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1250-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, all TLF-1 assays were conducted following preincubation of TLF-1 on ice with an excess of Hb. For assays with reconstituted globins, cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free media composed of HMI9 with 1% by weight glucose and 1% by weight BSA. Before addition to the trypanosomes, 100 mol eq of globin were preincubated with TLF-1 on ice for several minutes. For ApoL1 assays, time courses were longer than 2 h as indicated in the figure legends. Reagents used in lysis assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich: Human hemoglobin A (Hb), N,N′-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD), diethyl maleate (DEM), monobromobimane (BrBi), and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Differential interference contrast microscopy of live trypanosomes incubated with ApoL1, TLF-1, or hypotonic medium was performed using a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope. For survival assays, TLF-1 was added to 1 ml of cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in triplicate wells of a 6-well plate. Cells grew to mid-log phase during a 20-h incubation in the cell culture incubator. At the end point, cells were counted and graphed as a percentage of untreated cell number. DCF-DA was used to measure ROS in trypanosomes treated with H2O2 (23Dolai S. Pal S. Yadav R.K. Adak S.

The fluorescence was monitored in kinetic mode using an excitation of 485 nm (bandwidth 20 nm) and an emission of 528 nm (bandwidth 20 nm). The initial values for each sample at 0 min were set to 0 fluorescence units. For Fig. 1B, antioxidants were preincubated with the cells for 30 min at 37 °C before adding H2O2 at 0 min. For Fig. 9B, 100 μl of 2 × 107 cells/ml were added to the wells, and 100 μl of DMEM with 10% serum (isotonic) or H2O (hypotonic) was added at time 0 with or without concurrent addition of 50 μm H2O2.FIGURE 9.Oxidation induces osmotic lysis of T. brucei brucei.

Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Preparation and properties of apohemoglobin and reconstituted hemoglobins.Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). First, 4 mg of Hb was dissolved in 200 μl of deionized water. A 20-μl aliquot of Hb was reserved for control experiments, and 180 μl was added to 14 ml of acid acetone (40 mm HCl in acetone) and incubated for 10 min in the −80 °C freezer. Globin was precipitated by centrifuging for 5 min at 4 °C and 3200 × g. Acetone-heme supernatant was removed, and the globin pellet redissolved in 180 μl of deionized water, suspended in 15 ml of acid acetone, and incubated 10 min at −80 °C. Globin was repelleted and washed a second time before resuspending the pellet in 1 ml of deionized water and dialyzed three times. The first dialysis was in 0.1% NaHCO3 and 0.2 mm DTT buffer for at least 3 h at room temperature. The second dialysis was 50 mm KPi pH 7.5 buffer overnight at 4 °C. The third dialysis was 100 mm boric acid, pH 9.5, for at least 3 h at 4 °C. Globins were reconstituted with at least 4 equivalents of protoporphyrin IX (Fe3+ or Zn2+), which were mixed gradually into the globin solution. Contaminating aggregated porphyrins were pelleted by centrifuging at 4 °C. Free porphyrins were removed from the supernatant by elution by gravity through a Sephadex G-50 column. To make reconstituted reduced Fe2+-globin, sodium dithionite was placed at the top of the G50 column for reduction during purification. Globin-containing fractions were concentrated on a Centricon® filter (10-kDa cutoff), and the protein concentration was determined by a Bradford Assay. Reconstituted globins were used within 24 h of synthesis. MDA was measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay as previously reported using reagents from the Zeptometrix MDA assay kit (16Bishop J.R. Shimamura M. Hajduk S.L.

To this mixture, 175 μl of citric acid buffer at pH 4.8 containing 70 μm H2O2 was added and incubated at 37 °C in a benchtop thermomixer set to 300 rpm for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 30 μm SDS solution, and then 770 μl of thiobarbituric acid solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 95 °C. Fluorescence readings were taken on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 spectrofluorometer (excitation, 530 nm; emission, 550 nm; slit widths, 3 and 10 nm, respectively). MDA equivalents were determined from a linear MDA standard curve. Negligible fluorescence from samples with only globin and no TLF-1 were background subtracted from the TLF-1 plus globin samples. Blue native PAGE was utilized to observe reconstituted globin binding to human Hp1-1 (25Lustbader J.W. Arcoleo J.P. Birken S. Greer J. Hemoglobin-binding site on haptoglobin probed by selective proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1227-1234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonreducing native gel contained three layers: 16% polyacrylamide in the bottom layer, 10% in the middle layer (where the HpHb complex migrated), and a 4% stacking gel. Measured equivalents of globin in PBS were incubated with 5 nmol of human Hp1-1 per well (Sigma) at room temperature for 5–10 min before mixing with loading buffer before loading the gel and running at 150 V. After the solvent front had moved into the second layer of the gel, the central cathode buffer was replaced with imidazole anode buffer for better contrast. Gel was fixed with methanol (40% v/v) and acetic acid (10% v/v), stained with colloidal Coomassie dye, and destained in 8% acidic acid. Alexa 488-labeled TLF-1 (AlexaTLF) was prepared from TLF-1 using the Alexa 488 protein/antibody labeling kit (Invitrogen) and dialyzed against PBSE (21DeJesus E. Kieft R. Albright B. Stephens N.A.

For uptake assays, AlexaTLF and the indicated globin (100 equivalents) were incubated with 300 μl of 1 × 107 cells/ml for 20 min in serum-free medium at 37 °C, washed twice in ice-cold serum-free media, and analyzed by flow cytometry with a 488-nm laser and 530/30-nm BP filter on a Beckman Coulter Cyan instrument. FlowJo software was used for data analysis. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis through gating by light scatter, and the mean fluorescence of histogram peaks was calculated as previously described (21DeJesus E. Kieft R. Albright B.

https://openalex.org/W2255795650,"Elevated rates of reinfection tuberculosis in various hyperendemic regions have been reported and, in particular, it has been shown that in a high-incidence setting near Cape Town, South Africa, the rate of reinfection tuberculosis (TB) disease after cure of a previous TB disease episode is about four times greater than the rate of first-time TB disease. It is not known whether this elevated rate is caused by a high reinfection rate due, for instance, to living circumstances, or a high rate of progress to disease specific to the patients, or both. In order to address that question we analysed an extensive data set from clinics attended by TB patients in the high-incidence setting near Cape Town, South Africa and found that, in fact, the (average) rate of reinfection (as opposed to the rate of reinfection disease) after cure of a previous TB disease episode is initially about 0.85 per annum. This rate diminishes rapidly over time and after about ten years this rate is similar to the rate of infection in the general population. Also, the rate of progress to disease after reinfection is initially high but declines in subsequent years down to the figure typical for the general population. These findings suggest that the first few months after cure of a TB disease episode form a critical period for controlling reinfection disease in a hyperendemic setting and that monitoring such cured patients could pre-empt a reinfection progressing to active disease."

The tumors were located most often in the superior temporal region (in 117(21.5%) patients) and least common in the inferior region (in 31(5.7%) patients). In 548(94.2%) patients, the tumors were located in the choroid, in 33(5.7%) patients in the ciliary body, and in one (0.2%) patient in the iris. Treatment included episcleral brachytherapy (415(71.3%) patients), local tumor resection (48(8.2%) patients) and primary enucleation (119(20.4%) patients). In 53 individuals out of the 415 patients with primary brachytherapy, episcleral brachytherapy was followed by enucleation, due to an increasing tumor size or due to uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma. Median follow-up time was of 30 months (range: 1-124 months; mean: 34.8 ± 24.4 months). Overall survival rate at 5 and 10 years was of 92.7% and 85.1%.

The menstrual pattern, ovulation rate, hormonal and metabolic profiles were compared before and after the berberine treatment. Ovulation was confirmed by serum progesterone level ≥10 ng/ml.A total of 98 of 102 subjects (96.1%) completed the four month treatment, including 69 (70.4%, 69/98) normal weight and 29 (29.6%, 29/98) overweight/obese. Fourteen women (14.3%, 14/98) had regained regular menses after berberine treatment and there was no significant difference between normal weight and overweight/obese groups. The ovulation rate was 25.0% over four months in the whole group, 22.5% in the normal weight group and 31.0% in the overweight/obese group. Sex hormone binding globulin, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, total triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased after berberine treatment in the normal weight group only.Our study found that administration of berberine alone may improve the menstrual pattern and ovulation rate in anovulatory Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2194046006,"Background The precipitating role of life events in the onset of depression is well-established. The present study sought to examine whether life events hypothesised to be personally salient would be more strongly associated with depression than other life events. In a sample of women making the first transition to parenthood, we hypothesised that negative events related to the partner relationship would be particularly salient and thus more strongly predictive of depression than other events. Methods A community-based sample of 316 first-time mothers stratified by psychosocial risk completed interviews at 32 weeks gestation and 29 weeks postpartum to assess dated occurrence of life events and depression onsets from conception to 29 weeks postpartum. Complete data was available from 273 (86.4%). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine risk for onset of depression in the 6 months following a relationship event versus other events, after accounting for past history of depression and other potential confounders. Results 52 women (19.0%) experienced an onset of depression between conception and 6 months postpartum. Both relationship events (Hazard Ratio = 2.1, p = .001) and other life events (Hazard Ratio = 1.3, p = .020) were associated with increased risk for depression onset; however, relationship events showed a significantly greater risk for depression than did other life events (p = .044). Conclusions The results are consistent with the hypothesis that personally salient events are more predictive of depression onset than other events. Further, they indicate the clinical significance of events related to the partner relationship during pregnancy and the postpartum."

Objective To investigate the efficacy of the Arthrokinematic approach (AKA)-Hakata (H) method for chronic low back pain. Summary of Background Data The AKA-H method is used to manually treat abnormalities of intra-articular movement. Methods One hundred eighty-six patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain randomly received either the AKA-H method (AKA-H group) or the sham technique (S group) monthly for 6 months. Data were collected at baseline and once a month. Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale [VAS]) and quality of life (the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] and Short Form SF-36 questionnaire [SF-36]). Results At baseline, the VAS, RDQ, and SF-36 scores showed similar levels between the groups. After 6 months, the AKA-H group had more improvement in the VAS (42.8% improvement) and RDQ score (31.1% improvement) than the sham group (VAS: 10.4% improvement; RDQ: 9.8% improvement; both, P < 0.001). The respective scores for the SF-36 subscales (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, social functioning, general health perception, role emotional, and mental health) were also significantly more improved in the AKA-H group than in the sham group (all, P < 0.001). The scores for the physical, psychological, and social aspects of the SF-36 subscales showed similar improvement in the AKA-H group. Conclusion The AKA-H method can be effective in managing chronic low back pain. Trial Registration UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) UMIN000006250."
https://openalex.org/W2189974447,"The transcription factor C/EBPβ plays a key role in monocytic differentiation and inflammation. Its small isoform LIP is associated with proliferation at early premonocytic developmental stages and regulated via mTOR-dependent signalling. During later stages of (pre)monocytic differentiation there is a considerable increase in the large C/EBPβ isoforms LAP*/LAP which inhibit proliferation thus supporting terminal differentiation. Here, we showed in different models of monocytic differentiation that this dramatic increase in the LAP*/LAP protein and LAP/LIP ratio was accompanied by an only modest/retarded mRNA increase suggesting an important role for (post)translational mechanisms. We found that LAP*/LAP formation was induced via MEK/RSK-dependent cascades, whereas mTOR/S6K1 were not involved. Remarkably, LAP*/LAP expression was dependent on phosphorylated eIF4B, an acceleratory protein of RNA helicase eIF4A. PKR inhibition reduced the expression of eIF4B and C/EBPβ in an eIF2α-independent manner. Furthermore, under our conditions a marked stabilisation of LAP*/LAP protein occurred, accompanied by reduced chymotrypsin-like proteasome/calpain activities and increased calpastatin levels. Our study elucidates new signalling pathways inducing LAP*/LAP expression and indicates new alternative PKR functions in monocytes. The switch from mTOR- to RSK-mediated signalling to orchestrate eIF4B-dependent LAP*/LAP translation, accompanied by increased protein stability but only small mRNA changes, may be a prototypical example for the regulation of protein expression during selected processes of differentiation/proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2255725242,"The proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site-1 protease (S1P) is implicated in lipid homeostasis, the unfolded protein response, and lysosome biogenesis. The protease is further hijacked by highly pathogenic emerging viruses for the processing of their envelope glycoproteins. Zymogen activation of SKI-1/S1P requires removal of an N-terminal prodomain, by a multistep process, generating the mature enzyme. Here, we uncover a modular structure of the human SKI-1/S1P prodomain and define its function in folding and activation. We provide evidence that the N-terminal AB fragment of the prodomain represents an autonomous structural and functional unit that is necessary and sufficient for folding and partial activation. In contrast, the C-terminal BC fragment lacks a defined structure but is crucial for autoprocessing and full catalytic activity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequence of the AB domain is highly conserved, whereas the BC fragment shows considerable variation and seems even absent in some species. Notably, SKI-1/S1P of arthropods, like the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, contains a shorter prodomain comprised of full-length AB and truncated BC regions. Swapping the prodomain fragments between fly and human resulted in a fully mature and active SKI-1/S1P chimera. Our study suggests that primordial SKI-1/S1P likely contained a simpler prodomain consisting of the highly conserved AB fragment that represents an independent folding unit. The BC region appears as a later evolutionary acquisition, possibly allowing more subtle fine-tuning of the maturation process."
https://openalex.org/W2193483785,"The transition from childhood to teenaged years is associated with increased testosterone and a decreased iron status. It is not clear whether higher testosterone levels cause the decreased iron status, and to what extent, obesity-related inflammation influences the iron-testosterone relationship. The aim of the present study was to examine relationships of testosterone, iron status, and anti-/proinflammatory cytokines in relation to nutritional status in boys and young adolescent Taiwanese males.In total, 137 boys aged 7~13 yr were included. Parameters for obesity, the iron status, testosterone, and inflammatory markers were evaluated.Overweight and obese (ow/obese) boys had higher mean serum testosterone, interleukin (IL)-1β, and nitric oxide (NO) levels compared to their normal-weight counterparts (all p<0.05). Mean serum ferritin was slightly higher in ow/obese boys compared to normal-weight boys, but this did not reach statistical significance. A multiple linear regression showed that serum ferritin (β = -0.7470, p = 0.003) was inversely correlated with testosterone, while serum IL-10 (β = 0.3475, p = 0.009) was positively associated with testosterone after adjusting for covariates. When normal-weight boys were separately assessed from ow/obesity boys, the association between testosterone and serum ferritin became stronger (β = -0.9628, p<0.0001), but the association between testosterone and IL-10 became non-significant (β = 0.1140, p = 0.4065) after adjusting for covariates. In ow/obese boys, only IL-10 was weakly associated with serum testosterone (β = 0.6444, p = 0.051) after adjusting for age.Testosterone and serum ferritin are intrinsically interrelated but this relationship is weaker in ow/obese boys after adjusting for age."

The function of 4.1G remains largely unexplored. Here, using 4.1G knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as a model system, we explored the function of 4.1G in motile cells. We show that the adhesion, spreading, and migration of 4.1G−/− MEF cells are impaired significantly. We further show that, although the total cellular expression of β1 integrin is unchanged, the surface expression of β1 integrin and its active form are decreased significantly in 4.1G−/− MEF cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a downstream component of the integrin-mediated signal transduction pathway, is suppressed in 4.1G−/− MEF cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro binding assays showed that 4.1G binds directly to β1 integrin via its membrane-binding domain. These findings identified a novel role of 4.1G in cell adhesion, spreading, and migration in MEF cells by modulating the surface expression of β1 integrin and subsequent downstream signal transduction."

To further test its translational potential, this study was designed to determine whether isoflurane post-treatment induced neuroprotection in rabbits after embolic stroke. White male New Zealand rabbits received intra-carotid injection of clots when they were awake. Some rabbits were exposed to 2.5% isoflurane for 1 h at 5 min after the injection. Isoflurane post-treatment increased the tolerance of rabbits to the amount of clots. Isoflurane post-treatment also reduced brain infarct volumes and plasma S100B 3 days after the injection of 5 mg clots and improved neurological deficit scores after the stroke. Isoflurane post-treatment improves neurological outcome in rabbits after embolic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2258828710,"Mammalian E3 is an essential mitochondrial enzyme responsible for catalyzing the terminal reaction in the oxidative catabolism of several metabolites. E3 is a key regulator of metabolic fuel selection as a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc). E3 regulates PDHc activity by altering the affinity of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, an inhibitor of the enzyme complex, through changes in reduction and acetylation state of lipoamide moieties set by the NAD(+)/NADH ratio. Thus, an accurate kinetic model of E3 is needed to predict overall mammalian PDHc activity. Here, we have combined numerous literature data sets and new equilibrium spectroscopic experiments with a multitude of independently collected forward and reverse steady-state kinetic assays using pig heart E3. The latter kinetic assays demonstrate a pH-dependent transition of NAD(+) activation to inhibition, shown here, to our knowledge, for the first time in a single consistent data set. Experimental data were analyzed to yield a thermodynamically constrained four-redox-state model of E3 that simulates pH-dependent activation/inhibition and active site redox states for various conditions. The developed model was used to determine substrate/product conditions that give maximal E3 rates and show that, due to non-Michaelis-Menten behavior, the maximal flux is different compared with the classically defined kcat."
https://openalex.org/W2191420335,"Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that arise due to conformational change of normal, cellular prion protein (PrPC) to protease-resistant isofrom (rPrPSc). Deposition of misfolded PrpSc proteins leads to an alteration of many signaling pathways that includes immunological and apoptotic pathways. As a result, this culminates in the dysfunction and death of neuronal cells. Earlier works on transcriptomic studies have revealed some affected pathways, but it is not clear which is (are) the prime network pathway(s) that change during the disease progression and how these pathways are involved in crosstalks with each other from the time of incubation to clinical death. We perform network analysis on large-scale transcriptomic data of differentially expressed genes obtained from whole brain in six different mouse strain-prion strain combination models to determine the pathways involved in prion diseases, and to understand the role of crosstalks in disease propagation. We employ a notion of differential network centrality measures on protein interaction networks to identify the potential biological pathways involved. We also propose a crosstalk ranking method based on dynamic protein interaction networks to identify the core network elements involved in crosstalk with different pathways. We identify 148 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) potentially related to the prion disease progression. Functional association of the identified genes implicates a strong involvement of immunological pathways. We extract a bow-tie structure that is potentially dysregulated in prion disease. We also propose an ODE model for the bow-tie network. Predictions related to diseased condition suggests the downregulation of the core signaling elements (PI3Ks and AKTs) of the bow-tie network. In this work, we show using transcriptomic data that the neuronal dysfunction in prion disease is strongly related to the immunological pathways. We conclude that these immunological pathways occupy influential positions in the PFNs (protein functional networks) that are related to prion disease. Importantly, this functional network involvement is prevalent in all the five different mouse strain-prion strain combinations that we studied. We also conclude that the dysregulation of the core elements of the bow-tie structure, which belongs to PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, leads to dysregulation of the downstream components corresponding to other biological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2194395482,"Short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPLUNC1) protein is expressed in human nasopharyngeal and respiratory epithelium and has demonstrated antimicrobial activity. SPLUNC1 is now referred to as bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family A, member 1 (BPIFA1). Reduced BPIFA1 expression is associated with bacterial colonization in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Interleukin 13 (IL-13), predominately secreted by T helper 2 (TH2) cells, has been found to contribute to airway allergies and suppress BPIFA1 expression in nasal epithelial cells. However, the molecular mechanism of IL-13 perturbation of bacterial infection and BPIFA1 expression in host airways remains unclear. In this study, we found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BPIFA1 expression in nasal epithelial cells was mediated through the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway and AP-1 activation. We further demonstrated that IL-13 downregulated the LPS-induced activation of phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun, followed by attenuation of BPIFA1 expression. Moreover, the immunohistochemical analysis showed that IL-13 prominently suppressed BPIFA1 expression in eosinophilic CRSwNP patients with bacterial infection. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-13 plays a critical role in attenuation of bacteria-induced BPIFA1 expression that may result in eosinophilic CRSwNP."
https://openalex.org/W786848305,"We discover and examine within a wide phylogenetic perspective spatial neophobia, avoidance of untrodden terrain, in fruit flies, in an experimental setup that reduces the gap between the field and the laboratory. In our setup, fruit flies use a natal fruit as their origin, freely exploring for days their surroundings, which consists of a mixture of trodden and untrodden terrain. The interface between trodden and untrodden is, however, reduced in our setup to a wide doorway, opened within a surrounding wall. Crossing this doorway, characterized by a sharp contrast interface between trodden and untrodden, generates a behavior whose dynamics betrays the flies' space neophobia. The moment-by-moment dynamics of crossing is remarkably similar to that reported in mouse models of anxiety. This means that neophobic behavior is either homologous across arthropods and vertebrates or, not less interesting, convergent, whereby the same behavior is mediated in the two phyla by two completely different schemata."
https://openalex.org/W2267949278,"Prognosis remains extremely poor for malignant glioma. Targeted therapeutic approaches, including single agent anti-angiogenic and proteasome inhibition strategies, have not resulted in sustained anti-glioma clinical efficacy. We tested the anti-glioma efficacy of the anti-angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor cediranib and the novel proteasome inhibitor SC68896, in combination and as single agents. To assess anti-angiogenic effects and evaluate efficacy we employed 4C8 intracranial mouse glioma and a dual-bolus perfusion MRI approach to measure Ktrans, relative cerebral blood flow and volume (rCBF, rCBV), and relative mean transit time (rMTT) in combination with anatomical MRI measurements of tumor growth. While single agent cediranib or SC68896 treatment did not alter tumor growth or survival, combined cediranib/SC68896 significantly delayed tumor growth and increased median survival by 2-fold, compared to untreated. This was accompanied by substantially increased tumor necrosis in the cediranib/SC68896 group (p<0.01), not observed with single agent treatments. Mean vessel density was significantly lower, and mean vessel lumen area was significantly higher, for the combined cediranib/SC68896 group versus untreated. Consistent with our previous findings, cediranib alone did not significantly alter mean tumor rCBF, rCBV, rMTT, or Ktrans. In contrast, SC68896 reduced rCBF in comparison to untreated, but without concomitant reductions in rCBV, rMTT, or Ktrans. Importantly, combined cediranib/SC68896 substantially reduced rCBF, rCBV. rMTT, and Ktrans. A novel analysis of Ktrans/rCBV suggests that changes in Ktrans with time and/or treatment are related to altered total vascular surface area. The data suggest that combined cediranib/SC68896 induced potent anti-angiogenic effects, resulting in increased vascular efficiency and reduced extravasation, consistent with a process of vascular normalization. The study represents the first demonstration that the combination of cediranib with a proteasome inhibitor substantially increases the anti-angiogenic efficacy produced from either agent alone, and synergistically slows glioma tumor growth and extends survival, suggesting a promising treatment which warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2190281563,"We tested whether stereotypical situations would affect low-status group members' performance more strongly than high-status group members'. Experiment 1 and 2 tested this hypothesis using gender as a proxy of chronic social status and a gender-neutral task that has been randomly presented to favor boys (men superiority condition), favor girls (women superiority condition), or show no gender preference (control condition). Both experiments found that women’s (Experiment 1) and girls’ performance (Experiment 2) suffered more from the evoked stereotypes than did men's and boys’ ones. This result was replicated in Experiment 3, indicating that short men (low-status group) were more affected compared to tall men (high-status group). Additionally, men were more affected compared to women when they perceived height as a threat. Hence, individuals are more or less vulnerable to identity threats as a function of the chronic social status at play; enjoying a high status provides protection and endorsing a low one weakens individual performance in stereotypical situations."
https://openalex.org/W2194853995,"Thrombocytopenia and increased platelet clearance observed in von Willebrand disease-type 2B (VWD-2B) may be explained by platelet apoptosis triggered by the constitutive binding of VWF to its receptor, glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). Apoptosis was assessed in platelets from two patients with a severe VWD-2B mutation VWF/p.V1316M and from mice transiently expressing VWF/p.V1316M. We now report that the VWD-2B mutation VWF/p.V1316M which binds spontaneously to its receptor GPIbα does not induce apoptosis. In 2 unrelated patients (P1 and P2) exhibiting different VWF plasma levels (70% and 36%, respectively, compared with normal pooled human plasma given as 100%), inner transmembrane depolarization of mitochondria, characteristic of apoptotic events was undetectable in platelets, whether washed or in whole blood. No or a moderate phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure as measured by annexin-V staining was observed for P1 and P2, respectively. Expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, and caspase-3 activity were similar to control platelets. In the VWD-2B mouse model expressing high levels of mVWF/p.V1316M (423%), similar to what is found in inflammatory pathologies, no significant difference was observed between mice expressing mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.V1316M. These results strongly argue against apoptosis as a mechanism for the thrombocytopenia of severe VWD-2B exhibiting the VWF/p.V1316M mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2190418605,"This study investigated whether the effect of labeling on people's evaluation of aggression varies according to the group category of the evaluators (i.e., whether they are ingroup members or third parties). Two labeling strategies--the negative labeling of victims (NL strategy) and the positive labeling of aggressors (PL strategy)--were adopted. We conducted an experiment using the hot sauce paradigm, as a way to assess aggressive intent that includes behavioral measures of evaluations. The results suggested that the NL strategy causes ingroup members to evaluate aggression in a more positive light, while the PL strategy has the same effect but on third parties instead. Thus, labeling strategies may increase the severity of aggressors' reaction and could also be a factor that can escalate a war or conflict."
