This effect is independent of insulin, glucagon, or epinephrine. Prolonged fasting is accompanied by a rise in the hormone level in plasma. Measurement of this hormone after induced hypoglycemia is a specific test for pituitary somatotropic function."

https://openalex.org/W2082862442,"l-Arginine labeled with carbon-14 at the guanido group was injected into rabbits, and the ratio of the rates of entry of radioactivity into the protein and urea was determined. This ratio, multiplied by the rate of arginine utilization in urea synthesis and by the ratio of protein to protein arginine weights, gives the rate of protein synthesis. The method applies to albumin and should apply to any plasma protein synthesized in those liver cells which also synthesize urea."

Troughs of different depths were cut into these multilayers (substrata), and additional monolayers were superimposed. When cultured and fresh embryonic cells were grown on these substrata, the cells were entrapped within troughs whose depths were as small as 60 angstroms. The results demonstrate cellular responses to molecular changes in contact surfaces."

The enzyme contains bound flavin and nonheme iron in the ratio of 1: 2. The minimal molecular weight, calculated from the flavin content, is 100,000 which is in general agreement with a value of 80,000 to 90,000 obtained by sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge.’ The activity of the enzyme with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as an electron acceptor is 40 pmoles of DPNH oxidized per minute per mg of protein. With ferricyanide and cytochrome c as acceptors, the DPNH oxidizing activities are 40 and 3, respectively, in the same units. Although this enzyme is similar to other DPNH dehydrogenases described previously (5-ll), it is difficult to compare the properties (molecular weight, pH optimum, turnover number, specificity for electron acceptors, etc.) of these various enzymes since, even when prepared from the same tissue, different methods of solubilization have been used. One of the principal discrepancies between the various DPNH dehydrogenases is the nature of the flavin component. It has been reported that only FAD is found in a soluble DPNH dehydrogenase obtained by treatment of beef heart electron transport particle with Naja nuja venom (7, 9), and FAD has also been identified in a lipoflavoprotein DPNH dehydrogenase from beef heart (12). Earlier, Mahler et al. (5) had reported that the prosthetic group of the soluble DPNH-cytochrome c reductase from pig heart is a flavin dinucleotide not identical with FAD. On the other hand, we have reported in preliminary communications (1, 2) that FMN2 is the flavin component of the soluble DPNH dehydrogenase prepared from DPNH osidase, and King3 has reached"

Preceding the loss of wings, however, there is a rapid decline in the activity of an α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase which is located in the extramitochondrial fraction and is dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W2005753395,"PREPARATIONS of soluble proteins from brain and spinal cord which were used for the production of ‘allergic’ encephalomyelitis in experimental animals have been described1–4. Roboz et al.5 reported a soluble, collagen-like protein apparently of different nature. Others6–10 have reported on the association of encephalitogenic properties with proteolipids. Although its chemical pathogenesis is unknown, the disease is almost generally accepted to be an immunological reaction and we therefore prefer to describe chemical fractions obtainable from nervous tissue as ‘encephalomyelitis-promoting’ (EP) rather than ‘encephalitogenic’."

https://openalex.org/W1974647931,"WE have already shown that the metabolites (glucose, citrate, β-hydroxybutyrate), the final function of which is the production of energy in the ∼ P form1,2, give place to release of insulin in vitro when they are added to the incubation buffer surrounding slices of pancreas. For this reason, we considered it interesting to determine if ATP when added to the incubation buffer produces any effect on the release of insulin, although what is generally accepted is that the metabolic processes in which this nucleotide takes part are intracellular."

https://openalex.org/W1970955512,The substitution method may lead to poorer learning than the customary repetition method when learned pairs are eliminated after each trial. This results from a procedure in which the subject is required to spell the response. Spelling leads to greater difficulty in learning the response item but repetition tends to counteract it.

https://openalex.org/W106771481,SEVERAL authors1–3 have shown that the minor anodic fraction of hæmoglobin obtained by electrophoresis at pH 8.6 is part of the hæmoglobin modified during the ageing of the red cells. Proof is submitted here that the modification of the electrical charge of hæmoglobin A3 ( ) is due only to the modification of the β-chain. This is proved by comparison of the electrophoretic migration of the hybrids obtained between canine hæmoglobin HbCAN and HbA and between HbCAN and .

https://openalex.org/W2022181455,"IT is clear that subjects take longer to differentiate between two stimuli if they are closely similar than if they are widely separated along some continuum of difference1,2. Conditions such as poor contrast or dim illumination which tend to obscure differences between complex stimuli may be expected to have the same effect. Recent models for discrimination and recognition2,3 entail the assumption of some interaction between a factor of discriminability and the number of items to be differentiated. While data on reading-speed for various English vocabulary-sizes under dim illumination4 may be taken as support for this, a situation in which subjects make responses to complex stimuli presented one at a time has not been manipulated to demonstrate directly such an interaction. The two experiments summarized here show such interactions between size of stimuli, illumination-level, and the number of items between which discriminations are made."

Antibody titers were correlated with relative changes in gamma-beta globulin levels determined electrophoretically. Irradiated, immunized rabbits did not form detectable antibodies but had significantly greater globulin levels than non-immunized, irradiated controls. This relative difference occurred at the time nonirradiated, immunized rabbits were producing primary antibody."

https://openalex.org/W2042925305,"STUBBE1 was the first to observe an increase in the mutational frequency in Antirrhinum by subjecting chemically treated seeds and seedlings to centrifugation. Irrespective of the chemical used, he always found approximately the same increase in mutation rate over the non-centrifuged controls. Additional evidence in plant material was obtained by Kostoff2–4, who found that mechanical stress applied in the form of ‘pseudogravity’ created by centrifugation resulted in the appearance of chromosomal fragments and other structural changes. Contrary to these findings, Sax5, working on Tradescantia, observed an increased frequency of chromosomes and chromatid interchanges only when centrifugation was applied during X-radiation."
