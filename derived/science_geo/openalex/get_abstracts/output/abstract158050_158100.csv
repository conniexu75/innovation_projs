https://openalex.org/W2061995199,"Aggregated α-synuclein proteins form brain lesions that are hallmarks of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, and oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some of these disorders. Using antibodies to specific nitrated tyrosine residues in α-synuclein, we demonstrate extensive and widespread accumulations of nitrated α-synuclein in the signature inclusions of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease, and multiple system atrophy brains. We also show that nitrated α-synuclein is present in the major filamentous building blocks of these inclusions, as well as in the insoluble fractions of affected brain regions of synucleinopathies. The selective and specific nitration of α-synuclein in these disorders provides evidence to directly link oxidative and nitrative damage to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2040438092,"Current understanding of the higher order systematics of eukaryotes relies largely on analyses of the small ribosomal subunit RNA (SSU rRNA). Independent testing of these results is still limited. We have combined the sequences of four of the most broadly taxonomically sampled proteins available to create a roughly parallel data set to that of SSU rRNA. The resulting phylogenetic tree shows a number of striking differences from SSU rRNA phylogeny, including strong support for most major groups and several major supergroups."
https://openalex.org/W2035768602,"To assess the role of BAX in drug-induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells, we generated cells that lack functional BAX genes. Such cells were partially resistant to the apoptotic effects of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil, but apoptosis was not abolished. In contrast, the absence of BAX completely abolished the apoptotic response to the chemopreventive agent sulindac and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs inhibited the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL, resulting in an altered ratio of BAX to Bcl-XL and subsequent mitochondria-mediated cell death. These results establish an unambiguous role for BAX in apoptotic processes in human epithelial cancers and may have implications for cancer chemoprevention strategies."

In addition, several Virulence proteins must somehow be transported to fulfill a function in planta. Here, we used fusions between Cre recombinase and VirE2 or VirF to directly demonstrate protein translocation into plant cells. Transport of the proteins was monitored by a Cre-mediated in planta recombination event resulting in a selectable phenotype and depended on the VirB/D4 transport system but did not require transferred DNA."

By applying a matrix model to long-term population data, we found that (i) dam passage improvements have dramatically mitigated direct mortality associated with dams; (ii) even if main stem survival were elevated to 100%, Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) would probably continue to decline toward extinction; and (iii) modest reductions in first-year mortality or estuarine mortality would reverse current population declines."
https://openalex.org/W2086345249,"Establishment and maintenance of an intracellular niche are critical to the success of an intracellular pathogen. Here, the pore-forming protein listeriolysin O (LLO), secreted by Listeria monocytogenes, was shown to contain a PEST-like sequence (P, Pro; E, Glu; S, Ser; T, Thr) that is essential for the virulence and intracellular compartmentalization of this pathogen. Mutants lacking the PEST-like sequence entered the host cytosol but subsequently permeabilized and killed the host cell. LLO lacking the PEST-like sequence accumulated in the host-cell cytosol, suggesting that this sequence targets LLO for degradation. Transfer of the sequence to perfringolysin O transformed this toxic cytolysin into a nontoxic derivative that facilitated intracellular growth."
https://openalex.org/W2115218015,"We report on the discovery of two emission features observed in the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) of 16 December 1999 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. These features are identified with the Ly α line and the narrow recombination continuum by hydrogenic ions of iron at a redshift z = 1.00 ± 0.02, providing an unambiguous measurement of the distance of a GRB. Line width and intensity imply that the progenitor of the GRB was a massive star system that ejected, before the GRB event, a quantity of iron ∼0.01 of the mass of the sun at a velocity ∼0.1 of the speed of light, probably by a supernova explosion."
https://openalex.org/W2047411640,"A full quantum dynamical study of the reactions of a hydrogen atom with water, on an accurate ab initio potential energy surface, is reported. The theoretical results are compared with available experimental data for the exchange and abstraction reactions in H + D2O and H + H2O. Clear agreement between theory and experiment is revealed for available thermal rate coefficients and the effects of vibrational excitation of the reactants. The excellent agreement between experiment and theory on integral cross sections for the exchange reaction is unprecedented beyond atom-diatom reactions. However, the experimental cross sections for abstraction are larger than the theoretical values by more than a factor of 10. Further experiments are required to resolve this."
https://openalex.org/W2061410615,"Methyl halide gases are important sources of atmospheric inorganic halogen compounds, which in turn are central reactants in many stratospheric and tropospheric chemical processes. By observing emissions of methyl chloride, methyl bromide, and methyl iodide from flooded California rice fields, we estimate the impact of rice agriculture on the atmospheric budgets of these gases. Factors influencing methyl halide emissions are stage of rice growth, soil organic content, halide concentrations, and field-water management. Extrapolating our data implies that about 1 percent of atmospheric methyl bromide and 5 percent of methyl iodide arise from rice fields worldwide. Unplanted flooded fields emit as much methyl chloride as planted, flooded rice fields."
https://openalex.org/W2020648423,"The SpoIIIE protein of Bacillus subtilis is required for chromosome segregation during spore formation. The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic part of SpoIIIE was shown to be a DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) capable of tracking along DNA in the presence of ATP, and the NH(2)-terminal part of the protein was found to mediate its localization to the division septum. Thus, during sporulation, SpoIIIE appears to act as a DNA pump that actively moves one of the replicated pair of chromosomes into the prespore. The presence of SpoIIIE homologs in a broad range of bacteria suggests that this mechanism for active transport of DNA may be widespread."
https://openalex.org/W2139287985,"We have isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel human serine threonine protein kinase gene. The deduced protein sequence contains two cysteine-rich motifs at the N terminus, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain containing all the characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases. It exhibits the strongest homology to the serine threonine protein kinases PKD/PKCμ and PKCν, particularly in the duplex zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motif, in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the protein kinase domain. In contrast, it shows only a low degree of sequence similarity to other members of the PKC family. Therefore, the new protein has been termed protein kinase D2 (PKD2). The mRNA of PKD2 is widely expressed in human and murine tissues. It encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 105 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is expressed in various human cell lines, including HL60 cells, which do not express PKCμ. In vivo phorbol ester binding studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to PKD2. The addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in the presence of dioleoylphosphatidylserine stimulated the autophosphorylation of PKD2 in a synergistic fashion. Phorbol esters also stimulated autophosphorylation of PKD2 in intact cells. PKD2 activated by phorbol esters efficiently phosphorylated the exogenous substrate histone H1. In addition, we could identify the C-terminal Ser876 residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within PKD2. Phosphorylation of Ser876 of PKD2 correlated with the activation status of the kinase. Finally, gastrin was found to be a physiological activator of PKD2 in human AGS-B cells stably transfected with the CCKB/gastrin receptor.

Molecular cloning has demonstrated the presence of multiple related PKC isoforms, i.e. classical PKCs (cPKCs: α, β1, β2, and γ), novel PKCs (nPKCs: δ, ε, η, and θ), and atypical PKCs (aPKCs: ζ and λ), all of which possess a highly conserved catalytic domain. The regulatory domain of both classical and novel PKCs has a tandem repeat of zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motifs that confers phospholipid-dependent phorbol ester and DAG binding to these PKC isoforms. In contrast, atypical PKCs contain a single cysteine-rich motif, do not bind phorbol esters, and are not regulated by DAG. Another phorbol ester and DAG-stimulated protein kinase containing a duplex cysteine-rich zinc-finger-like motif has been cloned from a murine cDNA library and termed protein kinase D (PKD) (1Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc..Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Its human isotype, termed PKCμ (2Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was initially regarded as a member of the aPKC subfamily (2Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, examination of the catalytic domain of PKD/PKCμ revealed that the kinase subdomains show little similarity to the highly conserved regions of the kinase subdomains of the PKC family but are related to the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-like protein kinases. Furthermore, both the substrate specificity of PKD/PKCμ (1Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc..Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) are unlike those of the PKC family. In addition, these proteins contain a pleckstrin homology domain located between the duplex zinc-finger like motif and the kinase domain but lack sequences with homology to a typical PKC pseudosubstrate motif upstream of the cysteine-rich region. Interestingly, PKD is itself regulated by novel PKCη and PKCε (5Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar,6Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, these kinases are more distantly related to the PKC family and may constitute a distinct family of serine threonine kinases (7Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,8Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Recently, the sequence of a third member of this group has been reported, which has been termed PKCν (9Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning of a novel protein kinase termed PKD2. The PKD2 mRNA is widely expressed and encodes an 878-amino acid protein that is most highly related to human PKCμ (69% identity). It contains a duplex zinc-finger-like motif, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain exhibiting all the characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases. The catalytic domain exhibits the highest similarity to PKD/PKCμ (92% identity). The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 105 kDa in SDS-PAGE. PKD2 serves as a novel receptor for PDBu in eukaryotic cells and is activated in vitro by phorbol esters in a PS-dependent manner. In addition, PDBu stimulated the autokinase activity of PKD2. Moreover, activated PKD2 efficiently phosphorylated histone H1 in vitro. We identified the C-terminal Ser876 residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within active PKD2. Phosphorylation of Ser876 correlated well with the activation status of the kinase. Finally, gastrin was found to be a potent physiological activator of PKD2 in human AGS-B cells stably transfected with the CCKB receptor. Thus, PKD2 is a novel phorbol ester- and growth factor-activated protein kinase and therefore a novel component in the signal transduction pathways induced by phorbol esters and the CCKB/gastrin receptor. [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; 37 GBq = 1 mCi) and [3H]PDBu (18.6 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The polyclonal anti-PKCμ antibodies directed against the C or the N terminus of PKCμ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (antibodies D-20 and N-20, respectively). All other reagents were from standard suppliers as indicated in the text. Stock cultures of HEK293, HL60, and AGS-B cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. AGS-B cells are AGS human gastric cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection) stably transfected with the expression construct CCKB-pcDNAI-neo comprising the full-length coding region of the human CCKB/gastrin receptor and the neomycin resistance gene as described previously (10Höcker M. Henihan R.J. Rosewicz S. Riecken E.-O. Zhang Z. Koh T.J. Wang T.C.J. Biol..Chem. 1997; 272: 27015-27024Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from anonymous pathological specimens by collagenase digestion with the use of established techniques as previously described (11Kroll J. Waltenberger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A 1.672-kb EST clone (Xs220) was used for 5′-RACE using a 5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (version 2.0, Life Technologies Inc.). Several rounds of RACE yielded overlapping clones resulting in a 5′-extension of the Xs220 clone by 805 bp. We did not achieve any further 5′-extension using RACE. Therefore, a human pancreatic ductal library was used for hybridization with the composite clone resulting from Xs220 and the sequence obtained in the 5′-extensions. One of the clones obtained in this screen yielded a 3583-bp cDNA with a putative initiation codon at position 724. To generate a FLAG-PKD2 construct the ATG in full-length PKD2 was destroyed by PCR. Using degenerate (underlined) primers (sense: 5′-gcgaattcgccaccgccccctctt-3′, antisense: 5′-ggccctggcgcactaggccgaaga-3′), a 450-bp fragment was generated. This fragment was cloned together with the remaining PKD2 cDNA in-frame into the FLAG-pcDNA3 vector. A single point mutation at the Ser876 residue was generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique. Briefly, a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing mutant nucleotides (underlined) encoding a serine to alanine substitution at the 876 site was obtained using the following oligonucleotides: forward primer, 5′-gggctggcggagcgcatcgctgtt-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ccagtttgggcaggaagccacttt-3′. The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with Bam HI/Bss HII and used to replace the original pcDNA3-FLAG-PKD2Bam HI/Bss HII fragment. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. Exponentially growing HEK293 cells (5 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) were transfected with either pcDNA3-FLAG, pcDNA3-FLAG-PKD2, or pcDNA3-FLAG-PKD2-S876A using Fugene as described in detail by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, 0.5 μg of DNA was used for each 35-mm dish. Fugene was diluted with 100 μl of DMEM and, after 5 min, added to the DNA. After another 15 min of incubation with gentle mixing, the DNA·Fugene complex in DMEM was added to HEK293 cells in DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were used for experimental purposes 48 h later. Northern blot analysis was performed using a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 737-bpEco RI/Bst Z17I PKD2 cDNA fragment corresponding to bases 1–740 of human PKD2 according to standard procedures. RNA from several primary human tissues was analyzed with commercially available poly(A)+-RNA blots (CLONTECH). cDNA synthesis for PCR analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using RNA prepared from the murine T-lymphocyte cell line EL4, which was obtained from the ATCC. RT-PCR was performed using the sense primer 5′-ctgccctgcacggctgaaga-3′ corresponding to bases 643–662 and the reverse primer 5′-cagggaagatctggtagaca-3′ corresponding to bases 1641–1660 of human PKD2. The RT-PCR yielded a 1.023-kb fragment encoding the second cysteine-rich domain and the PH domain of murine PKD2. This fragment shared 885 identical bases with human PKD2 (87% identity). Embryos were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C and were subsequently prepared for cryostat sectioning. 10-μm sections were mounted on slides. The 1.023-kb murine PKD2 fragment was used to prepare sense and antisense riboprobes. RNA probes for each cDNA strand were generated by in vitro transcription using the Sp6/T7 in vitro transcription kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [35S]rUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as radioactive label. Labeled RNA (80,000 cpm/μl) was added to the hybridization mix consisting of 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml Escherichia coli RNA. Hybridization was performed overnight at 54 °C. The slides were washed at the same temperature in hybridization salt solution. After RNase A digestion, washing was continued in 0.2× and 0.1× SSC, and the slides were dehydrated at increasing ethanol concentrations and dried for autoradiography. The slides were coated with Ilford K5 emulsion and exposed for 14–28 days in the dark. After development, the slides were counterstained with Giemsa and photographed with bright and dark field illumination. In vitro transcription and translation were performed using the TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp.). T7 RNA polymerase was used for transcription of PKD2 from the T7 promoter in pcDNA3, obtaining a sense transcript of PKD2. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and further developed by autoradiography. For determination of [3H]PDBu binding to intact HEK293 cells, cultures of HEK293 cells transfected with either pcDNA3-FLAG or pcDNA3-FLAG-PKD2 were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with binding medium (DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 nm [3H]PDBu) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cultures were then rapidly washed at 4 °C with PBS and lysed, and bound radioactivity was determined using a Beckman β-scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm PDBu. The synthetic peptide GLPTDRDLGGACPPQD corresponding to amino acids 849–864 of PKD2 and the synthetic phosphopeptide AERISpVL corresponding to amino acids 872–878 of human PKD2, respectively, were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and antisera were prepared in rabbits. The polyclonal PKD2 antibody directed against amino acids 849–864 of human PKD2 was subsequently subjected to affinity purification. For detection of PKD2 protein, membranes were blocked using 3% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG mAb (1:440 = 5 μg/ml, Sigma), polyclonal PKD2 antibody (1:200), or polyclonal pSer876 antibody (1:2000) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat dry milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (for the anti-FLAG antibody) or anti-rabbit IgG (for the anti-PKD2 or pSer876 antibodies) and subsequent ECL. For immunoprecipitations, HEK293 cells on 35-mm dishes transfected with various plasmids as described in the figure legends were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in a solution containing 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.7 μg/ml), 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer I). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with the PKD2 antiserum (1:100 dilution), the pSer876 PKD2 antiserum (1:200), or with the monoclonal FLAG antibody precoupled to Sepharose (Sigma) in the absence or presence of the immunizing peptide (2 μg/μl antiserum). The immune complexes were recovered using protein A-Sepharose where appropriate. For the immunoprecipitations of endogenous PKD2 we used 1 mg of protein/condition. Immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above and washed once with lysis buffer I and twice with lysis buffer II (lysis buffer I without Triton X-100). PKD was then eluted at 4 °C for 30 min by batchwise incubation of the immunoprecipitates with 0.5 mg/ml immunizing peptide in lysis buffer II (elution buffer; 4 volumes of elution buffer/1 volume of protein A-Sepharose). For experiments investigating the effect of PS and PDB on in vitro kinase activity, PKD2 was eluted from the immunocomplexes as described in the preceding section and 20 μl of the eluate was mixed with 20 μl of phosphorylation mix containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 400–600 cpm/pmol), 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 250 nm PDBu and/or 100 μg/ml PS. The mixture was subsequently incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal amount of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5 m EDTA pH 8.0, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine autokinase activity and histone or aldolase phosphorylation, PKD2 was not eluted. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer I, twice with lysis buffer II, and twice with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml histone H1 or 0.5 mg/ml aldolase and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, terminated by adding an equal amount of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We screened human EST data bases using degenerate oligonucleotide sequences based on the amino acid sequence conserved in the C terminus of serine kinases. A clone was identified that contained a novel human sequence. This EST clone contained 1661 bp of coding region and 11 bp of 3′-untranslated region. Using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to isolate overlapping 5′-fragments of this novel cDNA, the EST clone could be extended by a further 805 bp. The composite clone was then used to screen a human ductal pancreatic library. A cDNA clone was isolated that encoded a new member of the serine threonine protein kinase family. The open reading frame of the clone encompasses 2634 nucleotides. Downstream of the first in-frame ATG, a purine (G) is located at position +4. This is in accordance with the Kozak predictions for an initiation codon (12Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Upstream of this first ATG the 5′-untranslated sequence contains three in-frame stop codons (data not shown). 2The PKD2 nucleotide sequence has been submitted to GenBank™ under accession number AF309082. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that this kinase is a protein of 878 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 97 kDa (Fig.1 A). Data base search revealed that the kinase has the highest homology to PKD/PKCμ and PKCν sharing 69 and 64% identical amino acids with PKD/PKCμ and PKCν, respectively (Fig. 1 B and TableI). Therefore, we designated the novel protein PKD2 for protein kinase D2. Hydropathy analysis revealed a hydrophobic area at the N terminus of PKD2, which could correspond to a potential transmembrane region. Located downstream from amino acid 138, PKD2 contains two characteristic cysteine-rich motifs (His-X 12-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 10–14-Cys-X 4-His-X 2-Cys-X 7-Cys), which form a complex with the heavy metal ions zinc and cadmium (13Block C. Freyermuth S. Beyersmann D. Malviya A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19824-19828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are responsible for phorbol ester binding (14Osada S. Mizuno K.

These duplex zinc-finger-like repeats are also found in all members of the PKC family except PKCζ and PKCλ/ι, in which only a single domain has been identified. At the level of the amino acids, the first zinc-finger-like motif of PKD2 shows 92 and 84% identity, and the second zinc-finger 88 and 88% identity to the corresponding domains in PKD/PKCμ and PKCν, respectively.Table IThe percentage of amino acid identity between human PKD2 and the other PKD family members, PKD/PKCμ (mouse/human), and human PKCνPKCPKD2ORF1-aORF, open reading frame; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; KD, kinase domain.CRD1CRD2PHKD%PKD6992886592PKCμ6992886592PKCν6484885891PKCβ19343027Identity calculations were performed using the Align PPC/MacMolly Tetra program.1-a ORF, open reading frame; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; KD, kinase domain.

In contrast, we found no homology to the second conserved domain (C2) common to all classical PKCs, the activation of which is Ca2+-dependent. Interestingly, the two cysteine-rich domains in PKD2 are separated by 76 amino acids. This is in contrast to a 15- and a 22-amino acid spacer in cPKCs and nPKCs but similar to the 95-amino acid spacer in PKD (7Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The tandemly repeated cysteine-rich domains are followed by a region of ∼113 amino acids that exhibits the characteristics of a PH domain, which is also found in PKD/PKCμ and PKCν (2Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) but cannot be detected in other PKCs. PKD2 shares 65 and 58% of the amino acids in this domain with PKD/PKCμ and PKCν, respectively (Fig. 1 B and TableI). Comparison of the putative kinase domain of PKD2 to those of other kinases (Fig. 1 B) revealed the expected identity of those amino acids that are invariant among known kinase family members. Thus, the ATP binding consensus sequence Gly-X-Gly-X 2-Gly-X 16-Lys, where X represents any amino acid, is conserved in the kinase domain of PKD2 (amino acids 558–580). Furthermore, the invariant aspartate essential for kinase activity is located at the predicted position within the conserved motif HCDLXXX N (amino acids 672–678). In PKD2 the XXX motif is KPE, which is found most often in serine threonine kinases and not AAR or RAA, which are typical of tyrosine kinases (16Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the PKD2 kinase domain is very closely related to that of PKD/PKCμ (92%) and PKCν (91%) but not to any other member of the PKC family (Table I). Of all other members of the PKC family, PKCβ exhibited the highest similarity to PKD2 with only 27 and 34% identical amino acids in the kinase domain and the first cysteine-rich domain, respectively. Northern blot analysis of human poly(A)+-RNA from various human tissues using an 807-kb fragment comprising the 5′-end, the first zinc-finger-like motif, and partly the second zinc-finger-like motif identified a 4-kb transcript in several human tissues indicating that the cloned cDNA is full-length and that PKD2 is widely distributed (Fig.2 A). High steady-state levels were detected in human pancreas, heart, lung, smooth muscle, and brain. Interestingly, in contrast to PKCμ (2Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), high levels of PKD2 mRNA could not be detected in kidney and liver suggesting that the different members of the PKD family exhibit some degree of tissue-specific expression. Overall, constitutive mRNA expression of PKD2 in normal tissues appeared rather low. Typically, a signal could only be detected after a longer exposure (>4 days) of the blots. In some tissues, an additional transcript of about 2 kb was detected, which might be a result of alternative splicing. For detection of PKD2 expression in adult mice, we isolated RNA from the murine T-lymphocyte cell line EL4. The RNA was reverse-transcribed, and RT-PCR was performed using the sense primer 5′-ctgccctgcacggctgaaga-3′ corresponding to bases 643–662 and the reverse primer 5′-cagggaagatctggtagaca-3′ corresponding to bases 1641–1660 of human PKD2. The RT-PCR yielded a 1.023-kb fragment encoding the second cysteine-rich domain and the PH domain of murine PKD2. This fragment shared 885 identical bases with human PKD2 (87% identity). In contrast, murine PKD shares only 693 identical bases with human PKD2 (68% identity; data not shown) suggesting that the cloned fragment indeed corresponds to the murine homologue of human PKD2.In situ hybridization using the 1.023-kb probe demonstrated constitutive expression of murine PKD2 in various adult murine tissues. In addition to PKD2 mRNA expression in those tissues identified by Northern blot analysis, murine PKD2 was found to be highly expressed in rapidly proliferating tissues such as colonic crypts and testis (Fig.2 B). To confirm the predicted open reading frame, human PKD2 transcripts were synthesized in vitro and translated in a cell free system in the presence of35S-labeled methionine. The T7 sense transcript produced a polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 105 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig.3 A). These data are similar to the calculated mass of the deduced protein sequence of 97 kDa. The apparent 8-kDa difference in molecular mass might reflect unusual migration of the protein in SDS gels or post-translational modifications. No polypeptides of comparable size were synthesized when only the pcDNA3-FLAG vector was used for in vitro translation (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). To characterize PKD2 at the protein level, HEK293 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3-FLAG-PKD2 plasmid and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG mAb. These experiments also revealed a protein of 105 kDa corresponding to the in vitro translated protein. A protein with an identical molecular mass was identified when lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-PKD2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a FLAG mAb followed by anti-FLAG-Western blotting. In both cases, a similar protein could not be detected when HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG vector alone (Fig. 3 B). Next, we raised a polyclonal antiserum against the synthetic peptide GLPTDRDLGGACPPQD corresponding to amino acids 850–865 at the C-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence of human PKD2. This peptide was chosen, because it exhibits the least homology to PKCμ, PKD, or PKCν at the C terminus. A protein band migrating with an identical molecular mass of 105 kDa was obtained when lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-PKD2 were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-PKD2 antibody followed by Western blotting using the same affinity purified antiserum. Identical results were obtained when lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-PKD2 were either immunoprecipitated with PKD2 antiserum followed by Western blot analysis with the FLAG antibody or immunoprecipitated with the FLAG antibody followed by Western blot analysis with the PKD2 antiserum (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the antibody failed to detect FLAG-PKD2 upon preincubation with the immunizing peptide (data not shown). Thus, the polyclonal antiserum detects transfected PKD2. To determine whether the PKD2 antiserum cross-reacts with PKD/PKCμ, HEK293 cells were transfected with PKCμ or PKD2. Our results show that the polyclonal PKD2 antiserum preferentially detected PKD2 and only very weakly PKCμ (migrating with a molecular mass of about 115 kDa) upon overexpression of these proteins in HEK293 cells. In contrast, a polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of PKCμ detected PKCμ as efficient as PKD2 upon overexpression of the respective plasmids in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the PKD2 antiserum specifically recognizes PKD2. To examine endogenous expression of PKD2 in various human cell lines, lysates of HEK293, HeLa, HL60, and HUVEC cells were immunoprecipitated using the PKD2 antibody followed by Western blotting with the same anti"

The influence of the frequencies of transcription and translation initiation on random fluctuations in gene expression has been studied in a number of simulations in which promoter and ribosome binding site effectiveness has been changed in the range of values reported for various prokaryotic genes. We show that the genes expressed from strong promoters produce the protein evenly, with a rate that does not vary significantly among cells. The genes with very weak promoters express the protein in “bursts” occurring at random time intervals. Therefore, if the low level of gene expression results from the low frequency of transcription initiation, huge fluctuations arise. In contrast, the protein can be produced with a low and uniform rate if the gene has a strong promoter and a slow rate of ribosome binding (a weak ribosome binding site). The implications of these findings for the expression of regulatory proteins are discussed.

The implications of these findings for the expression of regulatory proteins are discussed. RNA polymerase ribosome binding site transcription initiation frequency Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression have drawn the attention of several research groups. It has been postulated (1McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 2Arkin A. Ross J. McAdams H.H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1633-1648PubMed Google Scholar) and observed (3Newlands S. Levitt L.K. Robinson C.S. Karpf C.A.B. Hodgson V.R.M. Wade R.P. Hardeman E.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that proteins are produced in short “bursts” occurring at random time intervals rather than in a continuos manner. This expression pattern arises from the fact that elementary processes such as polymerase binding and open complex formation involve small number of molecules and therefore show a wide distribution of reaction times. The fluctuations in a number of protein molecules resulting from stochastic gene expression are of special importance if the concentration of the protein constitutes the message that regulates expression of another gene. In this case, one may expect that the activation pattern of the regulated gene is also random, to some extent. The stochastic nature of gene expression and other biochemical processes involving small numbers of molecules may explain the variations observed in isogenic populations of bacterial cells. Examples are individual chemotactic responses (4Levin M.D. Morton-Firth C.J. Abouhamad W.N. Bourret R.B. Bray D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 175-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the distribution of generation times observed in Escherichia coli cells (5Tyson J.J. Hannsgen K.B. J. Theor. Biol. 1985; 113: 29-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the individual cell responses observed during induction of lactose (6Maloney P.C. Rotman B. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 73: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and arabinose (7Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8168-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) operons at subsaturating inducer concentrations. Stochastic effects have also been observed in engineered genetic networks in E. coli (8Elowitz M.B. Leibler S. Nature. 2000; 403: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Taking into account the stochastic phenomena described above, it is clear that the cell must contain various mechanisms that ensure deterministic regulation of cellular processes. The check points in eukaryotic cell cycle regulation (9Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raft M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, London and New York1994Google Scholar) are examples of such a mechanism. Computer simulations implementing various Monte Carlo algorithms proved to be useful in studying stochastic processes in biochemical reaction networks. This is especially true for several prokaryotic systems for which, due to their relative simplicity, a large number of quantitative measurements are available. Examples are the kinetic analysis of developmental pathway bifurcation in phage λ (2Arkin A. Ross J. McAdams H.H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1633-1648PubMed Google Scholar), computer simulation of the chemotactic signaling pathway (4Levin M.D. Morton-Firth C.J. Abouhamad W.N. Bourret R.B. Bray D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 175-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and mechanistic modeling of the all or none effect in lactose operon regulation (10Carrier T.A. Keasling J.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 201: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The goal of this article is to study the kinetic mechanisms that are responsible for the stochastic phenomena of gene expression. Because both RNA and protein elongation rates are approximately equal for all genes, different levels of gene expression are the result of varying frequencies of transcription and translation initiations. Therefore, we examined the influence of transcription and translation initiation frequencies on the pattern of gene expression. The model of a prokaryotic gene was built using kinetic parameters of LacZ determined by Kennell and Riezman (11Kennell D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The model is consistent with the experimental results presented in their work. We have systematically varied the frequencies of transcription and translation initiation reactions, keeping other parameters of the model constant. Our results indicate that the genes expressed from strong promoters (high frequency of transcription initiation) produce proteins with constant velocity and low variation in the number of molecules. A decrease in the frequency of transcription initiation causes a noisy pattern of gene expression, i.e. the protein is produced in bursts at random time intervals. In contrast, a decrease in the frequency of translation initiation lowers the speed of protein synthesis but does not lead to noisy expression patterns. We present the kinetic model of single prokaryotic gene expression. The transcription and translation processes are represented by the collection of kinetic equations that are numerically integrated with the use of the Monte Carlo approach of Gillespie (12Gillespie D.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340-2361Crossref Scopus (7224) Google Scholar, 13Gillespie D.T. Phys. A. 1992; 188: 404-425Crossref Scopus (774) Google Scholar). We assume that the cells in which the model gene is expressed are in the exponential growth phase. All of the experimental data cited in our work concern the cells in this growth phase. Moreover, under these conditions, the concentrations of free RNA polymerase and ribosomes available for the single gene are most probably kept constant by the delicate balance between many coupled reactions (14Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar, 15McClure W.R Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1985; 54: 171-204Google Scholar, 16Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7405-7408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) such as synthesis of RNA polymerase and ribosomes, binding of RNA polymerase and ribosomes to other expressing genes, nonspecific binding of RNA polymerase to DNA, and its idling at pause sites. A detailed model of all the processes that buffer concentrations of free RNA polymerase and ribosomes would require taking into account the biosynthesis of all the components of gene expression machinery and their binding within all the transcription units in the cell. Most of the parameters of such a complex model would be unknown and impossible to estimate. Instead, we included in the model randomly changing pools of the free RNA polymerase and ribosomes. Because these pools result from many small contributions of other processes, their distributions should be Gaussian. The mean values of these distributions have been set close to the estimations presented by other authors. The fluctuations in the RNA polymerase and ribosome concentrations described by the standard deviations of the distributions are unknown. Therefore, we checked the sensitivity of our results to these parameters. Although many research groups are developing detailed kinetic models of various elements of the gene expression machinery (e.g. transcription initiation (17Record T.M. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar)), the in vivo values of the rate constants of many elementary reactions remain unknown. In contrast, many experimental works describe the kinetics of prokaryotic gene expression (mainly of the LacZ gene in E. coli) in terms of simple effective parameters such as the frequencies of transcription and translation initiation, the rate of RNA polymerase and ribosome movement, mRNA half-life, etc. (11Kennell D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,18Yarchuk O. Jacques N. Guillerez J. Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In our model, we adjust unknown values of elementary reactions to reproduce measured values of transcription and translation inititiation frequencies, mRNA level, and the protein synthesis rate in vivo. We assume that effective parameters obtained in this way implicitly include reactions involving nucleotides, translation initiation factors, bivalent ions, and other compounds necessary for proper function of the gene expression machinery. The summary of the kinetic model and its parameters for the LacZ gene is given in Table I. Details of the model and simulation algorithm are described below.Table ISummary of the kinetic model and its parameters for the LacZ geneReaction/processRate constantsCommentsThe pool of available RNA polymerase The pool of available ribosomesGaussian distribution with μ = 35 and δ = 3.5 molecules Gaussian distribution with μ = 350 and δ = 35 moleculesOrder of magnitude of the mean is set according to experimental estimations (14Bremer H.

Biol. 1992; 226: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)).Elongation of protein chain0.015 s−1According to commonly accepted value of ribosome movement rate (15 amino acids/s) and the length of β-galactosidase.Protein degradation6.42 × 10−5According to β-galactosidase half-life of 3 h measured by Bergquist and Truman (22Berquist P.L. Truman P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Transcription initiation is represented in our model as a two-step process: P+RNAP→P_RNAPEquation 1 P_RNAP→P+RNAPEquation 2 P_RNAP→TrRNAPEquation 3 where P represents the promoter region of the gene,RNAP represents RNA polymerase, and TrRNAPrepresents the transcribing RNA polymerase. Reactions in Equations 1and 2 describe reversible RNA polymerase binding; the reaction in Equation 3 represents isomerization of closed binary complex to open binary complex. The second order rate constant of RNAP1 binding has been set to 108m−1s−1, which is the order of magnitude of RNAP DNA binding determined in in vitro assays (17Record T.M. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar). The values of closed complex to open complex isomerization rates reported in the literature are of the order of 1 s−1. The rate of reaction (Equation 3) was set to this value. If the rate constants of reactions in Equations 1 and 3 are set to the values listed above, the rate of RNAP dissociation must be of the order of 10 s−1 to reproduce a transcription initiation frequency close to the value of 0.3 s−1reported by Kennell and Riezman (11Kennell D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding constant resulting from the rates of reactions in Equations 1 and 2is 107m−1, which is in reasonable agreement with values estimated according to in vitro measurements (17Record T.M. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar). To clear the promoter region, active RNA polymerase must move 30 to 60 nucleotides (17Record T.M. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar). Taking into account that the rate of polymerase movement is about 40 nucleotides/s, this step takes about 1 s (17Record T.M. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar). The length of the mRNA chain that is synthesized during this time corresponds roughly to the length of the leader region containing the ribosome binding site (RBS). Therefore, the synthesis of the RBS and promoter clearance occur at approximately the same rate of 1 s−1. It is irrelevant for the conclusions of our model whether the RBS appears slightly earlier or later than promoter clearance. Therefore, we modeled these two processes by the single first order reaction with a rate constant of 1 s−1: TrRNAP→RBS+P+ElRNAPEquation 4 where ElRNAP denotes polymerase elongating a given mRNA molecule. The elongation of the mRNA is not modeled. We assume that the RNA polymerase completes synthesis of the mRNA molecule with a rate sufficient to allow for a ribosome movement rate of 15 amino acids/s. In prokaryote transcription, translation and mRNA degradation are tightly coupled. Following the experimental results of Yarchuk et al. (18Yarchuk O. Jacques N. Guillerez J. Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we have assumed the following interdependence between translation and mRNA decay: (i) RNase E and ribosomes compete for the RBS; (ii) if RNase E binds to the RBS faster than the ribosome, it degrades mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction and does not interfere with the movement of the ribosomes that have been already bound; and (iii) every ribosome that successfully binds to the RBS completes translation of the protein. The above assumptions have been modeled by the following reactions: Ribosome+RBS→RibRBSEquation 5 RibRBS→RBS+RibosomeEquation 6 RibRBS→ElRib+RBSEquation 7 RBS→decayEquation 8 where Ribosome represents the pool of free ribosomes,RibRBS represents the ribosome binding site protected by the bound ribosome, and ElRib denotes the ribosome elongating protein chain. The reaction in Equation 8 models decay of unprotected RBS. Parameters of the reactions in Equations Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8 are more difficult to estimate than those concerning transcription initiation. The second order rate constant for ribosome binding was set to 108m−1s−1, which is of the order of diffusion limited macromolecule binding. The rate of the RBS clearance step in translation initiation (the reaction in Equation 7) was set to 0.5 s−1, which is close to experimental estimates (19Draper D.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 902-908Google Scholar). Parameters of the reactions in Equations 6 and 8 have been adjusted to reproduce the experimentally known rate of protein synthesis and ribosome spacing of the LacZ gene. Another important constraint is provided by experiments of Yarchuk et al. (18Yarchuk O. Jacques N. Guillerez J. Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The authors introduced mutations in the RBS region of the LacZ gene that resulted in a 200-fold variation in the expression level. A decrease in the protein synthesis rate has been followed by a nearly equivalent change in the stationary mRNA level. This means that for the less effective ribosome binding sites, the rate of mRNA decay exceeded or at least was no lower than the transcription initiation frequency. Otherwise, the significant mRNA level would be observed even in the case of RBS practically unprotected by ribosomes. We have set the rate of the reaction in Equation 8 to 0.3 s−1, which is equal to the transcription initiation frequency. Therefore, the rate of ribosome dissociation has to be set to 2.25 s−1 to reproduce the rate of protein synthesis measured by Kenell and Riezman. The elongation of the protein chain has been modeled as a single first order reaction: RibRBS→proteinEquation 9 We have used the commonly accepted rate of ribosome movement of 15 amino acids/s. Therefore, the rate of the reaction in Equation 9 has been set to 15/Ls−1, where L denotes the length of protein chain. For the 1024-amino acid-long product of theLacZ gene, the value of this parameter is 0.015. This treatment of the elongation reaction is simplified with respect to other Monte Carlo models of prokaryotic gene expression (1McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 20Carrier A.T. Keasling J.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 189: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In these publications, the addition of a single amino acid by a single ribosome has been simulated as a separate reaction, and ribosome overlap has been prevented by excluded volume constraints. It will be shown in the following sections that despite neglecting fine details of ribosome movement and using the average rate of protein chain synthesis instead, the model is able to reproduce the experimental data concerning expression of the LacZ gene. Simplification of the elongation reaction made the simulation computationally fast, thus we could collect good statistics from long timescale trajectories for a large number of parameter combinations. Protein degradation has been simulated by the following reaction: Protein→decayEquation 10 Although protein degradation rates are variable, most of the native proteins have half-lives of the order of hours (21Goldberg A.L. Dice J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 835-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In our simulations, we have applied the value of 3 h that has been measured for wild type β-galactosidase in E. coli cells (22Berquist P.L. Truman P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The numbers of available RNAP and ribosome molecules were generated from the Gaussian distribution. In the case of RNAP, the mean of the distribution was set to 35 molecules. This value is close to estimations made by other authors according to experimental data (14Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar, 15McClure W.R Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1985; 54: 171-204Google Scholar, 17Record T.M. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar). Because the number of ribosome molecules present in the cell is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the number of RNAP molecules, the mean of the ribosome pool distribution has been set to 350. We are not able to estimate the S.D. of the above-mentioned pools. We have repeated all the experiments with the standard deviations equal to 10% and 50% of the means to study the influence of the fluctuations in RNAP and ribosome pools on the gene expression pattern. In the following sections, results will be presented for the standard deviations of the pools equal to 10% of the means, unless it is stated explicitly that standard deviations are set to 50% of the means. To compute the time evolution of the system described above, we have used the Monte Carlo algorithm of Gillespie (12Gillespie D.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340-2361Crossref Scopus (7224) Google Scholar). This method has a sound physical basis and has already been proven useful in the simulation of prokaryotic gene expression (1McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar,2Arkin A. Ross J. McAdams H.H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1633-1648PubMed Google Scholar). For the convenience of the reader, a brief description of the Gillespie algorithm is given below. The rigorous derivation of this computational protocol can be found elsewhere (12Gillespie D.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340-2361Crossref Scopus (7224) Google Scholar, 13Gillespie D.T. Phys. A. 1992; 188: 404-425Crossref Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Gillespie's algorithm is formulated to numerically study systems composed of a large number of chemical species whose interactions are described by rate equations. At each step of simulation, two random numbers are generated. The first one is used to determine which reaction in the system will happen; the second one determines the waiting time for this event. The probability of a given reaction to be chosen is proportional to the product of its stochastic rate constant and numbers of substrate molecules. The distribution of the waiting times is given by the following equation: P(τ,μ)=aμexp(−a0τ)Equation 11 where aμ=hμcμ;a0=∑aμEquation 12 P(τ, μ) is the probability that the waiting time for the reaction is τ, provided that reaction μ was chosen to happen; h μ is the product of the numbers of substrate molecules in reaction μ; and c μ is the stochastic rate constant of this reaction. After the reaction and its waiting time are determined, one elementary reaction is executed (e.g. if the reaction is A + B→AB, one A molecule and one B molecule will be removed from the system, and one AB molecule will be added). The time of the simulation is then increased by τ, and the next simulation step is executed. The stochastic rate constant of the reaction is defined as the probability that the elementary reaction will happen in the infinitesimally short time interval. It can be calculated from the rate constant using simple relations. For the first order reactions, both constants are equal. For the second order reaction, the stochastic rate constant is equal to the rate constant divided by the volume of the system. It has been rigorously proven that for an infinitely large number of molecules, the Markov Chain generated by the Monte Carlo scheme given above converges to the same trajectory of the system as the deterministic integration of differential equations (12Gillespie D.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340-2361Crossref Scopus (7224) Google Scholar, 13Gillespie D.T. Phys. A. 1992; 188: 404-425Crossref Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The advantage of the Gillespie algorithm over the differential equation approach is that it also remains exact for arbitrary low numbers of molecules in the system. This is extremely important in the simulation of biochemical systems, where some processes involve single molecules (e.g. one molecule of promoter in transcription initiation). Randomly fluctuating pools of available ribosomes and RNA polymerase have been modeled in the following way. Before executing every step of the Gillespie algorithm, the number of RNAP molecules and ribosomes has been generated from Gaussian distributions with the means and standard deviations defined in the previous section. Then, the values ofa μ (see Equation 12) for every reaction were calculated, and the step of the Gillespie algorithm has been executed. Generation of the number of substrate molecules from the appropriate probability distribution has already been applied by Arkinet al. (2Arkin A. Ross J. McAdams H.H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1633-1648PubMed Google Scholar) in the Gillespie algorithm simulation to model rapid equilibrium phenomena in regulatory protein binding. We have applied the Gillespie algorithm to the model described in the previous sections. At the beginning of the simulation, only a single promoter (P) was present in the system. The numbers of all other molecules, except random pools of RNAP and ribosomes, were set to 0. Simulation was pursued until it reached the generation time ofE. coli, and then cell division was simulated,i.e. simulation was continued with the system containing one promoter molecule and all other numbers of molecules divided by 2. The generation time was set to 35 min. We have neglected the fact that during DNA replication, two copies of the bacterial gene can be expressed. Linear volume change of the growing cell has been assumed. Before every step of the Gillespie algorithm, stochastic rate constants of second order reactions have been recomputed by dividing the appropriate rate constants by the current volume of the cell. Simulation of several generations is important in the simulation of constitutive gene expression. As shown below, after starting our simulation with 0 protein molecules, the level of gene expression equilibrates after a few generations. We have found that 10 generations are sufficient to equilibrate the system. For each simulation, we computed 100 independent trajectories of the system covering 10 generations each. We have used our own implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. The software has been tested against examples given in the original work (12Gillespie D.T. J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340-2361Crossref Scopus (7224) Google Scholar). To check the validity of the model, we performed the simulation with the parameters describing theLacZ gene. Fig. 1 Apresents the gene expression pattern spanning 10 bacterial generations. Standard deviation of RNAP and ribosome pools has been set to 3.5 and 35, respectively (10% of the mean values). To compare these data with the results of Kennell and Riezman (11Kennell D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we have analyzed the changes in the number of protein molecules in the first generation because the experimental data covered the time scale of about 30 min after induction. The transcription initiation frequency obtained in this simulation was equal to 0.258 s−1, close to that of 0.3 s−1 reported by Kennell and Riezman for the LacZ gene. As seen in Fig.1 B, after about 500 s, the number of protein molecules begins"
https://openalex.org/W2079124813,"We have identified an activity that is required for transcription of downstream promoter element (DPE)-containing core promoters in vitro. The purified factor was found to be the Drosophila homolog of the transcriptional repressor known as NC2 or Dr1-Drap1. Purified recombinant dNC2 activates DPE-driven promoters and represses TATA-driven promoters. A mutant version of dNC2 can activate DPE promoters but is unable to repress TATA promoters. Thus, the activation and repression functions are distinct. These studies reveal that NC2 (Dr1-Drap1) is a bifunctional basal transcription factor that differentially regulates gene transcription through DPE or TATA box motifs."

Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Ras proteins belong to a superfamily of small GTPases that cycle between inactive GDP-bound states and active GTP-bound states, and represent a point of convergence for the transduction and integration of many extracellular signals that activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Ras-GTP initiates a sequential cascade of events involving recruitment to the membrane and activation of Raf-1, activation of the dual-specificity kinases termed mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinases (MEKs), and finally activation of ERK. Activated ERKs phosphorylate cellular substrates and translocate to the nucleus, where they play an important role in regulating gene transcription (3Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 4Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, ERKs constitute a primary effector pathway in controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle regulation, and survival. In brain, recent studies indicate that ERKs play an important role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (5Orban P.C. Chapman P.F. Brambilla R. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 38-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, and the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors are among the most widely distributed and abundant receptor-operated ion channels in the central nervous system. In addition to mediating the slow component of glutamate-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents, NMDA receptors play a vital role in a variety of processes, including neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neuronal survival and death (6Collingridge G.L. Lester R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 143-210PubMed Google Scholar). NMDA receptor-mediated increases in intracellular calcium have been shown to stimulate ERK signaling, and evidence suggests that NMDA receptor-mediated ERK activation may play an important role in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (7Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Kornhauser J.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 18: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NMDA-dependent hippocampal long-term potentiation is associated with activation of ERK and is blocked by compounds that inhibit the ability of MEK to activate ERK (9English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 10English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19103-19106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). ERK activation has also been shown to be required for hippocampal-dependent associative learning in rats (11Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Tzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), and mice lacking Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor (Ras-GRF) display impaired amygdala-dependent memory consolidation (12Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). An important aspect of NMDA receptor-mediated increases in intracellular calcium is that different levels of calcium influx stimulate different, and sometimes opposing, responses. For example, low levels of intracellular calcium can preferentially activate phosphatases, leading to long-term depression (13Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), whereas higher levels of intracellular calcium can activate kinases that support long-term potentiation (14Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 15Lisman J. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malinow R. Science. 1997; 276: 2001-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, small increases in intracellular calcium can promote neuronal survival (16Franklin J.L. Sanz-Rogriquez C. Juhasz A. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 643-664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Franklin J.L. Johnson E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), whereas large increases lead to cell death (excitotoxicity; Ref. 18Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, many calcium-dependent synaptic responses may represent a balance between opposing calcium-activated processes. In the present study, we demonstrate that NMDA receptor-dependent calcium influx can activate opposing stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that regulate ERK activation in primary cortical cultures. The stimulatory process predominates at lower levels of NMDA receptor activation, whereas the inhibitory process predominates at higher levels of NMDA receptor activation. Female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Farms (Wilmington, MA) and housed and bred in our animal facility. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and amphotericin B (Fungizone) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; plasma-derived horse serum (PDHS) was purchased from Sigma; trypsin was obtained from Worthington Biochemicals (Freehold, NJ); and penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Pfizer Inc. (New York, NY). CNQX was purchased from Tocris Neuramin (Essex, United Kingdom), and MK-801 and AMPA were from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). Anti-phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho-p44/42 (Tyr204), anti-p44/42, anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/Ser221), anti-phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB; Ser133), anti-CREB, and PD98059 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL), and U0126 was from Promega. Protease inhibitors, ionomycin, MCPG, Gö 6976, H-89, KN-92, KN-93, wortmannin, LY294002, okadaic acid, calyculin A, and cypermethrine were purchased from Calbiochem; tetrodotoxin was from Sigma; and pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Cerebral cortical cultures were prepared from newborn rat pups as described previously (19Chandler L.J. Sutton G. Norwood D. Sumners C. Crews F.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In brief, brains were removed and placed in an isotonic salt solution containing 100 units of penicillin G, 100 μg of streptomycin, and 0.25 μg of amphotericin B (Fungizone)/ml, pH 7.4. Blood vessels and pia mater were removed, and the tissue was chopped into ∼2-mm chunks. The brain pieces were then suspended in 25 ml of 0.25% (w/v) trypsin in isotonic salt solution, pH 7.4, and placed in a shaking water bath for 10 min at 37 °C to dissociate the cells. The dissociated cell suspension was then removed and combined with 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% PDHS, and the undissociated chunks were mixed with 160 μg of DNase 1 and triturated until the cells were dissociated. The dissociated cell suspensions were combined and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was washed with 50 ml of DMEM containing 10% PDHS. Cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% PDHS, plated in poly-l-lysine-precoated culture dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/35-mm dish, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air. On day 3, cells were treated with 10 μm β-cytosine arabinoside in DMEM containing 10% PDHS. After 2 days of β-cytosine arabinoside treatment, culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% PDHS, and cultures were grown for an additional 7–9 days before being used in experiments. At this time, cultures consisted of ∼90% neurons as determined by immunofluorescent staining with anti-neurofilament. Cultures appeared as many phase-bright cells with characteristic neuronal morphology overlying a small number of flat, phase-dark cells, which had typical astroglial morphology. Each experimental nrepresents data obtained from neuronal cultures prepared from separate litters of pups. For certain experiments, cortical cultures were serum-deprived for 24 h before use by replacing the serum-containing DMEM with serum-free DMEM. Cortical cultures were washed twice with 1 ml of HEPES buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 100 nm glycine, 15 mmglucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and incubated for 10 min in 1 ml of HEPES buffer followed by exposure to agonists (NMDA, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and ionomycin) or tetrodotoxin (TTX) for the indicated times. Antagonists and inhibitors (MK-801, CNQX, PD98059, sodium orthovanadate, Gö 6976, H-89, KN-92, KN-93, calyculin A, cypermethrin, okadaic acid, and nimodipine) were added 15 min before addition of NMDA. For experiments examining the involvement of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-proteins, cultures were preincubated with PTX (1 μg/ml) for 12 h before NMDA exposure. After the indicated exposure times, the HEPES buffer was removed, and the cells were scraped into 100 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm AEBSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamide, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells isolated from three dishes were combined, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was removed, an aliquot was taken for determination of protein concentration by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and the remainder was stored at −80 °C until use. An aliquot of the frozen supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer (final concentration, 50 mmTris HCl, pH 6.7, 4% w/v glycerol, 4% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and boiled for 10 min, and 20 μg was separated by size on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrlyaminde gel using the buffer system of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membranes in Towbin-SDS transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS). After transfer, the blot was washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and stored overnight at 4 °C in PBST. The membranes were blocked in PBST containing 5% nonfat dried milk (Carnation) and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The membrane was washed once with PBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-p44/42 (phospho-ERK1/2) antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBST containing 0.5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was then washed once for 5 min, once for 15 min, and then twice for 5 min in PBST, followed by a 1-h incubation with agitation at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G diluted 1:2000 in PBST containing 0.5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After this incubation, the membranes were washed as above, and the antigen-antibody-peroxidase complex was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by exposure to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hyperfilm ECL. In some instances, membranes were washed for 10 min with PBST and stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50 °C with gentle agitation. Membranes were blocked and reprobed with anti-p42/p44 as described above. Film autoradiograms were analyzed and quantified by computer-assisted densitometry. Because the phospho-ERK1 band was often undectable on film autoradiograms, only the ERK2 bands were quantified by densitometry. NMDA receptor coupling to ERK activation was examined in primary cortical neuronal cultures by measuring changes in levels of phospho-ERK2. Addition of TTX (1 μm) caused a large decrease in the levels of phospho-ERK2 (Fig.1, A and B), indicating synaptic activity-dependent activation of ERK2 in the cortical cultures. To eliminate this component of ERK activation, cultures were preincubated with 1 μm (TTX) for 1 h before a 5-min exposure to NMDA. In the absence of synaptic activity, the NMDA dose-response curve for stimulation of phospho-ERK2 appeared bell-shaped (inverted U), with stimulation of phospho-ERK2 at low NMDA concentrations (10 μm and 25 μm) and no stimulation at 100 μm NMDA. Extending the NMDA exposure time from 5 to 60 min yielded a similar bell-shaped dose-response curve (n = 2; data not shown). Fig. 1, C and D, shows that NMDA (50 μm) stimulation of phospho-ERK2 in the presence of TTX was blocked by MK-801 (10 μm), demonstrating that NMDA stimulation of phospho-ERK2 is an NMDA receptor-mediated process. Total ERK levels were unchanged by the above treatments (data not shown). Activation of ERK in response to NMDA receptor-stimulated calcium influx has been previously observed, yet the mechanism(s) underlying this activation process remain unclear. Several signaling messengers, including the tyrosine kinases Src (21Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) (22Lev S. Moeno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Ras-GRF (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Felg L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (25Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), have been reported to couple calcium to activation of ERK in a Ras-dependent manner. The next set of experiments examined intracellular messengers involved in coupling NMDA receptor-dependent calcium influx to activation of ERK2 in cortical neuronal cultures. NMDA (50 μm, 5 min) stimulation of phospho-ERK2 was attenuated (61%) by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (40 μm) but not KN-92 (an inactive analog of KN-93) and was completely blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitors wortmannin (200 nm; Fig.2) and LY294002 (100 μm; data not shown). Neither basal nor NMDA stimulation of phospho-ERK2 was altered in the presence of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H-89 (5 μm) or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö 6976 (1 μm), suggesting that these kinases do not play a role in NMDA receptor modulation of ERK activation in cortical cultures. In addition, the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine (1 μm) did not alter phospho-ERK2 (data not shown), arguing against secondary involvement of calcium influx through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. These observations indicate that both PI-3K and CaMKII play a critical role in coupling NMDA receptors to stimulation of ERK signaling in cortical cultures. Furthermore, this coupling process appears to involve a PTX-sensitive heterotrimeric G-protein, because preincubation of cultures with PTX (1 μg/ml) for 12 h eliminated NMDA stimulation of phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 2, C and D). The bell-shaped dose-response curve (Fig. 1) for NMDA stimulation of phospho-ERK2 was an unexpected observation. A bell-shaped dose-response curve for NMDA stimulation of phospho-ERK2 would be predicted if a stimulatory pathway predominated during lower levels of receptor activation and an inhibitory pathway predominated during higher levels of receptor activation. Basal levels of phospho-ERK2 in the cortical cultures were higher than expected in the absence of an added stimulating agent, suggesting high levels of activation by an endogenous mediator. The large decrease in basal phospho-ERK2 in the presence of TTX (Fig. 1) suggests synaptic activity-dependent release of a neurotransmitter that subsequently activates ERK signaling. To determine whether glutamate activation of NMDA receptors played a role in this activity-dependent stimulation of phospho-ERK2, the effects of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists on basal phospho-ERK2 were examined (Fig. 3). Incubation with the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 (10 μm) for 1 h reduced phospho-ERK2 to barely detectable levels. This inhibitory effect of MK-801 likely resulted from NMDA receptor blockade, because the competitive NMDA antagonist AP5 (50 μm) also reduced basal phospho-ERK2 (n = 2). In contrast, the AMPA/kainate antagonist CNQX (100 μm) did not significantly reduce basal phospho-ERK2. Blockade of metabotropic glutamate receptors with MCPG (1 mm) was also without effect on basal phospho-ERK (data not shown). Total ERK2 levels were not altered by any of the above treatments. These observations suggest that endogenous glutamate release acts at NMDA receptors to maintain high levels of ERK activation. As predicted from the NMDA dose-response curve, 100 μm NMDA also greatly reduced basal levels of phospho-ERK2. The ability of both NMDA receptor agonist and antagonist to reduce activity-dependent, NMDA receptor-mediated hyperphosphorylation of ERK2 is consistent with activation of inhibitory and stimulatory pathways for NMDA receptor modulation of ERK signaling. The next set of experiments examined the extracellular Ca2+dependence and time course of the inhibitory effect of NMDA. Reducing extracellular Ca2+ from 1.0 to 0.1 mm or substituting Ca2+ with 0.1 mm EGTA resulted in a large decrease in basal activity-dependent phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+, NMDA enhanced phospho-ERK2 in contrast to the inhibitory effect in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+. This stimulation was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. To examine ERK activation through a calcium influx-independent pathway, we next examined the effect of the PKC activator TPA on basal phospho-ERK2 (Fig. 5, A and B). TPA (1 μm) produced a rapid increase in phospho-ERK2 that was significant within 5 min of stimulation and remained elevated after 60 min of stimulation. This robust stimulatory effect of TPA on phospho-ERK2 demonstrates that stimulation of a calcium influx-independent pathway for activation of ERK signaling is able to further enhance phospho-ERK2 in cortical cultures. In contrast to the rapid and sustained increase in phospho-ERK2 in response to TPA, NMDA (100 μm) in the absence of TTX produced a time-dependent decrease in phospho-ERK2, and at no time point was stimulation of phospho-ERK2 observed (Fig. 5, Cand D). It is unlikely that NMDA stimulated an undetected rapid and transient increase in phospho-ERK2 before the 1-min time point, because a separate set of experiments found no increase in phospho-ERK2 15 or 30 s after NMDA addition (data not shown). Exposure of cultures to the calcium ionophore ionomycin (1 μm) produced a slight increase in phospho-ERK2 after 5 min of stimulation that returned to basal levels after 20 min and was significantly reduced after 60 min. Total levels of ERK2 did not change over the 60-min time course. These observations are consistent with the suggestion that high levels of NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx can activate an inhibitory pathway to decrease ERK2 activation.Figure 5Time courses for TPA activation and NMDA inhibition of synaptic activity-dependent phospho-ERK2. Neuronal cultures were exposed to the PKC activator TPA (1 μm; Aand b) or vehicle (DMSO), NMDA (100 μm), or ionomycin (1 μm; C and D) for the indicated times, and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with a phosphospecific antibody that only recognizes dually phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204) ERK1/2 (p44/42).

As was observed using non-serum-deprived cultures, NMDA (100 μm) stimulated a time-dependent decrease in phospho-ERK2 (data not shown; n = 5). Studies have shown that cAMP response element-mediated gene transcription is a downstream target for ERK signaling (26Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E.

This pathway appears to involve ERK activation of Rsk2, which translocates to the nucleus and directly activates CREB via phosphorylation of its regulatory Ser133 residue. Using a phospho(Ser133)-CREB-specific antibody, we tested whether the inhibitory effect of NMDA on ERK activation was reflected downstream at the level of CREB. Incubation (1 h) of cortical cultures with the MEK inhibitor U0126 (100 μm) greatly attenuated basal levels of phospho-CREB (Fig. 6) without a decrease in total CREB levels (data not shown), demonstrating that basal CREB activation coupled to, and was dependent on, ERK signaling. As was observed with phospho-ERK2, both NMDA (100 μm) and wortmannin (200 nm) significantly reduced basal levels of phospho-CREB. NMDA and wortmannin in combination produced an apparent additive effect to reduce phospho-CREB levels to that observed with U0126. PKA and PKC have been shown to regulate ERK activity, and cross-talk between Ras/ERK and these non-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways may be important for modulation of ERK activity. Regulation of ERK signaling by PKA is complex, and PKA has been shown to both stimulate and inhibit ERK activity (30Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan C.S. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Because NMDA receptors can activate PKA via calcium/calmodulin stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (31Chetkovich D.M. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a potential mechanism for NMDA modulation of ERK signaling is through PKA. To investigate the role of PKA in NMDA receptor modulation of phospho-ERK2 in the cortical cultures, we examined the effects of a selective kinase inhibitor on activity-dependent activation of ERK2 (Fig.7). In the absence of TTX, inhibition of PKA with H-89 (5 μm) did not alter basal (activity-dependent) levels of phospho-ERK2 and failed to prevent NMDA inhibition of phospho-ERK2, suggesting that PKA does not play a role in NMDA inhibition of phospho-ERK2. Inhibition of PKC with Gö 6976 (1 μm) also did not alter phospho-ERK under the above conditions, indicating that PKC also does not play a role in NMDA modulation of ERK signaling. As expected, inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93 (40 μm) and PI-3K with wortmannin (n = 2; data not shown) reduced activity-dependent phospho-ERK2 but did not prevent the inhibitory effect of NMDA. The next set of experiments examined whether the inhibitory effect of NMDA on phospho-ERK2 resulted from enhanced dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. In addition to phosphorylation by MEK1/2, dephosphoryation by ERK-specific phosphatases plays an important role in regulating ERK activity, and a potential mechanism in which high levels of NMDA receptor activation could decrease phospho-ERK2 is through stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Therefore, we tested the effect of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate on NMDA inhibition of phospho-ERK2. Exposure of cortical cultures to 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 1 h in the absence of TTX resulted in a significant increase in basal phospho-ERK2 yet did not alter the inhibitory ef"

The hMRE11-binding region is necessary for both nuclear localization of the complex and for cellular radiation resistance. On the other hand, the FHA domain regulates nuclear foci formation of the multiprotein complex in response to DNA damage but is not essential for nuclear transportation of the complex and radiation resistance.

Recently, we reported that expression of the full-length NBS1 protein complements multiple NBS phenotype characteristics such as radiation sensitivity, the G2checkpoint, and focus formation in nucleus after irradiation (8Ito A. Tauchi H. Kobayashi J. Morishima K. Nakamura A. Hirokawa Y. Matsuura S. Ito K. Komatsu K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 716-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings enable us to analyze the functional domain of NBS1 using deletion mutants of NBS1 transfected in NBS cells. By this approach, we localized an essential domain at C terminus region of NBS1 for hMRE11 binding. Interestingly, we found that the FHA domain at N terminus of NBS1 is not essential for restoration of radiation resistance of NBS patient cells but is essential for nuclear foci formation after DNA damage by radiation.RESULTSTo locate the functionally important domain of the NBS1 gene involved in the human NBS phenotype, we tried to determine which sequences were conserved in NBS1 in higher eukaryotes. Cloning and sequencing of the chicken Nbs1 gene can be very useful for locating a conserved domain, because a low homology of the NBS1 amino acid sequence between the human sequence and the chicken sequence has been suggested (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Beau M.L. Ill J.R.Y. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of chicken Nbs1 shows apparent homology with human and mouse NBS1 (62 and 63% identity, respectively) at the N terminus 360 amino acids, which contains both the FHA/BRCT domain and a phosphorylation site on a serine residue at 278 and 343 (Refs. 9Lim D.-S.

There is a region with low homology from 360 to 630 (33% identity between chicken and human). Another conserved sequence was observed at the region from 631 to 754 and the C terminus of the protein (Fig.1). A novel identical sequence with yeast Xrs2 protein was also found in this small region (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the suggestion that the C-terminal half of NBS1 may interact with hMRE11 (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Beau M.L. Ill J.R.Y. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we generated various C-terminal deletion mutants of NBS1 and tested their ability to bind to hMRE11 using a yeast two-hybrid analysis. Significant interaction between NBS1 and hMRE11 was detected only when codons 665–693 were present in the construct even when N-terminal FHA/BRCT domains were deleted (Fig. 2). This C-terminal region contains a sequence highly conserved at codons 682–693 in the chicken, mouse, human NBS1, and yeast Xrs2 proteins, implying that the sequence might be a critical region for hMRE11 binding.Figure 2NBS1 constructs used in the present study and their hMRE11 binding activity obtained from yeast two-hybrid analysis.

Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the hMRE11-binding domain is probably necessary for the processing of damaged DNA. To assay the functions of the binding domain in vivo, we subcloned mutant NBS1 constructs into expression vectors (shown in Fig. 2) and transfected them into the NBS cell line GM7166VA7. All of the stable transformants expressed a significant amount of the mutant NBS1 protein (Fig.3 a). Although the expression of multiple smaller proteins were observed in the N-terminal-deleted mutants (Fig. 3 a, FE3 and BRCT-d), the expected mutant NBS1 proteins in the FE3 and BRCT-d clones were still detected in their transformants (Fig. 3 a). Because it is known that NBS1 directly binds to hMRE11 and indirectly to hRAD50 through hMRE11 (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Beau M.L. Ill J.R.Y. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of mutant NBS1 to form the complex. Full-length and S703 mutant protein, containing C-terminal conserved region, were able to form the triple-protein complex, because they coimmunoprecipitated with hRAD50. On the other hand, S590 and S670, in which the C-terminal conserves sequence was deleted, were not able to form the complex (Fig. 3 b). The result is consistent with yeast two-hybrid experiment (Fig. 2), which demonstrated the essential C-terminal domain for hMRE11 binding at 665–693. Although the expected mutant protein from FE3 or BRCT-d was invisible in NBS1-blot for hRAD50 precipitates (Fig. 3 b), a very weak signal was detected when the increased amount of the precipitate was used for analysis (data not shown). Because the expected FE3 or BRCT-d proteins were accompanied by the degraded small fragments (Fig.3 a), the N terminus mutant proteins could be unstable. The absence of the N terminus region of the protein in the FE3 and BRCT-d clones was confirmed by immunoblotting using antiserum that recognizes the N-terminal end of NBS1 (data not shown). From these results, it appears that the multiple proteins expressed in the FE3 and BRCT-d mutants must contain functional hMRE11-binding domains at the C-terminal NBS1 region.Figure 3Expression of NBS1 protein in the NBS1-transfected cell lines. a, immunoblot analysis of NBS cells (GM7166VA7) and various NBS1 transfectants. b, formation of the triple-protein complex in NBS cells or in NBS1-transfected cells.

This was supported by finding that del 683–693 mutant lacking Xrs2-identical sequence could not restore radiation resistance (data not shown). Interestingly, cells transfected with mutant NBS1 lacking the FHA domain alone or lacking both the FHA and BRCT domains (FE3 and BRCT-d) also became radiation resistant to a degree similar to that seen in C-terminal end-deleted mutant (S703 in Fig. 4). These results imply that the FHA/BRCT domain is not essential for restoration of radiation resistance,i.e. for DNA repair.Figure 4Radiation sensitivity of parental NBS (GM7166VA7)- and NBS1-transfected cells.

Master R.S. Mackay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H.J. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). An absence of hMRE11 and hRAD50 in the nucleus was observed in NBS cells (GM7166VA7), and foci did not form when cells were irradiated with γ rays (Fig. 5, GM7166VA7; see Ref. 2Carney J.P. Maser R.S.

In contrast, nuclear localization of NBS1, hMRE11, and hRAD50 was detected in NBS cells transfected with full-length NBS1, and foci formation in the nucleus was clearly observed after irradiation (Fig. 5, +Full). A mutant of NBS1 containing the hMRE11-binding domain showed nuclear localization of hMRE11 and hRAD50 (Fig. 5, +S703, +FE3, and +BRCT-d), and the lack of the hMRE11-binding domain in the S670, S590, or the del 682–693 clone resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of the proteins. Because the cells in the absence of triple complex in nuclei (S590, S670, and del 682–693) remained radiation-sensitive (Fig. 4 and data not shown), these results suggest that the nuclear localization of hMRE11 and hRAD50 is necessary to restore the radiation resistance. Surprisingly, the FE3 and BRCT-d cells could not form foci in response to DNA damage (Fig. 5, +IR lanes, +FE3 and +BRCT-d) even though the triple-protein complex was able to localize in the nucleus. To confirm the inability of nuclear foci formation in FE3 mutant NBS1 protein, we transfected this mutant cDNA into HeLa cells. Significant reduction of foci formation after radiation was observed in FE3-expressed HeLa cells, possibly by dominant negative effects (Fig.6). This FE3-expressing HeLa cell clone showed no alteration of radiation sensitivity (data not shown), supporting the finding that FHA domain is not essential for restoration of radiation resistance.Figure 5Localization and ionizing radiation-induced foci formation of NBS1, hMRE11, and hRAD50 in NBS cells (GM7166VA7) or in cells transfected with various mutants of NBS1.Nonirradiated cells (IR−) or cells irradiated with 10 Gy of γ rays (IR+) were fixed at 3 h post-treatment, and immunofluorescent staining with anti-NBS1, anti-hMRE11, or anti-hRAD50 antibody was performed.

These observations suggest the function of NBS1 as a key regulator of both localization and activity of the triple-protein complex. We identified the essential region at codons 665–693 of NBS1 for hMRE11 binding. The present results also showed that the FHA/BRCT domain of NBS1 is essential for nuclear foci formation after DNA damage but not for cellular survival after irradiation. This is confirmed by evidence that foci formation was repressed in FE3-transfected HeLa cells. Zhao et al. (10Zhao S. Weng Y.-C. Yuan S.-S.F. Lin Y.-T. Hsu H.-C. Lin S.-C.J. Gerbino E. Song M.

Nature. 2000; 405: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) reported that the alteration of the phosphorylation site at both Ser273 and Ser343 residues markedly reduced the foci formation and radiation resistance, suggesting phosphorylation of NBS1 is necessary for both foci formation and DNA repair after irradiation. It is consistent with our result that the expression of a mutant NBS1 protein lacking both phosphorylation site and FHA/BRCT domain in GM7166VA cells was unable to complement not only nuclear foci formation of the complex but also radiation resistance of the cells (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that FHA/BRCT domain, possibly sole FHA domain, is essential for the nuclear foci formation of the triple-protein complex together with the presence of both hMRE11-binding domain and the serine residues for phosphorylation.A number of DNA repair-related proteins are known to form nuclear foci in response to DNA damage, such as RAD51, BRCA1, and BLM, as well as the hRAD50·hMRE11·NBS1 complex (1Matsuura S.

In view of this, the failure of the triple-protein complex in the FE3 and BRCT-d clones to form nuclear foci supports the putative functions of the FHA and BRCT domains, namely the FHA domain motif is for protein-protein interactions that recognize the phosphorylation state of the target protein (14Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and the BRCT domain might provide a DNA-binding domain for repair-related proteins (15Yamane K. Turuo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results shown here indicate that FHA/BRCT domain is essential for nuclear foci formation activity following DNA damage, even though they are not directly related to the DNA repair ability itself. This finding is consistent with the fact that most of the DNA double-strand breaks are rejoined within the first hour after irradiation (16Komatu K. Kubota N. Gallo M. Okumura Y. Lieber M.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1774-1779PubMed Google Scholar), but foci formation persists even 5–8 h after irradiation (8Ito A. Tauchi H. Kobayashi J. Morishima K. Nakamura A. Hirokawa Y. Matsuura S. Ito K.

Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is suggested that the nuclear foci formation is not a strict hallmark of DNA repair. Because the FHA/BRCT domain is conserved in eukaryotic NBS1 homologue, they might be involved in other crucial phenotypes of NBS, such as in insuring the fidelity of the rejoined DNA. NBS1 is a responsible gene for Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS),1 a variant of ataxia-telangiectasia.

PMT potentiates the production of inositol phosphates induced by various agonists that function through receptors coupling to G-proteins of the Gq/11 family, and PMT-induced formation of inositol phosphates can be inhibited by guanosine 5′-O-(β-thiodiphosphate) (18Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gq/11 family may be involved in the action of PMT. The Gq/11 family contains four members, of which two, Gq and G11, are expressed in almost all tissues of the mammalian organism and couple heptahelical receptors in a stimulatory fashion to β-isoforms of phospholipase C (18Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for a possible role of Gq/G11 in cellular effects of PMT came from studies in Xenopus oocytes. A PMT-induced Ca2+-dependent chloride current could be suppressed by injection of a Gαq antisense RNA and an antiserum recognizing both Gαq and Gα11(20Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, PMT-induced phosphorylation of ERK-1 was reduced by expression of a C-terminal peptide of Gαq that is believed to interfere with receptor-Gq interaction (21Seo B. Choy E.W. Maudsley S. Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2239-2245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).To determine the exact role of Gq/G11 in various cellular responses of PMT, we have studied the effect of PMT in Gαq/Gα11 double-deficient fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts lacking only Gαq or Gα11. Surprisingly, we found that the formation of inositol phosphates in response to PMT is dependent on Gαq but not on the closely related Gα11. In addition, exposure of cells to PMT induced Rho activation, Rho-dependent stress fiber formation, and activation of MAP kinases in a manner independent of Gαq/Gα11. These data show that PMT leads to pleiotropic effects in a Gαq-dependent and -independent manner.RESULTSFor studies on the possible role of Gq/G11in the cellular effects of PMT, we employed fibroblast cell lines derived from mouse embryos deficient in either Gαq or Gα11 or lacking both G-protein α-subunits. The absence or presence of Gαq and Gα11 was verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Treatment of wild-type mouse fibroblasts with 100 ng/ml PMT for increasing time periods resulted in a marked and time-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphates that could be observed 8 h after addition of the toxin and reached a maximum after about 20 h (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, incubation of Gαq/Gα11 double-deficient fibroblasts for various time periods did not result in any increase in the formation of inositol phosphates (Fig. 2 A). Inositol phosphate production in wild-type cells could be induced with 10 ng/ml PMT and increased dose-dependently up to a concentration of 1000 ng/ml of the toxin (Fig. 2 B). However, even at PMT concentrations that were maximally effective in wild-type fibroblasts, no effect on inositol phosphate levels could be observed in Gαq/Gα11 double-deficient fibroblasts (Fig.2 B). This indicates that G-proteins of the Gq/G11-family are indeed required for PMT-induced inositol phosphate formation.Figure 2Effect of PMT on inositol phosphate production in wild-type and Gαq/Gα11-deficient embryonic fibroblasts. A, wild-type cells (closed circles) and Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells (open circles) were incubated for the indicated time periods (abscissa) in the presence of 100 ng/ml PMT. B, wild-type cells (closed circles) and Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells (open circles) were incubated for 16 h with the indicated concentrations of PMT.

To test whether both Gq and G11 are involved in PMT-induced formation of inositol phosphates, we tested the effect of PMT on inositol phosphate production in cells that lack only Gαq or Gα11 (Fig.3). The expression of either Gq or G11 was sufficient to mediate receptor-dependent phospholipase C activation because inositol phosphate production could be induced by thrombin and bradykinin in Gαq(−/−) as well as in Gα11(−/−) cells, but not in Gαq/Gα11 double-deficient fibroblasts (Fig.3). However, although Gα11-deficient fibroblasts still responded with an increased inositol phosphate production to PMT, Gαq-deficient cells behaved like Gαq/Gα11 double-deficient fibroblasts and were completely unresponsive, indicating that the effect of PMT was mediated solely by Gαq and not by Gα11.Figure 3Effect of PMT and thrombin/bradykinin on inositol phosphate production in embryonic fibroblasts lacking Gαq and/or Gα11. Wild-type cells, Gαq, Gα11, or Gαq/Gα11 double-deficient cells were incubated for 20 h in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml PMT (upper panel) or for 20 min with a mixture of 5 μm bradykinin and 5 units/ml thrombin (lower panel).

Actin filaments were visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, and focal adhesions were stained with an anti-vinculin antibody. In serum-starved fibroblasts lacking Gαq and Gα11, PMT induced a pronounced formation of actin stress fibers and a formation of focal adhesions indistinguishable from its effect in wild-type cells (Fig.4). This indicates that the PMT-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion assembly occurred independently of the Gq/G11-mediated signaling pathway. Preincubation of cells with pertussis toxin did not affect PMT-induced actin stress fiber formation, indicating that G-proteins of the Gi family were not involved. Induction of actin stress fiber formation through various receptors in fibroblasts has been shown to involve a Rho/Rho kinase-mediated signaling pathway (35Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol.

To delineate the role of Gαq/Gα11 in PMT-induced MAP kinase activation, we compared its effect on JNK and ERK activity in wild-type and Gαq/Gα11double-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 7).

The precise molecular mechanism by which PMT acts is, however, still poorly defined. The toxin has only moderate homology to other proteins, and so far no enzymatic activity has been detected. Similar to many other toxins, PMT requires internalization and intracellular processing to exhibit cellular effects. This results in a lag period of a few hours between exposure of PMT to intact cells and the occurrence of cellular changes (16Staddon J.M. Barker C.J. Murphy A.C. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Michell R.H. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4840-4847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It has been suggested that G-proteins of the Gq/11 family are involved in the cellular action of PMT. The two main members of this family, Gq and G11, are structurally and functionally highly homologous and couple receptors in a stimulatory fashion to β-isoforms of phospholipase C (19Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 49Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). An antiserum recognizing the α-subunits of both Gαq and Gα11 blocks a PMT-induced Ca2+-dependent Cl− current inXenopus oocytes, which involves PLC-β (20Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Stimulation of this current by PMT could also be inhibited by the injection of Gαq antisense RNA, whereas sense RNA potentiated the effect of PMT (20Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These data were obtained after injection of PMT into oocytes, which results in a rapid response within seconds after injection. This, however, is a situation completely different from the action of the toxin on intact cells that requires internalization and processing of PMT. In a recent study using HEK-293 cells, it was shown that PMT-induced activation of Erk-1 can be reduced by about 70–80% upon expression of a C-terminal fragment of Gαq that is supposed to act in a dominant negative fashion (21Seo B. Choy E.W. Maudsley S. Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2239-2245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although these studies support an involvement of Gq/G11 in some of the cellular effects of PMT, the evidence provided remains indirect.To study the role of G-proteins of the Gq/G11family in the cellular action of PMT, we used fibroblast cell lines derived from mouse embryos that are deficient in Gαq/Gα11. In wild-type embryonic fibroblasts PMT induced a robust time- and dose-dependent increase in the production of inositol phosphates that could not be observed in fibroblasts lacking both Gαq and Gα11 (Figs. 2 and 3). Embryonic fibroblasts lacking only Gαq did not respond to PMT with inositol phosphate production, whereas PMT lead to a strong response in Gα11-deficient cells, indicating that PMT-induced inositol phosphate production is mediated by Gq and not by G11. This is surprising because evidence collected from biochemical, pharmacological, and somatic cell genetic studies suggested that Gαq and Gα11 have very similar, if not identical, characteristics. Gαq and Gα11 couple to the same set of seven transmembrane receptors with the same effector specificity for phospholipase C-β isoforms (50Wange R.L. Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Although our results in Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells clearly show that the Gq/PLC-β pathway plays an important role in the action of PMT, it has been suggested that PMT can also act independently of PLC-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation (12Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether PMT can still induce other cellular effects in the absence of Gq-dependent signaling. Exposure of Gαq/Gα11-deficient embryonic fibroblasts to PMT resulted in actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly (Figs. 4 and 5). Actin stress fiber formation was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme of C. botulinum as well as by a dominant negative form of Rho kinase and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. This indicates that a Rho/Rho kinase mediated but Gq/PLC-β-independent pathway is involved in this cellular response to PMT. A Rho/Rho kinase-mediated pathway resulting in the inhibition of myosin phosphatase and subsequent increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation has recently been proposed to underlie PMT-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells (13Essler M. Hermann K. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Heesemann J. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5640-5646PubMed Google Scholar). Actin rearrangement induced by PMT in endothelial cells could be completely blocked by an inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated myosin light chain kinase, suggesting that dual regulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation through Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain kinase activation and Rho/Rho kinase-mediated myosin phosphatase inhibition is involved in the effect of PMT on the actin cytoskeleton. Our data, however, suggest that the inhibition of myosin phosphatase through Rho/Rho kinase is sufficient to induce a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in embryonic fibroblasts because it can be observed in the absence of a Gq-mediated inositol phosphate production and subsequent Ca2+ mobilization."

Constitutive expression of MGSA/GROα in melanoma tumors is associated with constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity. We show here that either exogenous addition or continuous expression of MGSA/GROα in immortalized melanocytes enhances NF-κB activation, as well as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MEKK) 1, MAP kinase kinase (MEK) 3/6, and p38 MAP kinase activation. Expression of dominant negative M-Ras (S27N), dominant negative MEKK1 (K432M), or specific chemical inhibitors for p38 MAP kinase (SB202190 and SB203580) block MGSA/GROα-induced NF-κB transactivation, demonstrating that Ras, MEKK1, and p38 are involved in the signal pathways of MGSA/GROα activation of NF-κB. Expression of dominant active Ras or dominant active MEKK1 alone can also stimulate NF-κB activation. The expression of dominant negative MEKK1 inhibits the Ras-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that MEKK1 is a downstream target of Ras. Moreover, MGSA/GROα induction of NF-κB is independent of the MEK1/ERK cascade, because MGSA/GROα failed to increase ERK and ELK activation, and specific chemical inhibitors for MEK1 (PD98059) had no effect on MGSA/GROα-enhanced NF-κB activation.

Receptors for chemokines are traditionally considered to be responsible for the activation of special leukocyte functions such as chemotaxis, degranulation, and the release of superoxide anions. For example, SDF-1α induces tyrosine phosphorylation and association of components of focal adhesion complexes and activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, ERK, and NF-κB in a model of a murine pre-B cell line transfected with the human CXCR4 receptor (18Ganju R.K.

Interleukin-8 activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Ras/Raf pathway is required for human neutrophil migration. However, the regulation of cell migration by interleukin-8 is independent of ERK activation (19Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For some cell types, MGSA/GRO activation of ERK can also be through a Ras/Raf1-independent pathway (20Shyamala V. Khoja H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15918-15924Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms for signal transduction from CXCR2 receptors to transcription factors are poorly understood. MAP kinase pathways are cellular signaling pathways that enable cells to transduce extracellular signals to an intracellular response. To date, four separate MAP kinases have been identified in mammalian cells: ERK, JNK, p38, and BMK1/ERK5. MAP kinases are activated by phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr amino acids by dual specificity MAP kinase kinases (MEKs), which are themselves activated by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MEKKs). MEKKs are the protein serine-threonine kinases that have regulatory sequences for binding the small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins Ras (21Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and Cdc42/Rac (22Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L.

In addition, the expression of antisense p65 blocks cellular transformation (33Higgins K.A. Perez J.R. Coleman T.A. Dorshkind K. McComas W.A. Sarmiento U.M. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It has been reported that there is enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity through Raf-dependent and Raf-independent mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways when oncogenic Ras is overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells (35Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, these experiments were done under conditions in which the Ras or the Ras target is overexpressed. In our mouse immortalized melanocytes system, we could investigate these Ras signaling components in a normal cellular context in response to chemokine stimulation. Our earlier studies showed that MGSA/GRO-induced melanocyte transformation depends on the ability of MGSA/GROα to activate Ras activation through the CXCR2 receptor (36Wang D.Z. Yang W. Du J.G. Devalaraja M.N. Liang P. Matsumoto K. Tsubakimoto K. Endo T. Richmond A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4647-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the downstream components of the Ras-affected pathways in melanoma have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we performed experiments to define the MGSA/GRO intracellular signaling pathways in murine melanoma cells. Our data show that MGSA/GROα induces NF-κB activation as well as MEKK1, MEK3/6, and p38 activity. This MGSA/GROα induction of NF-κB is dependent on activation of the Ras/MEKK/p38 cascade, based upon experiments using dominant negative Ras, dominant negative MEKK1 or p38 inhibitors (SB202190 and SB203580). However, MGSA/GROα activation of NF-κB is independent of the MEK1/ERK/ELK and JNK pathways, because MGSA/GROα fails to induce activation of ERK/ELK and JNK, and the inhibitor for MEK1 (PD98059) has no effect on MGSA/GROα-enhanced NF-κB activation. Finally, we report that this NF-κB activation is required for MGSA/GROα-induced melanocyte transformation. The nontransformed mouse immortalized melanocyte cell line, parental melan-a (gift of Dr. Dorthea Bennett), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 3 mmglutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 200 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (Sigma). The V1, γ3-14, Mel-a-6, E6A, L7A, and R8A clones were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) as described previously (Ref. 11Owen J.D. Strieter R. Burdick M.

The nuclear proteins were extracted from the nuclear pellets using high salt extraction (25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm potassium chloride, and 240 mm sodium chloride) with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors, as described previously (37Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA were performed by incubating 0.25 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide end-labeled with 32P by polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, CA) and equal amounts of nuclear protein (5 μg) for 30 min at room temperature, as described previously (37Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar). The binding reaction mixtures were resolved in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Antibody supershift EMSA were performed by incubating nuclear extract proteins with antibodies (1 μg) against p65, p50, c-Rel, or control antibody r-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at room temperature for 1 h before adding the labeled probe. Whole cell extracts were prepared from control, MGSA/GRO-treated parental melan-a cells, and MGSA/GRO-expressing melan-a cells after serum-free starvation for 4 h. Western blots were performed following protocols provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The cells were washed at 4 °C with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.25–0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 50 μg of soluble protein was boiled, loaded, and electrophoretically separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h and then incubated for 12–16 h at 4 °C in a 1:200 dilution (1 μg/ml) of the anti-p-MEK3/6 (B-9) antibody, the anti-p-p38 antibody (D-8), the anti-p-ERK antibody (E-4), the anti-p-JNK antibody (G-7) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or the anti-p-ELK1 (9181) (New England BioLabs), respectively. Then the membrane was incubated in a 1:3000 dilution of the appropriate anti-mouse, anti-goat, or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TBS-T buffer with 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The protein bands were detected with the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-MEK3 (N-20) and MEK6 (N-19) antibodies, anti-p38 antibody (A-12), or anti-ELK1 antibody (9182) (New England BioLabs). Wild type M-Ras, constitutively active M-Ras (G22V), and dominant negative M-Ras (S27N) expression constructs and pBK-CMV expression vector were gifts from Dr. Takeshi Endo. The dominant active MEKK1 and dominant negative MEKK1 (dN) expression constructs and pCMV5Myc expression vector were gifts from Dr. Melanie Cobb. The NF-κB luciferase reporter gene construct was constructed by inserting two copies of the NF-κB consensus DNA binding sequence into the pGL-3 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The pSV-β-galactosidase expression construct was obtained fromPromega. 4 × 105 cells (6-well plates) were transiently cotransfected with 0.2 μg of NF-κB luciferase reporter gene and 0.4 μg of expression constructs indicated in figures, together with either 0.4 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase or pBL-CAT3 expression construct by the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent following manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three hours later, the cells were incubated with complete medium at 37 °C/5% CO2. The cells were treated with inhibitors, MGSA/GROα, or both, after serum-free starving for 4 h. Two days later, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. The luciferase, β-galactosidase, or CAT activity was measured according to standard protocols (Promega) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) or Beckman LS 3801. Transfection efficiency was monitored by assaying for CAT or β-galactosidase activity derived from a cotransfected expression constructs. All p values were obtained by using the Student's two-tailed t test. Whole cell extracts were prepared from control and MGSA/GROα-treated parental melan-a cells after serum-free starvation for 4 h. MEKK kinase assays were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). 400 μg of protein of each whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated with MEKK1 antibody (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitated MEKK1 activity was assayed using the MEKK1 substrate, GST fusion protein MEK4 (inactivated) (Upstate Biotechnology). Kinase reactions were initiated by addition of 2 μg of GST-MEK4 and kinase buffer containing 500 μm cold ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The phosphorylated bands were visualized by autoradiography. The blot was probed with MEKK1 antibody to monitor equal loading of MEKK1. Focus formation assays were performed in triplicate in three independent experiments. Mel-a-6 cells were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of a puromycin resistant vector (pBABE) and either 2 μg of pCMV4 (vector) or IκB-α (wild type or ΔN) by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.8 mg/ml G418 and 0.5 mg/ml puromycin, and the foci of transformed cells were counted 18 days after transfection. Allp values were obtained by using the Student's two-tailedt test. Earlier results showed high constitutive nuclear NF-κB activity in human Hs294T melanoma cells as compared with normal retinal pigment epithelial cells (37Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar). Hs294T cells secrete a high level of MGSA/GROα protein, whereas retinal pigment epithelial cells cells do not express MGSA/GROα protein (37Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Richmond A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3032-3039PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether MGSA/GROα induces the activation of NF-κB in mouse melanocytes (parental melan-a cells). First, we performed EMSA to evaluate DNA binding activity in parental melan-a cells treated with MGSA/GROα for the indicated times by using a 32P-labeled consensus NF-κB DNA binding sequence as the probe. As seen in Fig. 1 A(left panel), there are two shifted NF-κB nuclear complexes bound to the probe, and MGSA/GROα induces an increase in the formation of these complexes over time (10–120 min). Based on supershift EMSA as shown in Fig. 1 B, the lower band consisted of the p50 homodimer, whereas the upper band is the p65/p50 heterodimer. The antibody to c-Rel did not affect the mobility of the NF-κB complexes (Fig. 1 B). When the ELR motif of MGSA/GROα is mutated, the ligand exhibits marked reduction in its affinity for receptor, CXCR2 (38Hébert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts from MGSA/GROα-expressing clones (Mel-a-6), and each of three ELR motif mutant forms of MGSA/GROα-expressing clones (E6A/ELR, L7A/ELR and R8A/ELR) revealed that overexpression of MGSA/GROα increased the NF-κB p65/p50 heterodimer binding activity, whereas all three ELR motif mutant forms failed to enhance NF-κB binding activity (Fig.1 A, right panel). The V1 clone exhibited higher basal p50 homodimer binding activity than the parental melan-a cells. This low level of p50 homodimer NF-κB in V1 cells correlates with a slightly greater constitutive secretion of MIP-2 (138 pg/ml) and KC (49 pg/ml) in these cells, as compared with the parental melan-a cells (MIP-2 (0 pg/ml) and KC (21 pg/ml); Table II). Taken together, our data suggest that exogenous addition or overexpression of MGSA/GROα in the parental melan-a cells enhances NF-κB binding activity, and the ELR motif of MGSA/GROα is required for this induction.Table IIBasal chemokine expression, ras activity, and NF-κB activity in different clonesClone nameEndogenous MIP-2Endogenous KCRas activityNF-κB activationpg/mlpg/mlParental melan-a cells021 ± 00.51 (a relative value of luciferase activity for parental cells)V1138 ± 2349 ± 212-fold increase as compared to the parental melan-a cellsV1 transfected with pBK-CMV11 (a relative value of luciferase activity for V1 transfected with pBK-CMV)V1 transfected with Ras (wild type)3-fold2.8-fold increase as compared to the V1 transfected with pBK-CMVEndogenous MIP-2 and KC levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from conditioned medium collected from parental melan-a cells or V1 cells grown in the absence of serum.

NF-κB activation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Second, we tested the transactivation of these MGSA/GROα-enhanced NF-κB complexes. The cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by the SV40 promoter containing two copies of the NF-κB consensus element and pSV-β-galactosidase expression construct for internal control. MGSA/GROα-expressing cells (Mel-a-6) exhibited significantly increased NF-κB transactivation (2.5-fold,p < 0.01) compared with the V1 cell. Constitutive expression of ELR mutant forms of MGSA/GROα failed to increase the NF-κB transactivation (Fig. 1 C). The V1 cells exhibited 2-fold higher basal NF-κB transactivation than the parental cells (Fig. 1 C). The observation is consistent with the higher NF-κB binding activity in V1 cells than in the parental melan-a cells. To further confirm that the high basal NF-κB activation in V1 cells is mediated by CXCR2, we tested the ability of a selective CXCR2 inhibitor, SB 225002 (39White J.R. Lee J.M. Young P.R.

To identify the ligand binding pocket in the receptor for complement factor 5a (C5aR), we assessed binding affinities of hexapeptide ligands, each mutated at a single position, for seven mutant C5aRs, each mutated at a single position in the putative ligand binding site. In ChaW (an antagonist) and W5Cha (an agonist), the side chains at position 5 are tryptophan and cyclohexylalanine, respectively. Comparisons of binding affinities indicated that the hexapeptide residue at this position interacts with two C5aR residues, Ile-116 (helix III) and Val-286 (helix VII); in a C5aR model these two side chains point toward one another. Both the I116A and the V286A mutations markedly increased binding affinity of W5Cha but not that of ChaW. Moreover, ChaW, the antagonist hexapeptide, acted as a full agonist on the I116A mutant. These results argue that C5aR residues Ile-116 and Val-286 interact with the side chain at position 5 of the hexapeptide ligand to form an activation switch. Based on this and previous work, we present a docking model for the hexapeptide within the C5aR binding pocket. We propose that agonists induce a small change in the relative orientations of helices III and VII and that these helices work together to allow movement of helix VI away from the receptor core, thereby triggering G protein activation.

Low resolution models of the three-dimensional structure of the seven-helix bundle in the serpentine receptor core were based on patterns of conserved primary structure, biochemical observations with many receptors, and a low resolution electron cryomicroscopy structure of rhodopsin (4Unger V.M.

These similarities make the crystal structure a promising platform for designing and interpreting experiments aimed at elucidating structure and molecular mechanisms of other members of the rhodopsin-like family of serpentine receptors.The mechanism of receptor activation, which is probably highly conserved also, resides in the transmembrane helices (8Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), where most of the evolutionarily conserved residues are located. Indeed, extra- or intracellular loops and termini can be exchanged between different receptors, leaving intact the receptors' capacity to be activated, while swapping ligand or G protein specificity (9Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). How is this conserved activation switch activated by an enormously diverse set of agonist ligands, widely differing in size and chemical character, which must occupy similarly diverse binding pockets in the receptors? Small agonists, including biogenic amines and chromophores, are thought to bind exclusively to a transmembrane receptor pocket; larger ligands, such as oligopeptides and proteins, interact in addition with extracellular domains of their receptors (2Bockaert J.

Taken together, these studies show that receptor activation is mediated by interaction of C-terminal residues of C5a with the receptor's transmembrane helix bundle; hexapeptide ligands analogous to the C-terminal eight residues of C5a interact exclusively with the transmembrane pocket (13DeMartino J.A.

One residue in transmembrane helix V of the receptor, Arg-206, is essential for receptor activation by a hexapeptide agonist; the guanidinium group of Arg-206 interacts with the terminal carboxylate of this agonist, as shown by characterization of simultaneously altered ligand and receptor mutants (21DeMartino J.A.

Unlike its C-terminal residues, remaining regions of C5a sequence interact with the N terminus of the C5aR (14Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S.

These residues are located at positions cognate to positions of residues that are thought to interact with ligands for the β2-adrenoreceptor, rhodopsin, and other serpentine receptors, suggesting that structurally different agonists activate their receptors by a common mechanism, which involves similarly located elements of the receptors' ligand binding pockets. To address this hypothesis, we characterized interactions of C5a and other ligands with C5aR mutants in which alanine or other residues replace natural residues at sites in the putative ligand binding pocket. These experiments identified a transmembrane binding pocket for the antagonist ChaW, as well as an apparent activation switch that involves ligand interaction with adjacent residues in helices III and VII. On this basis we propose a model of the complex of the C5aR with the synthetic antagonist, ChaW. The model and our biochemical observations point to a site for ligand-dependent activation that is probably conserved in many serpentine receptors. Serpentine receptors transmit a diverse array of extracellular stimuli to heterotrimeric G proteins located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. These receptors promote exchange of GTP for GDP bound to the α subunit of the heterotrimer, allowing the α and βγ subunits to disengage from one another and activate intracellular effectors (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Of several serpentine receptor families (2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), the rhodopsin-like family is the largest (3Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Low resolution models of the three-dimensional structure of the seven-helix bundle in the serpentine receptor core were based on patterns of conserved primary structure, biochemical observations with many receptors, and a low resolution electron cryomicroscopy structure of rhodopsin (4Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Three such models, constructed independently (3Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M.

Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Myano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4992) Google Scholar). These similarities make the crystal structure a promising platform for designing and interpreting experiments aimed at elucidating structure and molecular mechanisms of other members of the rhodopsin-like family of serpentine receptors. The mechanism of receptor activation, which is probably highly conserved also, resides in the transmembrane helices (8Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), where most of the evolutionarily conserved residues are located. Indeed, extra- or intracellular loops and termini can be exchanged between different receptors, leaving intact the receptors' capacity to be activated, while swapping ligand or G protein specificity (9Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). How is this conserved activation switch activated by an enormously diverse set of agonist ligands, widely differing in size and chemical character, which must occupy similarly diverse binding pockets in the receptors? Small agonists, including biogenic amines and chromophores, are thought to bind exclusively to a transmembrane receptor pocket; larger ligands, such as oligopeptides and proteins, interact in addition with extracellular domains of their receptors (2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 10Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Ann. Rev.

Progress beyond this generalization has proved difficult; binding interactions have been studied in biochemical detail only for relatively small ligands, such as adrenergic amines and retinal, the chromophore of the visual pigment, rhodopsin (reviewed in Ref. 10Strader C.D.

Here, we investigated the influence of RhoB on signal pathways that are rapidly evoked by genotoxic compounds. The data obtained show that wild-type RhoB neither affects activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases nor AP-1-dependent gene expression. However, RhoB inhibited both basal and genotoxic agent-stimulated activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Thus, RhoB attenuated alkylation-induced increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and abrogated NF-κB-driven gene expression. Furthermore, RhoB inhibited decrease in the cellular amount of IκBα after genotoxic stress as well as after tumor necrosis factor α and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate treatment. This indicates that RhoB represses NF-κB activation by inhibiting dissociation and subsequent degradation of IκBα.

Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). After exposure of cells to genotoxic stress, Rac and Cdc42 trigger, via activation of MAP kinases, the activity of transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, Elk-1, and ATF-2 (18Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thereby, the pattern of gene expression in cells exposed to DNA damage is controled. Another transcription factor that is activated by different types of cellular stress is nuclear factor κB (NF-κB; Refs. 19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

A prerequisite for activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is IKK-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory molecule IκBα (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). On its phosphorylation on Ser32, NF-κB is released for nuclear translocation, and free IκBα is proteasomally degraded (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In the case of treatment of cells with ionizing radiation and UV light, activation of NF-κB occurs independent of phosphorylation of IκBα on Ser32 (21Bender K. Göttlicher M. Whiteside S.

Previously, it was reportet that Rho family GTPases interfere with the TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB (23Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Also, different members of nucleotide exchange factors for Rho proteins are able to stimulate NF-κB (24Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (12785): 12799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that multiple, Rho-regulated pathways are involved in NF-κB regulation. Recently, we have shown that the gene encoding the small GTPase RhoB belongs to the group of immediate-early inducible genes (25Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is activated by genotoxic stress (25Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The regulation of rhoB induction appears to be different from that of c-jun and c-fos (25Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The physiological function of RhoB is largely unknown. One interesting feature of RhoB is that it is essentially required for Ras-mediated transformation (8Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, and because RhoB is subject to modification by farnesylation (28Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RhoB is discussed as a further physiologically relevant target of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (29Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Originally, this type of drug was described as a promising tumortherapeutic acting on Ras (30Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 31Gibbs J.B. Kohl N.E. Koblan K.S. Omer C.A. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Anthony N.Y. Conner M.W. deSolms S.J. Williams T.M. Graham S.L. Hartman G.D. Oliff A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A variety of evidence strongly indicates that the function of RhoB is distinguished from that of other Rho species such as RhoA and RhoC. Thus, RhoB is distinguished from RhoA/RhoC in its C-terminal modification by farnesylation (28Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular localization (32Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and concentration (25Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), association with regulatory proteins (33Zalcman G. Closson V. Camonis J. Honore N.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1935-1945PubMed Google Scholar), endosomal targeting of PRK1 (protein kinase C-related kinase 1) (35Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The latter finding is of particular interest because the rapidly increased expression of rhoB in cells exposed to a genotoxic agent indicates that RhoB plays a role in the cellular response to induced DNA damage. This view gains support from the recent finding that RhoB forces cells to alkylation-induced apoptotic cell death (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because of its GTPase function, it is reasonble to assume that RhoB can influence signal transmission in a very fast manner. Having this in mind, we wondered whether RhoB interferes with early steps of cellular stress response, in particular with stress-induced gene expression participating in the regulation of apoptosis. To address this question, we analyzed the effect of RhoB on the activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB signaling by genotoxic agents. Here, we show that RhoB represses NF-κB signaling without influencing MAP kinase-regulated pathways. Rat rhoB cDNA was provided by T. Hunter. Hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and IKKα antibody was from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany). Other antibodies used in the present study were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) was purchased from Sigma. Mafosfamide was from ASTA Medica (Frankfurt, Germany). The NF-κB-specific reporter gene construct (3xNF-κB-luciferase) was kindly provided by U. R. Rapp. The human collagenase promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltrasferase (Coll-CAT) construct containing the AP-1-regulated fragment (−73/+63) of human interstitial collagenase gene (37Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was obtained from H. J. Rahmsdorf, and the HA-JNK1 expression construct originates from M. Karin. Expression vectors encoding Rho GTPases RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac were a gift from A. Hall. NIH 3T3 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Isolation of RhoB-overexpressing cells has been described previously (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For determination of NF-κB-dependent gene expression, an NF-κB-specific reporter gene construct was used (3xNF-κB-luciferase; Ref. 38Baumann B. Kistler B. Kirillov A. Bergman Y. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11448-11455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection of NIH 3T3 cells together or without an expression vector encoding the corresponding Rho GTPases, cells were exposed to a given genotoxic compound. After an incubation period of 24 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was analyzed using a luciferase assay (Promega). To analyze the effect of Rho GTPases on the activity of the AP-1-regulated collagenase promoter, a human Coll-CAT construct (−73/+63; Ref. 37Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was used for transfection experiments. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and the amount of CAT protein was determined by the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 20–30 μg of protein from nuclear or total cell extracts (1000 × g supernatant) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were wet-blotted to nitrocellulose filters and were detected using the corresponding primary antibodies and subsequently a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Incubation of filters with antibodies was performed for 2 h at room temperature in 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. For visualization of proteins, an ECL detection system was used (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 32P labeling of oligonucleotides was performed using T4 kinase. Total cell extracts were prepared as described (39van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van-der-Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed by incubation of 10 μg of protein from NIH 3T3 extracts with ∼5 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide for 30 min at room temperature (binding buffer, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg poly(dI-dC)). Subsequently, reaction mixtures were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels at room temperature. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The NF-κB specific oligonucleotide was purchased from Promega (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). The sequence of AP-1-specific oligonucleotide was derived from the mouse collagenase promoter (5′-AGTGGTGACTCATCACT-3′). JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase activities were measured by the immune complex assay system after immunoprecipitation of the corresponding kinases from NIH 3T3 cells using monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz). As substrate for the JNK reaction, glutathioneS-transferase-Jun (kindly provided by P. Angel), for p38 kinase, glutathione S-transferase-ATF-2 (Santa Cruz), and for the ERK reaction, myelin basic protein (Sigma) were used. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 40 μl of reaction buffer (JNK/p38 kinase reaction buffer: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μmATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; ERK reaction buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P-ATP]). Alternatively, ERK activity was analyzed by a Western blot-based method as described previously (40Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Determination of IKK activity was performed by the use of an immune complex assay system on immunoprecipitation of Ikkα with a specific antibody (Pharmingen; reaction buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). As a substrate for IKK, recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-IκBα was used. Reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. For quantitation, autoradiograms were densitometrically analyzed. To analyze whether RhoB interferes with the early cellular response to genotoxic stress, we made use of NIH 3T3 cells stably and transiently overexpressing wild-type RhoB protein. For stable transfection, a pCDNA3neo expression vector containing the cDNA sequence for His-tagged wild-type RhoB was used. Cell clones overexpressing RhoB were identified by Western blot analysis using a His-specific antibody (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Activation of MAP kinases represents one type of early cellular response to genotoxic stress that affects gene expression (18Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Comparing parental and RhoB-overexpressing cells with regard to the activation of MAP kinases, we observed a similar level of activation of JNK1, p38 MAP kinase, and ERK2 on treatment with MMS and UV light (Fig. 1 A). In line with this, transient overexpression of RhoB (V14RhoB) also failed to stimulate JNK1 activity (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, as one would expect from data previously reported (15Coso A.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 16Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) was able to activate JNK1 (Fig. 1 B). The UV- and MMS-stimulated increase in the DNA binding activity of AP-1 was similar in RhoB-overexpressing and control cells (Fig.1 C). In accordance, the activity of an AP-1-regulated human collagenase promoter fragment (−73/+63; Ref. 37Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) was not affected by transient overexpression of RhoB, whereas overexpression of Rac and RhoA caused its activation (Fig. 1 D). A stimulatory effect of Rac and RhoA on AP-1 transcription was reported recently for T cells (41Chang J.H. Pratt J.C. Sawasdikosol S. Kapeller R. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4986-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overall, the findings strongly indicate that RhoB is unable to influence activation of MAP kinases and AP-1-regulated gene expression. Another important element involved in the regulation of gene expression induced by cellular stresses is the transcription factor NF-κB (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). To analyze whether RhoB affects NF-κB activity, a32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing an NF-κB-specific consensus sequence was incubated with extracts from wild-type and RhoB-overexpressing cells. After gel electrophoresis, two32P-labeled complexes, the specificity of which was shown by competition experiments, were detected in wild-type cells (Fig.2 A). These complexes are known to consist of p50/p65 heterodimers (complex 1) and p50/p50 homodimers (complex 2), respectively (21Bender K. Göttlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 42Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type cells, extracts from RhoB-overexpressing cells predominantly showed expression of complex 2 (i.e. p50/p50; Fig. 2 A), whereas complex 1 (i.e. p50/p65) was only very poorly detectable (Fig. 2 A). Preincubation of the binding reaction with p50-specific antibody resulted in a strong supershift in control cells (Fig. 2 B). Appearance of the p50-induced supershift is accompanied mainly by a decrease in the intensity of complex 1 (i.e. p50/p65) Under conditions of RhoB overexpression, this supershift was largely reduced (>80%; Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained by the use of an anti-p65 antibody (data not shown). When using the anti-c-Jun antibody as a control, a supershifted, 32P-labeled complex was not observed (Fig.2 B). As determined by Western blot analysis, p50 and p65 protein levels are not changed in RhoB-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, quantitative differences in p50 and p65 protein expression cannot be responsible for the differences in DNA binding activity of NF-κB in RhoB transfectants versus control cells. The question arising next was whether RhoB is able to interfere with drug-induced activation of NF-κB. As analyzed 2 h after exposure of control cells to the alkylating mutagen MMS, DNA binding activity of NF-κB was clearly enhanced. In contrast, MMS failed to stimulate NF-κB binding activity in RhoB-overexpressing cells (Fig.3 A). A mechanism behind the RhoB-triggered inhibition of NF-κB activation on alkylation could be blockage of nuclear translocation of NF-κB. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the appearance of p50 protein in the nuclear fraction after MMS treatment. As shown in Fig. 3 B, an ∼11-fold increase in the amount of p50 protein in nuclear extracts of control cells was detected within 8 h after MMS treatment. RhoB-overexpressing cells, however, did not show elevation of p50 protein level (Fig.3 B). Basically the same results were obtained when translocation of p65 was measured (data not shown). Thus, on the basis of data obtained from both gel retardation experiments and Western blot analysis, we conclude that RhoB impairs the activation of NF-κB in cells exposed to alkylating agents. Recently, it was shown that the DNA binding activity of NF-κB and nuclear translocation are not necessarily related to NF-κB-dependent gene expression (43Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether RhoB exerts an effect on NF-κB-driven gene expression. To this end, transfection experiments using an NF-κB-specific minimal reporter gene construct (3xNF-κB-luciferase) were performed. These studies revealed that both basal and MMS-induced activation of gene expression triggered by NF-κB are largely blocked in RhoB-overexpressing cells (Fig.4 A). We point out that the same is true when the NF-κB reporter construct was transiently coexpressed with wild-type RhoB (Fig. 4 B). Whereas control cells showed a ∼3–5-fold increase in luciferase activity on MMS exposure, stable as well as transient overexpression of wild-type RhoB largely blocked this response (Fig. 4 C). Neither the coexpression of wild-type Rac nor that of RhoA blocked NF-κB signaling (Fig. 4 D). Overall, the data indicate that RhoB acts as an inhibitory component of both basal and MMS-induced NF-κB-regulated gene expression. A prerequisite for NF-κB activation, at least on treatment with TNFα, is IKK-dependent phosphorylation of the inhibitory molecule IκBα (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). On phosphorylation on Ser32, IκBα dissociates from NF-κB and subsequently becomes degraded (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). Genotoxic stress-induced activation of NF-κB appears to be regulated differently from that of TNFα (21Bender K. Göttlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 22Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This is illustrated by the finding that stimulation of NF-κB by UV light results in IKK-independent degradation of IκBα (21Bender K. Göttlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 22Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A possible mode of action of RhoB would be that it inhibits MMS-induced IKK activation. However, similarly, as reported for UV light (22Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), the alkylating agent MMS failed to activate IKK (Fig. 5). Thus, the inhibitory effect of RhoB on MMS-stimulated NF-κB activity cannot be explained by inhibition of IKK. As observed 8 h after MMS exposure, the IκBα protein level was reduced by ∼40% in control cells but remained unchanged in RhoB-overexpressing cells (Fig.6). Obviously, RhoB attenuates the MMS-induced decrease in IκBα.Figure 6RhoB inhibits MMS-induced degradation of IκBα. Up to 8 h after exposure to MMS (1 mm), total cell extract was prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis with regard to the level of IκBα protein. As control for the amounts of protein loaded, filters were rehybridized with an ERK2-specific antibody. Autoradiograms were densitometrically analyzed, and the relative amount of IκBα protein in the untreated control was set to 1.0.Control, NIH 3T3neo cells; RhoB, RhoB-overexpressing cells. Con, untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the question of whether the inhibitory effect of RhoB on NF-κB is specific for alkylating agents, we investigated the effect of RhoB on other NF-κB-activating compounds. As shown in Fig.7 A, RhoB attenuates both UV- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA)-induced increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Also, UV- and TPA-driven reduction in IκBα was abolished by RhoB (Fig. 7, B andC), yet RhoB did not impair activation of ERK2 by TPA, (Fig.7 D) as analyzed in identical extracts. This finding further supports the view that RhoB specifically interferes with NF-κB signaling without affecting MAP kinase-regulated pathways. An inhibitory effect of RhoB on NF-κB-driven gene expression was observed not only for MMS but also for other genotoxic compounds, such as mafosfamide, which is a cyclophosphamid analogue, and UV light (Fig.8). This was shown both by the use of stably transfected cells (Fig. 8 A) and by transient overexpression of wild-type RhoB (Fig. 8 B). Compared with MMS and mafosfamide, the repressive effect of RhoB on UV-induced NF-κB activation was only partial (Fig. 8). This is in line with data obtained from gel retardation experiments shown before (see Fig. 7). Finally, we analyzed whether RhoB interferes with activation of NF-κB by TNFα. As shown in Fig. 9, the TNFα-induced increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (Fig.9 A) as well as the TNFα-driven degradation of IκBα (Fig. 9 B) were partially blocked by RhoB. Obviously, compared with genotoxic agents and TPA, RhoB impairs TNFα-mediated signaling to NF-κB to a lesser extent. TableI summarizes the inhibitory function of RhoB on the effectiveness of different types of agents to evoke IκBα degradation. It turns out that RhoB exerts an inhibitory effect on IκBα degradation stimulated by various types of NF-κB-activating agents, including genotoxic and nongenotoxic compounds. Thus, RhoB appears to interfere with the regulation of different signal pathways converging in the activation of NF-κB.Figure 8RhoB attenuates genotoxic stress-stimulated gene expression regulated by NF-κB.

The gene coding for the small GTPase RhoB is immediate-early-inducible by DNA-damaging agents such as UV irradiation and alkylating compounds (25Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30637-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the basis of this and having in mind its GTPase function, which enables a very rapid modulation of signal mechanisms, we hypothesized that RhoB is important for the regulation of early cellular responses to genotoxic stress. This hypothesis was supported by our recent observation that overexpression of RhoB affects cellular sensitivity to induced DNA damage (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In particular, overexpression of RhoB renders cells hypersensitive to alkylation-induced apoptotic cell death (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the influence of RhoB on signal mechanisms that are quickly activated by DNA-damaging treatments, focusing on MAP kinase- and NF-κB-related mechanisms. Analyzing the influence of RhoB on the stimulation of MAP kinases by UV light and MMS, we found that RhoB-overexpressing cells were not distinguished from the control. Genotoxic stress-induced activation of ERK2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinase were not affected by RhoB. In line with this, the UV- and MMS-stimulated increase in the DNA binding activity of AP-1 was not changed by RhoB. Furthermore, transient overexpression of RhoB failed to stimulate JNK1 activity and did not increase the expression of the AP-1-regulated human collagenase promoter. Obviously, RhoB does not interfere with the genotoxic stress-induced activation of MAP kinases and AP-1-regulated gene expression. In contrast, as revealed by gel retardation experiments, RhoB overexpression causes considerable changes in the basal DNA binding activity of the transcription factor NF-κB. Thus, the NF-κB-specific DNA binding complex p50/p65 was only very poorly detectable in the transfectants. Furthermore, compared with control cells, an anti-p50-antibody-induced supershift was largely reduced under conditions of RhoB overexpression. Because the level of p50 and p65 protein was similar in wild-type and variant cells, we suppose that RhoB overexpression gives rise to posttranslational changes of p50, which in turn affect its interaction with other members of the NF-κB family, in particular Rel A (p65). Most interestingly, RhoB overexpression inhibited stimulation of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB after exposure of cells to the alkylating compound MMS. In line with the current view of NF-κB activation, RhoB-mediated abrogation of NF-κB binding activity was found to be accompanied by inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB in RhoB-overexpressing cells treated with MMS. As a consequence of the inhibition of the ability of NF-κB to enter the nucleus and to bind to DNA, basal and MMS-induced expression of NF-κB-regulated genes is blocked by RhoB. This was shown in reporter gene transfection experiments, which is important to note, because, as reported recently, DNA binding activity of NF-κB is not necessarily related to its capacity to stimulate promoter activity (43Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The same inhibitory effect on NF-κB-regulated gene expression as observed in RhoB-overexpressing cell lines was found in cells transiently coexpressing wild-type RhoB. This shows that stable overexpression of wild-type RhoB is not associated with unphysiological side effects. Inhibition of NF-κB-driven gene expression appears to be very specific for RhoB because it was not observed with with Rac or RhoA. In line with another report, NF-κB activity was even stimulated by RhoA (23Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that overexpression of RhoB results in hypersensitivity to alkylation-induced apoptotic cell death (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Having in mind that NF-κB is believed to act as an antiapoptotic factor (44Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 45Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 46Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C.J. Liu R. Baldwin A.S.J. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the observed inhibitory effect of RhoB on alkylation-triggered NF-κB-regulated gene expression provides an attractive basis to explain the alkylation-hypersensitive phenotype of RhoB-overexpressing cells. With respect to the molecular mechanism underlying RhoB-mediated inhibition of NF-κB, it appears unlikely that RhoB acts as a specific inhibitor of IKK. This assumption is based on the fact that RhoB impairs NF-κB activation by MMS and UV light, both of which exert their stimulatory effect on NF-κB independent of IKK (Ref. 22Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar; data shown here). Furthermore, TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB, which is regulated via IKK, is only partially inhibited by RhoB. A more general event than stimulation of IKK going along with NF-κB activation is proteasomal degradation of IκBα on its release from complexation with NF-κB. Exposure to MMS causes a decrease in the IκBα protein level in control cells but not in RhoB-overexpressing cells. It is striking that the MMS-induced decrease in IκBα level is quite weak compared with other types of stimuli activating NF-κB, yet, discussing this point, one has to consider that activation of NF-κB is basically also possible without IκBα degradation (47Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Notably, RhoB also prevented a decrease in IκBα protein level after treatment of cells with other types of NF-κB-activating stimuli such as TPA, ionizing radiation, UV light and, to a lesser extent, TNFα. An explanation for the reduction in genotoxic stress-induced degradation of IκBα under conditions of RhoB overexpression could be that RhoB prevents proteasomal degradation of IκBα. This, however, appears to be unlikely, because the amount of IκBα protein in RhoB-overexpressing cells is very similar to that of control cells. Interestingly, RhoB abolished TPA-induced degradation of IκBα but did not affect the TPA-induced activation of ERK2. Thus, as already observed for genotoxic stress-induced signaling, RhoB also specifically impairs TPA-stimulated signaling to NF-κB without influencing TPA-triggered activation of MAP kinase. Overall, on the basis of the data available, we suggest that RhoB functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB, counteracting the agent-triggered release of IκBα from complexation with NF-κB. Detailed analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms will be the subject of further investigation. In previous studies, the Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 were shown to activate NF-κB by stimulation of phosphorylation of IκBα (23Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). As shown here, RhoB differs from these Rho GTPases by exerting an opposite, inhibitory effect on NF-κB. RhoB may thus be considered a negative regulator of stress-induced gene expression. In this context, it should be noted that a repressive effect of RhoB on gene expression has indeed been reported previously. Thus, RhoB causes transcriptional repression of its own gene (26Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30637-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), inhibits transforming growth factor β-stimulated gene expression (48Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and impairs the activity of the basal transcription factor DB1 (49Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From these data we hypothesize that the transient induction of RhoB observed after DNA-damaging treatments (25Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) is a homeostatic mechanism, which is important for subsequent down-modulation of genotoxic stress-stimulated gene expression back to the basal level. This may be achieved by inhibition of the activity of one or various transcription factors that become activated by genotoxic treatment. One of these factors is NF-κB. Therefore, we suggest that transient induction of RhoB in cells exposed to a genotoxic agent counteracts coactivated gene expression triggered by NF-κB. The hypothesis of a homeostatic role of RhoB in gene expression is supported by the finding that stimulation of gene expression by transforming growth factor β is accompanied by increase in RhoB protein level (because of RhoB stabilization), which in turn provokes abrogation of the transforming growth factor β response (48Engel M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2089148676,"In addition to promoting protein folding and translocation, molecular chaperones of Hsp70/DnaJ families are essential for the selective breakdown of many unfolded proteins. It has been proposed that chaperones function in degradation to maintain the substrates in a soluble form. In Escherichia coli, a nonsecreted alkaline phosphatase mutant that lacks its signal sequence (PhoAΔ2–22) fails to fold in the cytosol and is rapidly degraded at 37 °C. We show that PhoAΔ2–22 is degraded by two ATP-dependent proteases, La (Lon) and ClpAP, and breakdown by both is blocked in a dnaJ259-ts mutant at 37 °C. Both proteases could be immunoprecipitated with PhoA, but to a much lesser extent in the dnaJ mutant. Therefore, DnaJ appears to promote formation of protease-substrate complexes. DnaJ could be coimmunoprecipitated with PhoA, and the extent of this association directly correlated with its rate of degradation. Although PhoA was not degraded when DnaJ was inactivated, 50% or more of the PhoA remained soluble. PhoA breakdown and solubility did not require ClpB. PhoA degradation was reduced in a thioredoxin-reductase mutant (trxB), which allowed PhoAΔ2–22 to fold into an active form in the cytosol. Introduction of thednaJ mutation into trxB cells further stabilized PhoA, increased enzyme activity, and left PhoA completely soluble. Thus, DnaJ, although not necessary for folding (or preventing PhoA aggregation), is required for PhoA degradation and must play an active role in this process beyond maintaining the substrate in a soluble form.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). Such misfolded proteins may result from nonsense or missense mutations, mistakes in translation, genetic engineering (e.g. gene fusions), failure of a polypeptide subunit to associate with others, or intracellular denaturation (3Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Another way such abnormal proteins may appear in cells is through incorrect localization; for example, if a secretory protein is retained in the cytosol, where it cannot form the correct disulfide bonds due to the reducing environment (5Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the protein is rapidly degraded (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how the cell's proteolytic apparatus recognizes and destroys such abnormal polypeptides while sparing normal cell constituents.Molecular chaperones have been implicated in this degradative process in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells (7Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1996; 77: 57-78PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition to participating in the folding of nascent polypeptides, their translocation across membranes, and the assembly of oligomeric complexes (9Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar, 10Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar), molecular chaperones of the Hsp70/DnaK family and the cofactors of the DnaJ families have recently been shown to play an essential role in protein degradation (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W.

A characteristic feature of Hsp70/DnaK is its ability to bind selectively to hydrophobic oligopeptides or unfolded proteins in extended conformations, where such domains may be exposed (13Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 14Rudiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct.

DnaJ stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK (16Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 17Russell R. Wali Karzai A. Mehl A.F. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and by itself can also bind to certain unfolded proteins (18Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M.

Both components can thus possibly facilitate the recognition of substrate conformations or act as cofactors in the degradative process.Among the first examples of the involvement of DnaJ/DnaK in the degradation of a specific abnormal protein was alkaline phosphatase (PhoA61), which is not secreted from the cytosol due to a missense mutation in its signal sequence (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Its rapid degradation at 37 °C is mediated in part by the ATP-dependent protease La (Lon) and also requires DnaK, because a dnaK- null mutant completely prevents its breakdown. Interestingly, dnaK756, a missense mutation that fails to release substrates in response to ATP, was found to enhance PhoA61 degradation, whereas a dnaJ mutant, which reduced PhoA61 association with DnaK, slowed its turnover. Thus, complex formation between PhoA61 and DnaK appears essential for its rapid degradation. Presumably, the successful folding or secretion of a normal polypeptide involves only transient association with DnaK. We therefore proposed that the chaperone, through its prolonged association with a nonfoldable protein, may trigger proteolysis, perhaps by helping to stabilize an abnormal polypeptide in an unfolded, extended conformation that favors recognition or digestion by the protease.One characteristic feature of unfolded proteins is their tendency to aggregate, and an important function of molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 and DnaJ families is to prevent this process in vivo(15Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 22Gragerov A. Nudler E. Komissarova N. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Nikiforov V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10341-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, together with ClpB, can promote the solubilization of aggregated proteins (23Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 24Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) inEscherichia coli, as can their homologs in yeast. It has been suggested that the primary function of DnaJ/DnaK in proteolysis is to help maintain unfolded proteins in a soluble form, which should render them more susceptible to proteolytic attack (25Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In several cases, undegraded abnormal proteins have been found to accumulate as intracellular aggregates. For example, in E. coli, the degradation of the short-lived transcription factor, RcsA, by protease La was retarded in a dnaJ mutant, where a significant fraction of RcsA was found in particulate form (26Jubete Y. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30798-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, in yeast mitochondria, the degradation by the ATP-dependent protease, Pim1 (a homolog of La), of two fusion proteins, bovine lactalbumin and cytochrome b 2-DHFR, requires the DnaK homolog mt-Hsp70 and the DnaJ homolog Mdj1 (11Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mdj1, these fusion proteins formed insoluble aggregates. However, in these chaperone-deficient cells, there was no evidence that the aggregation of these substrates actually caused the block in proteolysis and was not a consequence of the reduced degradation. In other words, if the chaperones are required directly in the degradative process, when degradation is blocked in the chaperone mutants, the unfolded polypeptides that accumulate may then tend to aggregate. Thus, establishing direct involvement of DnaK/DnaJ (Hsp70/40) in the proteolytic pathway is difficult, because the association of these chaperones with the substrate may be important both for facilitating proteolytic attack and for promoting the proper folding of the substrate.To distinguish these possibilities and to clarify the role of the chaperones in the breakdown of unfolded proteins, we have studied the cytosolic degradation of a nonsecreted alkaline phosphatase lacking the entire signal sequence (PhoAΔ2–22) (27Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The present studies have focused on the role(s) of DnaJ, because this chaperone has been suggested to bind directly to certain denatured proteins and favor DnaK binding to the substrate (20Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and also to play a crucial role in preventing aggregation of abnormal proteins (28Schroder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In the reducing environment of E. coli cytosol, the normally periplasmic PhoA cannot form the disulfide bonds necessary for the protein to acquire an active conformation (5Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, in a mutant strain lacking thioredoxin reductase (trxB), the cytosol has less reducing potential, and some PhoA(Δ2–22) has been shown to fold into an active enzyme (29Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We have therefore also used the trxB strain to test whether the rapid degradation of PhoA is in fact due to its failure to achieve the native conformation and to determine what role DnaJ might play when folding and degradation of this protein can both occur.DISCUSSIONThe present studies indicate that the molecular chaperone, DnaJ, plays multiple roles in determining the fate in the cytosol of a nonsecreted alkaline phosphatase molecule, PhoA(Δ2–22). Normally, when a signal peptide is present, DnaJ, together with DnaK and GrpE, promotes translocation of this enzyme into the periplasm (36Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 37Wild J. Rossmeissl P. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3608-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When export is impossible, DnaJ, apparently with DnaK and GrpE (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), carries out some function essential for rapid degradation of this unfolded protein by the ATP-dependent proteases La (Lon) and ClpAP. Although DnaJ was found to help maintain this protein in a soluble form (for example, in the lon-ClpP mutant cell, where degradation is not possible), DnaJ clearly must play additional role(s) in PhoA degradation beyond preventing the substrate from forming insoluble aggregates. When DnaJ was inactivated, at least half of the PhoA molecules remained soluble at 100,000 × g, yet they were not degraded. Furthermore, when a favorable redox environment was provided (i.e. in the trxB mutant cells), in which some PhoA can fold into its native form, DnaJ was still required for its degradation, but was not necessary for the prevention of aggregation or for the proper folding of the active enzyme.Previous findings in E. coli (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and yeast mitochondria (11Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) have implicated the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones in the rapid breakdown of certain abnormal proteins by ATP-dependent proteases. Both the DnaK and DnaJ families of chaperones are known to bind selectively to unfolded proteins (9Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3575) Google Scholar, 15Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 16Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 17Russell R. Wali Karzai A. Mehl A.F. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and in this way, they may promote the degradative process by facilitating the recognition of unfolded proteins as substrates by the proteases. Alternatively, by maintaining the substrates in an unfolded conformation, these chaperones may function as cofactors that facilitate digestion by the proteases. Studies with another nonsecreted variant, PhoA61, which contains a point mutation in the signal sequence, had suggested a kinetic partitioning model for chaperone function, in which a prolonged association of the substrate with DnaK would favor proteolytic attack and help distinguish appropriate substrates for degradation from normal cell constituents (7Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Exper. Suppl. (Basel). 1996; 77: 57-78PubMed Google Scholar). Successful folding of a protein, as occurs normally for most proteins, would involve only a transient association with the chaperones, whereas an extended association, as may occur with a highly abnormal mutant protein or an irreversibly damaged polypeptide, would favor its proteolytic digestion.The present finding that the association of PhoA with DnaJ correlates with its rapid degradation is consistent with this proposed mechanism. At 30 °C, where PhoA was relatively stable, or at 37 °C in thednaJ259 mutant, where PhoA degradation was blocked, much less soluble PhoA was associated with DnaJ than in the wild-type at 37 °C. By contrast, in a strain carrying a nondissociating DnaK mutation (dnaK756), where the amount of DnaJ complexed with PhoA was at least 5-fold higher than in the wild-type, PhoA degradation was enhanced at least 2-fold. In our prior studies, we had observed that the extent of DnaK association with PhoA61 (in dnaK756 and dnaK deletion strains) also correlated with the rate of its hydrolysis (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). (Those earlier studies, in contrast with the present ones, failed to demonstrate an association of PhoA with DnaJ because of the use of the detergent Triton X-100 in the buffers.) Thus, these findings together strongly suggest that prolonged association of this unfolded protein with DnaJ and DnaK facilitates its hydrolysis. However, these coimmunoprecipitation data only demonstrate correlations with the amount of PhoA present in complexes with the chaperones; the data do not distinguish whether rapid degradation may in fact be due to the presence of more molecules of the chaperone in complexes with the substrate or to a more prolonged or a tighter association of the substrate with the same number of chaperone molecules.Although not directly demonstrated in these experiments, it seems very likely that DnaJ and DnaK are present together in the same complexes with PhoA, as was found for certain other denatured proteins (16Laufen T.

For example, in the dnaK756 mutant, which is defective in ATP-dependent dissociation from PhoA, more PhoA was associated with DnaJ than in the wild-type. Also, thednaJ259 mutation, which is located in the highly conserved “J” domain that interacts with DnaK and thus causes a defective association with DnaK (39Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2139-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed a dramatically reduced association with PhoA. This in vivo failure of dnaJ259 to bind to PhoA is noteworthy, because no deficiency had been observed previously in its binding to model substrates in vitro. It is not clear if DnaJ and DnaK influence degradation rates independently or if one chaperone acts by influencing binding of the other as suggested by the results with the dnaK756 mutant. Such mechanistic questions will be best analyzed with pure componentsin vitro.The present results, although indicating a requirement of DnaJ for proteolysis, also support the view that one function of this chaperone in cells is to prevent PhoA aggregation into insoluble inclusions, because 30–50% of the newly synthesized PhoA accumulated in rapidly sedimenting fractions in the dnaJ mutant. A role for DnaJ in maintaining denatured proteins in a soluble form has been established in several studies (28Schroder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 40Prip-Buus C. Westerman B. Schmitt M. Langer T. Neupert W. Schwarz E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), especially in concert with DnaK (23Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 24Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and also ClpB (23Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, the rapid breakdown of two fusion proteins by the Pim1 protease (a homolog of protease La) required the mitochondrial DnaJ homolog Mdj-1, and in its absence, some of these proteins accumulated as insoluble aggregates (11Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Similarly, inE. coli, the rapidly degraded transcriptional activator RcsA was stabilized in a dnaJ mutant, and a large fraction of the RcsA was found in insoluble aggregates (26Jubete Y. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30798-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that the primary role of DnaJ, and by extension DnaK and GrpE, in protein breakdown is to maintain the substrate soluble and therefore susceptible to the protease (25Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that maintenance of these molecules in a soluble form is actually essential for proteolysis. Although it is likely that proteolytic attack on aggregated substrates may be slower and less efficient than degradation of soluble proteins (at comparable concentrations), the automatic assumption (25Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) that polypeptides in particulate fractions cannot be digested by soluble proteases seems unwarranted. Indeed, it has long been known that denatured proteins, once in large inclusion bodies, can still be rapidly hydrolyzed to amino acids (41Prouty W.F. Karnovsky M.J. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1112-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Prouty W.F. Goldberg A.L. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 240: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that protease La can digest insoluble, membrane-associated proteins (43Goff S.A. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4508-4515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Rapid digestion of such aggregated species may also require the involvement of molecular chaperones to promote substrate solubilization, and for this reason, we investigated the possible involvement in PhoA breakdown of ClpB, which can function with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE to solubilize aggregated proteins (23Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). ClpB, unlike DnaK and DnaJ, was not necessary for proteolysis. However, theclpB strain did consistently show a small reduction in PhoA breakdown, perhaps because a minor portion of the substrate was particulate and may require this chaperone for solubilization prior to DnaJ-dependent degradation.Although earlier studies (26Jubete Y. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30798-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), like the present ones, have demonstrated a tendency of the stabilized abnormal proteins to aggregate, they did not show (but assumed) that aggregation is the cause of the stabilization. On the contrary, the present findings clearly indicate an important additional function of chaperones in proteolysis, because in the dnaJ mutant, degradation was abolished completely, although at least half of the nondegraded PhoA remained soluble at 100,000 × g. Perhaps the best evidence for a role of DnaJ in facilitating the degradative process came from thetrxB strains, where the dnaJ mutant completely blocked PhoA degradation, even though none of the substrate was aggregated.In these trxB mutants, where a large fraction of the PhoA was able to fold into the active conformation, the inactivation of DnaJ led to a 3-fold increase in PhoA enzymatic activity. This increase in activity was most likely due to the increase in the amount of soluble PhoA that resulted from blocking its degradation. In other words, by promoting PhoA degradation, DnaJ appears to suppress the folding process. Such a role for DnaJ is supported by the finding that overexpression of DnaK and DnaJ reduced the cytosolic accumulation of a cloned human polypeptide (SPARC), presumably by increasing its degradation, and it also reduced the yield of SPARC with correct disulfide bond formation in a trxB mutant (44Schneider E.L. Thomas J.G. Bassuk J.A. Sage E.H. Baneyx F. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1997; 15: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DnaJ itself has been reported to possess disulfide oxidoreductase activity in vitro (45de Crouy-Chanel A. Kohiyama M. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22669-22672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that this activity may help maintain certain proteins, such as PhoA, in an unfolded conformation in vivo (e.g. in atrxB cell).These findings suggest that an essential function of DnaJ and DnaK in proteolysis is to facilitate the binding of substrates to the ATP-dependent proteases, ClpAP or La, or to stabilize these enzyme-substrate complexes once they are formed. The chaperones may promote the recognition of the partially unfolded protein by maintaining certain domains in a conformation that is particularly susceptible to association with the proteases. The critical finding here is that, when DnaJ was defective, very little La or ClpAP appeared to be associated with PhoA. These results indicate for the first time a requirement for DnaJ for the formation of degradative complexes between a substrate and the proteases that digest it. An analogous role of a DnaJ homolog in targeting a substrate to proteolysis has been proposed in yeast cytosol, based on the finding that binding of the DnaJ homolog Ydj1 was necessary for ubiquitin conjugation to a rapidly degraded protein (12Lee D.H. Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An additional example of Ydj1 maintaining a substrate in a conformation that allows enzymatic attack is in the ubiquitination of the Cln3 cyclin. In this case, Ydj1 binding to Cln3 was required for Cln3 phosphorylation by p34Cdc28, which in turn triggers ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (46Yaglom J.A. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other chaperone systems have also been implicated in “presenting” substrates for proteolysis or helping maintain them in conformations that allow proteolytic attack; for example, the rapid degradation of the fusion protein, CRAG, in E. coli requires a specific association between the substrate GroEL and Trigger Factor (TF) (31Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kandror O. Sherman M. Rhode M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6021-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 48Kandror O. Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37743-37749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).It is very unlikely that the requirement for DnaJ in proteolysis is for the folding, assembly, or activation of these two ATP-dependent proteases. Inactivation of these enzymes seems unlikely in these experiments, because the cells were grown at 30 °C and switched to 37 °C for only 20 min, which was sufficient to prevent complex formation between the protease and the substrate. In addition, hydrolysis of specific fluorogenic peptide substrates by these proteases occurred at similar rates in extracts of the wild-type and dnaJ mutant strains, and complex formation between ClpA and ClpP occurred whether or not DnaJ was functional. Finally, Jubeteet al. (26Jubete Y. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30798-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have noted that inactivation of DnaJ stabilized some protein substrates of protease La, but not others. Therefore, the chaperone must instead be necessary for substrate recognition or rapid digestion.An important feature of the degradation of PhoA shown here is that this process is catalyzed by two very different proteases, La and ClpAP. The two ATP-dependent proteases contribute about equallyin vivo, and each can degrade the substrate apparently without the involvement of the other. Degradation by both proteases is likely to occur in a highly processive fashion, because no intermediate fragments of PhoA were observed; also with each, relatively stable substrate-protease complexes could be captured by coimmunoprecipitation. Previous findings with PhoA61 (6Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and CRAG (31Kandror O. Busconi L. Sherman M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem"

Rhodopsin is embedded in the membranes of the rod outer segment, which are arranged in a long, closely spaced stack of disc-like saccules. Gt is bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the disc membranes. To provide an effective target for the light, rhodopsin is very densely packed, so that the receptor accounts for half of the dry weight of the disc membranes. It is composed of the apoprotein opsin, comprising seven transmembrane helices and the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which is covalently bound to Lys296 in the seventh helix via a protonated Schiff base and acts as a highly effective inverse agonist. Following the absorption of a photon, the retinal isomerizes to a strained all-trans conformation, which induces a series of conformational rearrangements of the opsin moiety. The final product of this reaction sequence is the active metarhodopsin II (Meta II) conformation, which contains all-trans-retinal as a covalently bound agonist, and is capable of catalyzing the activation of the retinal G-protein transducin (for reviews see Refs. 1Hofmann K.P.

Identified physicochemical events that accompany the transition into the active state include proton transfer reactions and helix movements. Deprotonation of the Schiff base bond, protonation of its counterion Glu113, and the uptake of a proton from the aqueous solution (4Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) mediated by the highly conserved opsin residue Glu134 are determinants of the active state. Based on computer simulations and mutagenesis studies, similar results have been obtained for the α1B-adrenergic receptor (5Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa I. De-Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6Scheer A. Fanelli F. Diviani D. De-Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Eur. Urol. 1999; 36: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The disc membrane is distinguished by its content of large amounts of highly unsaturated (22:6n-3) acyl chains in its major phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (7Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). A lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids causes abnormalities in visual function (8Bush R.A. Malnoe A. Reme C.E. Williams T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 91-100PubMed Google Scholar, 9Anderson R.E. Maude M.B. Narfstrom K. Nilsson S.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The high fluidity and other properties of the membrane's special composition may be crucial for the anchoring of G-protein and effector to the membrane surface, and thus, for proper signal transduction in the disc membrane. Understanding of the role of membrane properties in signal transduction is, at the physicochemical level, still incomplete. However, with regard to photoreceptor function, there are two identified determinants, namely, the formation of the active intermediate and the transport of the hydrophobic retinal ligand. Rhodopsin's active Meta II conformation depends on the composition (10Gibson N.J. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2438-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and the physical properties of the lipid bilayer (11Mitchell D.C. Kibelbek J. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8107-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Mitchell D.C. Lawrence J.T.R. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19033-19036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Its formation goes along with a number of physicochemical alterations, including a considerable reaction volume, and changes of the interfacial potential, positive relative to the aqueous exterior of the disc, within a boundary region of the native isolated disc membrane near the cytoplasmic surface. Electrical effects can be measuredin situ, namely, as a component of the “early receptor potential.” The most recent development is the “early receptor current” technique, realized in a unicellular expression system (13Sullivan J.M. Shukla P. Biophys. J. 1999; 77 (Comment: 1189–1191): 1333-1357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed changes in the molecular environment of lipid after transition of rhodopsin to Meta II (14Beck M. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After the decay of the active photoproduct into the apoprotein opsin and the photolyzed chromophore, all-trans-retinal, the phospholipid PE forms the condensation productN-retinylidene-PE (15Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), suggested to be the putative substrate for the ABC transporter. A concurrent process is the formation of an active complex between the retinal and the apoprotein, which depends on the presence of the palmitates at C-terminal cysteines, thus suggesting a role of lipid host in its formation (16Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Clearly, understanding the role of phospholipids in these functions will require information about the lateral and transbilayer distribution and dynamics of lipids in the disc membrane. The transbilayer distribution of the main phospholipids in disc membranes in the dark is nearly symmetric for PC and PE but asymmetric for PS, favoring the outer (cytoplasmic) leaflet of the membrane (17Wu G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The electrical asymmetry of the rhodopsin molecule, normal to the membrane plane, has been made responsible for the asymmetry of the lipid distribution strongly supported by studies on disc membranes in the dark (19Tsui F.C. Sundberg S.A. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 85-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 99-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, rhodopsin plays an essential role in organization of the disc membrane lipid phase. Accordingly, it is reasonable to anticipate that activation of rhodopsin affects its interaction with and the organization of the lipid phase as well. However, despite the quite detailed literature about the resting dark state, the problem of measuring possible effects of the light stimulus on the distribution of the different lipids has never been addressed. In this study, we therefore explored the possibility to assay the distribution of phospholipids in disc membranes after illumination, using spin-labeled lipid analogues (SL-PC, SL-PS, and SL-PE) and the BSA back-exchange assay (21Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 22Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). Analyzing the ESR spectra of both the supernatants and the membranes, we found characteristic time-dependent changes in the amount of SL-PL extractable from the outer membrane leaflet after illumination with activating wavelengths. Peptides from the Gt sequence, which are known to stabilize active Meta II, enhance the extraction of PS from the outer leaflet, supporting a direct role of the active photoproduct. The effects observed with SL-PC and SL-PE are complex and may reflect an involvement of these lipids in retinal binding and transport. Spin-labeled phospholipid analogues were synthesized as described previously (21Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 22Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F.

Synthesis and purification of the peptide Gtα-(340–350)HAA were as described before (24Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence for the high affinity analogue of Gtα-(340–350) was [Gtα-(340–350)HAA; VLEDLKSCGLF]. All chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All procedures were carried out in dim red light. The bovine ROS membranes were isolated from frozen bovine retinae (50 per preparation) and prepared according to standard procedure (25Kuhn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Disc vesicles were prepared following a previous procedure (26Smith Jr., H.G. Stubbs G.W. Litman B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, fresh prepared ROS were shocked hypotonically in aqua dest and centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 3.5% (w/v) Ficoll 400. The sample was left for 12 h at 4 °C to allow complete osmotic bursting of the ROS. The intact discs were harvested from the surface of the Ficoll 400 solution after centrifugation at 132,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the discs were washed in 5% (w/v) sucrose and resuspended in sucrose/Hepes buffer (5% (w/v) sucrose, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0). To prepare isolated discs the suspension was pressed through a filter with 2-μm pores (Nucleopore filter) and were used immediately. All measurements were done in the vesicle resuspension medium (5% (w/v) sucrose solution, 100 mmHepes buffer, 1 mm Mg-ATP; pH 7.0 ± 0.1, osmotic pressure of 360 ± 20 mosmol) in the dark at 20 °C. The rhodopsin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (extinction coefficient of 40,000 cm−1m−1) in the presence of 5% (w/v) lauryldimethylamine oxide. The disc suspensions were diluted in their respective medium to a final concentration of 120 μm rhodopsin (stock suspension). The ATP content of preparations was measured using the bioluminescent assay kit HS II containing the luciferin-luciferase assay. The emitted light was detected using a luminometer (LB 9500, Berthold Co., Germany). The interaction of the synthetic peptide Gtα-(340–350)HAA with rhodopsin was used to study the influence on the phospholipid distribution in disc membranes (pH 7.0) after illumination at 20 °C. The vesicle suspension containing 20 μm rhodopsin was preincubated with 200 μm Gtα-(340–350)HAA in the dark. The kinetics of the spin-labeled phospholipid distribution was followed as described. Spin-labeled phospholipid analogues carrying a long-chain fatty acid at thesn-1 position and a short spin-labeled fatty acid at thesn-2 position with a paramagnetic nitroxide group at the fourth carbon position were synthesized as described above. Ten minutes before labeling, the disc membranes were supplemented with 5 mm DFP at 20 °C to minimize hydrolysis of spin-labeled phospholipids. For labeling in the dark, disc membrane suspensions (20 μm rhodopsin concentration) were mixed with the label suspension representing time zero for all kinetic measurements. The final label concentration corresponded to 2 mol% of total phospholipids. The rapid incorporation of analogues into the disc membrane (data not shown) was in agreement with our recent study found in various disc membrane preparations (pH 7.4) at 25 °C (18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After insertion of spin-labeled phospholipids into the outer membrane leaflet of discs at 20 °C, the time-dependent redistribution of the SL-PL in the membrane was measured using the BSA extraction method (27Haest C.W. Plasa G. Deuticke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F.

At times indicated in the figures, 50-μl aliquots from the labeled membrane suspension were mixed with 25 μl of fatty acid-free BSA solution (3% final concentration (w/v)) for 1 min to extract all lipid analogues accessible to BSA (18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The incubation was performed on ice, to reduce transbilayer movement of lipids, thus avoiding redistribution of SL-PL from the inner to the outer leaflet during BSA extraction. After centrifugation (2 min, 52,000 × g), supernatant (50 μl) and pellet (the latter was washed again) were frozen separately for further analysis (see below). The transbilayer movement and distribution of SL-PL between both leaflets of disc membranes was followed in the dark at 20 °C as described above. After 60 min, when the equilibrium of SL-PL distribution was reached (see “Results”), the vesicle samples (350 μl, 20 μm rhodopsin concentration) were illuminated with 520- or 670-nm light for 1 min at 20 °C. To prevent a warming up of the samples, a cuvette was filled with water and located between the filter and the sample tube during illumination. The illumination of vesicles with 520-nm light bleached more than 85% of the rhodopsin and resulted in a high concentration of active Meta II in the membranes under the experimental conditions (pH 7.0, 20 °C), in equilibrium with Meta I. Immediately after illumination, the extraction of SL-PL to BSA was assayed in 1-min intervals in the dark at 20 °C. To study the label distribution in these short intervals, the BSA back-exchange assay was performed on two samples time-shift started. The amount of SL-PL in the samples (supernatant and pellet) was determined from the ESR spectra (Bruker ECS 106 spectrometer, Karlsruhe, Germany). To reoxidize reduced nitroxide moieties, potassium ferricyanide (10 mm final concentration) was generally added. In the presence of the DFP analogue, hydrolysis was less than 10% after 120 min under the described conditions. The correction of the hydrolysis component was obtained by computer subtraction as described previously (22Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Experimental data are presented in the figures as the amount of nonextractable spin-labeled phospholipid analogues contained in the inner leaflet of the membranes. Additionally, the signal intensity of the BSA-containing supernatants was estimated. The increase with time of the nonextractable fraction was fitted to exponential functions, using a least-square-fitted procedure. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were performed using a test for a nonparametric variance analysis. The experimental strategy was as follows:1.The transmembrane redistribution of each of the three spin-labeled phospholipids, SL-PS, SL-PC, and SL-PE, was determined in disc membranes in the dark at pH 7.0 and 20 °C using the BSA back-exchange and ESR spectroscopy.2.After equilibration between both leaflets (i.e.stable plateau of the transbilayer distribution) of SL-PL in the dark, the disc vesicles were illuminated for 1 min driving rhodopsin into the Meta II state, and the SL-PL distribution was followed.3.Different illumination and peptide stabilization protocols were used to assign the measured effects to the signaling state for the G-protein, Meta II. The transmembrane redistribution of each of the three spin-labeled phospholipids, SL-PS, SL-PC, and SL-PE, was determined in disc membranes in the dark at pH 7.0 and 20 °C using the BSA back-exchange and ESR spectroscopy. After equilibration between both leaflets (i.e.stable plateau of the transbilayer distribution) of SL-PL in the dark, the disc vesicles were illuminated for 1 min driving rhodopsin into the Meta II state, and the SL-PL distribution was followed. Different illumination and peptide stabilization protocols were used to assign the measured effects to the signaling state for the G-protein, Meta II. The distribution of SL-PL was calculated from ESR spectra of the disc membrane pellet and of the supernatants after BSA back-exchange as described previously (18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In each case, a stable equilibrium distribution was reached with a mean half time of less than 4 min. The equilibrium distribution, expressed as the percentage of respective endogenous phospholipid species, is given in Fig.1. It is estimated on the relative amounts of lipids, 45 mol% PC, 41.3 mol% PE, and 13.7 mol% PS, as determined in a previous study (28Boesze Battaglia K. Albert A.D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 821-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SL-PS, but not SL-PC and SL-PE, shows a distinct asymmetry, which favors SL-PS in the outer (cytoplasmic) leaflet. The estimated ATP concentration after preparation of the membranes was 0.6 ± 0.5 μmATP/mM rhodopsin (18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After reaching the equilibrium in the dark, the vesicles were illuminated with 520-nm light for 1 min at 20 °C, bleaching >85% of the rhodopsin. The subsequent extraction of SL-PL by BSA was assayed in 1-min intervals in the dark. A typical record of SL-PS distribution after illumination is presented in Fig.2, demonstrating the variability of the data between the smallest and largest effect of illumination. Fig. 3, A–C, shows the remaining amount of SL-PL in membranes after BSA extraction, with and without illumination at t = 60 min (open andclosed symbols, respectively); a complementary amount of SL-PL was found in the BSA-containing supernatants (data not shown).Insets show the same data in an enlarged scale. In the case of the PS analogue (Fig. 3 A), the illumination induces a significant and reversible effect on extraction of the analogue. Three minutes after illumination (at t = 63 min) 6% of the SL-PS becomes more extractable by BSA from the outer leaflet. In contrast to SL-PS, SL-PC becomes less extractable after illumination (Fig. 3 B). A maximal value of 4% increase of nonextractable SL-PC at t = 63 min was found, with a subsequent slow return to the dark level. For SL-PE (Fig. 3 C), the kinetics of redistribution are more complex. Some samples showed a transient increase and decrease of the extractable lipid and a final maximum level with a value of 4% at t = 70 min that decayed slowly to the dark level. As a control, the vesicle suspension was illuminated with 670-nm light, which does not activate rhodopsin. Under this condition, no significant light-induced effect was found with any of the SL-PLs. To elucidate whether the effect of illumination with 520 nm on extraction of SL-PS and SL-PC depends on ATP, the experiments were performed in the absence of Mg-ATP. No influence was found for SL-PS and SL-PC as presented in Fig. 4,A and B. To study the effect of rapid Meta II decay (29Hofmann K.P. Emeis D. Schnetkamp P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 725: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), some suspensions were incubated with hydroxylamine (0.2 and 1 mm for 10 min at 20 °C) before addition of the SL-PL. However, these samples gave unstable data, presumably because of a direct effect of hydroxylamine on the spin-label compounds (data not shown). The synthetic peptide Gtα-(340–350)HAA interacts specifically with Meta II and can therefore be used to specify the measured effects of illumination. The vesicle suspension (20 μm rhodopsin) was preincubated with 200 μmGtα-(340–350)HAA. In the dark, SL-PL redistribution occurred with the same kinetics in the presence or absence of the peptide (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows measurements for SL-PS in the membrane pellet that followed the same protocol as was applied in Figs. 2 and 3. Gtα-(340–350)HAA seems to enhance the effect of illumination on extraction of SL-PS, although no significant effect was found for SL-PC (Fig. 6).Figure 6Influence of Gtα-(340–350)HAA-peptide on SL-PC extraction. Protocol was analogous to Fig. 5, but data are for SL-PC presented for two independent measurements. Illumination and BSA extraction were as in Figs. 2 and 3. The change of SL-PC extraction was equivalent to a decreased extraction by BSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we examined the effect of a functional associated conformational change of a receptor membrane protein, the rhodopsin molecule on the organization of the phospholipid bilayer. Rhodopsin belongs to that class of membrane-spanning receptors, which transmit their signal into the cell interior by coupling to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins or G-proteins (G-protein-coupled receptors). The G-protein heterotrimer, composed of the α-subunit (Gtα) and the undissociable βγ-subunit complex (Gtβγ) reaches the receptor by diffusion on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane and couples its seven-helix transmembrane structure at the cytoplasmic face. Stimulus receptors induce exchange of GTP for GDP on Gtα and dissociation of Gtα from Gtβγ. Both GtαGTP and Gtβγ can interact with various membrane-bound effector molecules. We have studied the effect of the light signal on the organization of spin-labeled phospholipid analogues in the rod disc membrane, in particular, the kinetics of phospholipid transmembrane movement and their distribution of those analogues in the dark and after illumination. The transmembrane (re)distribution was assessed by back-exchange assay of analogues to BSA. We find a substantial rearrangement of phospholipid organization as a consequence of the reception of the light signal and formation of the active intermediate in rhodopsin. Although we did not attempt to provide mechanistic conclusions in this initial work, our results provide strong evidence for the dynamic interaction of rhodopsin with the lipid phase of the disc membranes. To obtain a basis for the study of the light-induced effect, we first tested the SL-PL distribution of discs in the dark. It was found that, with the experimental conditions, optimal for studying the light effect (pH 7.0, 20 °C), the SL-PL transbilayer movement and distribution did not significantly differ from those reported previously in media of pH 7.4 of different disc preparations at 25 °C, including those appearing as a preserved native membrane stack (18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After addition of the spin-labeled analogue lipid (2 mol% of the total phospholipid) to the outer leaflet, the transmembrane redistribution of the label between the two leaflets of the disc membrane occurred with a half time of less than 4 min at 20 °C. In the dark, PC and PE are almost symmetrically distributed, but PS shows a pronounced asymmetry with a preference for the outer leaflet (76%). Neither the kinetics nor the final equilibrium level of lipid redistribution depended on ATP, and it did not appear to be affected by cytoskeletal components, asymmetric salt solutions, or other transport systems (18Hessel E. Herrmann A. Muller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This establishes a difference between the disc organellum and plasma membrane systems (21Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar,30Dolis D. Moreau C. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Biophys.

The disc membrane is distinguished by its high contents of both the transmembrane protein rhodopsin and of long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids. With regard to the fatty acid content, docosahexaenoic acid is with a total fraction of 43 mol% unusually enriched (33Kamps K.M. De Grip W.J. Daemen F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 687: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In bovine disc membranes, PS, PE, and PC contain a fraction of polyunsaturated fatty acid of 70.5, 49, and 34.7 mol%, respectively (7Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Likely, this composition facilitates transmembrane motion of lipids, which generally appears to depend on lipid chain length and unsaturation. Bilayers made up from lipids with at least one unsaturated chain have a more rapid flip-flop, as compared with those with saturated lipids (see Refs. 34Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar and 35Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar and references therein). A high content of intrinsic membrane proteins introduced into pure lipid bilayers generally enhances permeability as well as transversal reorientation of lipids (36Van der Steen A.T. Taraschi T.F. Voorhout W.F. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 733: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Van Hoogevest P. Du Maine A.P. De Kruijff B. De Gier J. Biochim."

Bocker, J. Morris, S. Haskill, and J. M. Watson, submitted for publication. In contrast, monocytes adhered in the presence of either chemotactic stimuli or autologous serum will rapidly polarize and migrate (9Cianciola G. Hunter J. Silva J. Haskill S. Snyderman R. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Migration requires both contractile and protrusive events, mediated by changes in the actin cytoskeleton (7Sanchez-Madrid F. Del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although several lamellipodia are extended simultaneously, directional movement is obtained by the development of a dominant lamellipodium protruding in response to a concentration gradient (7Sanchez-Madrid F. Del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK)2 often coordinates integrin-mediated cell migration in nonhematopoetic cells (10Del Pozo M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Neito M. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). After adhesion, p125FAK is targeted to focal adhesions, where it colocalizes with integrins and becomes activated and phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues. p125FAKserves as both a kinase and as a structural protein capable of binding other proteins in a phosphotyrosine-dependent (e.g. src or Grb2) and -independent (e.g. paxillin) manner (11Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T.

Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In an alternatively spliced form of p125FAK, FRNK, the C-terminal noncatalytic domain has been used to identify the role of p125FAK in motility, presumably because its experimental overexpression displaces p125FAK from its site of action. For example, FRNK expression in endothelial cells blocked migration (13Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 8: 1209-1224Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In addition, fibroblasts isolated from p125FAK −/− knockout mice had reduced motility (14Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar), whereas ectopic expression of p125FAK in p125FAK-null cells dramatically enhanced cell spreading and migration (15Sieg D.J.

The stimuli that trigger CADTK in these cells are often associated with cell motility or at least cytoskeletal rearrangement. However, the downstream targets of CADTK activation and its role in hematopoetic cell cytoskeletal rearrangement are unknown. In other cell types, CADTK has been implicated in the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases (18Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B.

Monocytes constitutively express a detectable level of activated p38 MAP kinase and rapidly activate ERK and JNK kinases upon adhesion (6Mondal K. Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. Morris J. Haskill S. Watson J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However these activations are transient in motile monocytes adhered in the presence of autologous serum.1 The present work supports a role for CADTK in monocyte motility first by showing that CADTK immunolocalized to the leading edge ruffling lamellipodia. Taking a cue from studies of the role of p125FAK in adhesion and motility and its inhibition by FRNK (36Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we inhibited CADTK function by introducing a homologous protein referred to as CRNK (36Schaller M.D. Sasaki T.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This encompasses areas of the proline-rich region to the C terminus. In freshly isolated monocytes, GST-CRNK blocked adhesion-induced CADTK autophosphorylation and also resulted in dramatic inhibition of cell spreading, a loss of cell motility, and blockade of tyrosine phosphorylation redistribution. Although GST-CADTK had no effect on JNK activation, GST-CRNK introduction did block adhesion-induced ERK activation. Importantly, introduction of other GST proteins did not produce the same results, and GST-CRNK inhibited monocyte motility without altering monocyte phagocytosis or adhesion-dependent transcriptional activation of cytokine genes. These results suggest that CADTK regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and motility but is not required for all adhesion-dependent functions. Human monocytes were isolated from healthy volunteer donors as described previously (5Lofquist A.K. Mondal K. Morris J. Haskill S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by centrifugation through Ficoll/Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) and a Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) step gradient (50Harkin D.G. Hay E.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Monocytes were adherently cultured in endotoxin-free RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To produce polarized cells, monocytes were cultured in 5% autologous serum (9Cianciola G. Hunter J. Silva J. Haskill S. Snyderman R. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Monocyte motility was assessed using 20-s frame-time lapse microphotometry with a 40× phase objective and the NIH Image Movie program. Monocytes were studied for 70 frames. Cells were adhered for 30 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.5) for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 25% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with BodipyFL-phallacidin (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:20 with 25% goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. For the detection of CADTK, cells were stained with purified rabbit polyclonal anti-CADTK antibody (1:50–1:200). The anti-CADTK #72 antiserum was raised against amino acids 660–880 of CADTK expressed as a GST fusion protein. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated with a rhodamine (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate)-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) 1:400 dilution with 25% goat serum in PBS. After extensive washing in PBS, cells were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS. Specificity of the anti-CADTK antisera was determined by blocking with purified GST-CRNK for 1 h at room temperature before use. GST fusion proteins were grown and isolated from the expression plasmids pGEX3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pGEX3X-C3 (generously provided by Dr. K. Burridge, University of North Carolina), or pGEX3X-CRNK as described (6Mondal K. Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. Morris J. Haskill S. Watson J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). GST-CRNK was labeled with Oregon green 488 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Monocytes (1 × 107/ml) were resuspended in intracellular electroporation buffer, which consisted of 125 mm KOH, 4 mm NaOH, 73 mm PIPES, 10 mm NaHCO3, 5 mmK2HPO4, 5 mmKH2PO4, 5 mmd-glucose, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 μm CaCl2 (pH 7.0) (47Sayed M.R. Shield M.P. Stevens C.M. Duronio V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 monocytes were electroporated in the presence of 250 μg of purified GST, GST-CRNK, or GST-C3 proteins in a total volume of 400 μl in a 0.4-cm sterile cuvette at 750 V/cm2. After electroporation, cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10 μg/ml polymyxin-B before use. Purified GST has a molecular mass of ∼24 kDa. Purified GST-CRNK and GST-C3 have molecular masses of ∼42 and 46 kDa, respectively. Cells, 5–8 × 106, were adhered, rinsed, and lysed on ice for 30 min in 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Equivalent protein concentrations were incubated with 5 μl of anti-CADTK antibody for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 20 μl of protein-A/protein G-agarose beads. Beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and frozen until use. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 2 × 106 cells by direct lysis into Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies that detect the active, phosphorylated forms of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases. The p38 MAP kinase antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. Phospho-specific ERK and JNK antibodies were from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Horseradish peroxidase-RC20 (anti-phosphotyrosine) was obtained from Transduction Labs. Monocytes, 1 × 106, were adhered in the presence of autologous serum for 30 min and then fed 3 × 105/ml FITC-conjugated zymosan A (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) bioparticles (Molecular Probes) for 45 min. Extracellular fluorescence was quenched by the addition of 0.4% trypan blue. The percentage of phagocytosing cells was determined as the fraction of monocytes with internalized fluorescent particles from 500 monocytes counted by fluorescence microscopy. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. To begin tests of the role of CADTK in monocyte motility, we immunolocalized CADTK under several conditions. When monocytes were adhered under serum-free conditions, they failed to polarize and maintained radial symmetry (Fig.1 A, M-NM). In contrast, monocytes adhered in the presence of 5% autologous serum rapidly polarized, generated multiple small lamellipodia, but then migrated after development of a single large lamellipodium (Fig.1 A, M-M). Retraction fibers and filapodia were only observed in motile monocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that CADTK localized in the leading edge of motile monocytes and to the actin ruffles of both nonpolarized and polarized monocytes (Fig. 1,B and E). CADTK was detected diffusely throughout the monocyte cytoplasm in nonmotile cells, although it also concentrated in the nuclear cleft. Regions of intense actin staining showed increased localization of CADTK. Although some monocytes demonstrated increased CADTK localization at the adhered surfaces, CADTK immunoreactivity was most prominent in the cortical ruffles of both polarized and nonpolarized cells (Fig. 1, B andE). CADTK did not apparently localize to podosomes or points of focal contact, retraction fibers, or filapodia. In contrast, as previously shown, (28Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CADTK did localize to points of contact in the large enucleated structures, which are presumably derived from the platelet precursor, megakaryocytes (Fig. 1 B). CADTK localization was highly specific, as immunostaining with antisera that was absorbed with purified, baculoviral-expressed and purified CRNK, which contains the amino acids used to construct the immunizing GST fusion peptide, failed to detect any immunoreactivity within the ruffles (data not shown). Another group has also recently published data showing that CADTK/Pyk2 localized in the ruffles of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes and murine macrophages (51Williams L.M. Ridley A.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Localization of CADTK in the leading edge ruffles reinforced a possible role in migration and monocyte recruitment. To test this hypothesis, a GST fusion protein was generated by cloning the C-terminal region of CADTK, CRNK, (nucleotides 2050–3027) into the expression vector pGEX3X (36Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25319-25325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 49Li X. Dy R. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

Harding, L. M. Graves, and H. S. Earp, unpublished observations. Thus, CRNK has dominant negative activity. Monocytes cannot be transfected by conventional methods. However, high efficiency introduction of recombinant proteins into cells can be achieved by electroporation (6Mondal K. Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. Morris J. Haskill S. Watson J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 50Harkin D.G. Hay E.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that electroporation is adaptable for primary monocytes with proteins retaining functional activity over time (6Mondal K. Sirenko O.I. Lofquist A.K. Morris J. Haskill S. Watson J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Monocytes were electroporated with ∼300 μg of fluorescently labeled GST-CRNK to assess the uptake efficiency. Electroporated monocytes were extensively washed in cold medium and cytospin preparations made immediately or cells held at 37 °C for various time periods. Although uptake distribution was heterogenous, greater than 90% of monocytes were positive (Fig.2 A). Monocytes remained viable and retained expression of the fusion protein even after incubation for 90 min. Similar results were obtained with other FITC-labeled proteins including GST-C3 or with FITC-conjugated dextran (data not shown). Western blot analysis of monocytes lysed 30 min after electroporation and washing revealed comparable protein uptake for multiple GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2 B), GST at ∼21 kDa, GST-CRNK at ∼42 kDa, and the GST fusion protein including the RhoA inhibitor, C3 transferase, at ∼46 kDa. Both GST-CRNK and GST-C3 show some protein degradation after introduction and adhesion. This was not surprising, as we noted intense lysosomal staining after"

One such pathway, translesion DNA synthesis, involves specialized polymerases that, unlike replicative polymerases, are able to perform DNA synthesis on a damaged DNA template (reviewed in Refs. 1Johnson R.E.

Translesion DNA synthesis can be error-free or error-prone, depending on the chemical structure of the lesion and the polymerase utilized for translesion replication. Among the eukaryotic DNA polymerases, yeast and human DNA polymerases η perform efficient and accurate replication past a cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, a predominant DNA lesion formed by ultraviolet irradiation (4Johnson R.E.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of RAD30, which encodes pol η,1 confers moderate sensitivity to UV irradiation and an increase in UV-induced mutagenesis (8McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the human RAD30A gene, the counterpart of the yeast RAD30, cause the variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum (9Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells are hypermutable in response to UV irradiation, and they exhibit a significantly reduced ability to bypass a T-T dimer (reviewed in Ref. 3Cordonnier A.M. Fuchs R.P.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consequently, xeroderma pigmentosum variant individuals suffer from a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancers. 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine is one of the lesions formed by oxidative damage to DNA. Yeast and human pol η both efficiently bypass the 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine lesion. Whereas other polymerases insert A opposite this lesion, pol η preferentially inserts a C (11Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, pol η is unique among DNA polymerases in its ability to bypass a T-T dimer and a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine lesion efficiently and accurately. Here we examined the ability of yeast pol η to carry out translesion synthesis on DNA substrates containingN 2-guanine adducts of stereoisomeric 1,3-butadiene metabolites. 1,3-Butadiene is a potent carcinogen in mice and to a lesser extent in rats (12Himmelstein M.W. Acquavella J.F. Recio L. Medinsky M.A. Bond J.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1997; 27: 1-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and has been classified as a probable human carcinogen. Butadiene-mediated carcinogenesis is initiated through its reactive metabolites: butadiene monoepoxide, butadiene diepoxide, and butadiene diolepoxide. Each of these metabolites is represented by at least two stereoisoforms. The mutagenicity of butadiene and its reactive metabolites has been observed in several biological systems, particularly in yeast (13Luker M.A. Kilbey B.J. Mutat.

The 8-mer substrates containing the (R,R)- and (S,S)-intrastrand BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-links were synthesized as published previously (19Carmical J.R. Kowalczyk A. Zou Y. Van Houten B. Nechev L.V. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19482-19489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To construct the templates for polymerase reactions, each adducted oligonucleotide was ligated by T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) with two flanking oligonucleotides in the presence of the complement 45-mer scaffold. The ligation products were purified via denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences containing the BDO and BDE N 2-guanine lesions are identical: 5′-AGAATGTGGAAGATACTGTGGGCAGGTGGTGAATGGTCTGGGCAATGTCGTTGACTGGGA-3′, where the adducted G is underlined. The sequence containing the BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-link is as follows: 5′-CTAGAATGTGGAAGATACTGTGCATGGTCCAATGGTCTGGGCAATGTCGT-3′, where the cross-linked guanines are underlined. Oligodeoxynucleotides of anion-exchange grade purity were used as primers in the polymerase reactions and were obtained from the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Their sequences include 5′-ACGACATTGCCCAGACCATT-3′, which is complementary to the BDO and BDE N 2-guanine-adducted templates from positions −6 to −26 relative to the site of lesion. The same primer was used for the BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-link-containing substrates, being complementary from positions −4 to −24. 5′-ACATTGCCCAGACCATTGGA-3′ was used as the −1 primer for the BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-link-containing substrates, and 5′-ATTGCCCAGACCATTCACCA-3′ served as the −1 primer for the DNAs containing the BDO and BDEN 2-guanine lesions. 5′-TTGCCCAGACCATTCACCAC-3′ and 5′-GCCCAGACCATTCACCACC-3′ served as the 0 and +1 primers, respectively, overlapping the lesion site in the BDO and BDEN 2-guanine-adducted substrates. Primer oligodeoxynucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 32P-labeled primers were mixed with the oligonucleotide substrates in a molar ratio of 1:2 in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and slow cooled to room temperature. The completeness of the primer annealing was confirmed by electrophoresis through a native 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The glutathioneS-transferase-pol η fusion protein was overexpressed and purified as described previously (4Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The pol η polymerase assays were carried out essentially as described by Johnson et al. (4Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 100 μm dNTPs (each of the four dNTPs or one, as indicated), 5 nm primer annealed to a template, and 2 nm glutathione S-transferase-pol η. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of a 10-fold excess loading buffer consisting of 95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The pol I (Klenow fragment) polymerase reactions were performed basically under the same conditions as the pol η reactions but in the presence of the buffer provided by the enzyme supplier (New England Biolabs Inc.). The reaction products were resolved through a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea. Bands were visualized by autoradiography of the wet gels using Hyperfilm MP x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative analyses of the results were performed using a PhosphorImager screen and ImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Steady state kinetic assays were carried out under the same conditions as the DNA polymerase assays except that 1 nm pol η and 10 nm DNA substrates were used with various concentrations of one of the four nucleotides, and reactions were quenched after 5 min. DNA band intensities were quantitated using the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and then used to calculate the rate of nucleotide incorporation as described previously (21Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The rate of nucleotide incorporation was graphed as a function of nucleotide concentration, and k cat and K m parameters were obtained from the best fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The structures of the BDO and BDEN 2-guanine stereoisomers, which were examined in this study, are shown in Fig. 1. Among the butadiene epoxide guanine species that are formed as a result of the butadiene exposure, the N 2-guanine adducts are relatively stable (16Selzer R.R. Elfarra A.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In E. coli, replication efficiencies past the BDO and BDE N 2-guanines are significantly reduced in vivo, and the presence of these lesions in DNA is a complete block to synthesis by E. colipol I, II, and III in vitro (18Carmical J.R. Zhang M. Nechev L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions were carried out to test the ability of yeast pol η to perform translesion DNA synthesis on the BDO and BDEN 2-guanine-adducted DNA substrates (Fig.2 A). Primers were designed that provided “running start” (−6 primer) and “standing start” (−1 primer) conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 A, yeast pol η replicated through all four butadiene lesions, resulting in full-length products. However, pol η displays a strong stall site one nucleotide before the DNA lesion (lanes 3–6), suggesting an inhibition of nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Interestingly, the bypass efficiency of pol η seems to show stereospecificity. On the BDO N 2-guanine-containing substrates, as well as on the BDE N 2-guanine adducts, translesion DNA synthesis was more efficient in the case of theS stereoisomers. Primer extension reactions using E. coli pol I (Klenow fragment) were also carried out on substrates containing the BDO and BDE N 2-guanine adducts (Fig. 2 B). These data confirm previous reports that BDO and BDEN 2-guanines block DNA replication by pol I (18Carmical J.R. Zhang M. Nechev L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This polymerase incorporated one nucleotide opposite the lesion but in contrast to the yeast pol η, failed to extend the primer further on all four damaged substrates tested. Additionally, heterogeneity in the mobility of the final products (26-mer in the running start assays and 21-mer in the standing start assays) suggested nucleotide misincorporation in these reactions (lanes 3–6 and9–12). Next, the specificity of nucleotide incorporation by pol η opposite and downstream of these lesions was examined. To identify the nucleotide that was incorporated by pol η opposite the adducted base, single-nucleotide incorporation experiments were carried out using the −1 primer (Fig. 3). On a nondamaged substrate, pol η predominantly incorporated a C opposite G, but some T was also incorporated. In the case of the BDO and BDEN 2-guanine-containing substrates, a C residue was the only base that was incorporated opposite the lesions. Taking into account the lower efficiency of primer extension by pol η on the adducted templates, the substrate to enzyme ratio in the reaction was changed from 5:2 to 1:4. Under these conditions, no nonextended primers were left in the reactions on all five substrates tested when dCTP was in the incubation mixture (data not shown). Again, in the presence of the dTTP, no primer extension was observed on any of the damaged DNA substrates, but primer extension occurred on the nondamaged template. Although in reactions with the −1 primer no significant level of misincorporation opposite the lesion was observed, the smearing of bands was noted one nucleotide beyond the lesion, particularly in the case of the (R)-BDON 2-guanine-adducted substrate (Fig.2 A). To determine whether this smearing was attributable to nucleotide misincorporation past the lesion site, single-nucleotide incorporation studies were performed on (R)-BDON 2-guanine-adducted template using a 0 primer, which contains a C opposite the damaged G. On this template, pol η extended 93% of the 0 primer with dCTP, 23% with dTTP, 6% with dATP, and 2% with dGTP (Fig. 4). A low level of primer extension was also observed in the presence of dTTP on the (S)-BDO N 2-guanine-containing template. On the (R,R)- and (S,S)-BDEN 2-guanine-containing templates, pol η incorporated only the C residue. To test whether any misincorporation occurred beyond one nucleotide downstream of the lesion site, we performed single-nucleotide incorporation experiments using a +1 primer (Fig.5). No nucleotide misincorporation was observed on any of the damaged substrates examined, and pol η synthesized nearly the same amount of DNA on different damaged substrates when all four dNTPs were added to reactions. To quantitate the efficiency of pol η-catalyzed synthesis past each of the BDO- and BDE-modified N 2-guanines, steady state kinetic analyses were performed with both −1 and 0 primers. As shown in Table I, incorporation of dCTP opposite the (S)-BDO and (S,S)-BDEN 2-guanines (−1 primer extension) was 200–300-fold less efficient than incorporation opposite the unmodified guanine, whereas incorporation opposite the R stereoisomers was 2000–3000-fold less efficient than incorporation opposite the unmodified guanine. The reduced efficiency for incorporating dCTP opposite BDO- and BDE-adducted N 2-guanines is primarily a K m effect, not ak cat effect. Thus, there is a block to inserting dCTP opposite these lesions, as is also demonstrated by the pause site just prior to the adduct in Fig. 2 A. The extent of the blockage depended on the stereochemistry of the adduct, and this result agrees with the data presented in Figs. 2 A and 3. Interestingly, there is little block to extending from the C residue paired with the BDO- or BDE-modified N 2-guanine (kinetics of the dCTP incorporation in reactions with 0 primer), as is also demonstrated by the lack of a pause site at the site of the adduct (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion, no differences in efficiencies of elongation from the resulting base pair were observed. Thus, bypass efficiencies by pol η on the BDO- or BDE-modified N 2-guanines are limited at the step of the nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion but not at the extension step.Table IEfficiency of nucleotide incorporation by pol η on substrates containing the BDO and BDE N 2 -guanineSubstratedNTPk catK mk cat/K mRelative efficiency 1-aThe ratio of thek cat/K m of the adduct-containing substrate versus the nondamaged substrate.min −1μMmin −1 · μM −1−1 primer Nondamaged guaninedCTP0.78 ± 0.020.17 ± 0.024.61.0 (R)-BDON 2-guaninedCTP0.12 ± 0.0180 ± 121.5 × 10−33.3 × 10−4 (S)-BDON 2-guaninedCTP0.23 ± 0.049.5 ± 3.22.4 × 10−25.2 × 10−3 (R,R)-BDEN 2-guaninedCTP0.32 ± 0.04120 ± 302.7 × 10−35.9 × 10−4 (S, S)-BDE N2-guaninedCTP0.71 ± 0.0479 ± 129.0 × 10−33.7 × 10−30 primer Nondamaged guaninedCTP0.46 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.051.31.0 (R)-BDON 2-guaninedCTP0.85 ± 0.091.4 ± 0.30.610.47 (S)-BDON 2-guaninedCTP0.34 ± 0.040.66 ± 0.190.520.40 (R,R)-BDEN 2-guaninedCTP0.20 ± 0.020.96 ± 0.220.210.16 (S,S)-BDEN 2-guaninedCTP0.34 ± 0.020.62 ± 0.120.550.421-a The ratio of thek cat/K m of the adduct-containing substrate versus the nondamaged substrate. Open table in a new tab To further evaluate the accuracy of pol η replication through BDO and BDE N 2-guanine adducts, kinetic analyses of nucleotide misinsertion were carried out, and frequencies of misincorporation were calculated as the ratio ofk cat/K m of the incorrect nucleotide to the correct nucleotide (21Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In reactions with the −1 primer, frequencies of misincorporation were below the limit of detection under conditions used for all four damaged substrates. Thus, pol η incorporates the correct nucleotide C quite accurately oppositeN 2-guanine modified with BDO or BDE. In experiments utilizing the 0 primer, high frequencies of misincorporation were observed in extension from C base-paired with the (R)-BDO N 2-guanine. On this substrate, the frequencies of misincorporation were 2.0 × 10−2 for a T misincorporation and 6.2 × 10−4 for an A misincorporation. In all other cases, nucleotide misincorporation was below the limit of detection, which was approximately 5 × 10−4. Thus, kinetic data confirmed the results of the single-nucleotide incorporation experiment (Fig. 4), indicating that pol η is less accurate in extension from the base paired with (R)-BDO N 2-guanine than with (S)-BDO N 2-guanine. Structures of the BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-links are shown in Fig. 6. Cross-linked adducts are believed to contribute to butadiene-mediated carcinogenesis (22Vangala R.R. Laib R.J. Bolt H.M. Arch. Toxicol. 1993; 67: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Cochrane J.E. Skopek T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Previously, in E. coli, both (R,R)- and (S,S)-BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-links were shown to be extremely inhibitory to replicative bypass in vivo, and E. coli DNA pol I, II, and III were shown to be completely blocked on the templates containing these cross-links in vitro (19Carmical J.R.

To examine whether yeast pol η can bypass these lesions, primer extension experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 7, on the (R,R)- as well as on the (S,S)-BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine cross-link-containing substrates, DNA synthesis by pol η was completely blocked just before the lesion, both under standing start and running start conditions.Figure 7DNA polymerase activity of S. cerevisiae pol η under standing start and running start conditions on the diolepoxide guanine-guanine cross-link adducted templates.

Indeed, steady state kinetics assays of nucleotide incorporation have shown that pol η is a low fidelity enzyme. Both yeast and human pol η misincorporate nucleotides on undamaged DNA with frequencies of approximately 10−2–10−3 (6Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the accuracy of replication by yeast as well as by the human pol η opposite a T-T dimer does not differ from that opposite nondamaged DNA (6Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) pol η do not possess any intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity could explain in part the low fidelity of these polymerases. However, pol η has a lower fidelity than the other 3′→ 5′ exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases (6Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 24Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), suggesting that its low fidelity derives from the relaxed requirement of its active site for correct base-pairing geometry. A flexible active site should enable pol η to bypass DNA lesions other than the T-T dimer. In agreement with this, both yeast and human pol η also bypass a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine lesion efficiently, and they do so by predominantly inserting a C opposite the lesion (11Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, both yeast (26Yuan F. Zhang Y. Rajpal D.K. Wu X. Guo D. Wang M. Taylor J.-S Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8233-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and human (27Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) pol η preferentially insert the correct nucleotide (C) opposite anN 2-acetylaminofluorene-guanine. However, yeast pol η is unable to further extend DNA synthesis beyond the lesion (26Yuan F. Zhang Y. Rajpal D.K. Wu X. Guo D. Wang M. Taylor J.-S Wang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8233-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Human pol η can incorporate relatively efficiently one more nucleotide beyond the lesion, but only when the modified guanine is primed with a C (27Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here it has been shown that yeast pol η can bypass (S)-BDO N 2-guanine as well as (S,S)-BDE N 2-guanine with 200–300-fold less efficient nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion relative to the nondamaged guanine. pol η can also bypass the (R)-BDO N 2-guanine and (R,R)-BDE N 2-guanine adducts, but these lesions pose an approximately 10-fold greater block to replication by pol η than their S stereoisomers. Thus, the efficiency of translesion DNA synthesis by yeast pol η is stereoisomer-specific. Blockage of the pol η-catalyzed replication through the BDO and BDE N 2-guanines occurs at the step of the nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion, not at the extension step. In its ability to effectively extend synthesis past the BDO and BDE N 2-guanine adducts, yeast pol η differs from E. coli pol I, which fails to continue DNA synthesis beyond the lesion. Single-nucleotide incorporation experiments on BDO- and BDEN 2-guanine-containing substrates and steady state kinetic data indicate that lesion bypass by pol η can be error-prone at the step of postlesion replication and that the accuracy of translesion DNA synthesis at this step can also be stereoisomer-specific. On three out of four substrates tested, namely on (S)-BDO, (R,R)-BDE, and (S,S)-BDE N 2-guanine DNA adducts, nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion as well as elongation from the resulting base pair appeared to be quite accurate. On the (R)-BDO N 2-guanine-containing substrate, pol η inserted the correct nucleotide opposite the lesion, but it showed a tendency for nucleotide misincorporation in elongation from the resulting base pair. Stereoisomeric BDEN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine intrastrand cross-links were also examined in this study. However, these lesions were a complete block to synthesis by yeast pol η, and in this case, synthesis terminated one base prior to the first adducted guanine. Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that human pol η is capable of inserting a C opposite the first G of a cisplatin-GG intrastrand cross-link, but incorporation of the second C was highly inefficient, even using higher concentrations of pol η in the reaction. When the cisplatin cross-link was primed with a CC opposite the lesion, bypass was achieved (27Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N 2-guanine adducts of stereoisomeric 1,3-butadiene metabolites are a complete block to synthesis by E. coli DNA polymerases I, II, and III. In contrast, yeast pol η can insert nucleotides opposite these lesions and is able to efficiently extend from the resulting base pair. The ability of yeast pol η to bypass N 2-guanine butadiene adducts provides further support to the hypothesis (6Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 7Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the inability of pol η to bypass anN 2-guanine-N 2-guanine intrastrand cross-link suggests that its active site is not flexible enough to adapt to the rather severe distortion imposed upon DNA by the cross-link.

https://openalex.org/W2016823588,"We investigated the relationship between linker histone stoichiometry and the acetylation of core histones in vivo. Exponentially growing cell lines induced to overproduce either of two H1 variants, H10 or H1c, displayed significantly reduced rates of incorporation of [3H]acetate into all four core histones. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the rates of histone deacetylation were similar in all cell lines. These effects were also observed in nuclei isolated from these cells upon labeling with [3H]acetyl-CoA. Nuclear extracts prepared from control and H1-overexpressing cell lines displayed similar levels of histone acetylation activity on chromatin templates prepared from control cells. In contrast, extracts prepared from control cells were significantly less active on chromatin templates prepared from H1-overexpressing cells than on templates prepared from control cells. Reduced levels of acetylation in H1-overproducing cell lines do not appear to depend on higher order chromatin structure, because it persists even after digestion of the chromatin with micrococcal nuclease. The results suggest that alterations in chromatin structure, resulting from changes in linker histone stoichiometry may modulate the levels or rates of core histone acetylation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2075327157,"To explore the biophysical properties of the binding site for cocaine and related compounds in the serotonin transporter SERT, a high affinity cocaine analogue (3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acidN-(N-methyl-N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-7-yl)ethanolamine ester hydrochloride (RTI-233); K I = 14 nm) that contained the environmentally sensitive fluorescent moiety 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) was synthesized. Specific binding of RTI-233 to the rat serotonin transporter, purified from Sf-9 insect cells, was demonstrated by the competitive inhibition of fluorescence using excess serotonin, citalopram, or RTI-55 (2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane). Moreover, specific binding was evidenced by measurement of steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, showing constrained mobility of bound RTI-233 relative to RTI-233 free in solution. The fluorescence of bound RTI-233 displayed an emission maximum (λmax) of 532 nm, corresponding to a 4-nm blue shift as compared with the λmax of RTI-233 in aqueous solution and corresponding to the λmax of RTI-233 in 80% dioxane. Collisional quenching experiments revealed that the aqueous quencher potassium iodide was able to quench the fluorescence of RTI-233 in the binding pocket (K SV = 1.7m−1), although not to the same extent as free RTI-233 (K SV = 7.2m−1). Conversely, the hydrophobic quencher 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) quenched the fluorescence of bound RTI-233 more efficiently than free RTI-233. These data are consistent with a highly hydrophobic microenvironment in the binding pocket for cocaine-like uptake inhibitors. However, in contrast to what has been observed for small-molecule binding sites in, for example, G protein-coupled receptors, the bound cocaine analogue was still accessible for aqueous quenching and, thus, partially exposed to solvent. To explore the biophysical properties of the binding site for cocaine and related compounds in the serotonin transporter SERT, a high affinity cocaine analogue (3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acidN-(N-methyl-N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-7-yl)ethanolamine ester hydrochloride (RTI-233); K I = 14 nm) that contained the environmentally sensitive fluorescent moiety 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) was synthesized. Specific binding of RTI-233 to the rat serotonin transporter, purified from Sf-9 insect cells, was demonstrated by the competitive inhibition of fluorescence using excess serotonin, citalopram, or RTI-55 (2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane). Moreover, specific binding was evidenced by measurement of steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, showing constrained mobility of bound RTI-233 relative to RTI-233 free in solution. The fluorescence of bound RTI-233 displayed an emission maximum (λmax) of 532 nm, corresponding to a 4-nm blue shift as compared with the λmax of RTI-233 in aqueous solution and corresponding to the λmax of RTI-233 in 80% dioxane. Collisional quenching experiments revealed that the aqueous quencher potassium iodide was able to quench the fluorescence of RTI-233 in the binding pocket (K SV = 1.7m−1), although not to the same extent as free RTI-233 (K SV = 7.2m−1). Conversely, the hydrophobic quencher 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) quenched the fluorescence of bound RTI-233 more efficiently than free RTI-233. These data are consistent with a highly hydrophobic microenvironment in the binding pocket for cocaine-like uptake inhibitors. However, in contrast to what has been observed for small-molecule binding sites in, for example, G protein-coupled receptors, the bound cocaine analogue was still accessible for aqueous quenching and, thus, partially exposed to solvent. serotonin transporter rat SERT norepinephrine transporter dopamine transporter 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole 5-hydroxytryptamine 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl 2β-carbomethoxy-3β(4-iodophenyl)tropane 3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acidN-(N-methyl-N-(4-nitrobenzo2-oxa-1,3-diazol-7-yl)ethanolamine ester Cocaine is one of the most widely abused psychostimulants, causing major medical and socioeconomic problems (1Caine S.B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Currently, there is no effective treatment against cocaine addiction available; therefore, clarifying the molecular mechanisms underlying the psychostimulatory effects and addictive properties of cocaine should prove critical for potential development of future therapeutic strategies. Cocaine and related drugs act by inhibiting clearance of released monoamine neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft (2Horn A.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 3Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). This clearance of monoamines occurs via three distinct but highly homologous monoamine transporters, the serotonin transporter (SERT),1 the dopamine transporter (DAT), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) (2Horn A.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 3Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). Cocaine binds with high affinity to all three transporters and is generally believed to act as a competitive blocker of substrate translocation (4Povlock S.L. Amara S.G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar, 5Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Kuhar M.J. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 263-295Crossref Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence that inhibition of the DAT is the predominant mechanism behind the stimulatory effects and addictive properties of cocaine (6Ritz M.C. Lamb R.J. Goldberg S.R. Kuhar M.J. Science. 1987; 237: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 7Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G.

However, this hypothesis has been challenged by recent studies on mice in which the DAT gene has been deleted (1Caine S.B. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of the DAT gene, it was surprisingly observed that these mice self-administered cocaine, indicating a possible important role of also the SERT and NET (9Rocha B.A. Fumagalli F.

Miller G.W. Wang Y.M. Caron M.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The SERT belongs together with DAT and NET to a family of Na+/Cl−-dependent solute carriers that are characterized functionally by their dependence on the presence of Na+ and Cl− in the extracellular fluid (3Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar,11Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). All Na+/Cl−-dependent carriers are believed to share a common topology characterized by the presence of 12 transmembrane segments connected by alternating extracellular and intracellular loops with an intracellular location of the N and C terminus (3Giros B.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar), surprisingly little is known about the binding site for cocaine-like substances in the monoamine transporters. Although cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of transmembrane segment 3 in the SERT has suggested that two residues (Ile-172 and Tyr-176) in the middle of the transmembrane segment could be in close proximity to the cocaine binding site (20Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), no direct contact sites have been established between cocaine and specific transporter residues. Hence, it is not yet clear whether the cocaine binding site is deeply buried inside the transmembrane core of the transporter molecule or if the binding site is partially or fully exposed on the transporter surface. In this study we have investigated the biophysical nature of the cocaine binding site in the rat SERT (rSERT). For this purpose, a cocaine analogue, which contained the environmentally sensitive fluorescent moiety, nitrobenzoxadiazol, were synthesized (see Fig. 1). Moreover, an epitope-tagged version of the rSERT was expressed in Sf-9 insect cells and purified to obtain a transporter preparation that provided a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio for characterizing the fluorescent properties of the ligand bound to the rSERT. Our subsequent spectroscopic analysis of the bound fluorescent ligand provided evidence for a highly hydrophobic binding pocket. However, collisional quenching experiments showed that, despite the hydrophobic character of the binding crevice, the bound cocaine analogues were still accessible for aqueous quenching consistent with a partially exposed binding site. These findings contrast the observations for small-molecule ligand binding sites in other membrane proteins, such as, for example, G protein-coupled receptors, where the binding sites for small-molecule ligands are known to be deeply embedded in the transmembrane core of the molecule and entirely inaccessible to aqueous quenching (21Tota R.T.

Oxalyl chloride (2.0 m in CH2Cl2; 0.80 ml, 1.60 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of 3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid (RTI-374) (23Carroll F.I. Kotian P. Dehghani A.

After stirring for 1 h, the CH2Cl2 was removed by reduced pressure. A solution of the acid chloride andN-methyl-N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-7-yl)aminoethanol (458 mg, 1.93 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 ml) under argon was treated slowly with triethylamine (0.5 ml, 3.5 mmol) and stirred at 25 °C for 38 h. Removal of CH2Cl2 by rotary evaporation afforded an orange-red residue, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (4.5 × 18 cm) with an ethyl acetate/methyl alcohol gradient elution (100:0–50:50; 100 ml). Removal of the eluant by reduced pressure gave a red solid (270 mg, 73%), melting point 184–186 °C. The free base (270 mg) in CH2Cl2 was treated with ethereal HCl (1.0m, 3 ml) to yield the hydrochloride salt (282 mg), melting point >250 °C (decomposition); [α]Dd20 −35° (C = 0.1g/100 ml methanol). The analysis of C25H30ClN5O5·0.5 H2O was C, 57.23; H, 5.95; N, 12.35 (calculated) and C, 57.22; H, 6.32; N, 12.18 (experimental). The rSERT, tagged at the N terminus with the c-myc epitope and at the C terminus with 10 histidines, was inserted into baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as described (24Tate C.G. Whiteley E. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17551-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was expressed in Sf-9 insect cells, and baculovirus encoding the tagged rSERT was isolated by plaque purification followed by several rounds of amplification to obtain a high titer virus stock (∼109 plaque-forming units/ml) (24Tate C.G. Whiteley E. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17551-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Baculovirus encoding canine calnexin was generated as described previously (24Tate C.G. Whiteley E. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17551-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For purification, insect cells were grown in 1000-ml cultures in SF 900 II medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin (all products purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The cell cultures were infected at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml by inoculating a 1:25 dilution of a rSERT high titer virus stock plus 1:15 dilution of a high titer calnexin virus stock. The cells were harvested 48 h later by centrifugation (10 min at 5000 × g) and kept at −80 °C until purification. A significant fraction of the rSERT expressed in Sf-9 cells was previously found to be misfolded (24Tate C.G. Whiteley E. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17551-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, coinfection with the molecular chaperone, calnexin, was demonstrated to increase the fraction of correctly folded protein through assisted folding in the endoplasmatic reticulum of properly glycosylated SERT, which stabilizes the transporter at the cell surface (24Tate C.G. Whiteley E. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17551-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 ×g for 5 min), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized using 25 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer in 50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml benzamidine (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride(Sigma). The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing the above-mentioned protease inhibitors followed by an additional round of centrifugation and resuspension. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The membranes were diluted to 1 mg of protein/ml in buffer before storage at −80 °C. The transporter was purified using a two-step purification procedure, which will be described in further detail elsewhere. 2S. G. F. Rasmussen and U. Gether, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, one pellet of Sf-9 cells from a 1000-ml infected culture was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 10 μm desipramine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml benzamidine (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) followed by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysed cells were resuspended in solubilization buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 1% digitonin (Calbiochem), 30% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm desipramine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, and stirred for 2 h at 4 °C. Upon centrifugation (30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant containing the solubilized transporter was purified by nickel chromatography using chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding to the resin was carried out in batch for 2 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. The transporter was eluted from the nickel resin in 200 mm imidazole. The eluted transporter was further purified by concanavalin A chromatography. Binding to the concanavalin A resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out in batch, and elution was done in 250 mmα-methyl-mannopyranoside (Sigma). The purified transporter was concentrated using Centricon-30 spin concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The specific activity of the purified transporter was ∼3 nmol/mg of protein, corresponding to around 20% purity (active protein). Protein was determined using the detergent-insensitive Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The purified transporter was routinely analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by standard silver staining from which functional protein (125I-RTI-55 binding activity) were assessed to be around two-thirds of total SERT on the stain. In general, ∼2 nmol of purified SERT could be obtained from a 1000-ml culture. Binding experiments on rSERT expressed in Sf-9 insect cell membranes and of the purified transporter were performed using 125I-RTI-55 (PE Biosystems) as radioligand. In competition binding assays on membranes, 5 μg of membrane protein was assayed in a total volume of 250 μl using a sodium phosphate buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.25 nm125I-RTI-55 and increasing concentrations of competing ligands, 5-HT, citalopram, cocaine, RTI-233, or RTI-55. Citalopram was kindly provided by Klaus Gundertofte, Lundbeck A/S, Denmark. Cocaine and 5-HT were obtained from Research Biochemicals International. The membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before separation of bound from unbound by rapid filtration over glass fiber filters (FilterMat B, Wallac, Turku, Finland) using a Tomtec 96-well cell harvester. MeltiLex Melt-on scintillator sheets (Wallac) were used for counting of the filter in a Wallac Tri-Lux β scintillation counter. Competition binding experiments on purified transporter (15 fmol of transporter) were performed in digitonin buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% digitonin, and 100 mm NaCl) in a total volume of 100 μl using 0.25 nm of 125I-RTI-55 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands. The binding assays were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before separation of bound from unbound on 2 ml of Sephadex G-50 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate was collected directly in 4-ml counting vials (Wallac) using 1000 μl of ice-cold digitonin buffer. Scintillation fluid (HiSafe, Wallac) was added, and the vials were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β scintillation counter. All determinations in the binding assays were done in triplicate. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.0 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on a SPEX Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer connected to a PC equipped with the Datamax 2.2 software package (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ). In all experiments, the excitation and emission bandpass were set at 5 nm. For the emission scan, quenching, and anisotropy experiments, 20 pmol of purified rSERT was incubated in 100 μl of digitonin buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 0.1% digitonin, 100 mm NaCl) in the presence of 1 μm RTI-233 and, when indicated, 1 mm 5-HT, 10 μm RTI 55, or 10 μm citalopram for 30 min at 4 °C before separation of bound from unbound on 2 ml of Sephadex G-50 columns. The fraction of bound was obtained by eluting with 1000 μl of ice-cold digitonin buffer. A 400-μl sample of the eluate was transferred to a 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvette (Helma, Mulheim, Germany) for the subsequent spectroscopic measurements. The absorption by the nonfluorescent ligands, 5-HT, citalopram, and RTI-55 is less than 0.01 at the used concentrations excluding any “inner filter” effect. The emission scans were performed either on 400 μl of Sephadex G-50-separated samples obtained as described above or directly on buffer/dioxane samples containing RTI-233. Excitation was 480 nm, and emission was measured from 495 to 625 nm with an integration time of 0.3 s/nm. All emission spectra are averages of three consecutive scans. Photobleaching was negligible under the experimental conditions used. The emission spectra were corrected for any background fluorescence by routinely subtracting control spectra on buffer alone. Stock solutions (1.0m) of the hydrophilic quencher potassium iodide containing 10 mm Na2S2O3 were prepared freshly for each round of experiments. The hydrophobic quencher 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) was dissolved in 10% Me2SO at a concentration of 100 mm and immediately used. The experiments were performed on either 400 μl of the Sephadex G-50-separated samples and prepared as described above or directly on buffer samples containing RTI-233. To correct for dilution/ionic strength effects on fluorescence, measurements were performed in parallel using a 1.0 m stock of potassium chloride (KCl) and a 10% Me2SO stock for the potassium iodide-and TEMPO-quenching experiments, respectively. Ten μl of quencher (potassium iodide or TEMPO) or control solution (potassium chloride or 10% Me2SO) was added sequentially followed by thorough mixing after each addition and subsequent recording of fluorescence using the Constant Wavelength Analysis program in the Datamax software package. The excitation wavelength was 480 nm, and the emission wavelength was either 532 nm for the recordings on RTI-233 bound to rSERT or 536 nm for the recordings on RTI-233 alone in digitonin buffer. A complete experiment was performed in 8 min, during which dissociation of ligand was negligible. In the experiments with TEMPO, the fluorescence intensities were corrected as described (26London E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for inner filter effects caused by the absorption by TEMPO at the used excitation and emission wavelengths. The corrected data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation,F o/F = 1 +K sv[Q], whereF o/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of quencher (Q), andK sv is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (27Lakovicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic Publishers/Plenum Publishing Group, New York1999: 238-318Google Scholar). The SPEX Fluoromax-2 fluorometer was equipped with an automated L-format polarization accessory including two Glan-Thomson UV polarizers placed in the sample chamber to enable polarized excitation and emission detection. The anisotropy measurements were carried out using the Constant Wavelength Analysis program with the excitation set at 480 nm and emission measured at 532 nm for RTI-233 bound to rSERT and 536 nm for free RTI-233 in digitonin buffer (integration time 10 s). Concurrent measurements of the emission intensity with the excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position (V) and the emission-side polarizer in either the V or horizontal position (H) were carried out. The measurements were collected at 4, 20, and 37 °C by perfusion of water with adequate temperature through the thermostatted cuvette holder. The data were converted to anisotropy according to the equation, A = (I VV −GI VH)/(I VV + 2GI VH), where I VV is the intensity measured with both the excitation-side and emission-side polarizer in the vertical position (V), I VH is the intensity measured with the excitation-side polarizer in the vertical position (V) and the emission-side polarizer in the horizontal position (H), and G is the ratio of the sensitivities of the detection system for vertically and horizontally polarized light (S V/S H) (27Lakovicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic Publishers/Plenum Publishing Group, New York1999: 238-318Google Scholar). The anisotropy was stable for at least 15 min at the indicated temperatures, indicating negligible dissociation of ligand under the experimental conditions used. To obtain a fluorescent analogue of cocaine with preserved high affinity for the rSERT, the environmentally sensitive fluorescent moiety 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) was connected to the 2β position of the tropane backbone in RTI-374 (3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid) usingN-methylethanolamine as the linker as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1) (5Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Kuhar M.J. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 263-295Crossref Google Scholar). Importantly, very large 2β-carboalkoxy groups have been shown to be rather well tolerated in both cocaine and in the 3-phenyltropane analogue, RTI-55 (5Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Kuhar M.J. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 263-295Crossref Google Scholar). Notably, the fluorescent compound, RTI-233, differed, like RTI-55 and the parent 2β-carbomethoxy compound RTI-374 (3β-(4-methylphenyl)tropane-2β-carboxylic acid), from cocaine by having the aromatic ring directly connected to the 3 position of the tropane ring (Fig. 1). The 3-phenyltropane-type of structure was chosen since it is known to increase binding affinity as compared with that of cocaine itself (5Carroll F.I. Lewin A.H. Kuhar M.J. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 263-295Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, RTI-233 bound with high affinity to the rSERT expressed in Sf-9 cell membranes displaying a KI value of 6 nm for inhibition of 125I-RTI-55 binding (Fig. 2 and TableI). In comparison, the structurally related compound, RTI-55, and cocaine itself displayed KI values of 0.22 and 109 nm, respectively, for inhibition of 125I-RTI-55 binding.Table IBinding properties of purified rSERT in comparison to rSERT in Sf-9 membranesrSERT in Sf-9 membranesPurified rSERTK d[S.E. interval]K i [S.E. interval]Hill slopeK d [S.E. interval]K i [S.E. interval]Hill slopenmnmnmnmRTI-550.22 [0.187–0.260]−1.050.84 [0.771–0.915]−1.055-HT1112 [931–1327]−1.08441 [406–479]−0.99Cocaine109 [106.8–112.0]−1.02200 [194.0–205.6]−0.98RTI-2336.0 [5.06–7.04]−1.1613.7 [12.80–14.60]−0.93Citalopram1.0 [0.96–1.05]−1.012.4 [2.11–2.69]−1.06Competition binding on rSERT expressed in Sf-9 insect cell membranes and on purified transporter using 0.25 nm125I-RTI-55 as radioligand.

K i values were calculated according to the equation K i = IC50/(1 + L/K d) where L is concentration of radioligand.

The rSERT, expressed in Sf-9 insect cells, was purified by nickel chromatography followed by concanavalin A chromatography. The purified transporter bound RTI-233 with an affinity that was almost identical to that measured in the Sf-9 cell membranes (Fig. 2 and Table I). The KI for RTI-233 was 14 nm for the purified versus 6 nm for the transporter in membranes, as determined from competition binding assays with 125I-RTI-55 (Fig. 2 and Table I). Similarly, the KI values for serotonin and the two blockers RTI-55 and citalopram fo"
https://openalex.org/W2062698938,"<i>UL9</i>, an essential gene for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA replication, exhibits helicase and origin DNA binding activities. It has been hypothesized that UL9 binds and unwinds the HSV-1 origin of replication, creating a replication bubble and promoting the assembly of the viral replication machinery; however, direct confirmation of this hypothesis has not been possible. Based on the presence of conserved helicase motifs, UL9 has been classified as a superfamily II helicase. Mutations in conserved residues of the helicase motifs I—VI of <i>UL9</i> have been isolated, and most of them fail to complement a <i>UL9</i> null virus <i>in vivo</i> (Martinez R., Shao L., and Weller S. (1992)<i>J. Virol.</i> 66, 6735–6746). In addition, mutants in motifs I, II, and VI were found to be transdominant (Malik, A. K., and Weller, S. K. (1996) <i>J. Virol.</i> 70, 7859–7866). Here we present the characterization of the biochemical properties of the <i>UL9</i> helicase motif mutants. We report that mutations in motifs I–IV and VI affect the ATPase activity, and all but the motif III mutation completely abolish the helicase activity. In addition, mutations in these motifs do not interfere with UL9 dimerization or the ability of UL9 to bind the HSV-1 origin of replication. Based on the similarity of the helicase motif sequences between <i>UL9</i> and UvrB, another superfamily II member with helicase-like activity, we were able to map the <i>UL9</i>mutations on the structure of the UvrB protein and provide an explanation for the observed phenotypes. Our results indicate that the helicase function of UL9 is indispensable for viral replication, supporting the hypothesis that UL9 is essential for unwinding the HSV-1 origin of replication <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, the data presented provide insights into the mechanism of transdominance of the UL9 helicase motif mutants."
