https://openalex.org/W2095211795,"In electron-transfer processes, spin effects normally are seen either in magnetic materials or in systems containing heavy atoms that facilitate spin-orbit coupling. We report spin-selective transmission of electrons through self-assembled monolayers of double-stranded DNA on gold. By directly measuring the spin of the transmitted electrons with a Mott polarimeter, we found spin polarizations exceeding 60% at room temperature. The spin-polarized photoelectrons were observed even when the photoelectrons were generated with unpolarized light. The observed spin selectivity at room temperature was extremely high as compared with other known spin filters. The spin filtration efficiency depended on the length of the DNA in the monolayer and its organization."

https://openalex.org/W2038970717,"Stem and progenitor cells use asymmetric cell divisions to balance proliferation and differentiation. Evidence from invertebrates shows that this process is regulated by proteins asymmetrically distributed at the cell cortex during mitosis: Par3-Par6-aPKC, which confer polarity, and Gα(i)-LGN/AGS3-NuMA-dynein/dynactin, which govern spindle positioning. Here we focus on developing mouse skin, where progenitor cells execute a switch from symmetric to predominantly asymmetric divisions concomitant with stratification. Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, we investigate spindle orientation regulation and provide direct evidence that LGN (also called Gpsm2), NuMA and dynactin (Dctn1) are involved. In compromising asymmetric cell divisions, we uncover profound defects in stratification, differentiation and barrier formation, and implicate Notch signalling as an important effector. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of applying RNA interference in vivo to mammalian systems, and the ease of uncovering complex genetic interactions, here to gain insights into how changes in spindle orientation are coupled to establishing proper tissue architecture during skin development."

We measured metabolic rate and body temperature in hibernating black bears and found that they suppress metabolism to 25% of basal rates while regulating body temperature from 30° to 36°C, in multiday cycles. Heart rates were reduced from 55 to as few as 9 beats per minute, with profound sinus arrhythmia. After returning to normal body temperature and emerging from dens, bears maintained a reduced metabolic rate for up to 3 weeks. The pronounced reduction and delayed recovery of metabolic rate in hibernating bears suggest that the majority of metabolic suppression during hibernation is independent of lowered body temperature."

However, the direct targets that mediate their effects on longevity remain unclear. In mammals, CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs)6 are a family of cofactors involved in diverse physiological processes including energy homeostasis7,8,9, cancer10 and endoplasmic reticulum stress11. Here we show that both AMPK and calcineurin modulate longevity exclusively through post-translational modification of CRTC-1, the sole C. elegans CRTC. We demonstrate that CRTC-1 is a direct AMPK target, and interacts with the CREB homologue-1 (CRH-1) transcription factor in vivo. The pro-longevity effects of activating AMPK or deactivating calcineurin decrease CRTC-1 and CRH-1 activity and induce transcriptional responses similar to those of CRH-1 null worms. Downregulation of crtc-1 increases lifespan in a crh-1-dependent manner and directly reducing crh-1 expression increases longevity, substantiating a role for CRTCs and CREB in ageing. Together, these findings indicate a novel role for CRTCs and CREB in determining lifespan downstream of AMPK and calcineurin, and illustrate the molecular mechanisms by which an evolutionarily conserved pathway responds to low energy to increase longevity."

https://openalex.org/W2134790954,"The rheology of suspensions (solid particles dispersed in a fluid) is controlled primarily through the volume fraction of solids. We show that the addition of small amounts of a secondary fluid, immiscible with the continuous phase of the suspension, causes agglomeration due to capillary forces and creates particle networks, dramatically altering the bulk rheological behavior from predominantly viscous or weakly elastic to highly elastic or gel-like. This universal phenomenon is observed for a rich variety of particle/liquid systems, independent of whether the second liquid wets the particles better or worse than the primary liquid. These admixtures form stable suspensions where settling would otherwise occur and may serve as a precursor for microporous polymer foams, or lightweight ceramics."

https://openalex.org/W2020458486,"The classical view of neural plate development held that it arises from the ectoderm, after its separation from the mesodermal and endodermal lineages. However, recent cell-lineage-tracing experiments indicate that the caudal neural plate and paraxial mesoderm are generated from common bipotential axial stem cells originating from the caudal lateral epiblast. Tbx6 null mutant mouse embryos which produce ectopic neural tubes at the expense of paraxial mesoderm must provide a clue to the regulatory mechanism underlying this neural versus mesodermal fate choice. Here we demonstrate that Tbx6-dependent regulation of Sox2 determines the fate of axial stem cells. In wild-type embryos, enhancer N1 of the neural primordial gene Sox2 is activated in the caudal lateral epiblast, and the cells staying in the superficial layer sustain N1 activity and activate Sox2 expression in the neural plate. In contrast, the cells destined to become mesoderm activate Tbx6 and turn off enhancer N1 before migrating into the paraxial mesoderm compartment. In Tbx6 mutant embryos, however, enhancer N1 activity persists in the paraxial mesoderm compartment, eliciting ectopic Sox2 activation and transforming the paraxial mesoderm into neural tubes. An enhancer-N1-specific deletion mutation introduced into Tbx6 mutant embryos prevented this Sox2 activation in the mesodermal compartment and subsequent development of ectopic neural tubes, indicating that Tbx6 regulates Sox2 via enhancer N1. Tbx6-dependent repression of Wnt3a in the paraxial mesodermal compartment is implicated in this regulatory process. Paraxial mesoderm-specific misexpression of a Sox2 transgene in wild-type embryos resulted in ectopic neural tube development. Thus, Tbx6 represses Sox2 by inactivating enhancer N1 to inhibit neural development, and this is an essential step for the specification of paraxial mesoderm from the axial stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994425869,"Laboratory and theoretical studies suggest that earthquakes are preceded by a phase of developing slip instability in which the fault slips slowly before accelerating to dynamic rupture. We report here that one of the best-recorded large earthquakes to date, the 1999 moment magnitude (M(w)) 7.6 Izmit (Turkey) earthquake, was preceded by a seismic signal of long duration that originated from the hypocenter. The signal consisted of a succession of repetitive seismic bursts, accelerating with time, and increased low-frequency seismic noise. These observations show that the earthquake was preceded for 44 minutes by a phase of slow slip occurring at the base of the brittle crust. This slip accelerated slowly initially, and then rapidly accelerated in the 2 minutes preceding the earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2048651210,"Sialylated glycans serve as cell surface attachment factors for a broad range of pathogens. We report an atypical example, where desialylation increases cell surface binding and infectivity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9, a human parvovirus isolate. Enzymatic removal of sialic acid, but not heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate, increased AAV9 transduction regardless of cell type. Viral binding and transduction assays on mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines defective in various stages of glycan chain synthesis revealed a potential role for core glycan residues under sialic acid in AAV9 transduction. Treatment with chemical inhibitors of glycosylation and competitive inhibition studies with different lectins suggest that N-linked glycans with terminal galactosyl residues facilitate cell surface binding and transduction by AAV9. In corollary, resialylation of galactosylated glycans on the sialic acid-deficient CHO Lec2 cell line with different sialyltransferases partially blocked AAV9 transduction. Quantitative analysis of AAV9 binding to parental, sialidase-treated or sialic acid-deficient mutant CHO cells revealed a 3–15-fold increase in relative binding potential of AAV9 particles upon desialylation. Finally, pretreatment of well differentiated human airway epithelial cultures and intranasal instillation of recombinant sialidase in murine airways enhanced transduction efficiency of AAV9 by >1 order of magnitude. Taken together, the studies described herein provide a molecular basis for low infectivity of AAV9 in vitro and a biochemical strategy to enhance gene transfer by AAV9 vectors in general.

Cell surface glycans have been shown to play a critical role in the infectious pathways of viruses (1Olofsson S. Bergström T. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 154-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Detailed studies of virus-glycan interactions have yielded significant insight into mechanisms underlying emergence and transmission of viral pathogens in different hosts. Among various glycolipids, glycoproteins, or proteoglycans anchored to the plasma membrane, sialylated glycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycans appear to serve as predominant substrates for viral attachment to the cell surface. For instance, heparan sulfate serves as a primary receptor for Herpesviridae (2Akhtar J. Shukla D.

Rabinowitz J.E. Samulski R.J. Kerr J.R. Cotmore S.F. Bloom M.E. Parvoviruses. Edward Arnold Ltd., New York2006: 15-24Google Scholar). Recombinant AAV vectors, by virtue of their lack of pathogenicity and low immunogenicity, are currently being evaluated as lead candidates in clinical gene therapy trials (13Mueller C. Flotte T.R. Gene Ther. 2008; 15: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The discovery of a large number of AAV isolates over the past decade has accelerated efforts to exploit tissue tropisms displayed by different strains for therapeutic gene transfer applications (14Gao G. Vandenberghe L.H. Wilson J.M. Curr. Gene Ther. 2005; 5: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Mitchell A.M. Nicolson S.C. Warischalk J.K. Samulski R.J. Curr. Gene Ther. 2010; 10: 319-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Successful translation from bench to bedside will require a thorough understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying AAV infection. As with other viruses, attachment to cell surface glycans constitutes the first step in the AAV infectious pathway. For instance, several AAV serotypes have been shown to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans (AAV2 (4Summerford C. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AAV6 (11Wu Z. Miller E. Agbandje-McKenna M. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9093-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)), whereas others utilize sialic acid for cell surface binding and entry (AAV4 (16Kaludov N. Brown K.E. Walters R.W. Zabner J. Chiorini J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6884-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), AAV5 (10Walters R.W. Yi S.M. Keshavjee S. Brown K.E. Welsh M.J. Chiorini J.A. Zabner J. J. Biol.

Sialylated glycans that serve as primary receptors for the latter AAV strains vary at the level of N-acetylneuraminic acid linkage to underlying sugars, i.e. α2–3 or α2–6 linked to galactose residues (11Wu Z. Miller E. Agbandje-McKenna M. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9093-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Kaludov N. Brown K.E. Walters R.W. Zabner J. Chiorini J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6884-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Further receptor specificity has been demonstrated at the level of N-linked or O-linked glycans displayed on the cell surface (11Wu Z. Miller E. Agbandje-McKenna M. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9093-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Kaludov N. Brown K.E. Walters R.W. Zabner J. Chiorini J.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6884-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Selective recognition of such linkages and underlying core glycan types (18Cohen M. Varki A. OMICS. 2010; 14: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is likely enabled by differences in the capsid surface topology of AAV serotypes (19Govindasamy L. Padron E. McKenna R.

In general, dependence of AAV infectivity on sialic acid has been demonstrated using a battery of chemical, biochemical, and genetic tools to desialylate cell surface glycans. The current study is focused on glycan interactions of a human AAV isolate, AAV serotype 9/Hu.14 (Clade F) (21Gao G. Vandenberghe L.H. Alvira M.R. Lu Y. Calcedo R. Zhou X. Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6381-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Recombinant AAV9 vectors display widespread and robust transduction following systemic administration in animal models but fail to infect cells in culture (21Gao G. Vandenberghe L.H. Alvira M.R.

Ther. 2008; 16: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that efficient gene transfer by AAV9 vectors requires an atypical interaction with nonsialylated cell surface glycans. The results described herein provide a molecular basis for the low infectivity of AAV9 observed in cell culture. All plasmids were obtained from the University of North Carolina (UNC) vector core. The triple plasmid transfection protocol (23Grieger J.C. Choi V.W. Samulski R.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1412-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) utilized for production of AAV9 vectors includes (i) the AAV helper plasmid, pXR9, containing AAV2 Rep and AAV9 Cap genes; (ii) the adenoviral helper plasmid, pXX6-80; and (iii) the vector genome cassette, pTR-CBA-Luc or pHpa-trs-SK, containing the firefly luciferase gene driven by the chicken β-actin (CBA) promoter or self-complementary GFP cassette driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, respectively. The vector genome cassette is flanked by inverted terminal repeats required for packaging. The inverted terminal repeats are the only elements within the vector genome cassette derived from the wild-type AAV genome, thereby eliminating 96% of viral elements. Recombinant AAV9 vectors generated thus allow quantitation of viral infectivity (or transduction efficiency) through luciferase transgene expression assays. HEK293 cells utilized for production of recombinant AAV9 vectors were obtained from the UNC vector core. Sonicated cell lysates and PEG8000 precipitates from supernatant were pooled and subjected to cesium chloride ultracentrifugation as described earlier (23Grieger J.C. Choi V.W. Samulski R.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1412-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Dialyzed peak fractions were subjected to quantitative PCR using a Roche Light Cycler instrument with luc transgene-specific primers to determine viral vector titers (forward, 5′-AAA AGC ACT CTG ATT GAC AAA TAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCT TCG CTT CAA AAA ATG GAA C-3′). All cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B (Sigma) and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C unless mentioned otherwise. COS-1 (monkey kidney), Neuro2a (mouse neuroblastoma), U87 (human glioma) and Huh7 (human hepatocarcinoma) cells were obtained from the UNC tissue culture facility and utilized in viral transduction assays. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Pro5 and mutant Lec1, Lec2 cell lines were a gift from Dr. Jude Samulski (UNC Chapel Hill), and the CHO Lec8 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. All CHO cells, utilized for viral binding and transduction assays, were cultured in α-MEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B as outlined above. Well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures (4–6 weeks) grown on permeable membrane supports (Millipore, Corning, NY) at the air-liquid interface were provided by the Cell Culture Models Core and the UNC Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research Center. Different cell lines were seeded at 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C. Plates were then prechilled at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated with AAV9 vectors at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1000 vector genomes (vg)/cell to allow binding to the cell surface for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Unbound virions were then removed by washing three times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS), and 0.5 ml of DMEM added to each well. Luciferase transgene expression levels were quantitated after incubation for 24 h from cell lysates using a Victor 2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For studies with HAE, well differentiated cultures were pretreated with 1.25 units/ml sialidase A (Prozyme GK80040) at 37 °C for 3 h followed by three washes with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cultures were then incubated with scAAV9-CMV-GFP vectors (m.o.i. = 105 vg/cell) as outlined above. Fluorescence micrographs of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in HAE cultures at 2 weeks after transduction were obtained using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 20× objective and a Hamamatsu camera. Different cell lines were treated with heparinase I and III (from Flavobacterium heparinum; Sigma H2519 and H8891), chondroitinase ABC (from Proteus vulgaris; Sigma C2905), and neuraminidase type III (from Vibrio cholerae; Sigma N7885) to determine the role of cell surface glycans in AAV9 infection. Briefly, COS-1 cells were seeded at 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and pretreated with 50 milliunits/ml neuraminidase, 3 units/ml heparinase I, 1.5 units/ml heparinase III, and 1.5 units/ml chondroitinase ABC in DMEM at 37 °C for 2 h. Neuro2a, U87, HEK293, and Huh7 cells were treated with neuraminidase alone. Cells were then washed three times with 1× PBS and subjected to AAV9 infection at an m.o.i. of 1000 vg/cell. Luciferase transgene expression assays were carried out as described earlier at 24 h after infection. CHO Lec2 cells were seeded at 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and pretreated for 24 h with small molecule inhibitors of glycosylation, Swainsonine (10 μm; Sigma S8195) and α-benzyl-GalNAc (1 μg/ml; Sigma B4894) to determine the role of N- and O-glycans in AAV9 infection. Cells pretreated with chemicals were subjected to AAV9 infection at an m.o.i. of 1000 vg/cell and luciferase transgene expression assays carried out as described earlier. The sialic acid-deficient cell line, CHO Lec2 was treated with 50 milliunits/ml each of α2,3-(N)-sialyltransferase (Calbiochem 566218), α2,6-(N)-sialyltransferase (Calbiochem 566222), or α2,3-(O)-sialyltransferase (Calbiochem 566227) and 1 mm CMP-sialic acid (Sigma) in medium for 3 h at 37 °C. Untreated CHO Pro5 cells with endogenous sialic acid were included as control. Cells were then rinsed three times with 1× PBS and subjected to AAV9 infection at an m.o.i. of 1000 vg/cell and luciferase transgene expression assays carried out as described earlier. Competitive inhibition of AAV9 infection was carried out using a panel of lectins, concanavalin A (ConA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL I), Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA), and Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Briefly, prechilled CHO Pro5 or mutant Lec2 cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated lectin (fluorescent labeling assay) in α-MEM or along with AAV9 particles (transduction assay at m.o.i. = 10,000 vg/cell) for a period 1.5 h at 4 °C. After three washes with ice-cold 1× PBS to remove unbound virions and/or lectins, cells were imaged using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu camera or incubated for 24 h at 37 °C prior to luciferase transgene expression analysis. CHO Pro5 cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells/well in 96-well plates prior to treatment with 50 milliunits/ml neuraminidase type III from V. cholerae for 2 h at 37 °C. Untreated Pro5 and Lec2 cells were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Cells were then prechilled at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with AAV9 particles at m.o.i. of 102, 5 × 102, 103, 5 × 103, 104, 5 × 104, 105, 5 × 105 vg/cell for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Cells were then subjected to three washes with ice-cold 1× PBS to remove unbound virions. Cell surface-bound virions were collected along with cell lysates following three freeze-thaw cycles and vg copy numbers/cell determined using quantitative PCR as outlined earlier. Binding curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 5 software by applying the single site binding model (Y = Bmax*X/(Kd′ + X)), where Y represents the number of bound virions/cell determined by quantitative PCR; X represents m.o.i.; Bmax is the maximum binding capacity, and Kd′, the observed disassociation constant. All experiments were carried out with 6–8-week old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) maintained and treated in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and as approved by IACUC at UNC-Chapel Hill. Mice were administered via intranasal instillation with either 100 μl of PBS (50 μl/nostril) or 100 μl of neuraminidase type III from V. cholerae (200 milliunits; Sigma). At 2 h after treatment, a dose of 5 × 1010 AAV9 particles in 1× PBS (50 μl/nostril) was administered. Luciferase transgene expression in live animals was obtained using a Xenogen IVIS Lumina® imaging system (Caliper Lifesciences, CA) after intranasal instillation of luciferin substrate (120 mg/kg; Nanolight). Image analysis was carried out using the Living Image software® (Caliper Lifesciences) and luciferase expression reported in relative light units (photons/s per cm2 per steradian). Enzymatic removal of different cell surface glycans was achieved by treating cells with different glycosidases. Removal of terminal sialic acid residues using neuraminidase (from V. cholerae) enhanced AAV9 transduction by >1 log unit compared with virus alone on COS-1 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, hydrolysis of cell surface heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans using heparinase I/III or chondroitinase ABC, respectively, had no effect on viral transduction compared with control. Neuraminidase treatment abrogated AAV1 transduction, whereas AAV2 remained unaffected under these conditions (Fig. 1B). In addition, treatment of cell lines derived from different tissues with neuraminidase (gray bars) prior to AAV9 infection enhanced transduction efficiency by nearly 2 log units in contrast to infection with virus alone (white bars) (Fig. 1C). These results were corroborated by increased binding and internalization of AAV9, but not AAV1 vectors upon sialidase treatment in these cell lines (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Thus, sialic acid appears to mask cell surface glycans that selectively facilitate AAV9 infection in vitro. Further, enzymatic desialylation might serve as a facile biochemical strategy to enhance transduction efficiency of AAV9 vectors in vitro and might enable detailed analysis of intracellular trafficking pathways. Analysis of cell surface binding and infectivity of AAV1 and AAV9 on parental (Pro5) and mutant CHO cell lines was carried out to further understand the role of core glycans under sialic acid in AAV9 infection. The CHO Lec2 cell line lacks terminal sialic acid due to a defect in CMP-sialic acid transport (24Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas Lec8 and Lec1 cell lines are defective in translocation of UDP-galactose and N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase activity (25Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stanley P. Chaney W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1204-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), respectively. Correspondingly, cell surface glycans on CHO Lec2 cells contain terminal galactosyl residues, whereas Lec8 and Lec1 cell lines display predominantly terminal N-acetylglucosamine and mannosylated glycans, respectively (Fig. 2A). As seen in Fig. 2, B and C, cell surface binding and transduction of AAV9 particles (gray bars) on Lec2 cells are significantly increased (>1 log unit) compared with the parental Pro5 cell line. In contrast, AAV1 (white bars), which requires sialic acid for infection, shows ∼10-fold decrease in binding and transduction in all CHO Lec mutant cell lines. In addition, no major changes in binding and infectivity are observed in case of Lec8 and Lec1 cells for AAV9 particles. These results suggest that galactosylated glycans immediately underlying sialic acid can facilitate AAV9 cell surface binding and entry. The results also support the notion that AAV9 particles might exploit an inefficient and nonspecific uptake mechanism in the parental Pro5 and mutant Lec8 and Lec1 cell lines. To elucidate the nature of glycans required for AAV9 infection further, we utilized small molecule inhibitors of glycosylation and sialyltransferases to modify terminal galactosyl residues on the sialic acid-deficient Lec2 cell surface. Swainsonine (27Elbein A.D. Solf R. Dorling P.R. Vosbeck K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 7393-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and α-benzyl-O-GalNAc (28Kuan S.F. Byrd J.C. Basbaum C. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19271-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are chemical inhibitors of N-linked and O-linked glycosylation, respectively. Treatment with these reagents results in a corresponding decrease in cell surface expression of N-linked glycans and O-linked glycans. As seen in Fig. 3A, AAV9 infection is significantly blocked by Swainsonine (∼ 75%), whereas α-benzyl-O-GalNAc has a modest inhibitory effect (∼25%). These results suggest that AAV9 prefers N-linked cell surface glycans for infection. In addition, resialylation of the sialic acid-deficient Lec2 cell surface was carried out to understand the nature of the sialic acid linkage that blocks AAV9 infection (Fig. 3B). The abilities of different sialyltransferases to partially block AAV9 infection was observed to follow the order α2,3-N-sialyltransferase (3′NST) > α2,6-N-sialyltransferase (6′NST) > α2,3-O-sialyltransferase (3′OST). Alteration of cell surface glycans upon resialylation was confirmed by staining with lectins recognizing different glycan residues and linkages (Fig. 3C). As expected Pro5 cells expressing sialylated glycans and Lec2 cells expressing asialoglycans demonstrate preferential staining by FITC-MAL I and FITC-ECL, respectively. Resialylation of Gal(β1,4)GlcNAc residues with 3′NST, but not 3′OST partially restores FITC-MAL-I staining concurrent with decrease in AAV9 transduction. The lack of MAL I staining in 6′NST-treated Lec2 cells is expected due to lack of recognition of α2,6-sialylated glycans by MAL I. Taken together, these results not only corroborate the important role played by core N-linked glycans in AAV9 infection, but also the potential for α2,3 and α2,6 sialic acid linkages to block infection by masking underlying glycoconjugates on the cell surface. To understand better the nature of AAV9-glycan interactions that mediate infection, we carried out competitive inhibition studies with lectins that recognize different glycan linkages on the cell surface (Fig. 4, A and B). Specifically, we utilized (i) MAL I, which recognizes native, α2,3-sialylated, or sulfated glycoconjugates having Gal(β1,4)N-GlcNAc structures (29Wang W.C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bai X. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); (ii) SNA lectin, which binds preferentially to α2,6-sialylated galactose residues (31Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekaert W.F. Nsimba-Lubaki M. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1596-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) ECL, which demonstrates specificity toward galactose residues, in particular, Gal(β1,4)N-GlcNAc (32Wu A.M. Wu J.H. Tsai M.S. Yang Z. Sharon N. Herp A. Glycoconj. J. 2007; 24: 591-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); (iv) WGA, which binds N-GlcNAc and tolerates glycoconjugates containing sialic acid with different linkages (33Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Matsumoto I. Osawa T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5894-5899Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); and (v) ConA, which recognizes mannose residues (34Ohyama Y. Kasai K. Nomoto H. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6882-6887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SNA lectin had no effect on AAV9 infection and can be explained by low levels of α2,6-sialylated glycans in both cell lines of rodent (hamster) origin (35Stults N.L. Fechheimer M. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19956-19966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the MAL I demonstrated 5–10-fold inhibition of AAV9 infection in both Pro5 and Lec2 cell lines. More importantly, a striking difference in AAV9 transduction was observed in case of ECL-treated cells with 5-fold inhibition in parental Pro5 cells and nearly 200-fold inhibitory activity in the Lec2 cell line, demonstrating the importance of core Galβ1-linked residues. The ConA and WGA lectins demonstrated broad inhibitory activity in both parental Pro5 cells and the sialic acid-deficient Lec2 cell line suggesting that underlying N-GlcNAc and core mannose residues might contribute to AAV9-glycan interactions. These results were corroborated by fluorescent staining of Pro5 and Lec2 cell lines with aforementioned lectins (Fig. 4C). As expected, MAL I and WGA lectin, which bind to α2,3-sialylated glycans, preferentially label Pro5 cells. In contrast, preferential ECL staining is noted in Lec2 cells. The SNA lectin, which recognizes α2,6-sialic acid, does not stain either Pro5 or Lec2 cells, confirming the lack (or modest expression) of α2,6-sialylated glycans on these hamster-derived cell lines. Further evidence supporting the important role of galactose in mediating AAV9 infection was obtained by treatment of CHO Pro5 cells with endo-β-galactosidase (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Removal of galactose residues, but not fucose abrogated AAV9 transduction. Taken together, these results suggest that terminal galactosyl residues serve as the primary receptor for AAV9. Cell surface binding curves were generated to establish a quantitative biochemical rationale for the observed increase in AAV9 transduction following desialylation. Binding of AAV9 particles to the surface of parental CHO Pro5 cells, sialidase-treated Pro5 cells, or sialic acid-deficient Lec2 cells was carried out over a range of multiplicities of infection (vg/cell). As seen in Fig. 5, enzymatic removal of sialic acid partially recapitulates the effect of genetic desialylation by increasing the number of cell surface-bound AAV9 particles. Nonlinear regression analyses of binding data were carried out using the single site binding model (Y = Bmax*X/(Kd′ + X)), where X and Y represent multiplicity of infection and number of bound AAV9 particles, respectively; Bmax is the maximum binding capacity, and Kd′ is the relative (observed) binding affinity. Calculation of aforementioned parameters reveals Bmax values averaging 375 vg/cell on wild-type Pro5 cells, a ∼3-fold increase to 1025 vg/cell on sialidase-treated Pro5 cells, and a ∼5-fold increase to 1971 vg/cell on the sialic acid-deficient Lec2 cell line. These results support the observation that AAV9 prefers asialo N-glycans with terminal Galβ1-linked residues. In addition, an apparent decrease in Kd′ (∼3-fold) is observed in Lec2 cells as well as a corresponding 15-fold increase in relative binding potential (Bmax/Kd′) (Table 1). These results support the notion that enhanced avidity plays a role in mediating AAV9 binding to asialo N-glycans.TABLE 1Binding parameters for AAV9 interactions with cell surface glycansParametersPro5Pro5 + SialidaseLec2Bmax (vg/cell)3.75 × 102 ± 0.86 × 1021.03 × 103 ± 0.19 × 1031.97 × 103 ± 0.25 × 103Kd′ (vg/cell)3.58 × 105 ± 1.64 × 1053.34 × 105 ± 1.26 × 1051.22 × 105 ± 0.41 × 105Bmax/Kd′1.05 × 10−33.07 × 10−31.62 × 10−2R20.970.960.96 Open table in a new tab To evaluate the potential of enzymatic desialylation as a strategy to enhance gene transfer by AAV9 vectors, we evaluated the effe"

X-Y chromosome segregation hinges on efficient crossing-over in a very small region of homology, the pseudoautosomal region (PAR). We find that mouse PAR DNA occupies unusually long chromosome axes, potentially as shorter chromatin loops, predicted to promote double-strand break (DSB) formation. Most PARs show delayed appearance of RAD51/DMC1 foci, which mark DSB ends, and all PARs undergo delayed DSB-mediated homologous pairing. Analysis of Spo11β isoform-specific transgenic mice revealed that late RAD51/DMC1 foci in the PAR are genetically distinct from both early PAR foci and global foci and that late PAR foci promote efficient X-Y pairing, recombination, and male fertility. Our findings uncover specific mechanisms that surmount the unique challenges of X-Y recombination."

Combined with previous findings, these results suggest that the SRP:SR GTPase complex initially assembles at the tetraloop end of the SRP RNA and then relocalizes to the opposite end of the RNA. This rearrangement provides a mechanism for coupling GTP hydrolysis to the handover of cargo to the translocon."

To determine the relationship of these messengers, we investigated the direct interaction of PA with Arabidopsis sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) that phosphorylate phytosphingosine to generate phyto-S1P. Two unique SPHK cDNAs were cloned from the annotated At4g21540 locus of Arabidopsis, and the two transcripts are differentially expressed in Arabidopsis tissues.

PA is a minor membrane lipid, constituting less than 1% of total phospholipids in most plant tissues (4Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). However, the cellular level of PA in plants is dynamic, increasing rapidly under various conditions, including chilling, freezing, wounding, pathogen elicitation, dehydration, salt, nutrient starvation, nodule induction, and oxidative stress (1Wang X. Devaiah S.P. Zhang W. Welti R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 250-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2Bargmann B.O. Munnik T. Curr. Opin.

Acta. 2009; 1791: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The functional significance of PA has been indicated by characterization of various phospholipase Ds (PLD) that produce regulatory PA and by measurements of PA changes under different stress conditions (1Wang X. Devaiah S.P. Zhang W. Welti R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 250-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2Bargmann B.O. Munnik T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Characterization of genetic ablations, together with biochemical analyses, has shown that different PLDs have unique functions (1Wang X. Devaiah S.P. Zhang W. Welti R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 250-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 7Hong Y. Pan X. Welti R. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 803-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The differential activation, expression, and cellular locales, as well as substrate preferences of PLDs, indicate that the cellular location and timing of PA production are important determinants of PA function. A series of recent results have provided mechanistic insights into how specific PLD and PA mediate the abscisic acid (ABA) promotion of stomatal closure in Arabidopsis (8Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9508-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 9Mishra G. Zhang W. Deng F. Zhao J. Wang X. Science. 2006; 312: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Recently, PLDα1 and PA were found to regulate NADPH oxidase activity and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ABA-mediated stomatal closure (10Zhang Y. Zhu H. Zhang Q. Li M. Yan M. Wang R. Wang L. Welti R. Zhang W. Wang X. The Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 2357-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In addition to PA, another lipid messenger, long-chain base-1-phosphate (LCBP) including sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and phyto-S1P has been found to promote the ABA effect on stomatal closure (11Ng C.K. Carr K. McAinsh M.R. Powell B. Hetherington A.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 12Coursol S. Fan L.M. Le Stunff H. Spiegel S. Gilroy S. Assmann S.M.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis sphingosine kinase (SPHK) activity was mainly associated with the membrane fraction (13Coursol S. Le Stunff H. Lynch D.V. Gilroy S. Assmann S.M. Spiegel S. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recent study suggests that sphingosine and S1P are not detectable in Arabidopsis leaves due to the lack of expression of sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase, indicating that sphingosine and S1P are unlikely to play a significant role in ABA-mediated stomatal closure (14Michaelson L.V. Zäuner S. Markham J.E. Haslam R.P. Desikan R. Mugford S. Albrecht S. Warnecke D. Sperling P. Heinz E. Napier J.A. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, knock-out of Arabidopsis SPHK1 rendered the stomatal closure less sensitive to ABA, whereas overexpression of SPHK1 increased stomatal closure and ABA sensitivity (15Worrall D. Liang Y.K. Alvarez S. Holroyd G.H. Spiegel S. Panagopulos M. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. Plant J. 2008; 56: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These results suggest that other LCBPs are involved in ABA signaling in Arabidopsis (16Lynch D.V. Chen M. Cahoon E.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2009; 14: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine is one of such LCBs in Arabidopsis leaves and its phosphorylated form, phyto-S1P, is also detectable in Arabidopsis leaves (17Markham J.E. Jaworski J.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 21: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, ABA promotes the formation of PA and phyto-S1P, and both PLD/PA and SPHK/phyto-S1P positively regulate ABA-mediated stomatal closure (8Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9508-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 13Coursol S. Le Stunff H. Lynch D.V. Gilroy S. Assmann S.M. Spiegel S. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between PA and phyto-S1P in plant signaling pathways is unknown. One important mode of action by PA to regulate cell function is through its direct interaction with effector proteins (1Wang X. Devaiah S.P. Zhang W. Welti R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 250-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). PA has been reported to bind to various proteins, including transcriptional factors, protein kinases, lipid kinases, protein phosphatases, and proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangement (1Wang X. Devaiah S.P. Zhang W. Welti R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 250-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Several PA-interacting proteins have been identified in plants, including ABI1, PDK1, CTR1, TGD2, and NADPH oxidase (8Zhang W. Qin C. Zhao J. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Acidic phospholipids including PA have been suggested to stimulate SPHK activity (22Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PLD activation up-regulated SPHK in mammalian cells (23Melendez A.J. Allen J.M. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PLD activator, PKC, was found to activate SPHK1 (24Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). PA has also been suggested to promote the intracellular translocation of cytosolic murine SPHK1 to membranes enriched in PA (25Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Thompson D. Krugmann S. Pyne S. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44763-44774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SPHK is an effector protein of PA in animal cells. To determine the relationship of the lipid messengers PA and phyto-S1P in regulating plant functions, we investigated the direct interaction of PA with Arabidopsis SPHK1 (At4g21540) that phosphorylates phytosphingosine to generate phyto-S1P. During the study, we found that the annotated At4g21540 locus of Arabidopsis actually encodes two SPHKs and both SPHKs are associated with the vacuolar membrane. PA binds to both Arabidopsis SPHKs and the interaction stimulates their activity by promoting the binding of lipid substrate to the catalytic site of the enzyme. The At4g21540 locus contains a tandem repeat, and the second repeat sequence was previously cloned and named as SPHK1 (15Worrall D. Liang Y.K. Alvarez S. Holroyd G.H. Spiegel S. Panagopulos M. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. Plant J. 2008; 56: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The coding region of SPHK1 was amplified from a stock DNA for At4g21540 obtained from ABRC (Stock U16738) using specific primers AtSPHK1-F 5′-TAGGATCCATGGATCGTCAGCCGGAGAGGGA-3′ and AtSPHK1-R 5′-TACTCGAGTTATTCAGGAGAGAAGAGAGTGGC-3′ with engineered BamHI and XhoI (underlined) sites, respectively. The cDNA of the first repeat (SPHK2) of At4g21540 was amplified from Arabidopsis leaf cDNA using the primers: 5′-ATGGAGAATGATCAATTCATGTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCAAGATGGAGGGAGACGAGT-3′ (reverse). The cloned fragments were sequenced and a stop codon was found at the 3′-end. Then the following primers were designed to clone the coding region of SPHK2: AtSPHK2-F 5′-GCGGGATCCATGGAGAATGATCAATTCATGTGTC-3′ and AtSPHK2-R 5′-GCGCTCGAGTCAATATTCAGGAGAGAAGAGTG-3′ with engineered BamHI and XhoI (underlined) sites, respectively. Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs) was used for PCR under the condition of 98 °C 1min, 40 cycles of 98 °C 10 s, 60 °C 20 s, and 72 °C 30 s. The cDNA of SPHK1 and SPHK2 were amplified using the primers described above and ligated to pET-28a-c(+) vector to produce SPHK1 and SPHK2 with 6 histidine residues at the N terminus. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression of SPHKs was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl-1- thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 20 °C for 10 min. SPHKs were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications. The cells (harvested from 200 ml cell culture) were resupended in 10 ml of lysis buffer and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min and the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The agarose beads were pelleted and washed three times with a wash buffer. Protein was eluted with an elution buffer and dialyzed with TBS buffer overnight. The dialyzed protein was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay. Purified proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The prepared proteins for activity assay were kept in 50% glycerol at −80 °C. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) plants were grown in a growth chamber with cool white light of 200 μmol m−2·s−1 under 12-h light/12-h dark and 23 °C/19 °C cycles. Total RNA was isolated from tissues of 8-week-old Arabidopsis plants using RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR using RNA as template without reverse transcription. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit in a total volume of 20 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The efficiency of the cDNA synthesis was assessed by real-time PCR amplification of a control gene encoding UBQ10 (At4g05320). cDNAs were then diluted to yield similar threshold cycle (Ct) values (20Lu B. Benning C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17420-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) based on the Ct of the UBQ10. The level of individual gene expression was normalized to that of UBQ10 by subtracting the Ct value of UBQ10 from the tested genes. PCR was performed with a MyiQ system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green. Each reaction contained 7.5 μl of 2×SYBR Green master mix reagent (Bio-Rad), 3.5 μl diluted cDNA, and 200 nm of each gene-specific primer in a final volume of 15 μl. The primers were as follows: UBQ10, 5′-CACACTCCACTTGGTCTTGCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGTCTTTCCGGTGAGAGTCTTCA-3′ (reverse); SPHK1, AGACCTTGGTTGAGAAAGGAGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGGAACTTATCGGACCAAAGCT-3′ (reverse); SPHK2, 5′-CGGTGGACAGAGTATGGACTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCAGATTCCTCCTGCCT-3′ (reverse). The real-time PCR condition was: 95 °C for 3 min; and 50 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. SPHK1 and SPHK2 cDNA were cloned into p35S-FAST/eYFP, which was derived from p35S-FAST by introducing eYFP. Agro-infiltration for transient protein expression in tobacco leaves was performed as described by Voinnet et al. (26Voinnet O. Rivas S. Mestre P. Baulcombe D. Plant J. 2003; 33: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into C58C1 Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and grown to stationary phase. Bacterial cells were collected and resuspended in solution containing 10 mm MES (pH 5.7), 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mg ml−1 acetosyringone. 3-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with the bacteria solutions through abaxial air spaces. p35S-FAST/eYFP and p35S-FAST/PLDδ:eYFP were transformed as control. The eYFP fluorescence was examined in tobacco leaves using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal/muti-photon microscope, with a 488 nm excitation mirror and a 505–530 nm and 530–560 nm emission filter to record images. The above SPHK:eYFP contsructs were transformed into Arabidopsis to obtain transgenic plants. To isolated subcellular fractions, total proteins from leaves of SPHK1 or 2 transgenic Arabidopsis plants were extracted with a chilled buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 2 mm DTT. Total protein was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove tissue debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant and pellet are referred to as the soluble and microsomal fractions. The plasma and intracellular membranes were prepared using an aqueous polymer two-phase system according to the method described by Fan et al. (27Fan L. Zheng S. Cui D. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To isolate tonoplasts, protoplasts were prepared from fully expanded leaves of 4–6-week-old Arabidopsis (28Yoo S.D. Cho Y.H. Sheen J. Nature Protocols. 2007; 2: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were then purified from protoplasts following the protocol adapted from Jaquinod et al. (29Jaquinod M. Villiers F. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Hugouvieux V. Bruley C. Garin J. Bourguignon J. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2007; 6: 394-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Marker enzymes for the plasma membrane, intracellular membrane, and tonoplast are ATPase, cytochrome c reductase, and α-mannosidase, respectively (27Fan L. Zheng S. Cui D. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Jaquinod M. Villiers F. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Hugouvieux V. Bruley C. Garin J. Bourguignon J. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2007; 6: 394-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins from different fractions was determined using the Bradford protein assay. Proteins from the different fractions were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. SPHK1 was immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody and SPHK2 was detected with anti-GFP antibody. Sphingosine, phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine (d-erythro-DHS), dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (dl-threo-DHS), N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. 4-Hydroxy-8-sphingenine (t18:1) and 4, 8-sphingadienine (d18:2) were generous gifts from Dr Daniel Lynch (Williams College). SPHK activity was measured as previously described with some modifications (30Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified SPHK was incubated at 37 °C in 200 μl of sphingosine kinase buffer in the presence of 50 μm sphingolipid added in micellar form with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi, 1 mm) in 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 800 μl of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:200:1; v/v/v). Chloroform (250 μl) and 2 m KCl (250 μl) were then added sequentially to generate a two-phase system. The labeled lipids in the organic phases were separated by TLC with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1;v/v/v/v) and visualized with a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For quantification, LCBP was scraped and extracted from the TLC plate and quantified by scintillation counter. SPHK activity was expressed as nanomol of LCBP formed per minute and per milligram of protein. Michaelis-Menten plots and enzyme kinetic parameters were analyzed using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module. The filter binding was performed as described with some modifications (31Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Lipids (10 μg) were spotted on a nitrocellulose filter, followed by incubation with purified His-tagged SPHK in TBST (0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. The filter was washed three times with TBST (0.1% Tween 20). The filter was then incubated with anti-His antibody, followed by incubation with a second antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. SPHK protein that bound to lipids on filters was visualized by staining alkaline phosphatase activity. Liposome binding assay was performed as described (10Zhang Y. Zhu H. Zhang Q. Li M. Yan M. Wang R. Wang L. Welti R. Zhang W. Wang X. The Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 2357-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). PC and PA were mixed in the molar ratio of 2:1 in chloroform with the final concentration of lipids per sample being at 640 nmol. The lipids were dried under nitrogen and rehydrated for 1 h using extrusion buffer containing 250 mm raffinose, 25 mm Tris pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT. Liposomes were produced using lipid extruder (0.2 μm filters, Avanti Polar Lipids) following the manufacturer's protocol. Liposomes were diluted in three volumes of a binding buffer containing 125 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 15 min. The liposome pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer, and 1.2 μg of purified SPHKs was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The His-tagged SPHK protein used in the assay was preclarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min to remove any insoluble protein. Liposomes were harvested by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 30 min and washed three times in the binding buffer. Liposomes were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred on a PVDF membrane, followed by immunoblotting using anti-His antibodies. SPR binding assays were performed using a Biacore 2000 system according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Liposomes were prepared by mixing PC and PA at a 2:1 molar ratio as described above. Liposomes were resuspended in a running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, pH7.4). The purified His-tagged SPHK1 was dialyzed in the running buffer overnight at 4 °C, and then the protein was centrifuged at 13,000 × g to remove insoluble protein. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Biacore Sensor Chip NTA designed to bind His-tagged proteins for interaction analysis was used to immobilize protein. For each experiment, the running buffer containing 500 μm NiCl2 was injected to saturate the NTA chip with nickel. His-tagged SPHK1 protein (2 μm) was immobilized on the sensor chip via Ni2+/NTA chelation. Lipid-SPHK interaction was monitored as di16:0 PA/di18:1 PC or di18:1 PA/di18:1 PC liposomes (100 μm) were injected in sequence over the surface of the sensor chip. The liposome made with di18:1 PC only was used as control. Sensor chip was regenerated by stripping nickel from the surface with a regeneration buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA, pH 8.3). During the evaluation, the sensorgrams from the beginning of association to the end of dissociation for each protein-liposome interaction were analyzed and plotted by SigmaPlot 10.0. Kinetic constants including Bmax, association (kon) and dissociation rate (koff) were analyzed using the BIAevaluation Software. Triton X-100/lipid micelles were prepared according to the method described by Qin et al. (32Qin C. Wang C. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49685-49690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine dissolved in ethanol was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and de-ionized water was added to give a final concentration of 1 mm. The phytosphingosine suspension was sonicated on ice until clear. To obtain specific substrate concentrations at the desired mol fraction (MF), the phytosphingosine solution was diluted with Triton X-100 stock solution (40 mm) using the following formula: mol fractionphytosphingosine = [phytosphingosine]/([phytosphingosine]+[Triton X-100 (free)]); [Triton X-100 (free)] = [Triton X-100 (total)] − critical micelle concentration of Triton X-100 (0.24 mm). When the effect of PA mol concentration was to be tested, PA was added at this point, using the following formula: mol fractionPA = [PA]/([phytosphingosine] + [PA] + [Triton X-100 (free)]). The Triton X-100/phytosphingosine mixture was vortexed briefly and let stand at room temperature for half an hour. Four genes showing homology to human and mouse SPHK genes have been annotated in the Arabidopsis genome. At5g23450 encodes a long-chain base kinase, designated as AtLCBK1 (33Nishiura H. Tamura K. Morimoto Y. Imai H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 747-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whereas At5g51290 was reported to be a ceramide kinase (34Liang H. Yao N. Song J.T. Luo S. Lu H. Greenberg J.T. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2636-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). At2g46090 did not have sphingosine phosphorylating activity (15Worrall D. Liang Y.K. Alvarez S. Holroyd G.H. Spiegel S. Panagopulos M. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. Plant J. 2008; 56: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At4g21540 potentially encodes two SPHKs in tandem but was annotated as one SPHK in database (Fig. 1A). A cDNA from the second repeat was previously reported to encode an active SPHK while the cloning of the first repeat remained unsuccessful (15Worrall D. Liang Y.K. Alvarez S. Holroyd G.H. Spiegel S. Panagopulos M. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. Plant J. 2008; 56: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Utilizing primers corresponding to the first and second repeats, corresponding cDNAs were cloned and further verified by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1B). Sequencing of the first repeat revealed a stop codon at the 3′-end that is 788 bp upstream of the start codon of the second repeat SPHK1. Thus, the annotated At4g21540 is actually comprised of two separate SPHK genes (Fig. 1A). Since the second repeat was already named SPHK1(15Worrall D. Liang Y.K. Alvarez S. Holroyd G.H. Spiegel S. Panagopulos M. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. Plant J. 2008; 56: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we thus designated the first repeat SPHK2. Both genes have 10 exons and 9 introns, and the size of exons from 2 to 9 is the same for two genes. Arabidopsis SPHK1 and SPHK2 share 72.6% identity of amino acid sequences. Like mouse SPHK1, both SPHK1 and SPHK2 have 5 conserved C domains in the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1C). The expression of SPHK1 and SPHK2 in different Arabidopsis tissues was examined by real-time PCR (Fig. 2A). Both SPHK1 and SPHK2 were detectable in all tissues examined and they had similar levels of expression in flowers, siliques, young leaves, and roots. However, SPHK1 had a much higher expression level in inflorescence, older leaves, and stems than SPHK2 (Fig. 2A). These distinguishable patterns of expression further support the finding that SPHK1 and SPHK2 are encoded by two separate genes. To determine the intracellular location of these enzymes, SPHK1 and SPHK2 were fused with yellow fluorescence protein (eYFP) at the C terminus and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves while eYFP and PLDδ:eYFP were used as control. eYFP alone was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm as expected, as the eYFP fluorescence surrounded the chloroplast in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B, panel a). PLDδ was previously documented to be associated with the plasma membrane (35Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and the distribution of PLDδ:eYFP associated with the plasma membrane was consistent with the previous results (Fig. 2B, panel b). The subcellular distribution of SPHK1:eYFP and SPHK2:eYFP both were different from that of eYFP or the plasma membrane-associated PLDδ:eYFP. Using chloroplast (red color) as a reference, SPHK1:eYFP and SPHK2:eYFP fluorescence was separated from the plasma membrane by chloroplasts (Fig. 2B, panels c and d), indicating that they ar"
https://openalex.org/W2083009331,"Numerous reports have shown that mitochondrial dysfunctions play a major role in apoptosis of Leishmania parasites, but the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in Leishmania remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways in Leishmania major using tunicamycin as an ER stress inducer. ER stress activates the expression of ER-localized chaperone protein BIP/GRP78 (binding protein/identical to the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein) with concomitant generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Upon exposure to ER stress, the elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) level is observed due to release of Ca(2+) from internal stores. Increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) causes mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and ATP loss as ablation of Ca(2+) by blocking voltage-gated cation channels with verapamil preserves mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP content. Furthermore, ER stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent release of cytochrome c and endonuclease G from mitochondria to cytosol and subsequent translocation of endonuclease G to nucleus are observed. Inhibition of caspase-like proteases with the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone or metacaspase inhibitor antipain does not prevent nuclear DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine exposure. Conversely, significant protection in tunicamycin-induced DNA degradation and phosphatidylserine exposure was achieved by either pretreatment of antioxidants (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, GSH, and L-cysteine), chemical chaperone (4-phenylbutyric acid), or addition of Ca(2+) chelator (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester). Taken together, these data strongly demonstrate that ER stress-induced apoptosis in L. major is dependent on ROS and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial toxicity but independent of caspase-like proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1486372353,"Evidence suggests that the C-terminal truncation of α-synuclein is equally important as aggregation of α-synuclein in Parkinson disease (PD). Our previous results showed that an endopeptidase, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3), was induced and activated in dopaminergic (DA) cells upon stress conditions. Here, we report that MMP3 cleaved α-synuclein in vitro and in vivo and that α-synuclein and MMP3 were co-localized in Lewy bodies (LB) in the postmortem brains of PD patients. Incubation of α-synuclein with the catalytic domain of MMP3 (cMMP3) resulted in generation of several peptides, and the peptide profiles of WT α-synuclein (WTsyn) and A53T mutant (A53Tsyn) were different. Combined analysis using mass spectrometry and N-terminal determination revealed that MMP3 generated C-terminally truncated peptides of amino acids 1-78, 1-91, and 1-93 and that A53Tsyn produced significantly higher quantities of these peptides. Similar sizes of peptides were detected in N27 DA cells under oxidative stress and RNA interference to knock down MMP3-attenuated peptide generation. Co-overexpression of cMMP3 with either WTsyn or A53Tsyn led to a reduction in Triton X-100-insoluble aggregates and an increase in protofibril-like small aggregates. In addition, overexpression of the 1-93-amino acid peptide in the substantia nigra led to DA neuronal loss without LB-like aggregate formation. The results strongly indicate that MMP3 digestion of α-synuclein in DA neurons plays a pivotal role in the progression of PD through modulation of α-synuclein in aggregation, LB formation, and neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2047783599,"Parkinson disease is characterized cytopathologically by the deposition in the midbrain of aggregates composed primarily of the presynaptic neuronal protein α-synuclein (AS). Neurotoxicity is currently attributed to oligomeric microaggregates subjected to oxidative modification and promoting mitochondrial and proteasomal dysfunction. Unphysiological binding to membranes of these and other organelles is presumably involved. In this study, we performed a systematic determination of the influence of charge, phase, curvature, defects, and lipid unsaturation on AS binding to model membranes using a new sensitive solvatochromic fluorescent probe. The interaction of AS with vesicular membranes is fast and reversible. The protein dissociates from neutral membranes upon thermal transition to the liquid disordered phase and transfers to vesicles with higher affinity. The binding of AS to neutral and negatively charged membranes occurs by apparently different mechanisms. Interaction with neutral bilayers requires the presence of membrane defects; binding increases with membrane curvature and rigidity and decreases in the presence of cholesterol. The association with negatively charged membranes is much stronger and much less sensitive to membrane curvature, phase, and cholesterol content. The presence of unsaturated lipids increases binding in all cases. These findings provide insight into the relation between membrane physical properties and AS binding affinity and dynamics that presumably define protein localization in vivo and, thereby, the role of AS in the physiopathology of Parkinson disease.

The α-helix-forming region spans seven imperfect 11-residue repeats, six of which contain a highly conserved motif, XKTK(E/Q)GVXXXX (Fig. 1).

Furthermore, AS-membrane interactions have been reported to play a role in Parkinson disease pathology (16Auluck P.K. Caraveo G. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

For example, there is compelling evidence suggesting that low molecular AS aggregates or oligomers disrupt membranes and/or induce the formation of ion channels (20Zakharov S.D. Hulleman J.D.

Due to their high affinity for AS, membranes are important factors in protein localization and rate of aggregation. Experiments in vitro show that depending on membrane composition (charge, acyl chain saturation), lipids either accelerate (23Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J.

Early studies showed that the binding of AS to extracts of brain tissue lipid membranes did not require the presence of other proteins (27Kubo S. Nemani V.M. Chalkley R.J. Anthony M.D. Hattori N.

Because the lipophilic N-terminal part of AS is positively charged, the protein has a preference for anionic membranes (28Rhoades E. Ramlall T.F. Webb W.W. Eliezer D. Biophys.

The effects of the membrane phase and curvature on AS binding are still a subject of discussion (4Bisaglia M. Mammi S. Bubacco L. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been reported that AS interacts preferentially with membranes in the liquid disordered (Ld) phase (29Stöckl M. Fischer P. Wanker E. Herrmann A. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Kjaer L. Giehm L. Heimburg T. Otzen D. Biophys.

However, there are instances in which AS demonstrates a higher affinity for rigid and raftlike domains (27Kubo S. Nemani V.M. Chalkley R.J. Anthony M.D. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Edwards R.H. Fortin D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31664-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 37Bartels T. Ahlstrom L.S. Leftin A. Kamp F. Haass C. Brown M.F. Beyer K. Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2116-2124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Microcalorimetry (isothermal titration calorimetry) indicates that binding of AS to neutral small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) in the gel phase is stronger than to membranes in the liquid disordered phase (31Nuscher B. Kamp F. Mehnert T. Odoy S. Haass C. Kahle P.J. Beyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21966-21975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). High membrane curvature was reported to be essential for AS binding to DPPC vesicles (31Nuscher B. Kamp F. Mehnert T. Odoy S. Haass C. Kahle P.J. Beyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21966-21975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but this effect was not observed in the POPC/POPS system (28Rhoades E. Ramlall T.F. Webb W.W. Eliezer D. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4692-4700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Such disagreement is probably due to the use of lipids with different polar headgroups that influence the charge and curvature of membranes. AS binds preferentially to membranes composed of lipids with smaller polar headgroups (e.g. phosphatidic acids) (38van Rooijen B.D. Claessens M.M. Subramaniam V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), probably due to higher surface energy (more defects). High resolution NMR reveals that AS bound to small (∼5 nm) SDS detergent micelles forms two antiparallel α-helices (residues 3–37 and 45–92) (39Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). However, the conformation of AS on lipid membranes is still a subject of discussion. Some EPR reports suggest a broken-helix conformation (40Drescher M. Veldhuis G. van Rooijen B.D. Milikisyants S. Subramaniam V. Huber M. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2010; 132: 8657-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas others show an extended α-helix for residues 9–90 (43Georgieva E.R. Ramlall T.F. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Eliezer D. J.

Most studies devoted to AS interaction with membranes have been focused on particular lipidic systems without taking membrane diversity into account. Thus, the discrepant results and interpretations may reflect compositional issues as well as differences in key experimental parameters, such as lipid/protein ratio (47Bodner C.R. Dobson C.M. Bax A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 775-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and membrane charge (35Drescher M. Godschalk F. Veldhuis G. van Rooijen B.D. Subramaniam V. Huber M. ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 2411-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we addressed systematically the effects of different membrane properties on the thermodynamics and kinetics of AS-membrane interaction by employing environment-sensitive dyes that by virtue of their inherent sensitivity, allowed operation under close-to-native conditions (concentration and temperature). Fluorophores of 3-hydroxyflavone family undergo an excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) that leads to the appearance of a second tautomeric (T*) emission band (48Demchenko A.P. Mély Y. Duportail G. Klymchenko A.S. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 3461-3470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 49Chou P.T. Martinez M.L. Clements J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 2618-2622Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The intensity ratio of the normal (N*) and tautomeric bands is highly sensitive to the environment properties (50Klymchenko A.S. Demchenko A.P. New J. Chem. 2004; 28: 687-692Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 51Klymchenko A.S. Mély Y. Demchenko A.P. Duportail G. Biochim. Biophys.

Diethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone (FE) discriminates between protic and aprotic environments as well as different membrane types (48Demchenko A.P. Mély Y. Duportail G. Klymchenko A.S. Biophys.

Duportail G. Pivovarenko V.G. Klymchenko A.S. Mély Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that FE reveals differences in the supramolecular organization of amyloid fibrils (55Celej M.S. Caarls W. Demchenko A.P. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7465-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the utility of a related ESIPT probe (FC) as a reporter of AS aggregation (56Yushchenko D.A. Fauerbach J.A. Thirunavukkuarasu S. Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 7860-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we constructed a new Cys-reactive probe based on FE, which we introduced into the AS molecule in each of three alternative positions (positions 18, 90, and 140) spanning the protein sequence (Fig. 1). These constructs were used in a series of equilibrium and kinetic studies to establish the key membrane parameters that determine the binding of AS. α-Synuclein and its cysteine variants (A18C, A90C, and A140C) were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (56Yushchenko D.A. Fauerbach J.A. Thirunavukkuarasu S. Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 7860-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (for preparation details, see supplemental material). The protein was ultracentrifuged each time before use, and its concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 275 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 5600 m−1 cm−1. MFE dye was obtained as the product of the reaction of N-β-maleimidopropionic acid with 4′-diethylamino-3-hydroxy-6-aminoflavone. The precursor 4′-diethylamino-3-hydroxy-6-aminoflavone was obtained by oxidative cyclization of the 5′-acetamido-2′-hydroxyacetophenone and 4-diethylaminobenzaldehyde followed by hydrolysis as described elsewhere (54Postupalenko V.Y. Shvadchak V.V. Duportail G. Pivovarenko V.G. Klymchenko A.S. Mély Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). See supplemental material for details. To 1 ml of a 0.2 mm solution of A18C mutant of WT AS in 25 mm Na-PO4 buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mg (15-fold excess) of MFE in 0.5 ml of DMSO was added. The reaction was left for 48 h at 4 °C with mixing. The excess of the dye and DMSO were removed by dilution of the reaction mixture with buffer (to 12 ml) and filtration of the solution through an Amicon Ultracel filter (10 kDa) to obtain 1 ml of crude labeled protein. The derivatized protein was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Pharmacia Smart, Superdex 200HR 10/30 SEC column, 25 mm Na-PO4, pH 6.2) and concentrated with an Amicon Ultracel filter to 0.8 ml. The final labeled protein solution was 0.16 mm and had a labeling efficiency of >90%, as determined from the absorbance of the FE dye (ϵ430 = 32,000 m−1 cm−1). The overall recovery was ∼70%. The MFE derivatives of the A90C and A140C mutants were prepared by the same procedure. All lipidic components were purchased in lyophilized form or in CHCl3 solution from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Stock solutions of 2–5 mm were prepared in CHCl3 and stored in glass vials at −20 °C. Aliquots of the appropriate amounts of the stock solutions were mixed in clean glass vials, and the CHCl3 was removed under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The lipids were placed under vacuum for at least 1 h to ensure complete removal of residual CHCl3 and then rehydrated in 25 mm Na-PO4, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, to a final concentration of 1–2 mm lipid in the form of MLVs. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate films (Nucleopore) in a hand-held extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). The MLV suspension was first reduced in size by seven passages through a large (1-μm) pore size filter. The suspension was then passed 10 times through a filter with a 0.1-μm pore size. For preparation of SUVs, the hydrated lipid solution was sonicated (Kontes Micro cell disrupter, 70–80% power) for 1 h. The resulting colloidal solution was centrifuged 15 min at 15,000 × g to remove traces of metallic particles arising from the tip. The preparations of SUVs and LUVs were performed at temperatures 5–15 °C above the transition points. The size of all vesicles was determined by DLS using a Zetasizer Nano ZS equipped with a 633-nm laser (Malvern Instruments). The measured diameter of all LUVs was 110 ± 10 nm, whereas the mean size of SUVs varied in the range 35–60 nm, depending on composition. The vesicles were used within 2 days of preparation but were found to be structurally stable for at least 2 weeks (LUVs) or 5 days (SUVs) when stored at 4 °C. For vesicles composed of more than one type of lipid, all given percentages are based on relative molar composition. Unless otherwise indicated, all measurements were performed at 37 °C in 25 mm Na-PO4 buffer, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl. CD spectra were obtained with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The protein concentration was 2–10 μm for WT and 2 μm for the labeled mutants. Spectra were recorded using a 2-mm path length cuvette, scanning from 200 to 250 nm with a step size of 0.2 nm and a scanning speed of 20 nm/min. The spectra represent averages of three scans and were corrected for the background from buffer and protein-free vesicles. For the determination of α-helical conformation, the 222 ± 0.2 nm signal was averaged and corrected for dilution. Emission and excitation spectra were recorded with a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian), equipped with a thermally controlled cuvette holder. The protein concentration was 100 nm. The spectra were corrected for wavelength-dependent sensitivity and background light scattering. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined using a reference solution of 4′-diethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone in ethanol (quantum yield 0.51) (49Chou P.T. Martinez M.L. Clements J.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 2618-2622Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The affinities of AS for different artificial membranes were determined by titration of 100 nm protein solutions with 0.1–2 mm solutions of vesicles (depending on the affinity). We avoided lipid/protein ratios less than 10 to prevent vesicle disruption (see supplemental material). The proteins with the fluorescent label at the three positions were compared. The binding curves were fitted to the equation,R=Ro−(Ro−Rf)Kd+P+L/n−(Kd+P+L/n)2−4PL/n2P(Eq.1) where R is the measured signal (emission intensity, corrected for dilution) at a given lipid concentration, L is the total lipid concentration, P is the total concentration of the protein, Kd is the apparent macroscopic dissociation equilibrium constant, and n is the binding stoichiometry (lipids/protein). Rf and Ro are the final (corrected for dilution) and initial signals, respectively. This equation assumes that all binding sites are equivalent and that Kd does not depend on the lipid/protein ratio. The tight binding to anionic lipids (Kd < P ≈ 100 nm) could not be satisfactorily described by this model. In this case, the binding stoichiometry was evaluated as 2L50/P, where L50 is the concentration of lipids corresponding to 50% binding of AS. For comparison of the binding to different membranes, we used L50, which approximates Kd for low affinity systems. The emission spectrum of AS in membranes depends on the lipid composition and therefore could be used as a signature of the protein bound to known types of membrane in competitive assays. The affinity of AS for membranes of two different compositions was compared directly by the addition of the protein to a solution containing an excess of vesicles of both types and comparing the resulting emission spectrum with that of AS bound to each component separately. In a typical experiment, 100 nm AS was added to a solution containing 200 μm DPPC and DOPG SUVs (2000 lipids/protein). The observed spectrum is a weighted sum of the individual spectra of protein bound to DOPG and DPPC,Fλ=aFDPPC,λ+(1−a)FDOPG,λ(Eq.2) where FDPPC,λ and FDOPG,λ are reference spectra of the protein in DPPC and DOPG SUVs, respectively, and a is the molar fraction of AS bound to DPPC SUVs (supplemental Fig. S1). Because both lipids were present in the solution in the same concentration, the ratio a/(1 − a) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding dissociation equilibrium constants for AS, KDOPG/KDPPC. This method works well for comparison of protein binding to two types of membranes with high and comparable affinities. If the preference of the protein for one of the membranes is much higher than for the other (a < 0.1 or a > 0.9), the method provides only a qualitative assessment of which system has the higher affinity. All kinetic measurements were performed on an SX.18MV stopped-flow system (Applied Photophysics). For measurements of the kinetics of AS binding to membranes, equal volumes of a 0.5 μm solution of the protein and 100 μm SUVs were mixed to give a final protein concentration of 250 nm and a lipid-to-protein ratio of 200. The buffer (25 mm Na-PO4, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and temperature (37 °C) were the same as for the spectroscopic measurements. Reactions were monitored by fluorescence using 420 ± 4 nm excitation. Emission was collected with a 525 ± 25 nm band pass filter. Fluorescence was sampled in a 0.02–1-ms interval (logarithmic scale); the dead time of device was 2 ms. 6–10 kinetic curves were recorded for each sample and fitted after averaging by Origin software to the monoexponential model,F(t)=Fo+(Ff−Fo)e−k(t−s)(Eq.3) where F(t) is the fluorescence intensity as a function of time (t); Fo and Ff are the fluorescence of free and membrane-bound AS, respectively; k is the apparent reaction rate constant; and s is an apparent shift between the mixing/initiation time and the start of the recording (typically, s ≈ 0.1 ms). Most of the curves were satisfactory fitted to this model (R2 > 0.98). In a few cases (see Table 1), the presence of an additional slower (k < 0.2 s−1) component corresponding to <20% of the fluorescence changes was detected, and biexponential fitting was employed.F(t)=Fo+(Ff−Fo)(ae−k1(t−s)+(1−a)e−k2(t−s))(Eq.4) TABLE 1Binding parameters of AS to SUVsNameAcyl chainsMtKd (or L50)nkapp°Cμmlipids/ASs−1Neutral (zwitterionic)DSPC18:05514 ± 3300 ± 30NDDPPC16:04116 ± 3300 ± 301.1 ± 0.1aAlso observed a slower process with relati"

Within a cell, phys are synthesized as an inactive Pr conformer that resides in the cytosol. Exposure to red (R) light triggers a conformation shift to a biologically active Pfr form, which migrates into the nucleus and initiates phy signaling (6Fankhauser C. Chen M. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The active Pfr form can be reverted back to the inactive Pr form by exposure to far-red (FR) light. The active Pfr form interacts with multiple signaling partners within the nucleus (7Huq E. Quail P.H. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2005: 151-170Google Scholar) and controls the expression of a large number (10–30% of the genome) of genes to regulate photomorphogenesis (8Ma L. Li J. Qu L. Hager J.

Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, the positively acting transcription factors (e.g. HY5, HFR1, LAF1, and possibly others) are degraded in the dark and stabilized under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. By contrast, the negatively acting transcription factors (e.g. the phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs)) are stable in the dark and degrade in response to light. The net effect of this stabilization and destabilization of transcription factors shapes the transcriptome that regulates photomorphogenesis.PIFs have been shown to play central roles in phy signaling pathways (13Castillon A.

This morphological phenotype is reflected at the gene expression level, where a majority of the light-regulated genes are constitutively expressed in the pifQ mutant in the dark (27Shin J. Kim K.

In wild-type seedlings, light signals perceived by phys promote degradation of PIFs through the ubiquitin/26 S proteasomal pathway to derepress gene expression and promote photomorphogenesis (13Castillon A.

Jang I.C. Chua N.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the light-induced degradation of PIFs is only beginning to be understood. All PIFs except PIF7 are rapidly phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in response to light in vivo prior to their degradation (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E.

The mutant PIF1 and PIF3 that fail to interact with the Pfr forms of phyA and phyB do not undergo light-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting that phy interaction is necessary for the light-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of PIFs. However, the putative kinase(s) and the putative E3 ligase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of PIFs and recognition of the phosphorylated forms for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation are still unknown.CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase II), a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase, has been implicated in regulating light signaling and circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis (32Lee Y.

The Arabidopsis genome has four α subunit and four β subunit genes (39Salinas P. Fuentes D. Vidal E. Jordana X. Echeverria M. Holuigue L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Various members of both the α and β subunit families have been shown to be localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and also in chloroplasts (39Salinas P. Fuentes D. Vidal E. Jordana X. Echeverria M. Holuigue L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A CK2-like activity has been shown to phosphorylate HY5, a positively acting component in a phy signaling pathway (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4997-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, CK2 phosphorylates HFR1, a positively acting HLH transcription factor functioning under FR and blue light pathways (35Park H.J. Ding L. Dai M. Lin R. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both HY5 and HFR1 has been shown to stabilize these transcription factors (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W.

Because CK2-mediated phosphorylation stabilizes the positively acting transcription factors involved in light signaling in Arabidopsis, we reasoned that CK2 might also phosphorylate the negatively acting transcription factors (e.g. PIFs) and regulate their stability/function in Arabidopsis. Here we show that CK2 phosphorylates PIF1 at multiple sites in vitro. In addition, CK2-mediated phosphorylation promotes rapid light-induced degradation of PIF1 to fine-tune photomorphogenesis.DISCUSSIONPreviously, it was shown that PIF1 and PIF3–6 were phosphorylated in response to light before being degraded through the 26 S proteasomal pathway (13Castillon A.

Interactions with both phyA and phyB are necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation and degradation under all three light conditions (4Castillon A. Shen H. Huq E.

Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This study provides biochemical evidence that PIF1 is a substrate for Arabidopsis CK2, a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase present in all organisms. Phosphorylation by CK2 appears to be necessary for the rapid light-induced degradation of PIF1.Several lines of evidence suggest that PIF1 is a bona fide substrate for Arabidopsis CK2. First, in silico studies predicted that PIF1 has multiple CK2 phosphorylation sites (supplemental Table S2). Second, in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that PIF1 is strongly phosphorylated by purified Arabidopsis CK2 α and β subunit holoenzyme combinations (Fig. 1A). Third, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of PIF1 is inhibited by a specific inhibitor, heparin, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Fourth, mapping of the phosphorylation sites identified seven phosphorylation sites scattered throughout the PIF1 polypeptide with a cluster of sites at the C-terminal end (Fig. 2, A–C, and supplemental Fig. S1). Fifth, CK2-mediated phosphorylation enhances the rapid light-induced degradation of PIF1 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Sixth, overexpression of CK2 β subunits accelerates the light-induced degradation of native PIF1 in vivo (Fig. 5A). These data provide strong evidence that PIF1 is a substrate for Arabidopsis CK2 and that CK2 phosphorylation specifically plays a role in the light-induced degradation of PIF1 to promote photomorphogenesis. However, the above data do not show that PIF1 is a substrate for CK2 in vivo. Further experiments are necessary to demonstrate whether CK2 phosphorylates PIF1 in vivo.Previously, CK2 substrates have been identified in plants. These include translation initiation factors (e.g. eIF2α, eIF2β, eIF3c, eIF4B, and eIF5) (40Dennis M.D. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

However, phosphorylation by CK2 has been shown to either stabilize or modulate the activity of these factors (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W.

In contrast, our data show that phosphorylation by CK2 promotes the light-induced degradation of PIF1 through the ubiquitin/26 S proteasomal pathway (Fig. 3A). This is similar to the posttranslational regulation of mammalian IκBα and promyelocytic leukemia proteins, where CK2-mediated phosphorylation enhanced their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (49Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Cai L.F. Erdjument-Bromage H. Kaufman A.J. Singh B. Teruya-Feldstein J. Tempst P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2006; 126: 269-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 50Kato Jr., T. Delhase M. Hoffmann A. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Similar to PIF1, CK2 phosphorylates a cluster of sites at the C terminus of IκBα, and this phosphorylation is UV-light inducible (50Kato Jr., T. Delhase M. Hoffmann A. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, CK2-mediated stabilization and destabilization of proteins might represent an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.Although our data provide strong evidence that CK2 promotes the light-induced degradation of PIF1 in vivo, PIF1-6M (which lacks the majority of the CK2 phosphorylation sites) and the PIF1(S464–466A) mutants are still robustly phosphorylated in response to light in vivo as observed previously for wild-type PIF1 (Figs. 3A and 4A and supplemental Fig. S3) (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These data suggest that either CK2 phosphorylates PIF1 in response to light at different sites than the ones identified and mutated, or a separate light-specific kinase may phosphorylate PIF1 at different Ser/Thr residues under light. Because phy interaction is necessary for the light-induced phosphorylation and degradation of PIFs (12Henriques R. Jang I.C. Chua N.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Castillon A. Shen H. Huq E. Trends Plant Sci. 2007; 12: 514-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and because phyA has been shown to have Ser/Thr kinase activity (51Yeh K.C. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13976-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), it is possible that phys might directly phosphorylate PIFs in response to light. However, convincing in vivo evidence for the phyA kinase hypothesis is still lacking. Therefore, these data suggest that phosphorylation of PIF1 by CK2 and phosphorylation by either phys directly or a phy-associated kinase is necessary for the rapid light-induced degradation of PIF1. Further work is needed to identify the additional phosphorylation sites by either phytochromes or a phytochrome-associated kinase.In addition, the mechanism of CK2-mediated enhanced degradation of PIF1 is still unknown. It is possible that phosphorylation of PIF1 by CK2 enhances the affinity of PIF1 for phys, as phy interaction has been shown to be necessary for rapid degradation of PIF1 (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely, as the isolated APA and APB domains, which are located within the first 150 amino acids, are both necessary and sufficient for physical interaction with phyA and phyB, respectively (Fig. 2A) (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 52Khanna R. Huq E. Kikis E.A. Al-Sady B. Lanzatella C. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although PIF1 has one CK2 phosphorylation site near the APB sequence (Thr-10) (Fig. 2A), the results show that the CK2 sites at the C-terminal end (Ser-464, Ser-465 and Ser-466) play the major role in PIF1 degradation compared with other CK2 sites (Figs. 2, 3A, and 4A). An alternative hypothesis is that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of PIF1 at the C terminus enhances the interaction of PIF1 with substrate recognition factors responsible for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation (e.g. F-box proteins in Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complex). This is more likely because enhancement of proteasomal degradation of multiple factors by signal-induced phosphorylation has been demonstrated (50Kato Jr., T. Delhase M. Hoffmann A. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 53Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4043) Google Scholar). This possibility is also consistent with our previous data that isolated N- (1–150 amino acids) and C-terminal (151–478 amino acids) regions are not phosphorylated and degraded in response to light (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Conversely, both N- and C-terminal regions are necessary for the light-induced degradation of PIF1 in vivo (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Identification of factors responsible for recognition and polyubiquitination of PIF1 will help distinguish these possibilities.In summary, our data and those of others show that light stabilizes positively acting transcription factors (e.g. HY5, LAF1, and HFR1) (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4997-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 35Park H.J. Ding L. Dai M. Lin R. Wang H. J. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 423: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and induces proteasomal degradation of negatively acting transcription factors (e.g. PIFs) to promote photomorphogenesis (Fig. 6). CK2 phosphorylates both positively and negatively acting transcription factors involved in light signaling. However, the significance of CK2 phosphorylation is opposite for these two classes of transcription factors. CK2-mediated phosphorylation enhances the stability of the positively acting factors, whereas it decreases the stability of the negatively acting factors (e.g. PIF1 and possibly other PIFs). This contrasting but apparently synergistic effect is expected to promote robust photomorphogenesis. However, our phenotypic analyses showed that the CK2 β subunit overexpression lines have modest seedling deetiolation and circadian phenotypes (Figs. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S7). Moreover, a stable PIF1 is expected to promote hypocotyl growth as observed (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4) (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas a CK2 dominant-negative mutant displayed a short hypocotyl phenotype in the dark (45Moreno-Romero J. Espunya M.C. Platara M. Ariño J. Martínez M.C. Plant J. 2008; 55: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These apparent contradictions might be explained in part by the fact that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of HY5 reduces the DNA binding ability of HY5 (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4997-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, all organisms have multiple CK2 substrates in vivo that may function in multiple pathways. More than 300 substrates have been identified for CK2 in an animal system (55Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phenotypes of the CK2 mutants and overexpression lines will reflect the net effect of CK2 on these diverse pathways that regulate plant growth and development. Identification and characterization of these substrates will shed light on how CK2 optimizes photomorphogenesis. IntroductionBecause light is an essential environmental signal for modulating plant growth and development throughout the life cycle, plants have several different classes of photoreceptors sensing and responding to major bandwidths of the light spectrum (1Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 2Bae G. Choi G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2008; 59: 281-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Of these photoreceptors, the phytochrome (phy) 3The abbreviations used are: phy, phytochrome; R, red; FR, far-red; PIF, phytochrome interacting factor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; LUC, luciferase; APA, active phyA binding domain; APB, active phyB binding domain. family (which consists of five members, phyA to phyE, in Arabidopsis) senses and responds to a broad spectrum (red, far-red, and blue) of light signals and pleiotropically regulates plant growth from seed germination to flowering time (3Franklin K.A.

Nagy F. Photomorphogenesis in Plants and Bacteria. 3rd Ed. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Within a cell, phys are synthesized as an inactive Pr conformer that resides in the cytosol. Exposure to red (R) light triggers a conformation shift to a biologically active Pfr form, which migrates into the nucleus and initiates phy signaling (6Fankhauser C. Chen M. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The active Pfr form can be reverted back to the inactive Pr form by exposure to far-red (FR) light. The active Pfr form interacts with multiple signaling partners within the nucleus (7Huq E. Quail P.H. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2005: 151-170Google Scholar) and controls the expression of a large number (10–30% of the genome) of genes to regulate photomorphogenesis (8Ma L. Li J. Qu L. Hager J. Chen Z. Zhao H. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2589-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 9Quail P.H. J. Integr. Plant Biol. 2007; 49: 11-20Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Jiao Y. Lau O.S. Deng X.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar).One of the ways phys exert this strong effect on gene expression is by differentially regulating the stability of positively and negatively acting transcription factors functioning in light signaling pathways (11Huq E. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 4-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Henriques R. Jang I.C. Chua N.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For example, the positively acting transcription factors (e.g. HY5, HFR1, LAF1, and possibly others) are degraded in the dark and stabilized under red, far-red, and blue light conditions. By contrast, the negatively acting transcription factors (e.g. the phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs)) are stable in the dark and degrade in response to light. The net effect of this stabilization and destabilization of transcription factors shapes the transcriptome that regulates photomorphogenesis.PIFs have been shown to play central roles in phy signaling pathways (13Castillon A.

Genetic and photobiological experiments showed that PIFs function as negative regulators of photomorphogenesis largely by modulating the level of phyB under red light (23Leivar P. Monte E. Al-Sady B.

Moreover, quadruple (pifQ) mutant seedlings of pif1, pif3, pif4, and pif5 are constitutively photomorphogenic, suggesting that PIFs repress photomorphogenesis in the dark (24Leivar P. Monte E. Oka Y.

This morphological phenotype is reflected at the gene expression level, where a majority of the light-regulated genes are constitutively expressed in the pifQ mutant in the dark (27Shin J. Kim K.

In wild-type seedlings, light signals perceived by phys promote degradation of PIFs through the ubiquitin/26 S proteasomal pathway to derepress gene expression and promote photomorphogenesis (13Castillon A.

Jang I.C. Chua N.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the light-induced degradation of PIFs is only beginning to be understood. All PIFs except PIF7 are rapidly phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in response to light in vivo prior to their degradation (26Shen H. Zhu L. Castillon A. Majee M. Downie B. Huq E. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1586-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Al-Sady B. Ni W. Kircher S. Schäfer E. Quail P.H. Mol.

Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The mutant PIF1 and PIF3 that fail to interact with the Pfr forms of phyA and phyB do not undergo light-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting that phy interaction is necessary for the light-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of PIFs. However, the putative kinase(s) and the putative E3 ligase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of PIFs and recognition of the phosphorylated forms for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation are still unknown.CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase II), a ubiquitous Ser/Thr kinase, has been implicated in regulating light signaling and circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis (32Lee Y.

The Arabidopsis genome has four α subunit and four β subunit genes (39Salinas P. Fuentes D. Vidal E. Jordana X. Echeverria M. Holuigue L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Various members of both the α and β subunit families have been shown to be localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and also in chloroplasts (39Salinas P. Fuentes D. Vidal E. Jordana X. Echeverria M. Holuigue L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A CK2-like activity has been shown to phosphorylate HY5, a positively acting component in a phy signaling pathway (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4997-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, CK2 phosphorylates HFR1, a positively acting HLH transcription factor functioning under FR and blue light pathways (35Park H.J. Ding L. Dai M. Lin R. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both HY5 and HFR1 has been shown to stabilize these transcription factors (34Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W.

Because CK2-mediated phosphorylation stabilizes the positively acting transcription factors involved in light signaling in Arabidopsis, we reasoned that CK2 might also phosphorylate the negatively acting transcription factors (e.g. PIFs) and regulate their stability/function in Arabidopsis. Here we show that CK2 phosphorylates PIF1 at multiple sites in vitro. In addition, CK2-mediated phosphorylation promotes rapid light-induced degradation of PIF1 to fine-tune photomorphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001766190,"Daily oscillations of gene expression underlie circadian behaviours in multicellular organisms. While attention has been focused on transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, other post-transcriptional modes have been less clearly delineated. Here we report mutants of a novel Drosophila gene twenty-four (tyf) that show weak behavioural rhythms. Weak rhythms are accompanied by marked reductions in the levels of the clock protein Period (PER) as well as more modest effects on Timeless (TIM). Nonetheless, PER induction in pacemaker neurons can rescue tyf mutant rhythms. TYF associates with a 5'-cap-binding complex, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), as well as per and tim transcripts. Furthermore, TYF activates reporter expression when tethered to reporter messenger RNA even in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that TYF potently activates PER translation in pacemaker neurons to sustain robust rhythms, revealing a new and important role for translational control in the Drosophila circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2093929484,"The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) plays an important role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair as the underlying mechanism of the non-homologous end joining pathway. When DSBs occur, DNA-PKcs is rapidly phosphorylated at both the Thr-2609 and Ser-2056 residues, and such phosphorylations are critical for DSB repair. In this study we report that, in addition to responding to DSBs, DNA-PKcs is activated and phosphorylated in normal cell cycle progression through mitosis. Mitotic induction of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation is closely associated with the spindle apparatus at centrosomes and kinetochores. Furthermore, depletion of DNA-PKcs protein levels or inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity results in the delay of mitotic transition because of chromosome misalignment. These results demonstrate for the first time that DNA-PKcs, in addition to its role in DSB repair, is a critical regulator of mitosis and could modulate microtubule dynamics in chromosome segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2093972463,"Gram-negative bacteria can alter the composition of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer of the outer membrane as a response to different growth conditions and external stimuli. These alterations can, for example, promote attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. The changes occur in the outermost layer of the cell and may consequently influence interactions between bacterial cells and surrounding host tissue, as well as other surfaces. Microscopic analyses, fractionation of bacterial cells, or other traditional microbiological assays have previously been used to study these alterations. These methods can, however, be time consuming and do not always give detailed chemical information about the bacterial cell surface. We here present an analytical method that provides chemical information on the outermost portion of bacterial cells with respect to protein, peptidoglycan, lipid, and polysaccharide content. The method involves cryo-x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the outermost portion (within ∼10 nm of the surface) of intact bacterial cells followed by a multivariate curve resolution analysis of carbon spectra. It can be used as a tool for characterizing and monitoring variations in the chemical composition of bacterial cell walls or of isolated outer membrane vesicles, variations that result from e.g. mutations or external stimuli. The method enabled us to predict accurately the alterations in polysaccharide content and surface chemistries of a set of well characterized Escherichia coli LPS mutants. The described approach may moreover be applied to monitor surface chemical composition of other biological samples."

Insulin receptors are also expressed in several regions of the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus and the POA (24Baskin D.G. Figlewicz D.P. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Dorsa D.M. Annu. Rev.

Both insulin and IGF-1 play an important part in the central control of peripheral metabolism; intracerebroventricular infusion of IGF-1 increases the sensitivity of the liver to insulin (27Muzumdar R.H. Ma X. Yang X. Atzmon G. Barzilai N. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas intracerebroventricular infusion of insulin results in decreased food intake and body weight (28Woods S.C. Lotter E.C. McKay L.D. Porte Jr., D. Nature. 1979; 282: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and suppresses glucose production independent of circulating levels of insulin (29Obici S. Zhang B.B. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1376-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that hypothalamic insulin receptors play an important role in food intake and insulin resistance (30Obici S. Feng Z. Karkanias G. Baskin D.G. Rossetti L. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar).Neuronal loss of the insulin receptor in mice results in increased body fat and in plasma insulin and leptin levels (31Brüning J.C.

Science. 2000; 289: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of central insulin receptors in mediating the CNS effects of insulin on energy homeostasis. Mice with inactivation of the Insr gene exhibit normal embryonic development with normal birth weights, but these mutants survive postnatally only for a few days and then die of diabetic ketoacidosis (32Accili D.

Mice lacking the IGF-1R gene display a severe growth-deficiency phenotype at birth (approximately 45% of the normal weight) and die of respiratory failure shortly after birth (34Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Deletion of the IGF-1R in skeletal muscle in mice results in glucose intolerance and impaired insulin sensitivity (35Fernández A.M. Kim J.K. Yakar S. Dupont J. Hernandez-Sanchez C. Castle A.L. Filmore J. Shulman G.I. Le Roith D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The neuronal IGF-1R knock-out shows no metabolic or aging phenotype but a lowered growth hormone level, and the heterozygote exhibits a substantially longer life span (1Kappeler L. De Magalhaes Filho C. Dupont J. Leneuve P. Cervera P. Périn L. Loudes C. Blaise A. Klein R. Epelbaum J. Le Bouc Y. Holzenberger M. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the insulin receptor (IR) are both transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors that signal through “dimeric” receptors composed of combinations of two insulin half-receptors (IR/IR), two IGF-1 half-receptors (IGF-1R/IGF-1R), or as hybrids composed of IR and IGF-1 half-receptors. In cells that express both the IR and IGF-1R, hybrid receptors form by random association (36Bailyes E.M. Navé B.T. Soos M.A. Orr S.R. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 37Belfiore A. Frasca F. Pandini G. Sciacca L. Vigneri R. Endocr. Rev. 2009; 30: 586-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Insulin and IGF-1 can bind to either the dimeric IR or IGF-1R or hybrid receptors, respectively, with varying affinities. For example, IGF-1 has 100 times lower affinity than insulin for the homodimeric insulin receptor, yet it can activate the autophosphorylation of the IR and thus acts as an IR agonist (38De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Ursø B. Grønskov K. Latus L.J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The binding of IGF-1 or insulin to any of the three possible dimeric receptors (IR/IR, IGF-1R/IGF-1R, or IR/IGF-1R) induces activation of tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor that initiates the downstream signaling cascade (39Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar, 40Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4620) Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified the IR and IGF-1R transcripts in warm-sensitive neurons by sequencing cDNA libraries from individual neurons from the POA. The POA is a nucleus within the hypothalamus that is essential for the regulation of core body temperature (41Boulant J.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: S157-S161Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The POA sends inhibitory signals through separate outflow pathways to other hypothalamic nuclei, the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and raphe pallidus (RPa), to mediate differential inhibitory control of the sympathoexcitatory drive determining brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis (42Morrison S.F. Nakamura K. Madden C.J. Exp. Physiol. 2008; 93: 773-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that that insulin causes hyperthermia by direct inhibition of these neurons from the POA of the hypothalamus (43Sanchez-Alavez M. Tabarean I.V. Osborn O. Mitsukawa K. Schaefer J. Dubins J. Holmberg K.H. Klein I. Klaus J. Gomez L.F. Kolb H. Secrest J. Jochems J. Myashiro K. Buckley P. Hadcock J.R. Eberwine J. Conti B. Bartfai T. Diabetes. 2010; 59: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The presence of both IR and IGF-1 receptors in the same warm-sensitive neurons raised the possibility that both insulin and IGF-1 can affect the activity of these GABAergic projection neurons through inhibitory action at the DMH and RPa to mediate a disinhibition of the sympathoexcitatory drive resulting in BAT activation and thus causing hyperthermia (44Nakamura K. Morrison S.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To delineate the roles of the IR and of the IGF-1R in the anterior hypothalamic effects of IGF-1, we have examined the IGF-1-mediated hyperthermia both in mice that express IR and IGF-1R and in transgenic mice that lack expression of the neuronal insulin receptor (NIRKO), respectively.RESULTSIllumina sequencing of cDNA libraries individual, electrophysiologically identified, warm-sensitive neurons from the POA identified a subpopulation of neurons that express both IGF-1R and IR transcripts. Read counts are the number of times that any of the 42-base sequences map back to the mRNA of interest. When normalized for the mRNA length of the IR and the IGF-1R, these read counts are a reflection of the abundances of the corresponding mRNAs. Read counts show that the IR mRNA is present at ∼5-fold higher level than that encoding the IGF-1R in the cell that expresses both transcripts. Read count analysis also shows that there is variability in gene expression between cells with one warm-sensitive neuron expressing both mRNAs (read counts, IGF-1R = 4, IR = 30), and another cell studied expressed neither mRNA. Both the IR and IGF-1R mRNAs were likewise present in the pooled mRNA samples (four distinct heat-sensitive neuronal cell somas, read counts for IGF-1R = 4, IR = 15). The presence of the IR and IGF-1R transcripts in the same neurons facilitates the possibility that the gene products of the IR and IGF-1R genes can form hybrid receptors in the same neuron.To determine whether the IGF-1R expression leads to functional signaling receptors, we administered IGF-1 into the POA in mice implanted with a radiotelemetric device in the peritoneum and measured CBT. The initial increase in temperature (∼60-min duration) observed in all groups, including the vehicle-treated mice, is due to the stress-induced hyperthermia after the injection. IGF-1 injection into the POA caused a significant dose-dependent hyperthermic response (Fig. 1, A and B) that was not due to changes in locomotor activity (Fig. 1C) between vehicle and IGF-1 injected mice, respectively. The POA sends inhibitory signals through other hypothalamic nuclei, the DMH and the RPa to the BAT where thermogenesis occurs. The IGF-1R is expressed in the POA and in the projection areas of the warm-sensitive GABAergic neurons: the DHM and RPa nuclei of the hypothalamus (Fig. 1D).The administration of IGF-1 to the POA had the largest hyperthermic effect compared with microinjection of IGF-1 to either the DMH, where there was a late onset hyperthermic response, or the RPa where the effect on core body temperature was less pronounced compared with the other two regions studied (Fig. 2, A and B). For example, 2.5 h after the administration of IGF-1 the average core body temperature was 2.02 °C greater than when vehicle was applied to the POA, whereas the change in core temperature after microinjection of IGF-1 to the DMH or the RPa relative to vehicle was 0.82 °C and 0.65 °C, respectively. A trend of increased hyperthermic effect with higher doses of IGF-1 administered to the DMH was observed (Fig. 2, C and D) for approximately 3 h after injection, but no dose-dependent effect was observed when applied to the RPa (Fig. 2, E and F).FIGURE 2IGF-1 acts specifically at the POA to elicit a hyperthermic response.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with PQ401 before IGF-1 (10 ng in 0.5 μl), both administered to the POA 30 min apart, showed significant attenuation of the IGF-1-induced increase in core body temperature (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3, A and C). A similar attenuated hyperthermic response to IGF-1 by PQ401 pretreatment is observed when the temperature of the BAT is measured (Fig. 3, B and D). Therefore, the in vivo effects of PQ401 are mediated at the tyrosine kinase of the IGF-1R but may also be accounted for in part by a slight inhibition of autophosphorylation of the IR because PQ401 is not entirely selective for the IGF-1R (48Gable K.L. Maddux B.A. Penaranda C. Zavodovskaya M. Campbell M.J. Lobo M. Robinson L. Schow S. Kerner J.A. Goldfine I.D. Youngren J.F. Mol.

As expected, PQ401 did not block the hyperthermic effects of the well known pyrogen IL-1β (data not shown), and thus its ability to block the IGF-1 hyperthermia is not a general antipyretic effect.FIGURE 3Hyperthermic effects of POA injection of IGF-1 are inhibited by PQ401, an IGF-1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

We tested the effects of IGF-1 injection into the POA in NIRKO mice that lack neuronal IR expression and thus cannot present hybrid receptors. NIRKO mice show a significantly impaired hyperthermic response to IGF-1 compared with the response seen in wild-type mice (Fig. 4, A and B). These results clearly indicate that the functional expression of the IRs by CNS neurons is required for the full IGF-1-mediated hyperthermic response. As expected, NIRKO mice do not show a hyperthermic response to the POA microinjection of insulin as observed in wild-type mice (Fig. 4, C and D) (43Sanchez-Alavez M. Tabarean I.V. Osborn O.

Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Interscapular temperature was measured with an indwelling thermister after infusion of IGF-1 or vehicle into the DMH as well as after IGF-1, vehicle, or insulin was injected to the POA. Interscapular BAT local temperature was significantly elevated after insulin or IGF-1 injection to the POA compared with injection of IGF-1 to the DMH or vehicle control injections (Fig. 6A). In addition, a significant increase in UCP-1 transcript expression was observed in response to IGF-1 injection (Fig. 6B). UCP-1 found in the mitochondria of BAT mediates the generation of heat by nonshivering thermogenesis. Furthermore, IGF-1 injected into the POA in rats induced an elevation of 18F-FDG uptake in BAT which provides an indirect measure of the activation of the BAT adipocytes and resultant thermogenesis (Fig. 6, C and D).FIGURE 6POA injection of IGF-1 increases BAT activity.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3010-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) followed by sequencing of the cDNA library provides a powerful unbiased technique to determine the receptor repertoire of individual cells. In this study we identified the simultaneous expression of the IGF-1R and IR in cDNA libraries from discrete single warm-sensitive neurons that form part of the thermoregulatory center in the POA of the hypothalamus. In some individual neurons or small pools of the warm-sensitive neurons IGF-1R and IR mRNAs were both present within the same cell. These data using cDNA sequences of individual neurons to demonstrate that the same neuron expresses the two mRNAs of interest are a novel more sensitive way to prove co-existence of mRNAs than by double in situ hybridization. The number of sequence hits bears a relationship to the abundance of the mRNA, and in these warm-sensitive cells the IR mRNA is present at an ∼4–7 times higher level than the mRNA encoding the IGF-1R; nevertheless, the simultaneous presence of both mRNAs suggests the possibility of random IR/IGF-1R formation. Although data are not yet available for the mouse, hybrid receptors have previously been observed in brain extracts where Bailyes et al. (36Bailyes E.M. Navé B.T. Soos M.A. Orr S.R. Hayward A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2001898976,"Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) catalyze the formation of pyroglutamate (pGlu) residues at the N terminus of peptides and proteins. Hypothalamic pGlu hormones, such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone are essential for regulation of metabolism and fertility in the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes, respectively. Here, we analyzed the consequences of constitutive genetic QC ablation on endocrine functions and on the behavior of adult mice. Adult homozygous QC knock-out mice are fertile and behave indistinguishably from wild type mice in tests of motor function, cognition, general activity, and ingestion behavior. The QC knock-out results in a dramatic drop of enzyme activity in the brain, especially in hypothalamus and in plasma. Other peripheral organs like liver and spleen still contain QC activity, which is most likely caused by its homolog isoQC. The serum gonadotropin-releasing hormone, TSH, and testosterone concentrations were not changed by QC depletion. The serum thyroxine was decreased by 24% in homozygous QC knock-out animals, suggesting a mild hypothyroidism. QC knock-out mice were indistinguishable from wild type with regard to blood glucose and glucose tolerance, thus differing from reports of thyrotropin-releasing hormone knock-out mice significantly. The results suggest a significant formation of the hypothalamic pGlu hormones by alternative mechanisms, like spontaneous cyclization or conversion by isoQC. The different effects of QC depletion on the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes might indicate slightly different modes of substrate conversion of both enzymes. The absence of significant abnormalities in QC knock-out mice suggests the presence of a therapeutic window for suppression of QC activity in current drug development. Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) catalyze the formation of pyroglutamate (pGlu) residues at the N terminus of peptides and proteins. Hypothalamic pGlu hormones, such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone are essential for regulation of metabolism and fertility in the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes, respectively. Here, we analyzed the consequences of constitutive genetic QC ablation on endocrine functions and on the behavior of adult mice. Adult homozygous QC knock-out mice are fertile and behave indistinguishably from wild type mice in tests of motor function, cognition, general activity, and ingestion behavior. The QC knock-out results in a dramatic drop of enzyme activity in the brain, especially in hypothalamus and in plasma. Other peripheral organs like liver and spleen still contain QC activity, which is most likely caused by its homolog isoQC. The serum gonadotropin-releasing hormone, TSH, and testosterone concentrations were not changed by QC depletion. The serum thyroxine was decreased by 24% in homozygous QC knock-out animals, suggesting a mild hypothyroidism. QC knock-out mice were indistinguishable from wild type with regard to blood glucose and glucose tolerance, thus differing from reports of thyrotropin-releasing hormone knock-out mice significantly. The results suggest a significant formation of the hypothalamic pGlu hormones by alternative mechanisms, like spontaneous cyclization or conversion by isoQC. The different effects of QC depletion on the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes might indicate slightly different modes of substrate conversion of both enzymes. The absence of significant abnormalities in QC knock-out mice suggests the presence of a therapeutic window for suppression of QC activity in current drug development. Proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and C-terminal amidation represent important post-translational modifications of proteins in the secretory pathway. Among these, several proteins and peptide hormones carry an N-terminal 5-oxoprolyl (pyroglutamate (pGlu) 4The abbreviations used are: pGlu, pyroglutamate; T4, thyroxine; HPT, hypothalamic pituitary thyroid; HPG, hypothalamic pituitary gonadal; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; QC, glutaminyl cyclase; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; βNA, β-naphthylamine. ) residue. Examples of pGlu-containing peptides include the hormones thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and gastrin, the neuropeptide neurotensin, and the human chemokines MCP-1 to -4 (monocyte chemotactic proteins 1–4) (1Awadé A.C. Cleuziat P. Gonzalès T. Robert-Baudouy J. Proteins. 1994; 20: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Garavelli J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the pGlu residue protects the proteins from cleavage by aminopeptidases. For TRH or MCP-1 or -2, the biological function has been shown to depend strictly on 5-oxoproline at the N terminus. Loss or modification of this residue leads to a decrease in biological activity due to a decreased receptor interaction (3Abraham G.N. Podell D.N. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1981; 38: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Van Coillie E. Proost P. Van Aelst I. Struyf S. Polfliet M. De Meester I. Harvey D.J. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G.

For most of the proteins, however, the function of the N-terminal modification remains to be clarified. The potential role of the pGlu modification of amyloid peptides, which are deposited in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease, familial British dementia, and familial Danish dementia, has been described recently (6Schlenzig D.

Apparently, the N-terminal pGlu modification increases the amyloidogenicity of those peptides by changing the secondary structure and, importantly, their hydrophobicity (6Schlenzig D. Manhart S.

It appears likely that the modified peptide species are involved in disease progression. Thus, preventing N-terminal modification might represent a strategy for the development of potential novel treatment paradigms (11Schilling S. Zeitschel U. Hoffmann T. Heiser U. Francke M. Kehlen A.

Although it is well known that N-terminal glutaminyl residues tend to form pGlu by spontaneous deamidation (13Seifert F. Schulz K. Koch B. Manhart S. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11831-11833Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the reaction is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclases (QCs; EC 2.3.2.5) in vivo (14Pohl T. Zimmer M. Mugele K. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two functional genes, QPCT (QC) and QPCTL (isoQC), encoding glutaminyl cyclases have been described in mammals (15Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Busby Jr., W.H. Quackenbush G.E. Humm J. Youngblood W.W. Kizer J.S. J. Biol.

Although QC represents a secreted protein, which is apparently involved in hormone maturation in neuroendocrine tissue (14Pohl T. Zimmer M. Mugele K. Spiess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Böckers T.M. Kreutz M.R. Pohl T. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the function of the recently identified isoQC still remains unclear. The retention of the isoenzyme in the Golgi complex might suggest a role in the constitutive protein maturation similar to that of glycosyltransferases (15Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In order to gain further insight into the role of QC in hormone maturation and its potential physiological importance, we aimed here at the generation of mice that are deficient in a functional QPCT gene. Homozygous mice do not show a phenotype or apparent malfunction, which has implications for current strategies to develop QC inhibitors as treatments for neurodegenerative disorders. All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages at a temperature (22 ± 2 °C)- and humidity (55 ± 10%)-controlled facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and had access to standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum. The 129SvPas/C57/Bl6 hybrid founders were crossed two times against C57/Bl6, yielding the genetic background of 87.5% C57/Bl6 and 12.5% 129SvPas. All experiments were performed in accordance with the German animal protection law. The knock-out mice were generated by homologous recombination of a targeting vector in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) at genOway (Lyon, France). The targeting vector contained the mouse chromosomal QC region ranging from intron 3 to exon 6. This region was modified by the insertion of two LoxP sites in introns 3 and 5, respectively. In addition, a neomycin resistance cassette flanked by two flippase recognition targets was inserted immediately upstream of the LoxP site in intron 5. The linearized targeting vector was transfected into 129SvPas-derived ES cells by electroporation, and stably transfected cells were isolated by G418 selection. Resistant clones were screened for homologous recombination of the targeting vector by PCR amplification of the 3′ and 5′ integration sites. A restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR fragment allowed a reliable identification of the homologous recombination event. The results of the PCR screening were further verified by Southern blot hybridization. Targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts, and chimeras were generated by embryo transfer. For removal of the neomycin selection cassette, the chimeras were mated to Flp-expressing animals followed by breeding of the progeny with Cre-expressing animals for deletion of QPCT exons 4 and 5. Animals that were heterozygous for the QPCT locus were identified. These founders of the new pbd-02 line carry a QPCT allele, where exons 4 and 5 are deleted. In addition, deletion of exons 4 and 5 causes a frameshift in the QPCT open reading frame, generating a stop codon in exon 6. Thus, the complete C-terminal part of the QC protein is lost in the knock-out line. For genotyping of the pbd-02 animals, an allele-specific PCR using a set of three primers was developed, which enabled all possible genotypes to be distinguished by the different size of the PCR products. The primer set contained the upstream primer Pbd2-1 (5′-GTCCGGTAAGGTGAGGAGAA-3′), which binds to QPCT intron 3, and the downstream primers Pbd2-WT1 (5′-CCAGAGACATCCTGGTAAAACA-3′) and Pbd2–2 (5′-TGATGTGTGCGTTTCAGAGA-3′), which bind to exon 4 and intron 5, respectively. A standard PCR (58 °C annealing temperature, 45 s extension time, 30 cycles) on chromosomal pbd-02 DNA clearly distinguished the wild type allele (single larger band; 735 bp), knock-out allele (single smaller band; 525 bp), and heterozygous DNA (both bands; see Fig. 1A). The primary screen was used to prompt animals' general health, neurological reflexes, and sensory functions (muscle and lower motor neuron functions and spinocerebellar, sensory, neuropsychiatric, and autonomic functions) that could interfere with further behavioral assays. It was based on the guidelines of the SHIRPA protocol, which provides a behavioral and functional profile by observational assessment (19Rogers D.C. Fisher E.M. Brown S.D. Peters J. Hunter A.J. Martin J.E. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The investigation started with observing social behavior in the home cage (“home cage observation”) and subsequently undisturbed behavior of single animals in a clear Plexiglas arena for 90 s (“individual observation”). This monitoring of mouse behavior was followed by a battery of short tests for further characterization: acoustic startle reflex, hanging behavior, visual placing, falling behavior, righting reflex, postural reflex, negative geotaxis, hanging wire, ear twitch, whisker twitch, and eye blink. Finally, the animal was examined for dysmorphological and weight abnormalities. Using an automated fear conditioning system (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany), memory of an aversive experience (associated learning) was explored by investigating contextual and cued fear responses via infrared sensor-based activity measurement. On the first day (conditioning trial) animals were placed individually in constantly illuminated (∼300 lux), transparent Plexiglas chambers with a metal grid floor, housed within sound-attenuated boxes. A loudspeaker provided a constant, white background noise (68 dB SPL). After a 210-s habituation to the chamber, mice received an auditory cue (10 kHz, 75 dB SPL) for 30 s and an electric foot shock (0.7 mA constant current) for the final 2 s of the tone. 30 s after the foot shock, animals were returned to their home cages. On day 2, 24 h after the conditioning trial, contextual memory was tested by placing the animals in the familiar chamber without tone and foot shock and measuring their behavior during a 210-s trial period (context phase). 1 h later, after alteration of the testing chamber by using black, opaque Plexiglas boxes (leading to a dimmed illumination) and covering the grid floor with a plain black base plate, mice were returned into this modified, novel context. During the first 210 s, animals were allowed to freely explore, and then the auditory cue of day 1 was presented for the next 180 s (cue phase). Freezing was defined as no movement (no new beam break) for more than 3 s and was recorded automatically in all test phases. For analysis, the percentage duration of freezing per phase was calculated. Contextual memory was obtained by subtracting the percentage of freezing during habituation from that in the context phase; memory of cue was obtained by subtracting the percentage of freezing in the novel context from that in the cue phase. The pole was used as a simple test for motor-coordinative deficits. The test item consisted of a metal pole (diameter, 1.5 cm; length, 50 cm), which was wrapped with an antislip tape. The pole with a plastic ball on the top was vertically installed on a heavy platform. For testing, animals were placed head-up directly under the ball, and time to orient themselves down and descend the length of the pole was measured (cut-off time, 120 s). Aberrant activities (e.g. falling, jumping, and sliding) were recorded as 120 s value. The best performance over five trials was used for analysis. The rotarod is a standard test widely used to investigate neuromotor performance in rodents. It provides a quantitative assessment of coordination and balance because animals must continuously walk on a horizontal, rotating cylinder to avoid falling off the rod. Testing was performed on two consecutive days, using a computer-controlled rotarod system (TSE Systems). In the first morning session, mice were trained on a constantly rotating rod (10 rpm) until they were able to stay on the drum for at least 60 s. In the afternoon and on the following day, three test sessions were conducted, each consisting of three trials. The rod speed was accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over a 5-min period. The total distance moved until the animal fell down was calculated automatically by the system. Performance was examined for each testing trial (motor learning) and using best trial analysis (motor coordination). Circadian pattern of locomotor activity and ingestion behavior was assessed using the PhenoMaster system (TSE Systems). Two horizontally staked infrared sensor frames detected locomotion in the x-y level and rearing events in the z level. Measurement of water and food consumption was employed by two balances. Continuous recording of these four parameters was carried out simultaneously for all mice in individual observation units (standard type III cages with grid lid) for 6 days. Data were collected automatically with a rate of 100 Hz and stored on a personal computer as a sum over 1-min intervals. The experiment took place under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 0600 h, lights off at 1800 h). Animals received water and food ad libitum and remained undisturbed by the investigator during observation. RNA was extracted from various tissues by dispersing 50–100 mg of tissue in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Upon incubation at room temperature for 5 min, chloroform (0.2 ml) was added, and the solution was mixed for 15 s and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, mixed with 1 volume of 70% ethanol, and applied to an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the RNA was purified and eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using random oligomers and SuperscriptII (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The reaction volume was brought to 80 μl with H2O, and 1 μl of the cDNA solution was used for real-time PCR, which was done in duplicate in a 20-μl reaction volume using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden). The housekeeping gene ACTB was used as a reference gene, and real-time PCR was performed with the murine QuantiTect primer assay QPCTL and murine QuantiTect primer assay ACTB (both from Qiagen, Hilden) on a LightCycler 2.0 system (Roche Applied Science) using preset standard protocols. The mRNA levels were analyzed by the ΔΔCt method. Cultures of primary neurons were prepared from mouse embryos (embryonic day 16). The brains were removed and separated in tubes with DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), 5% FBS (Invitrogen), 0.05% gentamycin (PAA, Pasching, Austria). Afterward, each brain was triturated with a 10-ml pipette. The cells were separated using 100- and 40-μm cell strainers (BD Biosciences) consecutively. Cells of 20 μl of solution were stained with trypan blue (Sigma), and the vital cells were counted using a Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). 6 × 105 cells were spread on poly-l-lysine-coated 12-well plates and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The next day, the medium was exchanged, and cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12, 5% FBS, 0.05% gentamycin containing 25% conditioned medium from astrocyte cultures, N-2 (Invitrogen). Cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was added (1 μm) 3 days after preparation. The cells were subjected to the respective analyses on the next day. Astrocyte cultures were prepared from brains of newborn mice. The brains were removed, separated in tubes with DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), 5% FBS (Invitrogen) containing 0.05% gentamycin (PAA) and triturated using a 10-ml pipette. The brain solutions passed 100- and 40-μm cell strainers (BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with trypan blue (Sigma) and counted using a Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber (Roth), and 6 × 105 cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine 12-well plates. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Seven days later, the medium was renewed. The astrocytes were subjected to the analyses 12 days after seeding. QC activity was determined using a discontinuous assay based on separation and quantification of the substrate Gln-βNA and the product pGlu-βNA using HPLC-UV. Briefly, test samples from brain or peripheral tissue were homogenized in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, using a Precellys homogenizer (Peqlab). The homogenate was further sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min and 4 °C. The protein concentration of the resulting supernatant containing QC and isoQC was adjusted to 5–7 mg/ml. Reaction samples consisted of 50 μm Gln-βNA in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm N-ethylmaleinimide, and enzyme solution in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction temperature was 37 °C. Test samples were removed for up to 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to HPLC analyses using a RP18 LiChroCART HPLC Cartridge and the HPLC system D-7000 (Merck-Hitachi). The samples (20 μl) were injected and separated by increasing the concentration of solvent A (acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA) from 8 to 20% in solvent B (H2O containing 0.1% TFA). QC activity was quantified from a standard curve of pGlu-βNA (Bachem) determined under assay conditions. Mice (QC−/− and wild type littermates) were euthanized with carbon dioxide and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brains were dissected, cut into sample pieces (∼3 × 5 mm), and immersion-fixed with HOPE® (hepes glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect, DCS Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. Coronal sections of 10 μm were cut from the paraffin blocks using a sliding microtome and transferred to microscope slides. For antigen retrieval, the slides were incubated in hot citrate buffer (∼95 °C/30 min). Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 0.5% H2O2 in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (10 min). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% normal goat serum in TBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (1 h). As primary antibody, a polyclonal rabbit antibody (mQC1302, 1:200) was used at 4 °C overnight in antibody dilution buffer (DCS Diagnostics). As secondary antibody, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1,000; Vector Laboratories) was used (1 h at room temperature). A Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for the ABC method. The immunoreaction was visualized with DAB-Ni (DAB substrate kit for peroxidase; Vector Laboratories) (3 min). The serum T4 and testosterone concentrations were analyzed to evaluate potential effects of the QC knock-out on the HPT or HPG axis. Competitive ELISAs were used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany). The concentration of GnRH in serum and hypothalamic homogenates was determined applying an ELISA from Peninsula Laboratories (San Carlos, CA). Serum TSH was quantified using an ELISA from Gentaur (Brussels, Belgium). Before oral glucose load, mice were fasted for 5 h. Glucose (3 g/kg of a 40% glucose solution) was administered by oral gavage (with a feeding needle, 22 gauge, 25 mm; Fine Science Tools, Heidelberg, Germany) at 0 min. The blood glucose and insulin concentration was assessed for 120 min. Insulin concentrations were determined using commercial ELISAs (Mercodia AB; Uppsala, Sweden). The generation of a constitutive QC knock-out model has been achieved by flanking the targeted region with two LoxP sites, allowing its ubiquitous or tissue-specific deletion, depending on Cre-recombinase action. Based on the functional data obtained in former studies, it was decided to target exons 4 and 5 of the QC gene, which contain several essential residues of the active site. Following preparation of the targeting vector and selection of targeted ES cells, ES cells were inserted into blastocysts, and chimeric mice were obtained. After mating of the chimeras with Cre-expressing transgenic mice, heterozygous QC knock-out mice were selected. Intercross-breeding and genotyping of the offspring allowed the identification of constitutive homozygous knock-out (QC−/−) animals (Fig. 1A). QC protein expression in knock-out mice was assessed by determination of activity and immunohistochemistry. An analysis of QC activity in different tissues of the mice revealed a high expression in the brain, liver, and spleen, lower expression in muscle, and no detectable activity in peripheral organs like the kidney and heart (Fig. 1B). A comparison with the activity observed in QC−/− animals revealed a significant decrease of QC activity in the brain, but not in the liver and spleen. Because the determination of the activity does not discriminate between the enzyme and isoenzyme, it appears very likely that isoQC is the primary enzyme in peripheral tissues. The remarkable expression of QC in the brain was further analyzed by QC immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1C) and determination of activity in several regions of the cerebrum and the cerebellum (Fig. 1D). Both analyses provided similar results. In immunohistochemistry, wild type animals showed an immunostaining in cortical and hippocampal brain regions, which was prominent in the regions CA1 to -3 and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The staining was clearly diminished in QC−/− animals. Accordingly, the highest QC activity was observed in hypothalamus and hippocampus of wild type mice, which was significantly diminished in QC−/−, suggesting QC as the primary source of the activity in these brain regions. Lower QC activity was observed in cerebellum and cortex. Interestingly, the residual enzymatic activity in the knock-out animals appeared to be similar, which suggests a basal expression of the isoenzyme and a more differential expression of QC (15Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the cellular origin of QC activity in the brain, primary cortical neurons were cultured. Neurons from wild type mice secreted QC activity into the culture medium, which is in agreement with earlier investigations using transfected cultured cells. QC secretion decreased gene dose-dependently in primary neurons from QC−/− animals, supporting that the secreted activity is only caused by QC and not by isoQC (Fig. 1E). Similarly, QC activity was also detected in the medium of cultured glia cells, and the activity was abolished in glia medium from QC−/− mice. In contrast to the activity in the media, the QC activity did not change in the cell pellet, which suggests that the Golgi-resident isoQC activity is present and accounts for the majority of the activity within the cells. The gene dose-dependent reduction of QC in the medium of the cultured primary cells corresponds to the abolishment of QC activity in plasma of QC−/− (Fig. 1F). Thus, depletion of a functional QC gene results primarily in an effect on the extracellular QC activity. Finally, we investigated the expression of isoQC using real-time PCR, in order to exclude a compensatory up-regulation of isoQC. A direct comparison of the RT-PCR results obtained for isoQC did not reveal an increase of the transcript levels of isoQC in QC−/− animals (Fig. 1G). Thus, the determination of the QC activity is most likely not hampered by an increase in isoQC activity, which potentially shadows the decrease in activity in the QC−/− mice. Finally, this is also supported by the similar intracellular QC concentration/activity in the primary neuronal cells (Fig. 1E), which is most likely caused by isoQC. The QC knock-out animal colony was expanded by intercross of QC+/− mice. Among 955 pups, 24% were homozygous for the QC knock-out allele, which is in accordance with an expected Mendelian heredity and indicates the absence of prenatal lethality. In order to assess potential phenotypic differences between QC knock-out mice and wild type littermates, a group of young adult males was subjected to a comprehensive phenotypic assessment. A comparison of the body weight of the animals in the three genotype groups revealed a tendency to a reduced weight of QC−/− mice (Fig. 2A). However, the differences were not statistically significant, and the effect was not gene dose-dependent. Weight gain was virtually identical among all genotypes. The behavioral assessment of the mice was initiated by a primary screen investigating the animals' general behavior and health status in a qualitative assessment. No abnormalities were detected in QC+/− or QC−/− mice (not shown). Animals were further characterized in an automated phenotyping assessment in order to observe potential behavioral changes in a consecutive manner for 136 h. The phenotyping system allowed quantification of locomotion as well as food and water consumption (Fig. 2, B and D) and examination of the day/night rhythm of activity (Fig. 2C) and feeding. Supporting the primary screen result, no difference in food or water consumption was observed between all groups. Furthermore, the general locomotor activity was identical in all groups, and also the rhythm of"
https://openalex.org/W1991028225,"Ca2+-binding proteins play pivotal roles in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. CcbP from cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is a major Ca2+-binding protein involved in heterocyst differentiation, a process that forms specialized nitrogen-fixing cells. The three-dimensional structures of both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms of CcbP are essential for elucidating the Ca2+-signaling mechanism. However, CcbP shares low sequence identity with proteins of known structures, and its Ca2+-binding sites remain unknown. Here, we report the solution structures of CcbP in both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CcbP adopts an overall new fold and contains two Ca2+-binding sites with distinct Ca2+-binding abilities. Mutation of Asp38 at the stronger Ca2+-binding site of CcbP abolished its ability to regulate heterocyst formation in vivo. Surprisingly, the β-barrel subdomain of CcbP, which does not participate in Ca2+-binding, topologically resembles the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and might act as a protein-protein interaction module. Our results provide the structural basis of the unique Ca2+ signaling mechanism during heterocyst differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2067401239,"Mammalian cells express two isoforms of type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase: PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ. PI4KIIα exists almost exclusively as a constitutively active integral membrane protein because of its palmitoylation (Barylko, B., Gerber, S. H., Binns, D. D., Grichine, N., Khvotchev, M., Südhof, T. C., and Albanesi, J. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7705–7708). In contrast, PI4KIIβ is distributed almost evenly between membranes and cytosol. Whereas the palmitoylated membrane-bound pool is catalytically active, the cytosolic kinase is inactive (Wei, Y. J., Sun, H.

In this study, we identify the molecular chaperone Hsp90 as a binding partner of PI4KIIβ, but not of PI4KIIα. Geldanamycin (GA), a specific Hsp90 inhibitor, disrupts the Hsp90-PI4KIIβ interaction and destabilizes PI4KIIβ, reducing its half-life by 40% and increasing its susceptibility to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Cytosolic PI4KIIβ is much more sensitive to GA treatment than is the integrally membrane-associated species. Exposure to GA induces a partial redistribution of PI4KIIβ from the cytosol to membranes and, with brief GA treatments, a corresponding increase in cellular phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity. Stimuli such as PDGF receptor activation that also induce recruitment of the kinase to membranes disrupt the Hsp90-PI4KIIβ interaction to a similar extent as GA treatment. These results support a model wherein Hsp90 interacts predominantly with the cytosolic, inactive pool of PI4KIIβ, shielding it from proteolytic degradation but also sequestering it to the cytosol until an extracellular stimulus triggers its translocation to the Golgi or plasma membrane and subsequent activation. Mammalian cells express two isoforms of type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase: PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ. PI4KIIα exists almost exclusively as a constitutively active integral membrane protein because of its palmitoylation (Barylko, B., Gerber, S. H., Binns, D. D., Grichine, N., Khvotchev, M., Südhof, T. C., and Albanesi, J. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7705–7708). In contrast, PI4KIIβ is distributed almost evenly between membranes and cytosol. Whereas the palmitoylated membrane-bound pool is catalytically active, the cytosolic kinase is inactive (Wei, Y. J., Sun, H. Q., Yamamoto, M., Wlodarski, P., Kunii, K., Martinez, M., Barylko, B., Albanesi, J. P., and Yin, H. L. (2002) J. Biol.

Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) initiate the canonical phosphoinositide biosynthetic pathway by phosphorylating the D-4 hydroxyl of the inositol head group of PtdIns. The product of this reaction, PtdIns 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), 2The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns4P, PtdIns 4-phosphate; GA, geldanamycin; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. serves not only as a major precursor in the synthesis of more highly phosphorylated phosphoinositides, including PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate, but also has itself been shown to be a regulator of membrane trafficking (7De Matteis M.

The type III kinases, which are expressed from yeast to mammals, are further subdivided into α (∼230 kDa) and β (∼100 kDa) isoforms. Although mammals also express two type II kinases (α and β, both ∼55 kDa), Saccharomyces cerevisiae have only one PI4KII ortholog, known as Lsb6p (9Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Vereb Jr., G. Vereb G. Kakuk A.

Unlike PI4KIIIs, which are almost entirely cytosolic, PI4KIIs can associate integrally with membranes by virtue of palmitoylation of multiple cysteines within their catalytic domains (11Barylko B.

The palmitoylation motif, CCPCC, is present in both PI4KIIα and β. However, whereas >90% of PI4KIIα is palmitoylated and exists in cells as an active, integrally membrane-bound species, PI4KIIβ is divided almost evenly between cytosolic and membrane-bound pools (13Wei Y.J.

Moreover, almost half of membrane-bound PI4KIIβ is only peripherally associated with membranes, extractable by sodium carbonate at pH 11 in the absence of detergent. Therefore, it appears that only ∼25–30% of PI4KIIβ is normally palmitoylated in cells. Because palmitoylation is essential for catalytic activity (14Jung G. Wang J. Wlodarski P. Barylko B. Binns D.D. Shu H. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 70–75% of this isoform may be inactive under resting conditions. Although a small portion (∼7%) of PI4KIIβ is recruited to membranes in response to growth factor receptor activation (13Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Wlodarski P. Kunii K. Martinez M. Barylko B.

We reported that the different membrane binding properties and palmitoylation states of PI4KIIα and β are not due to their highly diverse N-terminal regions but instead to relatively slight differences in their C-terminal 160 residues (14Jung G.

Subrahmanyam G. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggest that it may have a role in cellular signaling. To understand how extracellular stimuli recruit PI4KIIβ to membranes, where it can be palmitoylated and activated, we sought to understand the basis for its distribution between membranes and cytosol. To this end, we attempted to identify binding partners that (a) selectively bind to PI4KIIβ over PI4KIIα and (b) could sequester PI4KIIβ to the cytosol. The data presented below demonstrate that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 fulfills these criteria. They further demonstrate that the interaction with Hsp90 is required to stabilize the cytosolic pool of PI4KIIβ and that the PI4KIIβ-Hsp90 interaction is disrupted by growth factor receptor activation, resulting in a partial redistribution of the kinase to membranes.DISCUSSIONOf the four mammalian PtdIns 4-kinase isoforms, PI4KIIβ is by far the least understood in terms of function or regulation. Unlike the other three isoforms, PI4KIIβ is almost evenly distributed between membranes and cytosol. The two type III kinases are almost entirely cytosolic (10Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell. Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the other type II isoform, PI4KIIα, is almost entirely membrane-bound (11Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because cytosolic PI4KIIβ is catalytically inactive, its redistribution to membranes is likely to represent a major mechanism of regulation. Indeed, a portion of PI4KIIβ is recruited to membranes in response to stimuli, such as growth factor receptor activation (13Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Wlodarski P. Kunii K. Martinez M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46586-46593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an effort to explain the subcellular distribution of PI4KIIβ, we sought to identify binding partners that could either recruit the kinase to membranes or sequester it in the cytosol. Our results revealed that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 binds preferentially to cytosolic (and weakly membrane-bound) PI4KIIβ, inhibits its association with membranes, and protects it from proteolytic degradation. Moreover, the interaction between PI4KIIβ and Hsp90 was weakened upon treatment of cells with EGF or PDGF, suggesting that Hsp90 is a key regulator of stimulus-dependent PtdIns4P production. Based on our data, we propose a model for the life cycle of PI4KIIβ shown in Fig. 10. According to this model, cytosolic PI4KIIβ associates with Hsp90 for stabilization. An extracellular signal disrupts the interaction, allowing the free kinase to translocate to the membrane, where it may undergo palmitoylation and activation. Short exposure to GA may mimic the effect of growth factors. In contrast to PI4KIIβ, we suggest that PI4KIIα rapidly associates with Golgi membranes after its synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes and then is stably palmitoylated and, hence, constitutively active.Hsp90 is essential for the maturation, stability, and translocation of a defined set of so-called “client” proteins (reviewed in Refs. 26Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 31Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 17: 87-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Currently there are more than 100 known Hsp90 clients, and many of those, including steroid hormone receptors, transcription factors, and protein kinases, participate in signal transduction pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a lipid kinase as an Hsp90 client, although PI3K activity is indirectly regulated by Hsp90 (36Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of Hsp90 is ATP-driven and involves the coordinated assistance of a variety of co-chaperones, as well as of Hsp70 (26Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 27Terasawa K. Minami M. Minami Y. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of the Hsp90 ATPase reaction, such as GA, have been used to disrupt interactions between Hsp90 and its client proteins in cells and to establish the functional significance of these interactions (24Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). As shown in this study for PI4KIIβ, GA treatment has often resulted in enhanced proteolytic degradation and reduction in cellular levels of Hsp90 clients (reviewed in Ref. 41Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar).Based on our observations, we hypothesize that growth factor-dependent stimulation of PI4KIIβ is tightly and obligatorily linked to its release from Hsp90. There are other examples in the literature of Hsp90 serving as an inhibitor of kinase activity. For example, protein kinase R is activated by dsRNA, which triggers its dissociation from Hsp90 (42Donzé O. Abbas-Terki T. Picard D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3771-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also, Src is transiently activated upon its release from Hsp90 (43Koga F. Xu W. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Baron R. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11318-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in some cases, interaction with Hsp90 can be inhibitory in the short term, although protective in the long term. At present, we have no information regarding the downstream signaling event(s) that might trigger growth factor-dependent dissociation of PI4KIIβ from Hsp90. The most obvious possibility, stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of PI4KIIβ, has not yet been examined, although it is interesting that this modification occurs only in the membrane-associated species (14Jung G. Wang J. Wlodarski P. Barylko B. Binns D.D. Shu H. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, because there is evidence that Hsp90 kinase interactions can be disrupted by phosphorylation (44Tucker D.E. Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Qiu Z.H. Gelb M.H. Leslie C.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 84: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), this direction will be pursued in future studies.

The product of this reaction, PtdIns 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), 2The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdIns4P, PtdIns 4-phosphate; GA, geldanamycin; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. serves not only as a major precursor in the synthesis of more highly phosphorylated phosphoinositides, including PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate, but also has itself been shown to be a regulator of membrane trafficking (7De Matteis M.

Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Two types of PI4K (PI4KII and PI4KIII) have been identified in eukaryotes. The type III kinases, which are expressed from yeast to mammals, are further subdivided into α (∼230 kDa) and β (∼100 kDa) isoforms. Although mammals also express two type II kinases (α and β, both ∼55 kDa), Saccharomyces cerevisiae have only one PI4KII ortholog, known as Lsb6p (9Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Vereb Jr., G. Vereb G. Kakuk A. Szivák I. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell. Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PI4KIIα and β have conserved catalytic domains but diverse N-terminal regions extending approximately from residues 1 to 90. Unlike PI4KIIIs, which are almost entirely cytosolic, PI4KIIs can associate integrally with membranes by virtue of palmitoylation of multiple cysteines within their catalytic domains (11Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Barylko B. Mao Y.S.

The palmitoylation motif, CCPCC, is present in both PI4KIIα and β. However, whereas >90% of PI4KIIα is palmitoylated and exists in cells as an active, integrally membrane-bound species, PI4KIIβ is divided almost evenly between cytosolic and membrane-bound pools (13Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Wlodarski P. Kunii K. Martinez M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Yin H.L. J. Biol.

J. 2008; 409: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, almost half of membrane-bound PI4KIIβ is only peripherally associated with membranes, extractable by sodium carbonate at pH 11 in the absence of detergent. Therefore, it appears that only ∼25–30% of PI4KIIβ is normally palmitoylated in cells. Because palmitoylation is essential for catalytic activity (14Jung G. Wang J. Wlodarski P. Barylko B. Binns D.D. Shu H. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 70–75% of this isoform may be inactive under resting conditions. Although a small portion (∼7%) of PI4KIIβ is recruited to membranes in response to growth factor receptor activation (13Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Wlodarski P. Kunii K. Martinez M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46586-46593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), conditions have not yet been found that result in a major redistribution of the kinase from cytosol to membranes. We reported that the different membrane binding properties and palmitoylation states of PI4KIIα and β are not due to their highly diverse N-terminal regions but instead to relatively slight differences in their C-terminal 160 residues (14Jung G. Wang J. Wlodarski P. Barylko B. Binns D.D. Shu H. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PI4KIIα has been implicated in generating PtdIns4P pools that regulate membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (15Wang Y.J. Wang J. Sun H.Q. Martinez M. Sun Y.X. Macia E. Kirchhausen T.

Sci. 2006; 119: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although no specific function has been ascribed to PI4KIIβ, its partial redistribution to the plasma membrane in response to growth factor receptor activation (13Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46586-46593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to activation of the T-cell receptor (18Fernandis A.Z. Subrahmanyam G. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) suggest that it may have a role in cellular signaling. To understand how extracellular stimuli recruit PI4KIIβ to membranes, where it can be palmitoylated and activated, we sought to understand the basis for its distribution between membranes and cytosol. To this end, we attempted to identify binding partners that (a) selectively bind to PI4KIIβ over PI4KIIα and (b) could sequester PI4KIIβ to the cytosol. The data presented below demonstrate that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 fulfills these criteria. They further demonstrate that the interaction with Hsp90 is required to stabilize the cytosolic pool of PI4KIIβ and that the PI4KIIβ-Hsp90 interaction is disrupted by growth factor receptor activation, resulting in a partial redistribution of the kinase to membranes. DISCUSSIONOf the four mammalian PtdIns 4-kinase isoforms, PI4KIIβ is by far the least understood in terms of function or regulation. Unlike the other three isoforms, PI4KIIβ is almost evenly distributed between membranes and cytosol. The two type III kinases are almost entirely cytosolic (10Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell. Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the other type II isoform, PI4KIIα, is almost entirely membrane-bound (11Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Südhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because cytosolic PI4KIIβ is catalytically inactive, its redistribution to membranes is likely to represent a major mechanism of regulation. Indeed, a portion of PI4KIIβ is recruited to membranes in response to stimuli, such as growth factor receptor activation (13Wei Y.J. Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Wlodarski P. Kunii K. Martinez M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46586-46593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an effort to explain the subcellular distribution of PI4KIIβ, we sought to identify binding partners that could either recruit the kinase to membranes or sequester it in the cytosol. Our results revealed that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 binds preferentially to cytosolic (and weakly membrane-bound) PI4KIIβ, inhibits its association with membranes, and protects it from proteolytic degradation. Moreover, the interaction between PI4KIIβ and Hsp90 was weakened upon treatment of cells with EGF or PDGF, suggesting that Hsp90 is a key regulator of stimulus-dependent PtdIns4P production. Based on our data, we propose a model for the life cycle of PI4KIIβ shown in Fig. 10. According to this model, cytosolic PI4KIIβ associates with Hsp90 for stabilization. An extracellular signal disrupts the interaction, allowing the free kinase to translocate to the membrane, where it may undergo palmitoylation and activation. Short exposure to GA may mimic the effect of growth factors. In contrast to PI4KIIβ, we suggest that PI4KIIα rapidly associates with Golgi membranes after its synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes and then is stably palmitoylated and, hence, constitutively active.Hsp90 is essential for the maturation, stability, and translocation of a defined set of so-called “client” proteins (reviewed in Refs. 26Young J.C.

Biol. 2007; 17: 87-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Currently there are more than 100 known Hsp90 clients, and many of those, including steroid hormone receptors, transcription factors, and protein kinases, participate in signal transduction pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a lipid kinase as an Hsp90 client, although PI3K activity is indirectly regulated by Hsp90 (36Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of Hsp90 is ATP-driven and involves the coordinated assistance of a variety of co-chaperones, as well as of Hsp70 (26Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 27Terasawa K. Minami M. Minami Y. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of the Hsp90 ATPase reaction, such as GA, have been used to disrupt interactions between Hsp90 and its client proteins in cells and to establish the functional significance of these interactions (24Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). As shown in this study for PI4KIIβ, GA treatment has often resulted in enhanced proteolytic degradation and reduction in cellular levels of Hsp90 clients (reviewed in Ref. 41Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar).Based on our observations, we hypothesize that growth factor-dependent stimulation of PI4KIIβ is tightly and obligatorily linked to its release from Hsp90. There are other examples in the literature of Hsp90 serving as an inhibitor of kinase activity. For example, protein kinase R is activated by dsRNA, which triggers its dissociation from Hsp90 (42Donzé O. Abbas-Terki T. Picard D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3771-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also, Src is transiently activated upon its release from Hsp90 (43Koga F. Xu W. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Baron R. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11318-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in some cases, interaction with Hsp90 can be inhibitory in the short term, although protective in the long term. At present, we have no information regarding the downstream signaling event(s) that might trigger growth factor-dependent dissociation of PI4KIIβ from Hsp90. The most obvious possibility, stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of PI4KIIβ, has not yet been examined, although it is interesting that this modification occurs only in the membrane-associated species (14Jung G. Wang J. Wlodarski P. Barylko B. Binns D.D. Shu H. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, because there is evidence that Hsp90 kinase interactions can be disrupted by phosphorylation (44Tucker D.E. Gijón M.A. Spencer D.M. Qiu Z.H. Gelb M.H. Leslie C.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 84: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), this direction will be pursued in future studies.

During the past 10 years, we have had our first glimpse of why individuals differ so much from one another. This is not the right place to revisit the nature-nurture wars or to reflect on the extent to which our impression of high phenotypic variability in humans is a narcissistic illusion. For the moment, let us just acknowledge the obvious: In any small group of people, we see a lot of variation in traits we care about—and not just those that affect health. Geneticists shy away from studying these traits—and for good reason. They prefer not to revisit a subject whose premature investigation accounted for the worst moments of their young science. Nonetheless, questions about the genetic basis of variability among generally healthy humans will not go away. Public fascination alone will keep it alive, as will the realization that genetics is unlikely to revolutionize medicine until we develop a better understanding of normal phenotypic variation. So, what have our first glimpses of variation in the genomes of generally healthy people taught us? First, balancing selection, the evolutionary process that favors genetic diversification rather than the fixation of a single “best” variant, appears to play a minor role outside the immune system. Local adaptation, which accounts for variation in traits such as pigmentation, dietary specialization, and susceptibility to particular pathogens is also a second-tier player. What is on the top tier? Increasingly, the answer appears to be mutations that are “deleterious” by biochemical or standard evolutionary criteria. These mutations, as has long been appreciated, overwhelmingly make up the most abundant form of nonneutral variation in all genomes. A model for human genetic individuality is emerging in which there actually is a “wild-type” human genome—one in which most genes exist in an evolutionarily optimized form. There just are no “wild-type” humans: We each fall short of this Platonic ideal in our own distinctive ways.

A decade is not nearly enough time to measure the impact of a scientific revolution. We should not presume to judge how human lives will change as a result of the publication of the human genome sequence in Science in February 2001. It is clear, though, that simply weighing past predictions against present realities misses the mark. It is too soon to tell whether cures for genetic disease were oversold or fears of producing a genetic underclass were much overblown. What matters is that we found a powerful new way to represent human identity, and the moral implications of that re-representation are just beginning to unfold.

Like the Constitution of the United States, the human genome turned out to be a sparse document, containing fewer genes than expected. This means that, as with the Constitution, the genome's meanings will evolve over time, as scientists, lawmakers, and publics make sense of the fixed elements of the sequence in relation to the variables and unknowns in the surrounding environment. Some outlines of new thinking are already emerging, as importantly in law and ethics as in biomedicine. Unsettled questions about who can patent genes, how to regulate unconsented uses of genetic information, when to allow familial searching of data banks, who owns immortal cell lines, and what constitutes impermissible mixing of human and nonhuman genetic material all point to deeper uncertainty about the moral status of the human genome.

These questions are contentious, but in disrupting our taken-for-granted assumptions, they force us to rethink the nature and consequences of being human. In retrospect, this point leaps out as most significant: 2001 marked the issuance of a founding document, a biological living constitution that remakes how we, as individuals and species, interpret our obligations to each other and to other entities on Earth.
