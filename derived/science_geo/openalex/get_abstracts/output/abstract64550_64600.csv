https://openalex.org/W2087298783,"Fluorescamine is a new reagent for the detection of primary amines in the picomole range. Its reaction with amines is almost instantaneous at room temperature in aqueous media. The products are highly fluorescent, whereas the reagent and its degradation products are nonfluorescent. Applications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2023691174,Silicon is required for normal growth and development in the chick when a low silicon diet is fed in a trace element controlled environment. Day-old deutectomized cockerels fed a purified amino acid diet showed significantly retarded growth and development within 2 to 3 weeks. Chicks fed the same diet plus a silicon supplement showed 50 percent higher growth and normal development. Silicon meets the criteria for an essential trace element.
https://openalex.org/W2051188685,"Labeled morphine, codeine, heroin, or methadone was injected as a bolus into the common carotid artery of the rat, and the rat was decapitated 15 seconds later. The brain uptake of the drug was calculated by measurement of the brain content of the drug as a percentage of a labeled, highly diffusible reference substance simultaneously injected. The uptake of morphine was below measurability; the uptake of codeine was 24 percent; heroin, 68 percent; and methadone, 42 percent. Brain uptakes of morphine and codeine were also studied after intravenous injection and correlated well with uptakes after carotid injection; the uptake of codeine being nearly complete by 30 seconds. These studies indicate that brain uptake of certain of these drugs is very rapid and that uptake of heroin injected intravenously is probably limited by the regional flow of blood in the brain. The possible relation of this rapid penetration of the blood-brain barrier by heroin to its strongly addictive properties is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2095392508,"Synaptosomes from rat brain accumulate choline by two kinetically distinct processes, a high-affinity uptake system [Michaelis constant (Km) = 1 × 10-6M], and a low-affinity system (Km = 9 × 10-5M). The high-affinity uptake system requires sodium, and is associated with considerable formation of acetylcholine. The low-affinity uptake system is less dependent on sodium, and does not appear to be associated with a marked degree of acetylcholine formation. The high-affinity choline uptake appears to represent selective choline accumulation by cholinergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1969900610,Nitric oxide is detected by a new technique in which tunable infrared radiation from a spin-flip Raman laser is used to measure the absorption spectrumn of a gas sample by optoacoustic spectroscopy. This technique is sensitive enough to detect a concentration of 0.01 part per million of nitric oxide pollution in air samples.
https://openalex.org/W1992240306,"It is evident that metabolic interactions can occur among drugs, insecticides, food additives, carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and a variety of environmental chemicals. A common denominator governing these effects is the versatile nature of the liver microsomal enzymes that metabolize chemicals with diverse structures and biological activities, and the fact that these enzymes can be stimulated or inhibited by other chemicals administered simultaneously. The discovery of these particular enzymes in the 1950's laid the groundwork for the current research on metabolic interactions. Such research provides information that is helpful in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of drugs and environmental chemicals, and suggests new directions for further research. Some examples are as follows."

https://openalex.org/W2007803710,"Small mammals are able to run at about the same maximum speed vertically as horizontally, but larger mammals cannot do this. During level running a mouse weighing 30 grams uses about eight times as much energy per unit of body weight as does a chimpanzee weighing 17.5 kilograms (42.6 joules per kilogram meter versus 5.17 joules per kilogram meter). The additional energy required to lift 1 kilogram of body weight 1 meter while running uphill was similar for the two species (about 15.5 joules per kilogram meter). Therefore the increment in energy expenditure for mice to run uphill compared to running horizontally is about one-eighth that for a chimpanzee. Both mice and chimpanzees were able to recover about 90 percent of the energy stored running uphill on the way down."
https://openalex.org/W1966313141,"Receptors for calcitonin, determined by activation of adenylate cyclase, were found in a distribution among zones of the kidney distinct from that of receptors for parathyroid hormone or vasopressin. Competitive binding studies showed that the receptors for calcitonin are similar in kidney and bone and that their high apparent affinity for salmon calcitonin accounts in part for the high biological potency in vivo of salmon calcitonin."
https://openalex.org/W2014608025,"The adsorption of elemental mercury vapor on a thin (several hundred angstroms) gold film produces resistance changes in the film. An instrument for the detection of mercury based on this phenomenon is simple and rapid and requires no chemical separations other than passage of the vapor sample through a few standard dry filters. The instrument is portable, and the technique is directly applicable to environmental problems and geochemical prospecting. The limit of detection of the prototype instrument is 0.05 nanogram of mercury."

https://openalex.org/W1973848414,"Within tested strains of the genera Naegleria and Acanthamoeba the ability to grow at high temperatures seems directly related to virulence, with nonvirulent strains unable to grow at normal or elevated body temperatures. Outside these genera, nonvirulent Hartmannella and Tetramitus do grow at elevated temperatures, which suggests a barrier to pathogenicity other than temperature sensitivity. The high optimal temperature of pathogenic Naegleria apparently explains previous difficulty in obtaining isolates from the aquatic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2054247112,"Bipedal chimpanzees reorient the pelvis to achieve an upright posture but retain the same pattern of femoral flexion and extension as in quadrupedal walking. Major differences from human gait are the abducted, relatively more flexed excursion of the femur and the timing of pelvic tilt, which raises during the swing phase. The femoral head morphology in the fossil hominid Australopithecus robustus is evidence of an approximately vertical excursion of the femur in contrast to the adducted pattern of modern man and the abducted pattern of chimpanzees."
https://openalex.org/W2078597019,"The striate cortex transforms the topographic representation of visual space in the lateral geniculate body into a Fourier transform or frequency representation at the complex cell level via the intermediary simple cell stage of ""strip integration."" Each of these three stages contains essentially the same amount of information, which expresses a conservation of information principle; however, the form of the information is changed. In the transform domain, invariant descriptions of visual objects can be derived to serve as the basic sets required for pattern recognition and memory. We believe that our experimental and theoretical findings are fundamental for understanding the functional organization of the striate cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2081517687,"The time of day is a decisive determinant of the effects of l-norepinephrine on feeding behavior. During the dark, direct application of l-norepinephrine to the hypothalamus of rats suppressed feeding behavior. During the light, treatment with the same dose of l-norepinephrine facilitated feeding behavior. Thus, l-norepinephrine has dual and opposite effects on feeding behavior. A hypothalamic substrate that fluctuates in a circadian rhythm could account for both actions of l-norepinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W2087147571,"In awake, unrestrained cats, bulboreticular neurons respond after electrical stimulation of cutaneous nerve with increasing discharge as stimulus intensity is raised to levels eliciting escape behavior. These cells discharge most vigorously to noxious natural somatic stimuli and are not driven by other sensory modalities. Electrical stimulation through the recording microelectrode also elicits escape, which further suggests bulboreticular participation in pain sensory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2001127251,"When cartilage is deformed, it becomes electrically polarized. At least two mechanisms seem to underlie this phenomenon, namely, a short-duration, high-amplitude, piezoelectric-like response and a longer-duration, lower-amplitude response secondary to streaming potentials. The polarity of articular cartilage during loading could hypothetically facilitate joint lubrication."
https://openalex.org/W2054283114,"Several species of bottom-dwelling fish from 2500 meters with similar feeding habits had mercury concentrations that differed by an order of magnitude. Within one species there was a correlation between size and concentration, with the larger individuals having mercury concentrations as high as 0.8 part per million (wet weight). The mercury content of the water in the deep-ocean habitat of these fish appears not to determine the mercury content of a particular fish; species-specific factors and size do appear to determine this concentration. The species-specific variation between the recent fish also existed between the same two species in specimens collected 90 years ago from a depth of 2000 meters, and a 90-year-old specimen fit closely the size-concentration regression curve for nine recent individuals of the same species."
https://openalex.org/W1973518182,Biosynthesis of a precursor (proparathyroid hormone) to human parathyroid hormone was demonstrated during incubation of tissue from parathyroid adenomas. The proparathyroid hormone is labeled more rapidly than parathyroid hormone during incubation with amino acids labeled with carbon-14 and is progressively converted to the hormone. Apparent differences in the relative rate of conversion of precursor to hormone found in different tumors suggest that proparathyroid hormone may accumulate in some of the tumors and be secreted into the circulation.

https://openalex.org/W2093821432,"The Hbbd allele at the hemoglobin beta chain locus of Mus musculus is composed of two linked genes, coding for structurally different beta chains, βdmin and βdmaj. Mus caroli has only one beta chain, which combines structural features of both βdmin and βdmaj and thus may be a Lepore type of beta chain. Sequence data suggest that selection may have been important in the evolution of the mouse beta chains."
https://openalex.org/W1990799672,In vitro studies on the dissolution rate of cholesterol monohydrate crystals in micellar bile acid solutions showed that the addition of lecithin decreases the dissolution rate even though lecithin increases the equilibrium solubility of cholesterol in these solutions. The reduction in rates caused by lecithin was attributed to a large crystal-solution interfacial barrier. An effective permeability coefficient for the interfacial barrier was calculated to be around 1.5 x 10(-5) centimeter per second for the transport of cholesterol molecules.

The sweetening of substances by temporarily modifying the tongue, rather than by adding a substance sweet in itself, may provide an alternative to currently used nonnutritive sweeteners."
https://openalex.org/W2015770339,"The addition of antimycin A (0.5 microgram per milliliter) to cultures of a bleached strain of Euglena gracilis in the logarithmic phase of growth on succinate as a carbon source results in (i) an interruption of growth for 24 hours and (ii) an increase in whole-cell respiration and the emergence of a novel succinoxidase activity within 2 to 4 hours. After 3 to 5 hours, the mitochondria enlarge, fuse, and form a sheathlike structure situated close to the periphery of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2074814795,"A 24-hour rhythm of gas exchange has been detected in dry onion seeds. The rhythm persists in constant conditions, and its period appears to be independent of temperature. Since DNA replication, transcription, and perhaps translation do not occur in this quiescent state, it is concluded that the basic oscillation that defines circadian rhythmicity does not derive directly from these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2113357628,"There are two common responses of plants to changes in concentration of limiting factors: change in the final yield (type I response) or change in the growth rate (type II response). Type II is typical of phytoplankton algae in nature, yet some experiments have failed to show growth rate changes because of inappropriate experimental design."
https://openalex.org/W2068681138,"There was decreased synthesis of the beta-globin chain in the peripheral blood, and equal synthesis of alpha- and non-alpha-chains in the bone marrow of three patients with hemoglobin Lepore trait, similar to the findings in patients with heterozygous beta-thalassemia. There is a relative instability of the synthetic mechanism for normal beta-chain in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2013408812,The amount of kappa and lambda chains and Fc fragment associated with the plasma membrane and in the entire cell has been measured for eight lines of human lymphocytes and 21 clones derived from two diploid lines. There was considerable variation in the nature and amount of membrane-associated immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin among different cell lines and clones. Cells with different phenotypes for membrane-associated immunoglobulin were utilized to show that it is not simply absorbed from the culture medium onto the plasma membrane. The methods are useful for selecting variants which lack or have altered membrane-associated immunoglobulin.

https://openalex.org/W2043252151,"Cat hemoglobin has a lower cooperativity and oxygen affinity than most mammalian hemoglobins. In contrast to the usual invariance of cooperativity with pH, a rise in cooperativity with pH is predicted by the allosteric model for low-affinity hemoglobins. Such a pH-dependent cooperativity for cat hemoglobin has been found."
https://openalex.org/W1985185163,"Of 19 adult intersex chickens examined, 17 were triploid animals with ZZW sex chromosomes. Triploid erythrocytes were about 1.5 times the size of diploid erythrocytes, and were present in amounts that were about two-thirds the number of diploid erythrocytes. Both diploid and triploid animals had similar hematocrits and hemoglobin concentrations. Triploidy is reflected in a relative increase in RNA, as well as in DNA, per erythrocyte. This, in addition to the trisomic mode of inheritance observed in several genetically distinct loci determining isoantigens, indicates that all three sets of chromosomes in the triploid animals are genetically active. Apparently, there is a homeostatic mechanism maintaining the concentration of hemoglobin for the species in spite of triploidy and its effect on erythrocyte size."
https://openalex.org/W1987270176,Cytogenetic analyses showed that a trisomic male brook trout of genotype BB'B'' for one of the lactate dehydrogenase subunit loci had a karyotype with two extra arms appearing as a metacentric chromosome. The metacentric chromosome probably arose through centric fusion of two acrocentric or telocentric chromosomes-one of which carried the locus for subunit B-followed by nondisjunction.
https://openalex.org/W1999160795,Data from two experiments show that the duration of visual fixation of solid objects by infants aged 6 to 20 weeks varies as a function of object distance between 30 and 90 centimeters. There was no characteristic habituation of fixation of an object at 90 centimeters but there was a marked increase in fixation time when objects were advanced to 30 centimeters (experiment 1). A linear decline in fixation times occurred as the object distance increased from 30 to 90 centimeters with the real size and the angular size of the object held constant (experiment 2). No evidence for visual size constancy in young infants was obtained by this method.
https://openalex.org/W2023845339,The radioactive proteins synthesized in a cell-free system and released from polyribosomes from rat brain were analyzed for the presence of a protein found only in the nervous system. Polyribosomes from rat liver were also studied to demonstrate the organ specificity of the radioactive product synthesized in vitro. The S-100 protein constituted 0.15 percent of the radioactive proteins released from brain polyribosomes.

First, Mössbauer spectroscopy has been widely used as a tool for basic research in solid-state physics, chemical structure, and magnetism. Second, the technique has been applied to many analytical and materials science problems where the nature of the sample prevents the use of more traditional approaches. Mössbauer spectroscopy research on frozen solutions, colloids, interface chemistry, and crystallographic transformations can be expected to increase rapidly in the next few years."
https://openalex.org/W2040896631,The isometric tension of glycerinated muscle fibers and the adenosine triphosphatase activity of homogenates were determined as a function of the concentration of adenosine triphosphate without the addition of divalent cations. These two phenomena are not parallel; large tensions can be developed with negligible hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate. It is concluded that the large negative free energy change of the hydrolysis is not required for shortening or development of tension.
