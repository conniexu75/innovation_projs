https://openalex.org/W2077033935,"Overnutrition is associated with chronic inflammation in metabolic tissues. Whether metabolic inflammation compromises the neural regulatory systems and therefore promotes overnutrition-associated diseases remains unexplored. Here we show that a mediator of metabolic inflammation, IKKbeta/NF-kappaB, normally remains inactive although enriched in hypothalamic neurons. Overnutrition atypically activates hypothalamic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB at least in part through elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress in the hypothalamus. While forced activation of hypothalamic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB interrupts central insulin/leptin signaling and actions, site- or cell-specific suppression of IKKbeta either broadly across the brain or locally within the mediobasal hypothalamus, or specifically in hypothalamic AGRP neurons significantly protects against obesity and glucose intolerance. The molecular mechanisms involved include regulation by IKKbeta/NF-kappaB of SOCS3, a core inhibitor of insulin and leptin signaling. Our results show that the hypothalamic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB program is a general neural mechanism for energy imbalance underlying obesity and suggest that suppressing hypothalamic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB may represent a strategy to combat obesity and related diseases."

Here, we combined genome-wide siRNA analyses with interrogation of human interactome databases to assemble a host-pathogen biochemical network containing 213 confirmed host cellular factors and 11 HIV-1-encoded proteins. Protein complexes that regulate ubiquitin conjugation, proteolysis, DNA-damage response, and RNA splicing were identified as important modulators of early-stage HIV-1 infection. Additionally, over 40 new factors were shown to specifically influence the initiation and/or kinetics of HIV-1 DNA synthesis, including cytoskeletal regulatory proteins, modulators of posttranslational modification, and nucleic acid-binding proteins. Finally, 15 proteins with diverse functional roles, including nuclear transport, prostaglandin synthesis, ubiquitination, and transcription, were found to influence nuclear import or viral DNA integration. Taken together, the multiscale approach described here has uncovered multiprotein virus-host interactions that likely act in concert to facilitate the early steps of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2123523713,"Background The prediction of the genetic disease risk of an individual is a powerful public health tool. While predicting risk has been successful in diseases which follow simple Mendelian inheritance, it has proven challenging in complex diseases for which a large number of loci contribute to the genetic variance. The large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms now available provide new opportunities for predicting genetic risk of complex diseases with high accuracy. Methodology/Principal Findings We have derived simple deterministic formulae to predict the accuracy of predicted genetic risk from population or case control studies using a genome-wide approach and assuming a dichotomous disease phenotype with an underlying continuous liability. We show that the prediction equations are special cases of the more general problem of predicting the accuracy of estimates of genetic values of a continuous phenotype. Our predictive equations are responsive to all parameters that affect accuracy and they are independent of allele frequency and effect distributions. Deterministic prediction errors when tested by simulation were generally small. The common link among the expressions for accuracy is that they are best summarized as the product of the ratio of number of phenotypic records per number of risk loci and the observed heritability. Conclusions/Significance This study advances the understanding of the relative power of case control and population studies of disease. The predictions represent an upper bound of accuracy which may be achievable with improved effect estimation methods. The formulae derived will help researchers determine an appropriate sample size to attain a certain accuracy when predicting genetic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2105329191,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) represent a unique immune cell type specialized in type I interferon (IFN) secretion in response to viral nucleic acids. The molecular control of PDC lineage specification has been poorly understood. We report that basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (E protein) E2-2/Tcf4 is preferentially expressed in murine and human PDCs. Constitutive or inducible deletion of murine E2-2 blocked the development of PDCs but not of other lineages and abolished IFN response to unmethylated DNA. Moreover, E2-2 haploinsufficiency in mice and in human Pitt-Hopkins syndrome patients was associated with aberrant expression profile and impaired IFN response of the PDC. E2-2 directly activated multiple PDC-enriched genes, including transcription factors involved in PDC development (SpiB, Irf8) and function (Irf7). These results identify E2-2 as a specific transcriptional regulator of the PDC lineage in mice and humans and reveal a key function of E proteins in the innate immune system."

To define the roles of Mre11 in both DNA bridging and nucleolytic processing during initiation of DSB repair, we combined small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and crystal structures of Pyrococcus furiosus Mre11 dimers bound to DNA with mutational analyses of fission yeast Mre11. The Mre11 dimer adopts a four-lobed U-shaped structure that is critical for proper MRN complex assembly and for binding and aligning DNA ends. Further, mutations blocking Mre11 endonuclease activity impair cell survival after DSB induction without compromising MRN complex assembly or Mre11-dependant recruitment of Ctp1, an HR factor, to DSBs. These results show how Mre11 dimerization and nuclease activities initiate repair of DSBs and collapsed replication forks, as well as provide a molecular foundation for understanding cancer-causing Mre11 mutations in ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD).

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic and genome-destabilizing DNA lesions. Mre11, the core subunit of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex (Mre11 complex or MRN), plays central roles in DSB detection and repair. The importance of the Mre11 complex has been established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where it is critical for survival of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and other genotoxins, as well as in humans, where hypomorphic mutations of MRE11 and NBS1 cause cancer-prone syndromes of ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), respectively (Chahwan et al., 2003Chahwan C.

As a DSB “first responder,” MRN recruits the ATM checkpoint kinase (yeast Tel1) (Lee and Paull, 2005Lee J.H. Paull T.T.

ATM initiates a signaling cascade leading to cell cycle arrest and checkpoint responses key to genome integrity in humans, as evident from severe cancer predisposition and IR-sensitive phenotypes of ATM null patients (Shiloh, 2003Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: Safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). However, Mre11 complex subunits are essential for organism and cell viability in mammals, whereas ATM is not, so ATM recruitment and activation is only one of the important Mre11 complex functions. One of the most interesting but least understood Mre11 complex activities is its DNA end-sensing and DNA synaptic functions. Atomic force (AFM) (Chen et al., 2001Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P.

EM and AFM indicate DNA-bound heterotetrameric Mre112Rad502 (M2R2) bridges dsDNA ends via two arrangements. Simultaneous DNA binding within one M2R2 DNA-binding head drives short-range bridging of DNA ends to within 100 Å of one another (Chen et al., 2001Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E.

Alternatively, reversible Zn2+-dependant Rad50 hook domain assembly erects two-headed octameric (M2R2)2 scaffolds to tether DNA chains up to 1200 Å apart (Moreno-Herrero et al., 2005Moreno-Herrero F. de Jager M.

Mesoscale conformational changes in the DNA-repair complex Rad50/Mre11/Nbs1 upon binding DNA.Nature. 2005; 437: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that the DNA-binding head bridges variable ends via the Mre11 protein, which interacts with ssDNA, dsDNA, and forked DNA structures (Trenz et al., 2006Trenz K. Smith E. Smith S. Costanzo V. ATM and ATR promote Mre11 dependent restart of collapsed replication forks and prevent accumulation of DNA breaks.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Wen et al., 2008Wen Q.

Cell. 2008; 19: 1693-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the basis for Mre11 complex DNA interactions is unknown because of an absence of high-resolution structures for any of the Mre11 complex components bound to DNA. Another key and poorly understood Mre11 complex function is its role in nucleolytic processing of DNA ends. Mre11 has both ssDNA endonuclease and 3′-5′ exonuclease activities when assayed in vitro but is paradoxically implicated in the 5′-3′ resection of DSBs in vivo (Williams et al., 2007Williams R.S. Williams J.S. Tainer J.A. Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 is a keystone complex connecting DNA repair machinery, double-strand break signaling, and the chromatin template.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This resection generates a 3′ ssDNA tail, which is critical for DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). Curiously, budding-yeast studies show that mutations ablating Mre11 nuclease activities without destabilizing the complex cause mild IR sensitivity yet have strong effects in meiosis and cleavage of hairpin structures. These findings led to a prevailing view that Mre11 nuclease activity is not needed for DSB repair except in situations involving blocked DNA ends or unusual DNA structures (Bressan et al., 1998Bressan D.A. Olivares H.A. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H.

Yet, structural and biochemical studies indicate that Mre11 is the core of the MRN complex DNA-binding and -processing head, participating in intermolecular interactions with itself, Rad50, Nbs1, and DNA substrates (Williams et al., 2007Williams R.S. Williams J.S. Tainer J.A. Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 is a keystone complex connecting DNA repair machinery, double-strand break signaling, and the chromatin template.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Here, we integrate crystallographic, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and biochemical analyses of archaeal Mre11-DNA complexes with genetics in S. pombe to dissect the basis for Mre11 homodimerization, Mre11-DNA interactions, short-range Mre11-complex DNA synapsis, and Mre11 nucleolytic mechanisms. Mre11-DNA complex structures allow the identification of single-site mutants that retain Mre11 fold and interactions but ablate either exonuclease activity or both endonuclease and exonuclease activities. Furthermore, phenotypic analyses of single-site mutants in fission yeast establish that Mre11 dimerization and endonuclease activities are required for survival of DSBs. In agreement with characterizations of an Mre11 nuclease-dead mouse cell line in an accompanying paper (Buis et al., 2008Buis J. Wu Y. Deng Y. Leddon J. Westfield G. Eckersdorff M. Sekiguchi J.M. Chang S. Ferguson D.O. Mre11 Nuclease activity has essential roles in DNA repair and genomic stability distinct from ATM activation.Cell. 2008; 135 (this issue): 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), these findings show Mre11 nuclease activity is critical for DSB repair in both fission yeast and mammals. Because DSBs are induced by ionizing radiation and form when DNA replication forks encounter lesions (Wyman and Kanaar, 2006Wyman C. Kanaar R. DNA double-strand break repair: All's well that ends well.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), they contain scission products with varied 5′ or 3′ overhanging ends or ssDNA-dsDNA junctions generated by replication fork collapse. We therefore crystallized and determined X-ray structures of the catalytically active phosphoesterase domains (comprising the nuclease and nuclease-capping domains, residues 1–342) of Pyrococcus furiosus Mre11 bound to two distinct DNA oligonucleotide targets (see the Experimental Procedures, Figure 1, and Figure S1 available online). The structures define two types of Mre11-DNA interactions: (1) a synaptic complex mimicking DNA end joining of products from a dsDNA scission event bearing a short 2 bp 3′ overhang (Figures 1A, 1C, and 1E) and (2) a branched DNA structure that might be encountered by Mre11 at a collapsed fork (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1F). Two approaches promoted stabilization of nuclease-DNA complexes. For the synaptic end complex, we used EDTA to chelate divalent cations from the Mre11 active site. For the branched DNA complex, we used an H85S-inactivating active-site mutation (characterized herein) that does not alter active-site Mn2+ binding, Mre11 stability, or macromolecular interactions. The synaptic end complex at 2.7 Å and branched complex at 2.2 Å resolution were phased by molecular replacement, fit to unbiased omit maps, and refined (Table S1). To characterize Mre11-DNA assembly interfaces, we examined crystal packing and noncrystallographic symmetry interactions in the DNA-bound crystal forms. Both structures reveal a conserved four-helix bundle Mre11-Mre11 homodimeric interface. This interface at a two-fold axis in the C-centered orthorhombic unit cell in the synaptic complex (Figure 1C) matched that at the interface between noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS)-related protomers in the branched DNA complex (Figure 1D). A related interface in the DNA-free Mre11 structure was assumed to reflect crystal packing (Hopfner et al., 2001Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Structural biochemistry and interaction architecture of the DNA double-strand break repair Mre11 nuclease and Rad50-ATPase.Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These two DNA-bound structures imply that this is the biologically relevant Mre11 dimer that interacts with diverse DNA substrates in vivo. The dimer interface between helicies αB and αC of the Mre11 nuclease domain buries ∼1400 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area with van der Waals packing between hydrophobic residues Leu61, Ile65, Pro92, Leu97, and Phe101 (Figure 2A). The four-helix-bundle periphery is reinforced by a Lys62 to Asp100 intermolecular salt bridge and capped near the basic DNA-binding cleft by Arg55 side-chain hydrogen bonding to an opposing Arg55 main-chain carbonyl across the two-fold (synaptic end complex), or pseudo-two-fold (branched complex) axis. Structure-based sequence alignments for human, yeast, and archaeal Mre11 homologs reveal that the high sequence identity among residues in this dimer interface is paralleled only by conservation within the five active-site nuclease phosphoesterase motifs (nuclease motifs I–V) and DNA-recognition loops (RL1–RL6) (Figure S1). The U-shaped Mre11 dimer enables two subunits to simultaneously contact the dsDNA portions of the DNA substrates (Figure 1, Figure 2). DNA makes extensive contacts to both N-terminal calcineurin-like nuclease domains and to a single C-terminal mixed α-β fold nuclease-capping domain (Figures 1A, 1B, and 2B–2E). Core DNA contacts in the two complexes are analogous, but not equivalent (Figures 2B and 2C). Six DNA-binding regions provide 17 residues for extensive DNA contacts in cis and in trans across the dimer. These six DNA-recognition loops (RL1–RL6) converge into a contiguous DNA interaction surface (Figures 2B–2D). DNA binding is mediated entirely by minor groove contacts to the sugar-phosphate backbone, explaining how Mre11 acts as a universal DNA-processing enzyme (Figure 2E). For the large protein surface area (1525 Å2) buried in the DNA interface, there is ∼2:1 (500:275 Å2 buried protein surface) distribution of DNA-binding contacts for each subunit (Figure 2E). Mre11 dimerization is therefore key to efficient DNA binding. Bound dsDNA is B form with key deviations in overall and local helical parameters. Structural overlays of the synaptic complex DNA with a B-DNA template and analyses of helical parameters show that phosphate backbone and nucleotide conformation for base pair positions distal from the nuclease motifs (A4:T15, A5:T14, G6:C13, and C7:G12 base pairs; Figure 2D) have idealized values. Conversely, the sugar phosphate backbone proximal to the active site (base pairs C3:G16, A2:T17, and C1:G18; Figure 2D) show a protein-induced ∼2 Å minor groove widening and helical axis distortion, coupled with a 10° bend toward the major groove. Salt bridging and van der Waals contacts from DNA-recognition loops RL1 (residues Lys18 and Pro19), RL4 (residue Lys111), RL5 (residue Trp150), and RL6 (residues Tyr325 and Lys327) engage the 5′ strand. The 3′ end direction is steered by contacts from loops RL2 (His52, Arg55, and Ser57), RL1 (Tyr13 and Glu14) and RL3 (Asn89). In concert, RL3 Arg90 and three RL1 residues (His17, Pro19, and Glu14) interrogate the DNA minor groove, forming a wedge that redirects and distorts the duplex backbone in the synaptic end and branching DNA complexes (Figure 2D). Recognition and sculpting of the structurally malleable fray of the duplex end provides a probable determinant of Mre11 DNA end recognition, DNA unwinding, 3′-5′ nuclease, and 5′-microhomology pairing Mre11 complex reaction activities. All core DNA-binding elements are conserved in human, Xenopus, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe Mre11 homologs except RL3 (Figure S1). Conserved Arg and Lys residues at the RL2 C-terminal end, which lies adjacent to RL3, may substitute for these contacts in eukaryotic Mre11. These small differences may reflect the differential functional requirements of eukaryotic enzymes, whose catalytic activities are modulated by Nbs1/Xrs2 (Lee et al., 2003Lee J.H. Ghirlando R.

The Mre11-DNA structures show how Mre11 dictates multiple DNA scaffolding functions. In the synaptic end complex, the 50 × 60 × 70 Å binding cleft houses two opposed DNA ends (Figures 1C and 1E). The DNA ends are tethered on a near parallel trajectory, with an offset of about one duplex width when viewed down the DNA helical axes. This linear bridging provides a molecular mechanism with which DNA ends can be tethered short distances (Chen et al., 2001Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E.

In the branched complex, the substrate ssDNA-dsDNA junction binds at the nuclease-capping domain interface, implicating the capping domain in ssDNA binding of branched DNA substrates (Figures 2C and 2F). Unlike the synaptic complex, the branched DNA binds asymmetrically across the dimer (Figure 1D). Capping domain movement occludes the second DNA-binding site in the crystal. The four-nucleotide 3′ ssDNA tail is diverted tangentially away from the dsDNA helical axis and makes nonspecific contacts to a positively charged surface formed by RL6 and capping domain helix αH (Figures 2C and 2F). Three conserved basic residues (Lys318, Arg332, and Lys327) bind the phosphate backbone of the 3′ end and, intriguingly, sculpt the last three 3′ nucleotides to adopt B form conformation (Figure 2F). We therefore propose that capping domain-DNA interactions can also participate in end-on dsDNA duplex binding such that the two interaction surfaces would simultaneously accommodate branched architectures of partially replicated collapsed replication forks. In combination, Mre11 dimer and capping domain-DNA interactions shown in the crystal structures appear suitable to dictate multiple DNA-tethering functions. To examine roles of Mre11 dimerization in DNA binding and catalysis by the Mre11 complex in solution, we assessed Mre11 shape and oligomeric state using analytical gel filtration and SAXS (Putnam et al., 2007Putnam C.D. Hammel M. Hura G.L. Tainer J.A. X-ray solution scattering (SAXS) combined with crystallography and computation: defining accurate macromolecular structures, conformations and assemblies in solution.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2007; 40: 191-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) (Figure 3 and Figure S2). Experimental scattering curves for WT-Mre11 compared to calculated scattering from monomeric or dimeric Mre11 model structures reveals a close correspondence to the dimeric model and a poor fit to the monomer profile (Figure 3E; Table S3). The calculated radius of gyration (Rg) derived from SAXS Guinier analysis (34.6 ± 0.02 Å), the apparent molecular weight from analytical gel filtration (∼74 kDa), and bimodal shape and maximum particle dimension (Dmax = 120 Å) found in the SAXS electron pair distribution function [P(r)] all agree with the bilobed Mre11 crystal structures (Figures 3A and 3C, Figure S2, and Table S2). Alignment of the dimeric crystal structure with averaged molecular envelopes from ab initio SAXS shape reconstruction further reveals the close agreement of the solution structures with the Mre11 crystallographic dimer assembly (Figure 3D). To test whether the four-helix bundle assembly mediates self-association, we introduced charged residue substitutions into the Mre11 hydrophobic dimer interface. Four closely associated conserved leucines are centered at the dimer core (Figure 3B). Mre11 harboring mutations of these leucines to charged residues (Mre11-L61K or Mre11-L97D) retain normal thermostability at 65°C but migrate as significantly smaller (∼36 kDa apparent molecular weight [MW]) protein species in gel filtration (Figure 3A; Table S2). SAXS analysis shows that Mre11-L61K and Mre11-L97D are converted to smaller forms with distinct skewed monomodal P(r) functions and significantly smaller Dmax values (∼85–90 Å) than wild-type Mre11 (Figures 3C). Although the gel-filtration analysis with proteins at ∼12.5 μM concentration shows effective disruption of stable Mre11 dimerization by mutation of the hydrophobic interface, SAXS solution scattering data for dimer mutants at high concentration (250 μM) is best fit with a mixed monomer/dimer equilibrium model (Figure S2 and Table S3). Thus, dimerization is mediated via a conserved hydrophobic four-helix bundle, and introduction of positive and negative charge into this interface disrupts the dimer. To probe the functional importance of dimerization, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis of DNA binding and measured nucleolytic activities of dimer variants. Wild-type Mre11 binds 40-mer ssDNA with high affinity (Kd = 170 nM) and has an ∼6.5-fold lower affinity for 40 bp dsDNA (Kd = 1.1 μM) (Figure 3F and Figure S3). In contrast, the monomeric Mre11-L61K and Mre11-L97D dimer mutants that lose approximately one-third of their total DNA contact surface show 30- to >50-fold decreased affinity for ssDNA, and a 3- to >10-fold decreased affinity for dsDNA. Mre11-L61K and Mre11-L97D retain high levels of ssDNA endonuclease activity (Figure 3G) and 3′-5′ dsDNA exonuclease activity (data not shown), suggesting that a high-affinity DNA interaction across the dimeric interface is not essential for efficient exo- and endonucleolytic catalysis. These results dissect Mre11 catalytic and architectural functions. Mre11 dimerization is not critical for catalysis but may enable architectural DNA-binding functions of MRN by promoting high-affinity DNA interactions. Specifically, our SAXS and X-ray crystal structures suggest that the Mre11 dimer characterized here is the core of the Mre11 complex DNA-binding head that recognizes diverse DNA structures and promotes short-range DNA synapsis. To test the structural implications of the DNA complexes for the Mre11 exonuclease polarity and dissect determinants of exo- and endonucleolytic catalysis, we examined the trajectories of the 3′ ends of the bound dsDNAs. In both Mre11-DNA complexes, the 3′ termini trace a path along the DNA-binding cleft toward the active site, consistent with reported 3′-5′ dsDNA exonuclease directionality and the orientation of 5′-dAMP nucleolytic product binding (Figures 1E and 1F) (Hopfner et al., 2001Hopfner K.P.

These structures support a three-step 3′-5′ nuclease mechanism (Figure 4A): (1) DNA binding, (2) duplex melting linked to capping domain rotation, and (3) phosphate rotation and nucleolysis driven by conserved nuclease motif II (His52) and motif III (His85) histidines. In the two complexes, DNA duplexes occupy similar but nonequivalent positions and registers in the binding cleft (Figure 4C). Structural overlays indicate DNA translocation is linked to capping domain rotation, reorientation of the Mre11 dimerization axis, and movement of the RL1 minor groove wedge (Figure 4C). Thus, after an initial DNA interaction, capping domain rotation and associated plastic deformations may drive duplex end melting. A relay of van der Waals contacts initiated by the capping domain and involving residues Phe16, Lys18, His17, Tyr301, and Tyr325 advances the RL1 wedge into the DNA minor groove (Figure 4C). The net result of these movements is an ∼2/3 base pair step helical translocation toward the active site and disruption of terminal base pairing interactions, as visualized for the synaptic complex DNA, where the wedge penetrates further into the minor groove (Figure 4D). Consistent with this model, a wedge component mutant (H17A) exhibits a 30%–35% reduction in 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, as monitored by release of the fluorescent adenine analog 2-aminopurine from the 3′ end of a preferred Mre11 blunt dsDNA exonuclease substrate (Figure 4B).

Here, we present the atomic structure of the Ca2+-sensing region of STIM1 consisting of the EF-hand and sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains (EF-SAM). The canonical EF-hand is paired with a previously unidentified EF-hand. Together, the EF-hand pair mediates mutually indispensable hydrophobic interactions between the EF-hand and SAM domains.

In mammalian cells, EF-SAM destabilization mutations within full-length STIM1 induce punctae formation and activate SOCE independent of luminal Ca2+. We provide atomic resolution insight into the molecular basis for STIM1-mediated SOCE initiation and show that the folded/unfolded state of the Ca2+-sensing region of STIM is crucial to SOCE regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2152642445,"Drosophila neural precursor cells divide asymmetrically by segregating the Numb protein into one of the two daughter cells. Numb is uniformly cortical in interphase but assumes a polarized localization in mitosis. Here, we show that a phosphorylation cascade triggered by the activation of Aurora-A is responsible for the asymmetric localization of Numb in mitosis. Aurora-A phosphorylates Par-6, a regulatory subunit of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). This activates aPKC, which initially phosphorylates Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl), a cytoskeletal protein that binds and inhibits aPKC during interphase. Phosphorylated Lgl is released from aPKC and thereby allows the PDZ domain protein Bazooka to enter the complex. This changes substrate specificity and allows aPKC to phosphorylate Numb and release the protein from one side of the cell cortex. Our data reveal a molecular mechanism for the asymmetric localization of Numb and show how cell polarity can be coupled to cell-cycle progression."

Surprisingly, these new data point towards a critical role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. A single common coding variant in the autophagy protein ATG16L1 predisposes individuals to the development of Crohn's disease: while ATG16L1 encoding threonine at amino acid position 300 (ATG16L1*300T) confers protection, ATG16L1 encoding for alanine instead of threonine (ATG16L1*300A, also known as T300A) mediates risk towards the development of Crohn's disease. Here we report that, in human epithelial cells, the Crohn's disease-associated ATG16L1 coding variant shows impairment in the capture of internalized Salmonella within autophagosomes.

Mre11 possesses DNA nuclease activities that are highly conserved in evolution but play unknown roles in mammals. To define the functions of Mre11, we engineered targeted mouse alleles that either abrogate nuclease activities or inactivate the entire MRN complex. Mre11 nuclease deficiency causes a striking array of phenotypes indistinguishable from the absence of MRN, including early embryonic lethality and dramatic genomic instability. We identify a crucial role for the nuclease activities in homology-directed double-strand-break repair and a contributing role in activating the ATR kinase. However, the nuclease activities are not required to activate ATM after DNA damage or telomere deprotection. Therefore, nucleolytic processing by Mre11 is an essential function of fundamental importance in DNA repair, distinct from MRN control of ATM signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2073075746,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are evolutionarily conserved in animals and plants, and play critical roles in the regulation of developmental gene expression. Here we show that the Arabidopsis Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunits CURLY LEAF (CLF), EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2 (EMF2) and FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) repress the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a central repressor of the floral transition in Arabidopsis and FLC relatives. In addition, CLF directly interacts with and mediates the deposition of repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) into FLC and FLC relatives, which suppresses active histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in these loci. Furthermore, we show that during vegetative development CLF and FIE strongly repress the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a key flowering-time integrator, and that CLF also directly interacts with and mediates the deposition of H3K27me3 into FT chromatin. Our results suggest that PRC2-like complexes containing CLF, EMF2 and FIE, directly interact with and deposit into FT, FLC and FLC relatives repressive trimethyl H3K27 leading to the suppression of active H3K4me3 in these loci, and thus repress the expression of these flowering genes. Given the central roles of FLC and FT in flowering-time regulation in Arabidopsis, these findings suggest that the CLF-containing PRC2-like complexes play a significant role in control of flowering in Arabidopsis."

Microtubules (MTs) and filamentous actin (F-actin) control diverse cellular functions, including cell shape, cell division, intracellular transport, adhesion, and movement. Increasing evidence suggests that intricate molecular interactions exist between these two seemingly distinct cytoskeletal networks (Goode et al., 2000Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Barnes G.

The coordination of cytoskeletal dynamics is particularly important for cell migration and adhesion, processes that are intrinsic and essential features of tissue morphogenesis and physiology. The complex, multistep process of directed cell migration requires integrated activities of cytoskeleton, membrane, and cell/extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions (Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996Lauffenburger D.A.

Recent studies have pointed to an importance of MTs and coordinated MT/actin dynamics in cell migration (Palazzo and Gundersen, 2002Palazzo A.F. Gundersen G.G.

It has long been known that MTs can be transported rearward in the lamellae of migrating cells, and this movement depends on actomyosin activity (Mikhailov and Gundersen, 1995Mikhailov A.V.

One possible role for such coordinated actin-MT dynamics might be in mediating specific spatiotemporal regulation of FA dynamics to polarize cellular movements. Previous studies have demonstrated that MTs can specifically target peripheral FAs and promote their turnover, perhaps through MT motor-mediated delivery of key disassembly factors (Kaverina et al., 1998Kaverina I.

Additional explorations reveal roles for FAK and dynamin in MT-induced FA turnover, suggestive of involvement of actin dynamics and endocytosis (Ezratty et al., 2005Ezratty E.J.

The molecular nature that underlies the potentially crucial coordination of MT-actin cytoskeletons at sites of focal adhesions in mammalian cells remains elusive, but accumulating evidence suggests that MT plus ends (+tips) and +tip-tracking proteins may mediate this cytoskeletal crosstalk (Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008Akhmanova A.

Although budding yeast lacks the major components of FAs, several tantalizing parallels exist between directed cell movement in mammalian cells and that which pulls and reorients the mitotic spindle along F-actin cables to its specific anchoring site within the yeast bud. In yeast, this intricate process requires an F-actin motor (Myo2) that binds to the adaptor protein Kar9, which in turn links indirectly to spindle MTs through the yeast homolog (Bim1) of the +tip protein EB1 (Kusch et al., 2003Kusch J.

Of the mammalian spectraplakins, ACF7/MACF1 (actin crosslinking family 7/microtubule and actin crosslinking factor 1) is expressed and localized in patterns that most closely resemble Drosophila spectraplakin. Although preimplantation lethality precludes in vivo analysis, visceral endoderm cells derived from cultured ACF7 null blastocysts reveal defects in the coordination of MT and actin cytoskeletons, accompanied by skewed cytoplasmic trajectories and altered dynamic instability of MTs. ACF7-deficient cells also fail to maintain cellular polarity in scratch-wounded cultures (Kodama et al., 2003Kodama A. Karakesisoglou I. Wong E. Vaezi A. Fuchs E. ACF7: An essential integrator of microtubule dynamics.Cell. 2003; 115: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the present report, we employ conditional gene targeting to ablate ACF7 expression in skin of mice. Our findings have uncovered key roles for ACF7 in wound healing and epidermal migration, which we trace to an ability of ACF7 to target MTs that preferentially track along F-actin to FAs. By uncoupling this connection, we show that it is essential for controlling FA assembly and dynamics. Surprisingly, however, we find that the MT, F-actin, and +tip protein binding capabilities of ACF7 are not sufficient to rescue all of the functions of wild-type (WT) ACF7. Subsequently, we've identified an ∼3000 residue central domain that bears sequence similarity to the Smc family of ATPases. We show that ACF7 can function as an ATPase, and, importantly, it behaves as an actin-regulated rather than MT- or calcium-regulated ATPase. Hitherto unrecognized in the spectraplakin family, this activity unveils important mechanistic insights into how spectraplakins evolved to function as unique macromolecular integrators that regulate dynamic actin-MT-mediated processes and how ACF7 in particular functions in establishing and maintaining proper cytoskeletal coordination during cell movement. We conditionally targeted ACF7 by inserting two loxP sites flanking exon 6 and exon 7 (Figure S1 available online), which reside within the conserved plakin domain common to all known isoforms of ACF7 and other spectraplakins (Bernier et al., 2000Bernier G.

Neonatal mice genotypic for K14-Cre and ACF7fl/fl alleles (conditional knockout, cKO) were born in the expected Mendelian numbers and grew to normal size as adults. Immunoblot analyses with an antibody specific for all known ACF7 isoforms confirmed the reduction of protein in heterozygous animal skin epidermis (K14-Cre: ACF7fl/+) and absence of ACF7 in cKO skin epidermis (Figure 1B). This was further verified by immunofluorescence, which documented the absence of ACF7 in epidermis and hair follicles (Figure 1C). Although the targeting could theoretically permit expression of a truncated N-terminal ACF7, immunoblot with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal sequence of ACF7 did not detect any low-molecular-weight protein product in KO keratinocyte lysate (Figure S2A), suggesting that the truncated protein was not expressed or unstable. Surprisingly, ACF7 cKO animals showed no gross morphological changes in skin or hair coat. Histologically, epidermal homeostasis appeared normal, and immunofluorescence with antibodies against β4 integrin (basal surface of the epidermis), keratin 5 (basal layer), keratin 10 (spinous layer), and loricrin (granular layer) all displayed localization patterns analogous to WT skin (Figure S2B). However, when challenged to respond to injury, ACF7 cKO skin exhibited a significant delay in repairing full-thickness wounds. Histological analysis and quantification revealed that the area of hyperproliferative epithelium (HE) that typically proliferates and migrates into the wound site was diminished by more than 30% over 2–4 days after injury. (Figures S2C and S2D, Figure 1D). Interestingly, despite the delay in wound closure, no significant decrease was found in proliferation or apoptosis, as judged by labeling for phospho-histone H3, Ki67, or activated caspase 3, respectively (Figures S2D and S2E and data not shown). Rather, the delayed wound response in ACF7-deficient skin seemed more likely to be rooted in alterations in cell migration, which we documented by culturing primary keratinocytes (1°MK) from cKO and littermate control skins and monitoring the polarized rate of cell migration during recovery of ∼500 μm scratches introduced into keratinocyte monolayers. Whereas WT 1°MK closed the gap within 36 hr, KO keratinocytes moved only ∼20% of this distance into the gap (Figures 1E and 1F). As expected from our in vivo data, growth curve experiments showed no significant difference between KO and WT cells (Figure 1F). Videomicroscopy permitted imaging and monitoring of the velocities and directed migration of individual keratinocytes. Assays of representative 1°MK highlighted the significantly slower movements of KO cells compared to their WT counterparts (Movie S1). Quantification of these movements revealed an ∼60% decrease in average speed on fibronectin (FN) (Figures 1G and 1H). In contrast, when kymography was used to record membrane dynamics (Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell migration: A physically integrated molecular process.Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar), no differences were detected in either duration of protrusion or protrusion rate (Figures S3A and S3B). To explore other possible mechanisms that might underlie ACF7 regulation of cell migration, we examined the contribution of cell/ECM adhesion to cell migration after ACF7 loss. To manipulate cell adhesive strength, we plated 1°MK onto dishes coated with FN at different concentrations (Gupton and Waterman-Storer, 2006Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Spatiotemporal feedback between actomyosin and focal-adhesion systems optimizes rapid cell migration.Cell. 2006; 125: 1361-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, Palecek et al., 1997Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Integrin-ligand binding properties govern cell migration speed through cell-substratum adhesiveness.Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) and then recorded cell migration by videomicroscopy. Interestingly, by simply reducing the amount of underlying matrix protein, we were able to largely equalize the marked differences in velocities displayed by KO versus WT cells (Figure 2A). These data suggested that ACF7 null 1°MK migrated aberrantly because they were defective in how they adhered to their underlying substratum. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed enhanced labeling of FAs in ACF7 null 1°MK relative to WT controls (Figure 2B). Notably, the robust FAs in cells lacking ACF7 were also closely associated with cables of F-actin (stress fibers). Quantification documented a substantial increase in both size and total fluorescence intensity of FAs in KO 1°MK. Figure 2C shows the quantifications for vinculin, a representative structural component of FAs. FA enlargement at the cell periphery is a sign of defects in FA dynamics, which are essential for cells to move (Berrier and Yamada, 2007Berrier A.L. Yamada K.M. Cell-matrix adhesion.J. Cell.

Cell migration: Integrating signals from front to back.Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar). To explore the nature of this defect in ACF7 null 1°MK, we began by employing confocal videomicroscopy to trace the behavior of individual FAs (Webb et al., 2004Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. FAK-Src signalling through paxillin, ERK and MLCK regulates adhesion disassembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). To monitor the process, we transfected cells with plasmids encoding either DsRed-Zyxin or GFP-Paxillin (Kodama et al., 2003Kodama A. Karakesisoglou I. Wong E. Vaezi A. Fuchs E. ACF7: An essential integrator of microtubule dynamics.Cell. 2003; 115: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, Schober et al., 2007Schober M. Raghavan S. Nikolova M. Polak L. Pasolli H.A. Beggs H.E. Reichardt L.F. Fuchs E. Focal adhesion kinase modulates tension signaling to control actin and focal adhesion dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Examples of the perturbations in FA dynamics arising from ACF7 deficiency are shown in complete form in Movie S2, and in montages are shown in Figure 3A. Most strikingly, in a 120 min interval of observation, FAs in KO cells were often static, whereas the majority of FAs in WT keratinocytes underwent continual bouts of formation, maturation, and disassembly. Quantifications of the kinetics of hundreds of individual FAs revealed a significant and marked decrease in both the assembly and disassembly rates of FAs in KO cells (Figure 3B). This was interesting, as FAK KO keratinocytes display defects in disassembly but not assembly rates (Schober et al., 2007Schober M. Raghavan S. Nikolova M. Polak L. Pasolli H.A. Beggs H.E. Reichardt L.F. Fuchs E. Focal adhesion kinase modulates tension signaling to control actin and focal adhesion dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The defects in FA dynamics were further substantiated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (Figure 3C). By comparing GFP-Paxillin (Pxn)-transfected 1°MK, we found that ACF7 deficiency resulted in a strong decrease in the fraction of mobile protein and a significant increase in half-times of fluorescence recovery after bleaching (Figure 3D). Together, these data provide compelling evidence that FAs are more stable in the absence of ACF7, suggesting that ACF7 regulates cell migration at least in part by promoting FA dynamics. Rho GTPases and their control of actomyosin activity are known to play a pivotal role in regulating FA dynamics and cell migration (Jaffe and Hall, 2005Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Rho GTPases: Biochemistry and biology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). However, biochemical pull-down assays revealed comparable overall levels of the GTP-bound state of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in WT and ACF7 KO cells (Figures 3E and 3F). Similarly, no significant differences were detected in myosin light chain Ser19 phosphorylation, which correlates with myosin contraction activity (Figures S4A and S4B). FA turnover typically involves a signaling pathway centering on FAK and Src tyrosine kinases, which are activated upon integrin-ECM engagement (Guan, 1997Guan J.L. Focal adhesion kinase in integrin signaling.Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Mitra et al., 2005Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Focal adhesion kinase: In command and control of cell motility.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). However, ACF7 null 1°MK exhibited no obvious change in either total FAK or Y397 phosphorylated (active) FAK (Guan, 1997Guan J.L. Focal adhesion kinase in integrin signaling.Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Parsons, 2003Parsons J.T. Focal adhesion kinase: The first ten years.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) (Figure 3G). Moreover, irrespective of ACF7 status, Y397 phosphorylation was abolished when cells were placed in suspension, suggesting that the dependency of activated integrins for FAK activity was not perturbed by loss of ACF7 function. Consistent with this notion, Src activity was unchanged as determined by phosphorylation levels of Y418 Src (Figure 3G). In suspension, WT and KO cells displayed similar decreases in Src activity. These findings were in good agreement with our kinetic studies and provided additional evidence that the impaired FA dynamics caused by ACF7 deficiency cannot be explained by alterations in the overall activity of Rho GTPases or FAK/Src signaling. Given the absence of changes in Rho/FAK/Src activities in ACF7-null 1°MK and increasing evidence that MT targeting is involved in FA turnover (Kaverina et al., 1999Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. Microtubule targeting of substrate contacts promotes their relaxation and dissociation.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, Rodriguez et al., 2003Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Conserved microtubule-actin interactions in cell movement and morphogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), we turned to the possibility that coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics and/or targeting of MT to FAs might be responsible for the defects in FA dynamics caused by loss-of-function mutations in ACF7. Interestingly, treatment of nocodazole, a MT-depolymerizing drug, dramatically reduced the rate of FA turnover in WT 1°MK to a similar level as in untreated KO cells. On the contrary, the same treatment did not further inhibit FA turnover in KO keratinocytes, despite their comparable sensitivity to the drug and comparable overall levels of polymerized tubulin (Figure 3H, Figure S5). These data suggested that ACF7's effect on FA disassembly in epidermal cells is mediated by polymerized MT networks. Immunofluorescence microscopy unveiled additional defects in KO MT networks. In contrast to WT keratinocytes, where MTs bundles projected radially toward the cell periphery and paralleled the organization of actin stress fibers, MTs in ACF7 null keratinocytes were often curled and bent and no longer coaligned with actin cables (Figure 4A). Although the curly, bent behavior of MTs was remarkably similar to that observed in ACF7 null endodermal cells (Kodama et al., 2003Kodama A. Karakesisoglou I. Wong E. Vaezi A. Fuchs E. ACF7: An essential integrator of microtubule dynamics.Cell. 2003; 115: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the robust network of stress fibers and FAs in keratinocytes accentuated the extent to which coordination between actin and MT networks was disrupted in the absence of ACF7. The prominent actin-FA network in keratinocytes led us to discover a striking and important perturbation in MT dynamics that had not been noted previously, namely that the MT ends that normally converge at peripheral FAs were missing in ACF7 null cells (Figure 4B). Since ACF7 localized to these sites in WT keratinocytes (Figure 4B), we tested whether ACF7 might physically interact with +tip proteins, as has been found for two other spectraplakins (Kakapo and BPAG1) (Slep et al., 2005Slep K.C.

Proper transmission of genetic material is essential for the viability of all organisms. Nucleic acid replication and segregation must be precisely coordinated to ensure accurate genome inheritance. Eubacterial chromosomes contain a single origin of replication (oriC) that is recognized by the initiator protein DnaA. DnaA bound at oriC forms a homo-oligomer that mediates open complex formation and allows assembly of an initiation complex that loads the replicative helicase. Production of the initiation complex is followed by recruitment of the remaining replisome components, leading to replication of the bacterial chromosome (Kornberg and Baker, 1992Kornberg A.

However, in spite of being the focus of study for several decades, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the activities of bacterial chromosomal partitioning genes are poorly understood.

The ATP-bound dimer binds cooperatively to nonspecific DNA and contains ATP-hydrolysis activity (Hester and Lutkenhaus, 2007Hester C.M. Lutkenhaus J.

Spiegelman G.B. Soj antagonizes Spo0A activation of transcription in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis by Soj leads to dissociation from DNA and resets the cycle. We have investigated the activities of B. subtilis Soj in vivo by studying the effects of three mutations that alter the functions of Soj proteins in vitro. These mutations inhibit specific activities of Soj (ATP binding, cooperative DNA binding, or ATP hydrolysis) and lead to accumulation of different protein intermediates. We find that the Soj variants have distinct intracellular localization patterns and that they differentially regulate initiation of DNA replication. Both Soj localization and regulation of DNA replication initiation require the DNA replication initiator protein DnaA. Additionally, we show that Soj regulates sporulation by activating the DNA replication initiation checkpoint protein Sda. Previous work describing the localization of wild-type Soj suggested that the protein either (1) localized mostly to cell poles or (2) localized dynamically to a subset of nucleoids within the cell (Marston and Errington, 1999Marston A.L.

Control of development by altered localization of a transcription factor in B. subtilis.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 665-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To reconcile the differences between these observations, soj was replaced with gfp-soj (expressed from its native transcriptional and translational expression system at its endogenous location in the chromosome) and GFP-Soj localization was determined using epifluorescence microscopy. In this strain, GFP-Soj was observed to localize to septa (Figure 1A, arrows) and as relatively faint punctate foci within the cytoplasm (Figure 1A, asterisks) (similar results were obtained with a Soj-GFP fusion; data not shown). The localization pattern of GFP-Soj was dependent on Spo0J, and in a Δspo0J mutant GFP-Soj colocalized with the nucleoid as previously shown (Figure 1B) (Marston and Errington, 1999Marston A.L.

Control of development by altered localization of a transcription factor in B. subtilis.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 665-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The differences in the localization patterns reported for Soj could be due to the expression level of the GFP fusion. To test this the gfp-soj chimera was placed at an ectopic locus under the control of an inducible expression system (Figure S1A available online). At low expression levels GFP-Soj was observed to localize to septa and as foci within the cytoplasm. However, at higher expression levels the protein formed bright patches that colocalized with a subset of nucleoids similar to patterns previously reported. Thus, the localization of GFP-Soj depends on its expression level and the correct pattern is probably that observed at low expression levels. For the remainder of this work (unless noted) all soj alleles and fusions were expressed under native control (western blot analysis showed that all Soj proteins were expressed to approximately the same level as wild-type Soj; Figure S2). To begin exploring the consequences of conformational changes in Soj, the subcellular distributions of various Soj mutants were compared with that of the wild-type. (N.B., for B. subtilis: SojK16A = ATP binding deficient, cooperative DNA binding deficient; SojG12V = ATP binding proficient, cooperative DNA binding deficient; SojD40A = ATP2-bound dimer, cooperative DNA binding proficient, ATP hydrolysis deficient (see Figure 6). These biochemical properties were reported for the T. thermophilus Soj mutant proteins (Leonard et al., 2005Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Lowe J. Bacterial chromosome segregation: structure and DNA binding of the Soj dimer–a conserved biological switch.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and have been confirmed for the corresponding B. subtilis mutant proteins (B. McLeod and G. Spiegelman, personal communication; H. Ferreira and J.E., unpublished). The GFP-SojK16A mutant was predominantly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, although some faint foci could be discerned (Figure 1C). This pattern was unchanged in the absence of spo0J (Figure 1D). In contrast, the GFP-SojD40A mutant localized exclusively as bright foci within the cell (Figure 1G), with no hint of polar fluorescence. This pattern was reminiscent of the localization of Spo0J, which associates with sites near oriC (Glaser et al., 1997Glaser P. Sharpe M.E. Raether B. Perego M. Ohlsen K. Errington J. Dynamic, mitotic-like behaviour of a bacterial protein required for accurate chromosome partitioning.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Lin et al., 1997Lin D.C.-H. Levin P.A. Grossman A.D. Bipolar localization of a chromosome partition protein in Bacillus subtilis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 4721-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To test whether these foci had a basis in interaction with Spo0J, we constructed a strain to look simultaneously at SojD40A (fused to YFP) and Spo0J (fused to CFP). As shown in Figure 2A, almost complete colocalization was observed. This strongly suggested that SojD40A interacts with Spo0J. Such an interaction would be consistent with in vitro data showing that Spo0J stimulates the ATP-hydrolysis activity of the Soj dimer (Leonard et al., 2005Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Lowe J. Bacterial chromosome segregation: structure and DNA binding of the Soj dimer–a conserved biological switch.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To further test this idea, we examined the localization of GFP-SojD40A in the absence of Spo0J. Now, GFP-SojD40A localized in a dispersed nucleoid associated pattern, similar to that of wild-type GFP-Soj in the absence of Spo0J (Figure 1H). We interpret this to indicate that the ATP-dimer form of Soj (in which state SojD40A is thought to be trapped) binds to DNA in a manner that is relatively nonspecific in the absence of Spo0J but that is strongly influenced by Spo0J when present. Finally, we examined the distribution of the GFP-SojG12V mutant. This protein localized at septa and formed faint foci within the cell (Figure 1E). Remarkably, however, this pattern was unchanged in the absence of Spo0J (Figure 1F). Therefore, these foci are different from those of GFP-SojD40A, even though their frequency and localization strongly suggested an association with the oriC region of the chromosome. To determine if GFP-SojG12V foci were localized near oriC, we constructed an additional strain harboring an array of tetO operators near oriC that can be visualized using a red fluorescent TetR reporter protein (TetR-mCherry). As shown in Figure 2B, all GFP-SojG12V foci colocalized with the oriC region of the chromosome. The septal bands formed by GFP-SojG12V have previously been shown to depend on the cell-division inhibitor MinD (Autret and Errington, 2003Autret S. Errington J. A role for division-site-selection protein MinD in regulation of internucleoid jumping of Soj (ParA) protein in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As for wild-type GFP-Soj, the polar localization was also dependent on MinD and in ΔminD mutants GFP-Soj was observed throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 2C). Septal localization of GFP-Soj was not affected in a ΔminC mutant (Figure 2C). Since both ΔminC and ΔminD mutants form minicells, loss of GFP-Soj septal localization was specific to the ΔminD mutant. Furthermore, it appeared that GFP-Soj was enriched at septa in a ΔminC mutant, suggesting that MinC and Soj might compete for binding with MinD. GFP-Soj did associate with the nucleoid in a ΔminD Δspo0J double mutant (data not shown), indicating that Spo0J remains competent to inhibit Soj DNA binding in the absence of MinD. To place the SojG12V mutant protein within the Soj activity pathway we determined the localization of double mutants that inhibited either ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis of the GFP-SojG12V mutant protein. As shown in Figure S4A, the GFP-Soj(G12V,K16A) mutant protein was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the GFP-Soj(G12V,D40A) mutant protein remained localized as foci and at septa. These results are consistent with the SojG12V mutant protein being bound by ATP, placing it between the SojK16A mutant (nucleotide free) and the SojD40A mutant (DNA-binding-proficient ATP-bound dimer). We conclude that SojG12V associates with septa and also with a factor or site located in or near oriC, but that it is not capable of cooperatively binding to the nucleoid and that it has little or no association with Spo0J. soj null mutants do not have an obvious cellular phenotype (Ireton et al., 1994Ireton K. Gunther N.W.I. Grossman A.D. spo0J is required for normal chromosome segregation as well as the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5320-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and fluorescence microscopy on sojK16A and sojD40A mutants revealed that growth, division, and chromosome segregation were within normal limits (Table S1). It was surprising, then, that the sojG12V mutant displayed a strikingly abnormal phenotype with a high frequency of cells lacking DNA (2.6% compared to <0.1% for wild-type; Figure S3 and Table S1). To address the basis for the sojG12V defect we examined the replication and segregation of the oriC region marked with an array of tetO operators to which a fluorescent TetR reporter protein (TetR-YFP) binds (Lau et al., 2003Lau I.F. Filipe S.R. Soballe B. Okstad O.A. Barre F.X. Sherratt D.J. Spatial and temporal organization of replicating Escherichia coli chromosomes.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 731-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Strains were grown in a medium supporting a relatively slow growth rate, and samples were taken to determine the number of TetR-YFP foci per cell. Cell membranes were stained with the fluorescent dye Nile Red to distinguish individual cells (Figure 3A). In the wild-type strain a majority of cells contained two foci (Figure 3Bi). A minority of cells contained more than two foci (13% with three foci, 7% with four foci), and only 7% contained a single focus. The Δsoj and sojK16A mutant distributions were similar to those of the wild-type strain (Figures 3Bii and 3Biii). In contrast, the sojD40A mutant had more foci per cell (Figure 3Bv), while the sojG12V mutant had fewer foci per cell (Figure 3Biv). The sojG12V mutant also produced cells that lacked a TetR-YFP focus, consistent with our finding of cells lacking DNA (Figure S3). The effects of these soj alleles on origin copy number was then tested for dependence on spo0J. For wild-type Soj the number of foci per cell was greatly increased in the Δspo0J mutant, consistent with a previous report (Figures 3Bi and 3Bvi; Lee et al., 2003Lee P.S. Lin D.C.-H. Moriya S. Grossman A.D. Effects of the chromosome partitioning protein Spo0J (ParB) on oriC positioning and replication initiation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Deletion of spo0J appeared to exacerbate the phenotypes of the sojG12V and sojD40A mutants causing a further decrease or increase in the number of foci per cell, respectively (Figures 3Biv, 3Bv, 3Bix, and 3Bx and Table S1). These results indicate that Spo0J strongly regulates the activity of wild-type Soj, but that it has only minor effects on the activity of the sojG12V and sojD40A mutant proteins. To test more directly and unambiguously for effects on origin copy number, DNA sites near the origin and terminus of replication were measured by quantitative PCR. This marker frequency analysis supported the idea of early initiation of DNA replication in the sojD40A mutant and in the Δspo0J mutant (Figure 3C; Lee et al., 2003Lee P.S. Lin D.C.-H. Moriya S. Grossman A.D. Effects of the chromosome partitioning protein Spo0J (ParB) on oriC positioning and replication initiation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Appreciable premature initiation was also observed in the Δsoj mutant and in the Δsoj Δspo0J double mutant, although to a lesser degree than for the sojD40A or Δspo0J mutants (Figure 3C). In contrast, the sojG12V and sojK16A mutants exhibited a significant decrease in origin copy number compared to the Δsoj mutant (Figure 3C), consistent with inhibition of DNA replication initiation (similar to wild-type) and in accordance with flow cytometry data (Ogura et al., 2003Ogura Y. Ogasawara N. Harry E.J. Moriya S. Increasing the ratio of Soj to Spo0J promotes replication initiation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was surprising that different Soj mutant proteins had opposing activities on the rate of DNA replication initiation. To examine whether wild-type Soj could act as both a repressor and an activator of DNA replication initiation, we titrated Soj levels in cells with an inducible expression system. Compared to the control strain, at low expression levels of Soj there was a decrease in the origin copy number (Figure S1B). However, further induction of Soj reversed this effect and dramatically increased the origin copy number (Figure S1B), consistent with a previous report (Ogura et al., 2003Ogura Y. Ogasawara N. Harry E.J. Moriya S. Increasing the ratio of Soj to Spo0J promotes replication initiation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, wild-type Soj appears to be capable of either negative or positive regulation of DNA replication initiation. If the SojG12V and SojK16A mutant proteins are negative regulators of DNA replication initiation, overproduction of these proteins should cause a more severe inhibition of replication. Examination of cells overexpressing these proteins lent support to this idea (similar results were obtained with SojG12V and K16A; only those of the former mutant are shown). As shown in Figure 4A, without SojG12V overexpression"
https://openalex.org/W2130399516,"In mammalian cells, abnormal proteins that escape proteasome-dependent degradation form small aggregates that can be transported into a centrosome-associated structure, called an aggresome. Here we demonstrate that in yeast a single aggregate formed by the huntingtin exon 1 with an expanded polyglutamine domain (103QP) represents a bona fide aggresome that colocalizes with the spindle pole body (the yeast centrosome) in a microtubule-dependent fashion. Since a polypeptide lacking the proline-rich region (P-region) of huntingtin (103Q) cannot form aggresomes, this domain serves as an aggresome-targeting signal. Coexpression of 103Q with 25QP, a soluble polypeptide that also carries the P-region, led to the recruitment of 103Q to the aggresome via formation of hetero-oligomers, indicating the aggresome targeting in trans. To identify additional factors involved in aggresome formation and targeting, we purified 103QP aggresomes and 103Q aggregates and identified the associated proteins using mass spectrometry. Among the aggresome-associated proteins we identified, Cdc48 (VCP/p97) and its cofactors, Ufd1 and Nlp4, were shown genetically to be essential for aggresome formation. The 14-3-3 protein, Bmh1, was also found to be critical for aggresome targeting. Its interaction with the huntingtin fragment and its role in aggresome formation required the huntingtin N-terminal N17 domain, adjacent to the polyQ domain. Accordingly, the huntingtin N17 domain, along with the P-region, plays a role in aggresome targeting. We also present direct genetic evidence for the protective role of aggresomes by demonstrating genetically that aggresome targeting of polyglutamine polypeptides relieves their toxicity."

Retrograde flow in both lamellipodia and lamella is required for membrane protrusion and for force generation by coupling to cell adhesion. We report that the Rac/Cdc42-binding kinase MRCK and myosin II-related MYO18A linked by the adaptor protein LRAP35a form a functional tripartite complex, which is responsible for the assembly of lamellar actomyosin bundles and of a subnuclear actomyosin network. LRAP35a binds independently to MYO18A and MRCK. This binding leads to MRCK activation and its phosphorylation of MYO18A, independently of ROK and MLCK. The MRCK complex moves in concert with the retrograde flow of actomyosin bundles, with MRCK being able to influence other flow components such as MYO2A. The promotion of persistent protrusive activity and inhibition of cell motility by the respective expression of wild-type and dominant-negative mutant components of the MRCK complex show it to be crucial to cell protrusion and migration.

The promotion of persistent protrusive activity and inhibition of cell motility by the respective expression of wild-type and dominant-negative mutant components of the MRCK complex show it to be crucial to cell protrusion and migration. Cell movement involves a cycle of steps executed in different cellular zones, including membrane protrusion in the forms of lamellipodia and filopodia at the leading edge, formation of adhesions at the leading edge and their disruption at the cell body and rear zones, and finally generation of contractile force in the lamella and the accompanying cell rear retraction that result in cell body translocation (Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell migration: a physical integrated molecular process.Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton and myosin motor proteins play pivotal roles in these processes, which require precise spatial and temporal coordination (Gupton and Waterman-Storer, 2006Gupton S.L.

Formation of the lamellipodia and filopodia is promoted by Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 that activate actin filament nucleation factor Arp2/3 through their respective effector proteins (Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Cell migration: Rho GTPases lead the way.Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). The specific inactivation of the actin filament depolymerizing factor cofilin by LIM-kinase, downstream of Rho GTPase effector kinases (PAK, ROK, and MRCK), is also important in these events (Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Cell migration: Rho GTPases lead the way.Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, Sumi et al., 2001Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Shibuya A. Nakamura T.

PAK regulation on cofilin has also been shown to coordinate actin dynamics in the lamellipodium and lamella (Delorme et al., 2007Delorme V. Machacek M. DerMardirossian C. Anderson K.L. Wittmann T.

Cell. 2007; 13: 646-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Turnover of focal adhesion complexes at the cell front is regulated by Rac via PAK and its complex partners PIX and GIT (Zhao et al., 2000Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Coupling of PAK-interacting exchange factor PIX to GIT1 promotes focal complex disassembly.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). RhoA and effector ROK, which regulate stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, are also required for cell body contraction in cell movement (Kolega, 2003Kolega J.

Cell. 2003; 14: 4745-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RhoA activity also plays a part in cell protrusion (Pertz et al., 2006Pertz O. Hodgson L. Klemke R.L. Hahn K.M. Spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activity in migrating cells.Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) involving another Rho effector, mDia (Yamana et al., 2006Yamana N.

The nonmuscle myosin II (MYO2) component of the ubiquitous bipolar actin-based motor protein is important for diverse activities including cell migration (Mitchison and Cramer, 1996Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Actin-based cell motility and cell locomotion.Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar) and cytokinesis (Straight et al., 2003Straight A.F.

Dissecting temporal and spatial control of cytokinesis with a myosin II inhibitor.Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). MYO2 activity is determined by the phosphorylation state of the associated regulatory myosin light chain (RMLC), whose kinases include ROK and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK regulates MYO2-mediated periodic lamellipodial contraction (Giannone et al., 2004Giannone G. Dubin-Thaler B.J. Döbereiner H. Kieffer N. Bresnick A.R. Sheetz M.P. Periodic lamellipodial contractions correlate with rearward actin waves.Cell. 2004; 116: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) at the cell periphery where MYO2A is localized (Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2007Vicente-Manzanares M. Zareno J. Whitmore L. Choi C.K. Horwitz A.F. Regulation of protrusion, adhesion dynamics, and polarity by myosins IIA and IIB in migrating cells.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar); MYO2A is also the major isoform generating contractile force, activating F-actin retrograde flow in the lamella (Cai et al., 2006Cai Y.

ROK activity is required for both tail retraction and MYO2 activity in the cell center where MYO2B is predominant (Kolega, 2003Kolega J.

The distinct and overlapping cellular distributions of MYO2A and MYO2B perhaps reflect their ability to perform unique as well as shared functions during cell movement. There is another related myosin, Myosin 18A/MysPDZ (MYO18A), that binds actin (Mori et al., 2005Mori K. Matsuda K. Furusawa T. Kawata M. Inoue T. Obinata M.

Myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) is implicated in the regulation of myosin activity underlying cell protrusion and neurite outgrowth (Leung et al., 1998Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase acts as a Cdc42 effector in promoting cytoskeletal reorganization.Mol. Cell.

In invasive colorectal carcinoma cells, Cdc42-MRCK and Rho-ROK signaling cooperatively regulate the contractility required for movement (Wilkinson et al., 2005Wilkinson S. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Cdc42-MRCK and Rho-ROCK signalling cooperate in myosin phosphorylation and cell invasion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). MRCK also promotes nuclear rotation and reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in migrating cells through the activation of F-actin retrograde flow (Gomes et al., 2005Gomes E.R. Jani S. Gundersen G.G.

All these observations support a role for MRCK in modulating actomyosin activity linked to cell protrusion. In exploring the molecular mechanism of MRCK regulation, we have found that MRCK, a leucine-rich adaptor protein LRAP35a, and MYO18A form a tripartite complex that colocalizes extensively with lamellar actomyosin filaments. Biochemical and cellular studies show that LRAP35a activates MRCK and targets it to actomyosin through its interaction with MYO18A, leading to RMLC phosphorylation and MYO2A-dependent actomyosin assembly in the lamella. We also show the MRCK complex to play a role in cell protrusion and migration. We first set out to identify, by immunoprecipitating endogenous MRCKα and β from rat brain extracts followed by in vitro phosphorylation reactions with γ32P-ATP, phosphorylation substrates that form stable interactions with MRCK. Multiple phosphorylated bands at around 35 kDa (p35) and a weaker band at approximately 28 kDa (p28) were present in immunoprecipitates of both MRCKα and β isoforms (Figure 1A). When the immunocomplex was analyzed by 2D PAGE (Figure 1B), the 35 kDa bands appeared as multiple spots with pI < 5. Mass spectrometry analysis of seven tryptic peptides from three spots matched the sequence of an uncharacterized protein in the database with 239 amino acid residues and pI of 4.6 with no recognizable domain except for two stretches of leucine repeats arranged in tandem and a putative PDZ-interacting motif at the C terminus (Figure 1C). The terminal residues of Thr-Phe-Leu form the type 1 PDZ-binding motif with the characteristic sequence Ser/Thr-x-Φ-COOH (x is any amino acid, Φ a hydrophobic residue) (Songyang et al., 1997Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Recognition of unique carboxyl-terminal motifs by distinct PDZ domains.Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). We termed the protein LRAP35a for leucine repeat adaptor protein 35a to distinguish it from the closely related LRAP35b, also previously uncharacterized. Database searches show that the genes encoding LRAP35a and LRAP35b isoforms are only found in vertebrates. Both isoforms are not MRCK substrates (Figure S1 available online); their phosphorylation and appearance as multiple bands on gels probably result from the activity of other coimmunoprecipitated protein kinases. Next, we confirmed the interaction between MRCK and LRAP35a. HA-tagged LRAP35a was found to coimmunoprecipitate with both FLAG-tagged MRCKα and MRCKβ but not with FLAG-ROKα (Figure 2A). Further, MRCKα and β from rat brain lysates coimmunoprecipitated with LRAP35a (Figure 2B). To determine the MRCKα region interacting with LRAP35a, overlapping fragments of MRCKα (Figure 2C) fused to a FLAG or glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag were used to coimmunoprecipitate HA-LRAP35a coexpressed in COS7 cells. The LRAP35a interaction site was mapped to the N-terminal half of KIM, the kinase inhibitory motif of MRCKα (Figure 2D). KIM is an intramolecular negative autoregulatory domain that inhibits MRCK kinase activity by binding the catalytic domain (Tan et al., 2001Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34156-34164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). LRAP35a interaction with KIM led to abolition of the negative autoregulation and resultant MRCK activation, MRCK coimmunoprecipitated with HA-LRAP35a being more active than when immunoprecipitated without HA-LRAP35a (Figure 2E). Our results show that MRCK and LRAP35a can form a complex in vivo, with the LRAP35a-KIM interaction resulting in MRCK activation. To determine the MRCK-interacting site in LRAP35a, overlapping fragments of LRAP35a (Figure 3A) fused to GST were used to pull down the coexpressed KIM-containing MRCK fragment. We found the leucine repeat 1 (LR1) of LRAP35a sufficient for MRCK interaction (Figure 3B). As LRAP35a was a predicted adaptor, we sought to identify interacting proteins other than MRCK. FLAG-tagged LRAP35a from COS7 and HeLa lysates was immunoprecipitated using FLAG antibodies. The immunocomplex contained several major bands (Figure 3C). In addition to MRCK, mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of MYO18A with a conventional PDZ domain (Figures 3C and S2) (Mori et al., 2005Mori K. Matsuda K. Furusawa T. Kawata M. Inoue T. Obinata M. Subcellular localization and dynamics of MysPDZ (Myo18A) in live mammalian cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GST-pulldown assays showed that the MYO18A-PDZ domain interacted with the LRAP35a containing the C-terminal putative PDZ-interacting domain, but not with mutant LRAP35aΔTFL missing the last three amino acids (Figure 3D). The requirement for the C-terminal residues conforms to a typical PDZ interaction (Songyang et al., 1997Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Recognition of unique carboxyl-terminal motifs by distinct PDZ domains.Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Accordingly, no interaction was observed with the related LRAP35b with a different C-terminal sequence (Figure 3D). Since the LRAP35a interacting sites for MRCK and MYO18A were separate, we next investigated whether the three proteins could associate to form a tripartite complex. We first immunoprecipitated FLAG-MRCKα/HA-LRAP35a (wild-type or LRAP35aΔTFL) complexes coexpressed in COS7 cells using FLAG antibodies, then incubated the immunoprecipitates with COS7 lysates containing HA-MYO18A, and finally determined their association through a second coimmunoprecipitation. MYO18A was only detected in eluates from the MRCK/LRAP35a complex, but not from the MRCK/LRAP35aΔTFL complex (Figure 3E). Importantly, endogenous MYO18A and LRAP35a were enriched in MRCK complexes immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysates (Figure 3F). These results show that the three proteins can form a tripartite complex, LRAP35a serving as an adaptor to connect MRCK with MYO18A. MRCK regulates RMLC phosphorylation in vivo (Wilkinson et al., 2005Wilkinson S. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Cdc42-MRCK and Rho-ROCK signalling cooperate in myosin phosphorylation and cell invasion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), but how it coordinates with the other two important RMLC kinases, ROK and MLCK, in the overall regulation of myosin II is obscure. Possibly, their particular activity is specified through their intracellular localization, as exemplified by targeting of MLCK and ROK, respectively, to the cell periphery (Giannone et al., 2004Giannone G. Dubin-Thaler B.J. Döbereiner H. Kieffer N. Bresnick A.R. Sheetz M.P. Periodic lamellipodial contractions correlate with rearward actin waves.Cell. 2004; 116: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and to stress fibers (Katoh et al., 2001Katoh K. Kano Y. Amano M. Onishi H. Kaibuchi K. Fujiwara K. Rho-kinase-mediated contraction of isolated stress fibers.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Using a monoclonal anti-MRCKα antibody, we found endogenous MRCKα to mainly localize to two specific networks, in the lamella and cell center, colocalizing preferentially with discrete populations of RMLC phosphorylated on Ser19 (pRMLC) and actin filaments (Figures 4A and 6D). Similar localizations were observed for exogenous MRCKα expressed in HeLa cells (Figure 5B). MRCK colocalized predominantly with the fine actomyosin filaments in the lamellar arc-like structures and with the subnuclear actin bundles at the cell center (Figure 4A); little colocalization was observed with stress fiber bundles spanning the cell body. To determine the spatial role of MRCK, we examined the organization of actomyosin filaments in MRCK-depleted cells. MRCK knockdown, using two separate sets of siRNAs specific for α and β isoforms (Figure 4B), resulted in loss of the actomyosin networks in the lamellar and subnuclear region (Figures 4A and S3). An increase in Rho/ROK-mediated stress fibers was consistently observed (Figures 4A and S3). This defect can be readily rescued by introducing siRNA-resistant wild-type but not kinase-dead MRCKα (Figure S3), indicating the requirement for the catalytic activity of the kinase for the network formation. These findings strongly suggest MRCK to be essential in the formation of lamellar and subnuclear actomyosin networks.Figure 5MRCK-LRAP35a-MYO18A Complex Forms an Essential Part of the Retrograde Flowing Actomyosin Network in the Lamella and Cell CenterShow full caption(A) HeLa cells were doubly stained for endogenous MRCKα and MYO18A (top panel).

Scale bar: 20 μm. Next, we used live-cell microscopy to compare the dynamics of actomyosin filaments in control and MRCK-depleted cells by visualizing filaments incorporated with RFP-RMLC. Kymograph analyses in Figure 4C (Movies S1 and S2) showed that actomyosin filaments in the lamella of control cells readily underwent retrograde movement toward the nucleus, while MRCK-depleted cells contained far fewer such rearward-moving filaments, with nonmoving stress fibers still present. These results show that MRCK is important for actomyosin retrograde flow in the lamella and the subnuclear network. These two networks were diminished under serum-free conditions and readily re-established upon stimulation with serum factors such as LPA (Figure 4D). There were no obvious changes in composition or content of the MRCK complex upon the stimulation (Figure 4E). The LPA-stimulated network reorganization was sensitive to Cdc42 depletion and inhibition (Figures 4F, 4G, 4H, and S4). Cdc42 therefore has an important role in the formation of the MRCK-dependent lamellar and subnuclear networks induced by extracellular signals, probably by recruitment of a preformed complex to the leading cell edges. This notion finds support in the appearance of MRCK (also observed with MYO18A) at the membrane region of overexpressing cells (Movie S6). We have previously reported MRCK to enhance Cdc42-induced membrane expansion (Leung et al., 1998Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase acts as a Cdc42 effector in promoting cytoskeletal reorganization.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that these membrane events are associated with subsequent actomyosin network formation in the lamellar region. We then examined the intracellular distribution of LRAP35a and MYO18A relative to that of MRCK. Double staining of HeLa cells with anti-MRCKα and anti-MYO18A antibodies showed endogenous MYO18A colocalized with MRCK (Figure 5A). MYO18A also clearly colocalized with pRMLC in the lamellar and subnuclear regions, but not with actin stress fibers. Not being successful in generating LRAP35a antibodies for cell staining studies, we resorted to GFP-labeled LRAP35a for localization studies. GFP-LRAP35a and FLAG-MYO18A colocalized extensively when coexpressed in HeLa cells (Figure 5A), the distribution resembling that of endogenous MRCK and MYO18A. Our results thus far suggest that the tripartite complex of MRCK, LRAP35a, and MYO18A constituted an essential part of the dynamic actomyosin network in the lamella and probably undergoes retrograde movement along with lamellar RMLC. We observed that although HeLa cells constantly formed multiple lamellae that may correspond to the multiple protrusions, there was largely no cell polarization and net movement. When the dynamics of fluorescent protein-labeled MRCK, LRAP35a, and MYO18A were examined (Figure 5B; Movies S3, S4, S5, and S6), these proteins consistently exhibited their characteristic lamellar localization and retrograde movement, with a velocity similar to that of lamellar RMLC of approximately 0.4 μm/min. These findings strongly indicate the complex to be closely associated with the lamellar actomyosin filaments that exhibit retrograde movement. To determine the interdependence of these proteins in vivo, we examined the distribution of endogenous MRCK and MYO18A in cells depleted of both MRCKα and β or MYO18A. Figure 5C shows the effects and specificity of the MYO18A siRNAs. From cell staining, we observed that depletion of MRCK and MYO18A separately led to a reciprocal disruption of MYO18A and MRCK localization, respectively (Figure 5D). As with MRCK depletion, cells depleted of MYO18A were mainly left with stress fibers and a marked reduction in the actomyosin network in the lamellar and subnuclear regions. MRCK localization was similarly disrupted in cells expressing the MYO18A-ATPase mutant (more than 70% transected cells) (Figure 5D). These results reflect the interdependence and functional linkage of MRCK and MYO18A in promoting the formation of the two networks. To assess the importance of LRAP35a, we generated a MRCK-binding defective mutant LRAP35aΔIE by deleting I87 and E88. As determined by coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 5E), LRAP35aΔIE showed impaired interaction with MRCK and not with MYO18A. LRAP35aΔIE expression in HeLa cells resulted in significant mislocalization (more than 70% transfected cells) of both MRCK and MYO18A (Figure 5F), likely as a result of the uncoupling of MRCK from MYO18A. The MRCK-dependent actin filaments in the lamellar and subnuclear regions were markedly decreased, but stress fibers remained unaffected (Figure 5F). These findings underline the important role of LRAP35a as the mediator linking MRCK and MYO18A and suggest that the three proteins are functionally interdependent in reorganizing actomyosin bundles in the lamellar retrograde flow and the subnuclear region. MYO2-related MYO18A has at its C-terminal half a motor domain followed by a putative RMLC-binding IQ motif (Mori et al., 2005Mori K. Matsuda K. Furusawa T. Kawata M. Inoue T. Obinata M.

To determine whether, like MYO2, MYO18A is associated with RMLC, immunoprecipitated FLAG-MYO18A from COS7 cells was probed with an anti-RMLC antibody. A strong association of endogenous RMLC with MYO18A was detected (Figure 6A). Further, the associated RMLC was readily phosphorylated by MRCKα mainly on Ser19 in vitro (Figure 6A), but not on both Thr18 and Ser19 (ppRMLC) as reported for Citron kinase and ROK (Figure 6A) (Yamashiro et al., 2003Yamashiro S.

https://openalex.org/W2101099809,"The interplay between dopamine and alpha-synuclein (AS) plays a central role in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD results primarily from a severe and selective devastation of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. The neuropathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies within the surviving neurons, enriched in filamentous AS. In vitro, dopamine inhibits AS fibril formation, but the molecular determinants of this inhibition remain obscure. Here we use molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to investigate the binding of dopamine and several of its derivatives onto conformers representative of an NMR ensemble of AS structures in aqueous solution. Within the limitations inherent to MD simulations of unstructured proteins, our calculations suggest that the ligands bind to the (125)YEMPS(129) region, consistent with experimental findings. The ligands are further stabilized by long-range electrostatic interactions with glutamate 83 (E83) in the NAC region. These results suggest that by forming these interactions with AS, dopamine may affect AS aggregation and fibrillization properties. To test this hypothesis, we investigated in vitro the effects of dopamine on the aggregation of mutants designed to alter or abolish these interactions. We found that point mutations in the (125)YEMPS(129) region do not affect AS aggregation, which is consistent with the fact that dopamine interacts non-specifically with this region. In contrast, and consistent with our modeling studies, the replacement of glutamate by alanine at position 83 (E83A) abolishes the ability of dopamine to inhibit AS fibrillization."
https://openalex.org/W2052926928,"RhoA a small G-protein that has an established role in cell growth and in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Far less is known about whether RhoA can modulate cell fate. We previously reported that sustained RhoA activation induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Del Re, D. P., Miyamoto, S., and Brown, J. H. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 8069–8078). Here we demonstrate that less chronic RhoA activation affords a survival advantage, protecting cardiomyocytes from apoptotic insult induced by either hydrogen peroxide treatment or glucose deprivation. Under conditions where RhoA is protective, we observe Rho kinase-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Activation of endogenous cardiomyocyte FAK leads to its increased association with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and to concomitant activation of Akt. Treatment of isolated perfused hearts with sphingosine 1-phosphate recapitulates this response. The pathway by which RhoA mediates cardiomyocyte Akt activation is demonstrated to require Rho kinase, FAK and PI3K, but not Src, based on studies with pharmacological inhibitors (Y-27632, LY294002, PF271 and PP2) and inhibitory protein expression (FAK-related nonkinase). Inhibition of RhoA-mediated Akt activation at any of these steps, including inhibition of FAK, prevents RhoA from protecting cardiomyocytes against apoptotic insult. We further demonstrate that stretch of cardiomyocytes, which activates endogenous RhoA, induces the aforementioned signaling pathway, providing a physiologic context in which RhoA-mediated FAK phosphorylation can activate PI3K and Akt.

However, the biological significance of FAK activation in cardiomyocyte survival and the involvement of RhoA and the cytoskeleton in this process have not been explored. focal adhesion kinase focal adhesion kinase-related nonkinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase sphingosine 1-phosphate multiplicity of infection In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA activation affords a survival advantage to cardiomyocytes, and this occurs through FAK phosphorylation, association of FAK with PI3K, and, consequently, activation of Akt. Akt is a well accepted mediator of survival, protecting the heart from apoptotic insult (28Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 29Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H. Li L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), but the precise molecular events leading to its activation in the heart are not fully established. This is, to our knowledge, the first report demonstrating that cytoskeletal events and the downstream cascade initiated by RhoA activate Akt and mediate protection of cardiomyocytes. Cell Culture—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared from hearts of 2–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups, as described previously (30Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were digested with collagenase and myocytes purified over a Percoll gradient. Myocytes were plated at a density of 0.4 × 106 cells/3.5-cm dish, 1.2 × 106 cells/6-cm dish, or 4 × 106 cells/10-cm dish in serum-containing medium overnight. For stretch experiments, cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 onto silicon membranes coated with collagen type I (0.5 μg/cm2), which were assembled in a biaxial stretch device, as described previously (31Kawamura S. Miyamoto S. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31111-31117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stretched for the times indicated. Adenoviral Infection—Cells cultured in serum-free medium overnight were subsequently infected with (L63)RhoA, FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK), or AdCMV control adenovirus for 2 h. Cells were washed and maintained in serum-free medium. Inhibitors were added at infection and replaced following virus washout unless otherwise described. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, Src inhibitor PP2, and cytochalasin D were purchased from Calbiochem. The 2-deoxyglucose was purchased from Sigma. The cell-permeable exoenzyme C3 transferase was purchased from Cytoskeleton. The GTPase-deficient mutant (L63)RhoA adenovirus was generated as described previously (32Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) supplemented with sodium vanadate, leupeptin, aprotinin, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5! Nonidet P-40. Bradford analysis was performed to determine protein concentration. Equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon membrane, and the resulting blot was probed using the following antibodies. The total Akt, phospho-Akt (threonine 308 and serine 473), and p85 phosphorylated binding motif antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. The RhoA, FRNK, p85, total Src, and actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The phospho-Src (tyrosine 416) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The phospho-FAK (tyrosine 397) antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. The total FAK antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Immunocytochemistry—Following viral infection, cardiomyocytes were fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1! Triton X-100, and blocked in 5! bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with anti-phospho-FAK (tyrosine 397) rabbit polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE) overnight at 4 °C and blocked for 30 min in 10! normal goat serum before incubating with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 90 min at room temperature. Cell Death Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent (POD) Assay—DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis was assayed using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, lysates were incubated with anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA-POD in a streptavidin-coated microplate for 2 h and washed, colorimetric substrate was added, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Co-Immunoprecipitation Assay—Following intervention, cells were collected in lysis buffer (supplemented with sodium vanadate, leupeptin, aprotinin, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride) and cleared, and equal amounts of total protein were incubated with anti-FAK (BD Transduction Laboratories) primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Complexes were pulled down using protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. RhoA Activation Assay—Activated RhoA was determined using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the RhoA binding domain of the RhoA effector rhotekin, as described previously by our group (33Sagi S.A. Seasholtz T.M. Kobiashvilla M. Wilson B.A. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, lysed, clarified by brief centrifugation, and then incubated with the Sepharose-bound glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin-RhoA binding domain for 40 min at 4 °C. The beads and precipitated proteins were washed, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The precipitated GTP-bound RhoA was normalized to total RhoA present in the whole cell lysate. Langendorff Perfused Heart—Adult male C57B6 mice (8 weeks old, weighing 28–32 g) were heparinized (500 units/kg, intraperitoneally) and anesthetized (2! isofluorane with 0.8! oxygen). Hearts were rapidly excised, washed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit solution, and cannulated via the aorta on a 20-gauge stainless steel blunt needle. Hearts were perfused at 80 mm Hg on a Langendorff apparatus using Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 °C. Hearts were perfused for 30 min to allow for equilibration, followed by 10 min of perfusion with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) or vehicle. Statistical Analysis—All results are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparison of two groups was accomplished using an unpaired Student's t test. Data from experiments with more than two groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post hoc test for comparison between groups. RhoA has been shown to mediate hypertrophic growth of cultured rat cardiomyocytes as indicated by increased cell size, cytoskeletal organization, and gene expression (34Sah V.P. Hoshijima M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31185-31190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Thorburn J. Xu S. Thorburn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1888-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36Aoki H. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). RhoA has also been implicated in mediating activation of FAK in response to endothelin and mechanical stretch (23Torsoni A.S. Marin T.M. Velloso L.A. Franchini K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1488-H1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Heidkamp M.C. Bayer A.L. Scully B.T. Eble D.M. Samarel A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1684-H1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To confirm that RhoA signaling pathways increase cytoskeletal organization and to directly determine whether FAK is a downstream RhoA target, we infected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with constitutively active (L63)RhoA and visualized the cells using confocal microscopy. Cells were infected with control adenovirus (AdCMV) or RhoA adenovirus for 2 h, washed, and examined 6–24 h later. RhoA transgene expression was demonstrated to be maximal, attaining a modest 2–3-fold increase in RhoA protein expression compared with control-infected cells, by 12 h following virus washout (data not shown). By 24 h, RhoA-expressing cells were noticeably larger, appeared more spread, and showed increased actin filament organization relative to control-infected cells. RhoA-expressing cells also showed a robust increase in activated FAK, which colocalized with actin filaments (Fig. 1A). Thus, RhoA-induced cytoskeletal changes are temporally and spatially associated with FAK activation. Based on the immunocytochemical results described above we sought to confirm and quantify the effect of RhoA on FAK activation using Western blot analysis. These studies demonstrated a maximal 3-fold increase in FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 (indicative of FAK activation), following 24 h of RhoA expression (Fig. 1B), with lesser but significant increases at earlier (12 h) and later (48 h) times (data not shown). No significant difference in total FAK expression was observed at any of these times. Since FAK associates with and activates the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src (37Parsons S.J. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7906-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), we asked whether Src phosphorylation was also increased in cells expressing RhoA. Notably, Western analysis carried out using phosphoantibody directed to the tyrosine 416 site (indicative of activation) showed no change in Src phosphorylation in RhoA-infected cells versus control cells (Fig. 1B). Rho kinase has been demonstrated to mediate many of the effects of RhoA on the cytoskeleton; thus, we asked whether Rho kinase was involved in FAK activation. The ability of the Rho kinase selective inhibitor, Y-27632, to block FAK phosphorylation was examined. As shown by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 1A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C), treatment with 10 μm Y-27632 significantly reduced RhoA-induced FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397. To examine the role of RhoA-induced cytoskeletal changes in FAK activation, cells were treated with cytochalasin D to disrupt actin polymerization. Treatment with 10 μm cytochalasin D completely abolished the RhoA-induced increase in FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data provide evidence that Rho kinase, as well as cytoskeletal integrity, are required for RhoA-mediated FAK activation. FAK serves as a protein scaffold that mediates activation of signaling molecules, including PI3K (20Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). An interaction between heterologously expressed FAK and p85, a regulatory subunit of the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3K, has been shown to increase PI3K activity in fibroblasts (38Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 39Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1996; 1311: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit contains a Src homology 2 domain known to bind the consensus sequence Y*XXM, where X is any amino acid and Y*isa phosphorylated tyrosine residue (41Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A sequence scan of FAK revealed three corresponding motifs conserved between mice, rats, and humans. To test the possibility that RhoA increases phosphorylation of this p85 recognition motif in FAK, we immunoprecipitated FAK from control- and RhoA-infected cells and probed for this phosphorylated motif. RhoA expression markedly increased phosphorylation of this sequence in FAK, and this increase was mediated by Rho kinase, since it was completely blocked by Y-27632 treatment (Fig. 2A). To test for an interaction between FAK and p85 in cardiomyocytes, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using a total FAK antibody. These experiments demonstrated increased association of endogenous FAK and p85 in cells expressing RhoA (Fig. 2B). This increased association was completely abolished by treatment with either Y-27632 (10 μm) or PF271 (1 μm), a pharmacological inhibitor of FAK, indicating that both Rho kinase and FAK activity are required to elicit this interaction (Fig. 2B). Based on our findings that RhoA increases the association of FAK with PI3K, we asked whether RhoA activates the well characterized cardioprotective kinase, Akt. Western blot analysis demonstrated that expression of RhoA increased Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 as well as threonine 308 (data not shown), inducing a nearly 4-fold increase versus control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Akt phosphorylation was increased significantly within 12 h of RhoA infection, was maximal at 24 h, and then declined by 48 h postinfection (data not shown), paralleling the time course of FAK activation. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μm), completely abolished the increase in Akt phosphorylation, indicating involvement of PI3K (Fig. 3, A and B). To prove that Akt activation results from the recruitment of PI3K by FAK, we infected cells with adenovirus encoding the FAK-related nonkinase, FRNK. FRNK is an endogenously expressed truncated form of FAK that contains the C-terminal domain of FAK but lacks its kinase domain and therefore acts as a dominant inhibitory regulator (42Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Expression of FRNK adenovirus prevented RhoA-induced FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397, evidence that the construct acted as intended (Fig. 4A). Importantly, expression of FRNK fully inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt elicited by RhoA expression. Western blot analysis was also performed on cells treated with Y-27632 (10 μm), the FAK inhibitor, PF271 (1 μm), or the Src-selective inhibitor, PP2 (1 μm), and levels of phosphorylated Akt were determined. Fig. 4B quantifies Akt activation in the absence or presence of these inhibitors or FRNK adenovirus (10 MOI). The blockade of Akt activation by Y-27632 is consistent with the data above showing that Rho kinase is required for FAK phosphorylation and for PI3K association with FAK (Figs. 1C and 2B). The lack of inhibition by PP2 is consistent with our observation that Src is not activated by RhoA expression (Fig. 1B). The data with PF271 and FRNK, taken with the data above, implicate FAK, acting independently of Src, as a RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent mediator of PI3K and Akt activation. To examine the possibility that RhoA signaling pathways mediate a protective response, control- and RhoA-infected cells were treated with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide for 16–18 h. Myocytes infected with control adenovirus showed a roughly 5-fold increase in DNA fragmentation. This increase was significantly attenuated in cells expressing RhoA (Fig. 5A). To demonstrate the involvement of PI3K/Akt in RhoA-mediated protection, we examined the effect of LY294002. Inhibition of PI3K had no effect on DNA fragmentation induced by hydrogen peroxide in control-infected cells (data not shown). However, the ability of RhoA to protect against DNA fragmentation elicited by hydrogen peroxide was fully blocked in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 5A), indicating that Akt activated by RhoA serves a protective function. The data above suggest that RhoA and Akt-mediated protection occurs via increased FAK phosphorylation. To prove that FAK is the mediator of cardiomyocyte protection, we tested the ability of FRNK adenoviral expression and of pharmacological FAK inhibition to block RhoA-mediated protection. Blocking FAK through either means precluded RhoA from protecting cardiomyocytes from apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide or glucose deprivation (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, not only is FAK activated by RhoA/Rho kinase, but this response is critical for protection against apoptosis. To test whether a more physiologic intervention would activate this same signaling pathway, we employed a well characterized model of biaxial static stretch (43Lee A.A. Delhaas T. Waldman L. MacKenna D. Villarreal F.J. McCulloch A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1400-C1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory previously reported that stretching cardiomyocytes leads to rapid activation of RhoA (31Kawamura S. Miyamoto S. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31111-31117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and the data presented here confirm that finding (Fig. 6A). Furthermore we examined the effect of stretch on FAK and Akt and found phosphorylation of these kinases to be significantly increased (∼2- and 5-fold, respectively; Fig. 6B). To implicate RhoA in stretch-induced FAK and Akt activation, cardiomyocytes were treated with C3 exoenzyme prior to stretching. Blocking RhoA activation was sufficient to completely abolish the increased phosphorylation of FAK and Akt induced by stretch (Fig. 6C). To determine whether stretch also increases the association of FAK with the p85 subunit of PI3K, total FAK protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates of stretched and unstretched cardiomyocytes. We observed a robust increase in the association of endogenous FAK and p85 following stretch (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that stretch leads to activation of Akt via a RhoA-mediated FAK/p85 interaction. Our group previously reported that the G-protein-coupled receptor ligand, S1P, protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo (44Means C.K. Xiao C.Y. Li Z. Zhang T. Omens J.H. Ishii I. Chun J. Brown J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: H2944-H2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). S1P2 and S1P3 receptors activate RhoA through coupling to Gα12/13 (45Ishii I. Ye X. Friedman B.

Using the Langendorff isolated perfused mouse heart, we demonstrate that S1P treatment leads to activation of RhoA, concomitant with increased phosphorylation of FAK and Akt (Fig. 7A). In other studies, we immunoprecipitated endogenous FAK from lysates of S1P and vehicle-treated perfused hearts. S1P treatment led to increased association of the p85 subunit of PI3K and FAK (Fig. 7B), implicating FAK in S1P-mediated Akt activation in the intact heart. A model summarizing the proposed pathway for protective signaling is illustrated in Fig. 8. RhoA, acting though Rho kinase-dependent changes in the cytoskeleton, induces phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 397. FAK serves as a scaffold, binding the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and recruiting it to the plasma membrane, where increased PI3K activity leads to activation of Akt. This signaling scaffold initiated by RhoA serves to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptotic insult. RhoA acts as a transducer of signals from a subset of G-protein-coupled receptors as well as mechanical stretch and integrin engagement (1Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 2Brown J.H. Del Re D.P. Sussman M.A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Canonical RhoA signaling pathways alter the cytoskeleton via activation of the RhoA effector, Rho kinase, leading to increased myosin phosphorylation and contraction (3Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). RhoA/Rho kinase also initiate actin stress fiber formation via activation of LIM kinase or phosphorylation of ERM proteins, both of which promote actin assembly (46Noma K. Oyama N. Liao J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C661-C668Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).

They act via their receptor RAGE to induce inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We examined the molecular mechanisms by which the RAGE ligand, S100b, induces COX-2 in monocytes. S100b significantly increased COX-2 mRNA accumulation in THP-1 monocytes at 2 h via mRNA stability. This was further confirmed by showing that S100b increased stability of luciferase-COX-2 3′-UTR mRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that S100b decreased occupancy of the DNA/RNA-binding protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein K (hnRNPK), at the COX-2 promoter but simultaneously increased its binding to the COX-2 3′-UTR. S100b treatment promoted the translocation of nuclear hnRNPK to cytoplasm, whereas a cytoplasmic translocation-deficient hnRNPK mutant inhibited S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA stability. Small interfering RNA-mediated specific knockdown of hnRNPK blocked S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA stability, whereas on the other hand, overexpression of hnRNPK increased S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA stability. S100b promoted the release of entrapped COX-2 mRNA from cytoplasmic processing bodies, sites of mRNA degradation. Furthermore, S100b significantly down-regulated the expression of a key microRNA, miR-16, which can destabilize COX-2 mRNA by binding to its 3′-UTR. MiR-16 inhibitor oligonucleotides increased, whereas, conversely, miR-16 mimic oligonucleotides decreased COX-2 mRNA stability in monocytes, further supporting the inhibitory effects of miR-16. Interestingly, hnRNPK knockdown increased miR-16 binding to COX-2 3′-UTR, indicating a cross-talk between them.

This is associated with increased monocyte activation, migration, and adhesion to the endothelium, events related to inflammation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. RAGE is a well studied cell surface receptor that interacts with multiple ligands including AGEs and proinflammatory peptides such as S100b belonging to the S100/calgranulin family (14Schmidt A.M.

COX-2 induction by S100b after 4 h of treatment was transcriptionally regulated and involved key NF-κB elements in the distal COX-2 promoter (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, in those studies, we noted that S100b could also increase COX-2 mRNA expression at an early time point of 2 h via unknown post-transcriptional mechanisms and were therefore investigated in the current study. Transcription of the COX-2 gene is regulated via cis-acting elements that bind to transcription factors such as NF-κB (19Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 20Tanabe T. Tohnai N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, COX-2 can also be regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA stabilization (21Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 22Tamura M. Sebastian S. Yang S. Gurates B. Fang Z. Bulun S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3263-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, conserved adenosine- and uridine-rich (AU-rich) elements (AREs) found in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of many inflammatory genes, including COX-2, can promote rapid mRNA destabilization and degradation (23Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). AREs present within the COX-2 3′-untranslated region (COX-2 3′-UTR) regulate COX-2 mRNA decay through association with specific RNA-binding proteins such as RNA stability factor HuR and the translational repressor protein TIA-1 that target specific AREs. These RNA-protein (RNP) complexes regulate COX-2 mRNA degradation, stabilization, and translation (24Cok S.J. Acton S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36157-36162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Tebo J. Der S. Frevel M. Khabar K.S. Williams B.R. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) also play key roles in ARE-mediated destabilization of inflammatory gene mRNAs (28Vasudevan S. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2007; 128: 1105-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Binding of miR-16 to AREs of mRNA transcripts like tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and COX-2 could promote their degradation (29Jing Q. Huang S. Guth S. Zarubin T. Motoyama A. Chen J. Di Padova F. Lin S.C. Gram H. Han J. Cell. 2005; 120: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Although several studies have examined transcriptional mechanisms regulating pathological genes under diabetic conditions, much less is known about the mechanisms involved in mRNA stability or the role of miRs in regulating ARE-containing mRNAs. In the present study, we show for the first time that miR-16 and a key DNA/RNA-binding protein, namely heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein K (hnRNPK), play opposing roles in S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA stabilization. Our results suggest that, at early time points after treatment of monocytes with S100b, increased stabilization of COX-2 mRNA occurs via movement of hnRNPK from the COX-2 promoter to the 3′-UTR, whereas miR-16 binding to the 3′-UTR is simultaneously reduced. These data illustrate an efficient mechanism by which diabetic conditions can rapidly augment the stability of inflammatory genes without the need for increased transcription. Materials—The following antibodies were used for the co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses: anti-GFP, anti-hnRNPK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-luciferase, and anti-α-actin (Sigma). miR-16 siRNAs, inhibitor and mimics were from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Control and hnRNPK siRNAs were from Ambion (Austin, TX). Bovine brain S100b peptide was obtained from Calbiochem. RAGE antibody was from Dr. A. M. Schmidt, Columbia University, New York, NY). Cell Culture and Treatments—Human THP-1 monocytic cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection or from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) and cultured as described (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum and 5.5 mm d-glucose (normal glucose, NG). Where indicated, THP-1 cells were treated with S100b (40 μg/ml) protein. Isolation of PBMC—Human PBMC were isolated as described earlier using an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PBMC were plated in 6-well dishes (1 × 105 cells/well) and treated with S100b as indicated, and total RNA were isolated as described below. RNA Preparation and Relative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed, and relative RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers paired with QuantumRNA 18 S internal standards as described earlier (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Shanmugam N. Gaw Gonzalo I.T. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ primers for firefly luciferase (Luc) mRNA were 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTC-3′ and 5′-AGGCTCCTCAGAAACAGCTCTTC-3′, respectively. Gene expression was expressed as -fold stimulation over NG after normalizing with paired 18 S RNA levels. Analysis of microRNA (miR) Expression—The microRNAs were isolated using the mirVana quantitative RT-PCR miRNA detection kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX). MiR-16 levels were quantified with Has-miR-16 quantitative RT-PCR primer sets (Ambion). For Northern blot detection of miR-16, total RNA (40 μg) was fractionated on 12.5% 7 m urea gel at 125 volts for 100 min. RNAs were transferred overnight using capillary transfer on to a Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad) in 2× SSC solution. The membranes were covalently cross-linked by UV irradiation for 10 min with UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). An antisense miR-16 oligonucleotide probe was labeled using T4-Poly nucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP to be used as probe. Membranes were hybridized overnight with the probe in 7% SDS, 0.2 m Na2PO4, pH 7.0, at 35 °C, washed three times with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 37 °C, once with 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and once with 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. Washed membranes were exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C for overnight. Measurement of mRNA Stability—For Luc mRNA stability assays, Luc reporter constructs containing the indicated COX-2 3′-UTR regions (21Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected into THP-1 cells using Nucleofection equipment (Amaxa). Cells were allowed to recover for 1 day and treated without or with S100b (40 μg/ml) for 2 h, and then transcription was stopped by adding actinomycin D (Act D, 10 μg/ml). Samples (5 × 106 cells/ml) were collected at the indicated time intervals in RNA-STAT60 reagent. Total RNA was isolated, and Luc mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Real-time quantitative PCRs (QPCRs) were performed using SYBR green reagent kits with gene-specific primers on the Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system (Foster City, CA). The 5′ and 3′ primers for Luc mRNA amplification were 5′-TCTCTGGCATGCGAGAATCT-3′ and 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTC-3′, respectively. Primers for control GAPDH were forward, 5′-GGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CACCATTCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATGGTG-3′. Each sample was run in triplicate. The relative RNA amount was calculated after normalization with the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase according to the method described earlier (29Jing Q. Huang S. Guth S. Zarubin T. Motoyama A. Chen J. Di Padova F. Lin S.C. Gram H. Han J. Cell. 2005; 120: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from control (NG) and S100b (40μg/ml)-treated THP-1 cells were prepared as described before (30Shanmugam N. Gaw Gonzalo I.T. Natarajan R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA/siRNA Transfections and Luc Assays—THP-1 cells (1.2 × 106/transfection) were transfected with indicated siRNA or miR oligonucleotides (1 nm each) and plasmids (1 μg each) using an Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystem) according to the manufacturer's protocols and plated in six-well plates. Following an overnight recovery period, the transfected cells were cultured in either medium alone (NG) or medium containing S100b (40 μg/ml) as indicated. Luc activity in cell lysates (20 ul) was determined using a Luc assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (RNA-EMSA) and UV Cross-linking—RNA-EMSA and UV-cross-linking were performed as described earlier (31Shanmugam N. Ransohoff R.M. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31212-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed 32P-labeled COX-2 3′-UTR RNA and its deletion fragments (115, 420, and Δ1000 bp) were used as probes. After the UV cross-linking, the RNA body was digested with RNases (RNase A and RNase U2), and the proteins were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE. 32P-labeled RNP complexes visualized by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed as described earlier (32Miao F. Natarajan R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4650-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ChIP-enriched DNA was analyzed by PCR and QPCR using COX-2 promoter-specific primers. Distal promoter region primers were: forward primer, 5′-CCTATTAAGCGTCGTCACTA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CGAGAGCCAGTTCGGACTG-3′. Proximal promoter region primers were: forward primer, 5′-TGTGCGCCTGGGGCGGTGGA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GTCGCTAACCGAGAGAACCT-3′. Data were normalized using input samples. RNA-Immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP)—THP-1 cells were lysed using Buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 rpm, and RNasin (Promega, 40 units/ml) was added. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using GFP or hnRNPK antibodies (2 μg each) and 30 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h at RT. Then protein A agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl. RNA was extracted from the beads by phenol-chloroform extraction and reverse-transcribed using a reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting cDNA was amplified using the following primers for human COX-2: forward, 5′-ATCTACCCTCCTCAAGTCCC-3′, and reverse, 5-′TACCAGAAGGGCAGGATACAG-3′. Immunofluorescent Staining—THP-1 cells were treated with or without S100b as indicated, and at the end of the incubation period, cells were washed and immobilized on a polylysine-coated glass slide for 30 min. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The slides were then blocked (10 min) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% human albumin and immunostained with hnRNPK antibody (1:250 dilution) followed by appropriate Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution). Slides were viewed using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX50 with DP70 camera). In Situ Hybridization—THP-1 cells were transfected with GFP-Dcp1a expression plasmid and immobilized on a polylysine glass slide for 30 min. After fixing with paraformaldehyde (4%), cells were treated with 70% ethanol, rehydrated in 2× SSC, and used for hybridization. Cells were hybridized with 15 ng of the fluorescent oligonucleotides complementary to the COX-2 coding region in 50 μl of hybridization solution containing 2× SSC, 30% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The sequence of the probe used was 5′-gT*actggaattgtttgttgaaaagT*agttctgggtcaaattT*c-3′. Residues marked as T* are the amino-modified thymidines that were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555. Slides were washed three times with 2× SSC and 30% formamide for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were counterstained for DNA with DAPI (Sigma), mounted using antifade Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California), and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. In Vitro Pull-down Assays to Evaluate miR-16 Binding—Biotin UTP-labeled RNA of COX2–3′-UTRs were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase for 2 h at 37°C with 1:10 ratio of biotin-labeled UTP:UTP (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The RNA samples were then run on a 5% 7 m urea PAGE. RNA was extracted from the excised gel samples followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and precipitated with ethanol. The biotin-labeled RNA was further purified by another round of phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. MiR-16 and antisense miR-16 were 32P-labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase. These labeled miRs (5 × 106 cpm) were each added to a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 15 μl of THP-1 cell cytoplasmic extracts (CE), 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 40 units/ml RNasin, 5 mm EGTA, 30 μg/ml creatine kinase, 25 mm creatine phosphate, and 200 pmol of biotin-labeled RNA. The binding reaction was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C. The biotin-labeled RNA was pulled down with streptavidin-coated Dynabeads that had been preblocked with CEs. The amount of miR bound to the RNA was determined using a scintillation counter. Data Analyses—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of multiple experiments. Paired Student's t tests were used to compare two groups and analysis of variance with Dunnett's post tests for multiple comparisons. COX-2–3′-UTR Plays an Important Role in S100b-mediated Stabilization of COX-2 mRNA—We previously reported that S100b could induce COX-2 expression at 4 h in human monocytes through NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation of the COX-2 promoter (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and at 2 h due to mRNA stability regulated via unknown mechanisms. We therefore evaluated the mechanisms involved in S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA stability. Human THP-1 monocytic cells were first transiently transfected with plasmids containing Luc reporter under the control of human COX-2 promoter regions (–7140/+127, –1430/+127, and –860/+127), stimulation with S100b for 2 h, and Luc activities were determined. S100b did not induce COX-2 promoter transcriptional activation at 2 h with any of these constructs (Fig. 1A), unlike at 4 h (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Evidence shows that COX-2 mRNA stability can be regulated by the presence of a 3′-UTR with multiple copies of AREs targeted by RNA-interacting factors (21Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 24Cok S.J. Acton S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the S100b-induced COX-2 stabilization may involve similar mechanisms. Because COX-2 mRNA can be increased by both stability (at 2 h) as well as promoter activation at > 4 h (18Shanmugam N. Kim Y.S. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34834-34844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), measuring COX-2 mRNA will not reflect the true RNA stability component. Therefore, we used reporter plasmids containing the COX-2 3′-UTR at the 3′ end of the Luc gene expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter (21Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and used Luc as a surrogate for the COX-2. Under these conditions, measuring Luc mRNA half-life (steady-state Luc mRNA levels) after treatment with Act D to stop transcription would reflect COX-2 mRNA stabilization by S100b due to the COX-2 3′-UTR. THP-1 cells were transfected with indicated Luc-COX-2 3′-UTR plasmids (Fig. 1B), treated with or without S100b, and Luc activities in lysates were measured. Results showed that basal Luc activity was dramatically reduced in cells expressing Luc containing full-length COX-2 3′-UTR (pZeo/Luc-COX-2–1477) and 420 bp (pZeo/Luc-COX-2–420) when compared with those transfected without COX-2 3′-UTR (pZeo/Luc) (Fig. 1C), demonstrating the destabilizing effect of the COX-2 3′-UTR on Luc mRNA (or COX-2 mRNA). S100b treatment reversed this effect and significantly increased Luc activity of both pZeo/Luc-COX-2–1477 and pZeo/Luc-COX-2–420 by 3-fold with no effect on pZeo/Luc transfected cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Luc with COX-2 3′-UTR region in the antisense orientation (pZeo/Luc-COX-2–420AS) or with 3′-UTR harboring a deletion at the 5′end (pZeo/Luc-COX-2-Δ1000) displayed higher basal Luc activity when compared with the 1477- and 420-bp constructs. S100b treatment also failed to increase their Luc activities (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that the cis-elements located within 5′ end 420 bp of the 3′-UTR are involved in S100b-induced COX-2 mRNA stability in monocytes. Furthermore, S100b-induced Luc activity at 2 h in THP-1 cells transfected with pZeo/Luc-COX-2–420 was significantly blocked by pretreatment with a RAGE antibody relative to IgG alone (data not shown), demonstrating the role of RAGE-mediated signaling in COX-2 stability. Immunoblotting of transfected cell lysates with Luc antibody showed increased Luc protein levels in S100b-treated THP-1 cells transfected with pZeo/Luc-COX-2–1477 and pZeo/Luc-COX-2–420 when compared with the respective untreated cells (Fig. 1D) but not in cells transfected with pZeo/Luc or pZeo/Luc-COX-2–420AS (Fig. 1D). S100b also significantly increased levels of Luc-COX-2–1477 mRNA in THP-1 cells (Fig. 1E). These results confirm that the observed changes in Luc activity reflect Luc protein and mRNA levels in transfected cells. Next, we further confirmed the involvement of the COX-2 3′-UTR in Luc mRNA (or COX-2 mRNA) stability in the THP-1 cells treated with S100b. THP-1 cells transfected with pZeo/Luc-COX-2–1477 were treated with S100b for 2 h, and transcription was inhibited by treatment with Act D. Luc mRNA levels were then determined by RT-QPCR at various time intervals up to 2 h"
https://openalex.org/W2118706074,"In C. elegans, four asymmetric divisions, beginning with the zygote (P0), generate transcriptionally repressed germline blastomeres (P1-P4) and somatic sisters that become transcriptionally active. The protein PIE-1 represses transcription in the later germline blastomeres but not in the earlier germline blastomeres P0 and P1. We show here that OMA-1 and OMA-2, previously shown to regulate oocyte maturation, repress transcription in P0 and P1 by binding to and sequestering in the cytoplasm TAF-4, a component critical for assembly of TFIID and the pol II preinitiation complex. OMA-1/2 binding to TAF-4 is developmentally regulated, requiring phosphorylation by the DYRK kinase MBK-2, which is activated at meiosis II after fertilization. OMA-1/2 are normally degraded after the first mitosis, but ectopic expression of wild-type OMA-1 is sufficient to repress transcription in both somatic and later germline blastomeres. We propose that phosphorylation by MBK-2 serves as a developmental switch, converting OMA-1/2 from oocyte to embryo regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2017043601,"In response to environmental stress, the translation machinery of cells is reprogrammed. The majority of actively translated mRNAs are released from polysomes and driven to specific cytoplasmic foci called stress granules (SGs) where dynamic changes in protein-RNA interaction determine the subsequent fate of mRNAs. Here we show that the DEAH box RNA helicase RHAU is a novel SG-associated protein. Although RHAU protein was originally identified as an AU-rich element-associated protein involved in urokinase-type plasminogen activator mRNA decay, it was not clear whether RHAU could directly interact with RNA. We have demonstrated that RHAU physically interacts with RNA in vitro and in vivo through a newly identified N-terminal RNA-binding domain, which was found to be both essential and sufficient for RHAU localization in SGs. We have also shown that the ATPase activity of RHAU plays a role in the RNA interaction and in the regulation of protein retention in SGs. Thus, our results show that RHAU is the fourth RNA helicase detected in SGs, after rck/p54, DDX3, and eIF4A, and that its association with SGs is dynamic and mediated by an RHAU-specific RNA-binding domain. In response to environmental stress, the translation machinery of cells is reprogrammed. The majority of actively translated mRNAs are released from polysomes and driven to specific cytoplasmic foci called stress granules (SGs) where dynamic changes in protein-RNA interaction determine the subsequent fate of mRNAs. Here we show that the DEAH box RNA helicase RHAU is a novel SG-associated protein. Although RHAU protein was originally identified as an AU-rich element-associated protein involved in urokinase-type plasminogen activator mRNA decay, it was not clear whether RHAU could directly interact with RNA. We have demonstrated that RHAU physically interacts with RNA in vitro and in vivo through a newly identified N-terminal RNA-binding domain, which was found to be both essential and sufficient for RHAU localization in SGs. We have also shown that the ATPase activity of RHAU plays a role in the RNA interaction and in the regulation of protein retention in SGs. Thus, our results show that RHAU is the fourth RNA helicase detected in SGs, after rck/p54, DDX3, and eIF4A, and that its association with SGs is dynamic and mediated by an RHAU-specific RNA-binding domain. Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression is important and highly regulated in response to developmental, environmental, and metabolic signals (1.Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). During stress conditions such as heat shock, oxidative stress, ischemia, or viral infection, mRNA translation is reprogrammed and allows the selective synthesis of stress response and repair proteins (2.Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the translation of housekeeping genes is arrested, and untranslated mRNAs accumulate in cytoplasmic foci known as stress granules (SGs) (3.Anderson P. Kedersha N. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).

Phosphorylation of eIF2α can be mediated by several stress-induced protein kinases (for a review, see Ref. 4.Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), suggesting that the formation of SGs is highly regulated and that eIF2α plays a pivotal role in sensing stress. Upon translational arrest, polysome-free 48 S preinitiation complexes containing initiation factors, small ribosomal subunits, and poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP-1) aggregate into SGs (3.Anderson P. Kedersha N. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 5.Kedersha N. Chen S. Gilks N. Li W. Miller I.J. Stahl J. Anderson P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Several known SG-associated mRNA-binding proteins have been identified and shown to induce or inhibit SG aggregation when overexpressed. It is presumed that the overexpression of mRNA-binding proteins, which are able to oligomerize, disturb the equilibrium of mRNA distribution between polysomes and polysome-free ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and thus induce SG formation by their aggregation (6.Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Nevertheless some RNA-binding proteins do not induce SG formation upon overexpression, e.g. a zipcode-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), heterogeneous nuclear RNP A1, or PABP-1 (7.Stohr N. Lederer M.

Under normal conditions, most RNA-binding proteins are involved in various aspects of mRNA metabolism, such as translation (TIA-1, TIA-1-related protein, PCBP2, Pumilio 2, and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein), degradation (G3BP, TTP, Brf1, rck/p54, KH domain RNA binding protein [KSRP], and PMR1), stability (HuR), and specific intracellular localization (ZBP1, Staufen, Smaug, Caprin-1, and FMRP) (for a review, see Ref. 10.Anderson P. Kedersha N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The differing flux of these SG-associated proteins and poly(A)+ mRNAs revealed by fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis suggests that SGs are dynamic foci (6.Kedersha N.

Cell Res. 2008; 314: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They are also considered to be sites at which RNPs undergo structural and compositional remodeling and may be temporally stored, returned to polysomes for translation, or packaged for degradation (6.Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar).Immediately after transcription, RNA forms with RNA-binding proteins RNPs that are dynamic and take part in RNA metabolism. RNP remodeling, which is essential for the cellular localization, processing, function, and fate of RNA (15.Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), is mainly regulated by a large family of proteins called RNA helicases. These enzymes use energy released by ATP hydrolysis to unwind secondary structures of RNA or displace proteins from RNA (16.Linder P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4168-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The majority of RNA helicases are assigned to superfamily 2 (SF2), which is divided into three subfamilies named after the sequence in the helicase motif II: DEAD, DEAH, and DEXH (17.Jankowsky E. Jankowsky A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several DEX(H/D) proteins have been shown to unwind double-stranded RNA in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro (16.Linder P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4168-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 18.Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), but most are involved in the ATP-dependent remodeling of RNPs (16.Linder P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4168-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Although RNA helicases contain a highly conserved helicase core region, they are involved in all of the RNA processes ranging from transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA export, and translation initiation to RNA decay (for reviews, see Refs. 19.Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20.Abdelhaleem M. Maltais L. Wain H.

The specific functions of individual enzymes are attributed to the less conserved N/C termini, which are responsible for substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and cofactor requirements (22.Mohr G.

Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RHAU is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein found predominantly in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm. As with other helicases (27.Askjaer P. Rosendahl R. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11561-11568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28.Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2926-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), ATPase activity is necessary for RHAU function in the decay of uPA mRNA and for its nuclear localization (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite the role of RHAU as a factor destabilizing uPA mRNA, global analysis of gene expression in RHAU knockdown cells revealed that changes in steady-state levels of mRNAs were only partially influenced by mRNA decay regulation (30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed the nuclear localization of RHAU and its guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA/RNA-resolving activity (31.Vaughn J.P. Creacy S.D. Routh E.D. Joyner-Butt C. Jenkins G.S. Pauli S. Nagamine Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38117-38120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) may reflect that RHAU regulates gene expression at various steps other than mRNA decay.Given that SGs are sites at which dynamic changes in protein-RNA interaction determine the fate of mRNAs during and after stress, it is surprising that the role of SG-associated RNA helicases with an essential function in remodeling protein-RNA interactions is largely unknown. Here we show that RHAU is a novel component of SGs and that its recruitment to SGs is mediated by an RNA interaction. Although identified as an ARE-associated protein involved in ARE-mediated mRNA decay of uPA, it was not immediately clear whether RHAU directly binds RNA. Here we show that RHAU physically interacts with RNA in vitro and in vivo via a unique N-terminal RNA-binding domain composed of a G-rich region and an RHAU-specific motif (RSM) that is highly conserved between RHAU orthologs. The same RNA-binding domain is necessary and sufficient for RHAU recruitment to SGs. Finally we show that the ATPase activity of RHAU is involved in the dynamic regulation of RHAU shuttling into and out of SGs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The plasmids pTER-shRHAU and pTER-shLuc were described previously (30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasmids EGFP-RHAU, EGFP-Nter, EGFP-HCR, and EGFP-Cter were based on pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and EGFP-E335A (also termed DAIH in this study), which was derived from EGFP-RHAU by point mutation in motif II as described previously (30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasmids RHAU-EGFP, (50-1008)-EGFP, (105-1008)-EGFP, (1-130)-EGFP, and (1-105)-EGFP were based on pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) by inserting corresponding fragments into the BglII (XhoI for RHAU full length) and AgeI sites of the vector. Plasmids EGFP-(50-1008) and EGFP-(105-1008) were prepared by inserting the corresponding fragments between BglII and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1. RHAU-FLAG, (50-1008)-FLAG, (105-1008)-FLAG, (1-105)-FLAG, and (1-130)-FLAG were prepared by inserting corresponding RHAU fragments into the BglII (NheI for RHAU full length) and AgeI sites of pIRES.EGFP-N1-FLAG. The vector was prepared by insertion of IRES.EGFP between AgeI and NotI of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The IRES.EGFP insert was designed by PCR using the pIRES.ECMV-EGFP vector, which was kindly provided by D. Schmitz Rohmer and B. A. Hemmings, as a template. The PCR product of the IRES.EGFP insert contained FLAG sequence with the AgeI site on the 5′ end and the NotI site on the 3′ end. Plasmids β-gal-(1-52)-EGFP, β-gal-(1-130)-EGFP, and β-gal-(52-200)-EGFP were prepared by inserting corresponding RHAU fragments into EcoRI and SalI sites of pβ-gal-EGFP. 4F. Iwamoto and Y. Fujiki, unpublished data. The GST-RHAU vector was designed as described previously (26.Tran H. Schilling M. Wirbelauer C. Hess D. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). GST-Nter was prepared by inserting the fragment (1-200 aa) between BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The oligonucleotides used in this work and detailed descriptions of the plasmid construction are available upon request.Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-RHAU antibody (12F33) was generated against a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of RHAU, 991-1007 aa, as described previously (31.Vaughn J.P. Creacy S.D. Routh E.D. Joyner-Butt C. Jenkins G.S. Pauli S. Nagamine Y. Akman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38117-38120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Commercially obtained antibodies were: mouse anti-green fluorescent protein (B-2, sc-9996), goat anti-TIA-1 (sc-1751), goat anti-eIF3b (N-20, sc-16377), mouse anti-HuR (3A2, sc-5261), and rabbit anti-eIF2α (FL-315, sc-11386) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-actin (pan Ab-5, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA); rabbit monoclonal anti-eIF2α-P (Ser-51, 119A11, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); and mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich). The mouse antibodies were all monoclonal.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stress Treatments—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. T-REx-HeLa cells stably transfected with pTER-shRHAU were maintained as described previously (30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To induce short hairpin RNA expression and consequent depletion of endogenous RHAU, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for 7 days as described in supplemental Fig. 1. For immunofluorescence analysis, transient transfection of DNA plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was performed according to the manual provided using 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE 6/35-mm dish. For immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen). Briefly HeLa cells were seeded at 0.8 × 106 cells/35-mm dish and 24 h later were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were used 24 h later for the following experiments. RNA interference silencing was induced by transient transfection of small interfering RNAs with INTERFERin (Polyplus Transfection, New York, NY) following the manual instructions. Small interfering RNA was added to give a final concentration of 2.5 nm in 2 ml of medium and 8 μl of INTERFERin for transfection of 40% confluent cells in each 35-mm dish. To test SG formation, 0.5 mm sodium arsenite (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 μm hippuristanol (kindly provided by J. Tanaka (32.Mazroui R. Sukarieh R. Bordeleau M.E. Kaufman R.J. Northcote P. Tanaka J. Gallouzi I. Pelletier J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4212-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)) was added in conditioned medium for 45 or 30 min, respectively. To induce SGs with the ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), cells were washed with 1× PBS- (PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and cultured in glucose- and pyruvate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μm CCCP. Heat shock was performed at 44 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 45 min.Immunocytochemistry and Image Processing—At 24 h after transfection by FuGENE 6, HeLa cells were replated in 12-well dishes with coverslips coated with 0.2% gelatin. The next day, cells were treated with the indicated stimuli, fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS- for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer (25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 60 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) for 30 min and blocked with 5% horse serum in PHEM buffer for 1 h. All steps were performed at room temperature. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies (goat anti-TIA-1 (1:200), mouse anti-HuR (1:200), and goat anti-eIF3b (1:200)) diluted in the blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips with fixed cells were washed three times with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer and incubated in the dark with the secondary antibody and 500 ng/ml DAPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to identify the nuclei for 40 min at room temperature. Cy2-, Cy3-, or Cy5-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used at dilutions of 1:200, 1:2,000, or 1:200 with 2.5% horse serum in PHEM buffer, respectively. The cells were mounted in FluoroMount reagent (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescent images were captured with a confocal microscope (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) as described previously (30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) except that a Plan-NeoFluar 100×/1.3 oil differential interference contrast objective was used. The data obtained were processed using standard image software (Bitplane Imaris 5.7.1, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator). To quantify association of RHAU with SGs, at least 100 transfected cells were analyzed under the wide spectrum microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss) and scored as positive when the green fluorescent protein signal was enriched and co-localized with TIA-1 in SGs. Three (n = 3) independent transfections were analyzed to calculate mean percentages and ±S.E.Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—To prepare total cell lysates, cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Typically 30 μg of the total cell lysate was loaded for Western blotting. The protein bands were visualized with the direct infrared fluorescence method or the chemiluminescence method as described previously (30.Iwamoto F. Stadler M. Chalupnikova K. Oakeley E. Nagamine Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1378-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Cross-linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP)—RHAU and RNA interaction was determined by the previously reported CLIP method with slight modifications (33.Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (0.8 × 106/35-mm dish) were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and then UV irradiated (400 mJ/cm2) to induce cross-linking between protein and RNA. Cells were then lysed with 200 μl of RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin)/well in a 6-well dish and shaken for 15 min at 4 °C. Pooled lysates from 6 wells were treated with 30 μl of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (1 unit/μl; Promega, Madison, WI) and with 31 units of RNase A (31 units/μl; USB Corp.) as described in the CLIP protocol (33.Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Treated samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (600 μg) were incubated with 4.5 μg of a mouse anti-RHAU monoclonal antibody (12F33) or 10 μl (bed volume) of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220, Sigma-Aldrich) with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer, twice with high salt washing buffer (5× PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and twice with 1× PNK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The associated nucleic acids were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) as described in the CLIP protocol (33.Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Methods. 2005; 37: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and RHAU-RNA complexes were resolved in a NuPAGE 4-12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitated RHAU was detected by Coomassie Blue staining and in-gel Western blotting according to the manual of Odyssey In-Gel Western detection (LI-COR Biosciences). Half of the samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to facilitate better protein detection by Western blotting and to remove free RNA. The proteins were detected by the Odyssey infrared imager as described above. Radiolabeled RNA was detected by a phosphorimaging system, Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare), and analyzed using the ImageQuant TL program. To test whether RHAU associates with RNA, bound nucleic acids were isolated and radiolabeled according to the CLIP protocol (33.Ule J. Jensen K. Mele A. Darnell R.B.

Nucleic acids were mixed with increasing amounts of RNase A (0.015, 0.15, 1.5, and 15 units) in H2O and 1 unit of RQ1 DNase in 1× RQ1 DNase reaction buffer. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and resolved by denaturing 8% PAGE in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer.Protein Purification—Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-Nter proteins were induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 25 °C and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-RHAU protein was expressed in Sf9 cells according to the supplier's instructions (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and purified as above. The purity of recombinant proteins was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining as reported in supplemental Fig. 2.Double Filter RNA Binding Assay—5 μg of total RNA isolated from HeLa cells was alkali-treated with 0.1 m NaOH on ice for 10 min and then EtOH-precipitated. Redissolved RNA or poly(rU) (P9528, Sigma-Aldrich) was 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min and passed through a G-50 column (GE Healthcare) to remove free nucleotides. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing varying amounts of recombinant proteins (0-150 nm as specified in text), radiolabeled RNA (poly(rU), 10,000 cpm; total RNA, 5,000 cpm) and 2 units of RNase inhibitor (RNAguard, Roche Applied Science) in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm NaCl) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The double filter RNA binding assay was performed with a slot-blot apparatus using a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose (Protran, Whatman) and nylon membranes (positively charged; Roche Diagnostics) that was presoaked in different buffers as described previously (34.Tanaka N. Schwer B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9795-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Loaded samples were washed three times with 200 μl of the binding buffer. Retained RNA was detected with a phosphorimaging system, Typhoon 9400, and analyzed using the ImageQuant TL program. The nitrocellulose membrane retains only RNA-protein complexes, and free RNAs are captured on the nylon membrane. The ratio of RNA that was bound to GST-RHAU or GST-Nter was calculate using the following formula: bound RNA (%) = 100((signalnitrocellulose)/(signalnitrocellulose + signalnylon)).Bioinformatics—The program RNABindR (35.Terribilini M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W578-W584Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used to predict RNA binding potential in amino acid sequences. Programs RISP (RNA-Interaction Site Prediction) and BindN+ were used to confirm the reliability of the RNABindR program: RISP (36.Tong J. Jiang P. Lu Z.H. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 2008; 90: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) runs with 72.2% RNA binding prediction accuracy, and BindN+ (37.Jeong E. Chung I.F. Miyano S. Genome Inform. 2004; 15: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar) runs with 68% RNA binding prediction accuracy. For multiple sequence alignments of N termini, RHAU orthologs were identified by a BLASTP (version 2.2.18+) search of non-redundant protein entries in the NCBI data base using the entire sequence of RHAU as a query. Multiple sequence alignment was carried out with ProbCons (version 1.12) (38.Do C.B. Mahabhashyam M.S. Brudno M. Batzoglou S. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2073607907,"Background M-CSF recruits mononuclear phagocytes which regulate processes such as angiogenesis and metastases in tumors. VEGF is a potent activator of angiogenesis as it promotes endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation. Previously, we reported that in vitro M-CSF induces the expression of biologically-active VEGF from human monocytes. Methodology and Results In this study, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of M-CSF-induced VEGF production. Using a construct containing the VEGF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter, we found that a mutation reducing HIF binding to the VEGF promoter had no significant effect on luciferase production induced by M-CSF stimulation. Further analysis revealed that M-CSF induced VEGF through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway via the transcription factor, Sp1. Thus, inhibition of either ERK or Sp1 suppressed M-CSF-induced VEGF at the mRNA and protein level. M-CSF also induced the nuclear localization of Sp1, which was blocked by ERK inhibition. Finally, mutating the Sp1 binding sites within the VEGF promoter or inhibiting ERK decreased VEGF promoter activity in M-CSF-treated human monocytes. To evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF induced VEGF production, we used an in vivo angiogenesis model to illustrate the ability of M-CSF to recruit mononuclear phagocytes, increase VEGF levels, and enhance angiogenesis. Importantly, the addition of a neutralizing VEGF antibody abolished M-CSF-induced blood vessel formation. Conclusion These data delineate an ERK- and Sp1-dependent mechanism of M-CSF induced VEGF production and demonstrate for the first time the ability of M-CSF to induce angiogenesis via VEGF in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2117254609,"Understanding of the magnitude and direction of the exchange of individuals among geographically separated subpopulations that comprise a metapopulation (connectivity) can lead to an improved ability to forecast how fast coral reef organisms are likely to recover from disturbance events that cause extensive mortality. Reef corals that brood their larvae internally and release mature larvae are believed to show little exchange of larvae over ecological times scales and are therefore expected to recover extremely slowly from large-scale perturbations.Using analysis of ten DNA microsatellite loci, we show that although Great Barrier Reef (GBR) populations of the brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, are mostly self-seeded and some populations are highly isolated, a considerable amount of sexual larvae (up to approximately 4%) has been exchanged among several reefs 10 s to 100 s km apart over the past few generations. Our results further indicate that S. hystrix is capable of producing asexual propagules with similar long-distance dispersal abilities (approximately 1.4% of the sampled colonies had a multilocus genotype that also occurred at another sampling location), which may aid in recovery from environmental disturbances.Patterns of connectivity in this and probably other GBR corals are complex and need to be resolved in greater detail through genetic characterisation of different cohorts and linkage of genetic data with fine-scale hydrodynamic models."

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; Ang, angiotensin.2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; Ang, angiotensin. represent a large group of receptors that are directly involved in cellular signaling networks and are considered to be an important family of targets for pharmacological intervention (reviewed in Ref. 1.Imming P. Sinning C. Meyer A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It is estimated that approximately one-third of therapeutic development in the pharmaceutical industry is targeted toward drug discovery in the area of GPCRs (2.Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the human genome identified over 800 putative members of the GPCR superfamily, over half of which are thought to be involved in sensory mechanisms and are not considered to be drug targets. Among the known GPCRs, ∼300 are considered potential pharmaceutical targets (3.Lin S.H. Civelli O. Ann. Med. 2004; 36: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Out of this group around 150 GPCRs have no designated natural/endogenous ligand or activator. These receptors are termed “orphan GPCRs” and have recently become very attractive to many industrial and academic researchers as they hold great potential as targets for novel drug discovery (4.Leifert W.R. Aloia A.L. Bucco O. Glatz R.V. McMurchie E.J. J. Biomol. Screen. 2005; 10: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lately, a major effort was made by many academic institutes as well as biotech and pharmaceutical companies to identify both natural and surrogate ligands for both known and orphan GPCRs (5.Kutzleb C. Busmann A. Wendland M. Maronde E. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6.Jiang Z. Zhou Y. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2006; 7: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The most common method to screen for novel GPCR activators is through large scale screening of hundreds and thousands of compounds on many GPCRs, testing for in vitro activation of any given receptor by assessing its signaling response of an expressing cell to binding of a specific compound or tissue extract. This method, called “reverse pharmacology” (7.Howard A.D. McAllister G. Feighner S.D. Liu Q. Nargund R.P. Van der Ploeg L.H. Patchett A.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 132-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8.Civelli O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), gave rise in the past decade to over 30 new receptor/ligand pairs and many previously known or novel ligands, most of them peptides (5.Kutzleb C. Busmann A. Wendland M. Maronde E. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, this method is very expensive and time-consuming and might lead to many potential ligands either being missed or falsely annotated (6.Jiang Z. Zhou Y. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2006; 7: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 9.Eglen R.M. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2005; 8: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To increase the feasibility of this type of testing, it is necessary to pre-screen any potential group of ligands and focus on high chance, low risk candidates. This might allow more thorough screening and validation of true novel activators with better chances of becoming therapies. Computational screening can supplement experimental efforts as a preliminary screening tool for efficient identification of natural ligands, especially peptides (10.Bock J.R. Gough D.A. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2005; 45: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics can serve as a powerful tool that provides reliable predictive measures to select for the high potential candidates and provide a spotlight pointed at potential new candidates for experimental discovery, thereby enabling higher success rates in identification of novel GPCR ligands (11.Huang E.S. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the experimental validation of computationally discovered novel GPCR-activating peptides. A subgroup of 33 potential candidate peptides was experimentally screened. Here we report the in vitro validation of eight novel GPCR peptide activators (hit rate of ∼25%) as potential candidates for related clinical utilities. One of the examined peptides was tested in vivo and was found effective in a mouse inflammation model. Data Set Preparation for the Proteolytic Site Predictor—All mammalian proteins (28,780) were downloaded from the Swiss Protein Database (release 43) (12.Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Wu C.H. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B. Ferro S. Gasteiger E. Huang H. Lopez R. Magrane M. Martin M.J. Natale D.A. O'Donovan C. Redaschi N. Yeh L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D154-D159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Of these, 11,705 proteins were classified as secreted or membrane proteins according to Swiss-Prot annotation. From these 11,705 proteins, 553 experimentally validated 18-mer peptide convertase proteolytic sites were extracted based on Swiss-Prot FT annotation lines. This subset of sequences was used as a learning set for Breiman's random forest classifier algorithm (13.Breiman L. Machine Learning. 2001; 45: 5-32Crossref Scopus (65007) Google Scholar), whereas the negative set (non proteolytic sites) consisted of all extracellular 18-mers, excluding the boundaries of pro-peptides, chains, and peptides, according to Swiss-Prot annotations. Creation of a Predicted Human Peptidome Dataset—A predicted human secretome was generated by analyzing human proteins from the following two sources: (i) the Uniprot/Swiss Protein Database (version 47) and (ii) Refseq sequences from the NCBI nr protein data base (GenBank™ version 149). There were 29,530 proteins from NCBI nr, including proteins with various validation annotations, reviewed, predicted, and modeled. The annotation for Uniprot proteins was used to filter out proteins that do not have a signal peptide, validated or predicted. For NCBI nr proteins, the SignalP 3.0 software (14.Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunk S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar) was used to predict the existence and location of a signal peptide. For each protein precursor sequence, the following procedure was used to create the potential peptide products of the precursor. (The full cleavage prediction concept is detailed in Kliger et al. (15.Kliger Y. Gofer E. Wool A. Toporik A. Apatoff A. Olshansky M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2008; 24: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).) The predicted signal peptide was removed, and potential cleavage sites were scored based on the outcome of the machine learning algorithm used for cleavage site prediction. Based on precision/recall analysis, each putative cleavage site was assigned a score value between 0 and 10, where 0 represents a known cleavage site (as annotated on Uniprot) and 10 corresponds to unlikely cleavage sites. Sites with a score of 4 or less, and sites that contained two consecutive basic amino acids (e.g. Arg or Lys), regardless of their score, were selected. Peptides whose end points were either a selected cleavage site or an end point of the precursor (signal peptide cleavage site at the N terminus or the C terminus of the precursor) were created. Peptides longer than 100 amino acids were discarded. It should be noted that different peptides from the same precursor may have an overlapping sequence, and one can be a sub-sequence of another. The peptide set was extended by sequentially removing C-terminal basic amino acids and removing an additional C-terminal glycine, leaving an amide attached to the C terminus of the peptide (this mimics a known natural peptide maturation process called “glycine-directed peptide amidation”). All the intermediate peptides resulting from this extension were considered as separate peptide products. The complete list of predicted peptides (the “peptidome”) contained hundreds of thousands of peptides, which were then analyzed as a source data by the GPCR-activating ligand predictor. GPCR Ligand Predictor—The set of known GPCR peptide ligands was extracted from Uniprot, using the Uniprot annotation (SRS from Swiss-Prot and by relevant keywords from GPCRDB (16.Horn F. Bettler E. Oliveira L. Campagne F. Cohn F.E. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)) and was manually curated based on literature search. The sequence lengths and positions of the peptides were extracted from the Swiss-Prot feature table. The learning data set contained 64 precursors and 123 peptides. Of these, 87 did not overlap with another peptide of the same precursor. Several known GPCR ligands were removed from the learning set (for example, the chemokine family and the hormone proteins that are larger than 100 amino acids) giving an average peptide size of 26 amino acids. The learning process also required a negative set of peptides that are not known as GPCR peptide ligands. Two negative sets of peptides were constructed. The first set was extracted based on Uniprot using annotations to filter peptides that are not GPCR peptide ligands. The second set was a collection of 3000 randomly chosen peptides from the novel peptide data base (peptidome) described above. Using the generated learning set, a classifier based on the “Random Forest” algorithm (13.Breiman L. Machine Learning. 2001; 45: 5-32Crossref Scopus (65007) Google Scholar) was implemented to select peptides that are likely to be GPCR ligands. Following a thorough optimization process, the classifier was programmed to analyze the following index parameters. The length of the peptide (in amino acids). The frequency of each amino acid in the peptide relative to the peptide length (21 parameters, one for each amino acid and an extra parameter for those that are not conventional amino acids). The amino acids in proximity to the N-terminal cleavage site from both sides as follows: the first four amino acids in the N terminus of the peptide and the last four amino acids of the precursor preceding the cleavage site (eight parameters, and each can be one of 21 values, one for each amino acid and an extra value for other letters or for amino acids beyond the signal peptide cleavage site). This parameter (four amino acids) was found most effective in the optimization process. The amino acids in proximity to the C-terminal cleavage site from both sides are as follows: the last three amino acids in the C terminus of the peptide and the first three amino acids of the precursor following the cleavage site (six parameters, each can be one of 21 values, one for each amino acid and an extra value for other letters or for amino acids beyond the precursor end). This parameter (3 amino acids) was found most effective in the optimization process. The last entry is the number of coding exons in the gene coding for of the precursor. Based on these numeric parameters the classifying program was trained to distinguish between the learning set of known ligands (true set) and the negative (false) set. This program was then used to give each predicted peptide a score signifying the likelihood of being a GPCR-activating ligand. At the end of the process, a dataset of 100 peptides with the highest classifier scores was created. These peptides underwent a manual expert analysis process and literature review by a few different biologists. The selection of GPCR-activating peptides was based on the following criteria: expression profile and tissue specificity of the precursor, with relation to the receptor; comparison of the cleavage and GPCR classifier scores of the candidate peptides and their mouse orthologs; conservation of the sequence and cleavage sites of the peptide in the precursor proteins of all orthologs; position of the peptide within the precursor with respect to known domains and features (as a negative rule); and the number of cysteine residues and disulfide bridge annotations. The peptides were also checked for their novelty status based upon the comparison with sequences appearing in patent data bases with very strict exclusion parameters. This process resulted in a subset of 35 confirmed novel peptides most likely to be GPCR ligands. Peptide Synthesis—For each peptide, from the subset of 35 peptides, a number of modifications were made to enhance stability and functionality. In peptides containing a single cysteine residue, the cysteine was replaced by either a serine or a valine depending on the hydrophobicity and amino acid content of the peptide. For peptides containing a glycine residue at the C terminus, the glycine was replaced by an amide. Peptides were synthesized (10 mg) by Pepscan Inc. (The Netherlands) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to >90% (confirmed by mass spectrometry). Apart from one peptide that failed synthesis, and one insoluble peptide, which was discarded, all remaining 33 peptides were soluble in PBS or in Lab-grade purified water. G-protein-coupled Receptor Selection—The list of receptors was generated by ranking all human (GPCRDB (16.Horn F. Bettler E. Oliveira L. Campagne F. Cohn F.E. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)) receptors according to their clinical relevance. All known odorant and taste receptors were omitted. GPCRs known to be activated by non-peptide ligands and small molecules (such as dopamine, serotonin, purines, etc.) were removed from the list together with receptors for proteins (size over 50 amino acids) such as chemokines. The final list of receptors contained mainly peptide-activated GPCRs together with receptors annotated as orphan, with a predicted high probability of being activated by a peptide (based upon sequence similarity and evolutionary relation to GPCRs activated by peptides and literature searches). Each receptor was also assessed for its most potent known ligand as a positive control for the screening experiments. GPCR Screening for Ca2+ Activation by the Predicted Peptides—The experimental screening was done by Applied Cell Sciences, Inc., on all the selected GPCRs by utilizing the promiscuous Gα16 to divert signaling to the Gq pathway, thus enabling readout of GPCR activation by testing for Ca2+ flux as described (17.Liu A.M. Ho M.K. Wong C.S. Chan J.H. Pau A.H. Wong Y.H. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peptides were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. All plates were stored at –80 °C until used. cDNA clones of the GPCRs were commercially obtained in one of the following expression vectors: pcDNA3.1, pCMV6, or MO2. Transient transfections were performed using CHO-K1 cells as host cells. Cells (12 millions) were plated into T75 flasks on the day preceding transfection. Cells were transfected with a GPCR DNA and Gα16 using a lipid technique according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Cells were transfected for 5 h, then re-plated into 96-well dishes (60,000 cells per well), and grown overnight. On the day of the experiment, cells were loaded with Fluo4-NW (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Plates were loaded into a FlexStation™ (Molecular Devices) plate reader, and fluorescence was monitored. Seventeen seconds following initiation of reading, cells were stimulated with the indicated agonist/compound at final concentration of 1 μm. Each 96-well plate contained each of the examined peptides in triplicate. We defined a hit as a peptide that elicited a clear and distinct increase in intracellular calcium that is clearly visible and statistically significant (using a t test comparing the levels of calcium before and after peptide addition with p value lower than 0.001) upon examination of the calcium trace for at least two repeats. GPCR Screening for Cyclic AMP Accumulation with Candidate Peptides—Applied Cell Sciences transiently transfected 13 different GPCRs included within the list of screened receptors into CHO-K1 cells as described previously. Transfected cells were plated into 24 wells of a 96-well plate. Cells were pretreated with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (stimulation buffer) for 10 min at 37 °C, then stimulated with either a positive control or a candidate peptide (for Gs functional examination), followed by stimulation or a preincubation with 10 μm forskolin (for Gi functional examination). Following a 20-min stimulation with 1 μm of either positive control or the tested peptides, either with or without forskolin, intracellular cAMP was assayed using the Hit Hunter cAMP kit (DiscoveRx Corp.), according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Data were converted to nanomoles of cAMP by running a standard cAMP curve. Dose Response of GPCR Activation and Affinity (EC50) Measurements—Cells were transfected as described above. Each peptide was added, in triplicate, according to functional assay selected (either Ca2+ or cAMP) in final concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm and 1 and 3 μm. All peptides were examined and compared with similar concentrations of a selected positive control (as described in Table 1). EC50 best fit values (representing affinity) were calculated by nonlinear regression of sigmoidal dose-response curves, using Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). The formula for the sigmoidal dose-response curves was defined as Y=bottom+(top−bottom)/(1+10∧(logEC50−X)×Hill slope)).TABLE 1Novel peptides that were found to activate GPCRsPeptide nameProtein name of precursorSwiss-Prot IDSequenceP33HWKM1940Q6UWF9_HUMANSMCHRWSRAVLFPAAHRPaUnderlined Cys was replaced by Val for the validation experiment.P58B9Q9UPM9_HUMANTIPMFVPESTSKLQKFTSWFMGbC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.P58-5LQKFTSWFMGbC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.P58-4FTSWFMGbC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.P59Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 8 (Precursor)C1QT8_HUMANGQKGQVGPPGAACRRAYAAFSVGaUnderlined Cys was replaced by Val for the validation experiment., bC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.P74Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 8 (Precursor)C1QT8_HUMANGQKGQVGPPGAACRRAYAAFSVGRRAYAAFSVGaUnderlined Cys was replaced by Val for the validation experiment., bC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.P60Uncharacterized protein C5orf29CE029_HUMANGIGCVWHWKHRVATRFTLPRFLQcUnderlined Cys was replaced by Ser for the validation experiment.P61TIMM9Q6UXN7_HUMANFLGYCIYLNRKRRGDPAFKRRLRDcUnderlined Cys was replaced by Ser for the validation experiment.P63Bone morphogenetic protein 3b (Precursor)BMP3B_HUMANAHAQHFHKHQLWPSPFRALKPRPGbC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.P94Bone morphogenetic protein 3b (Precursor)BMP3B_HUMANAAQATGPLQDNELPGLDERPPRAHAQHFHKHQLWPSPFRALKPRPGbC-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.a Underlined Cys was replaced by Val for the validation experiment.b C-terminal glycine was replaced by an amide.c Underlined Cys was replaced by Ser for the validation experiment. Open table in a new tab In Vivo Activity of P58 and Its Derivates—Male out-bred Swiss albino mice were purchased from Harlan, UK (T.O. strain). All animals were housed for 7 days prior to experimentation to allow body weight to reach ∼25 g on the day of the experiment. Air pouches were formed by injecting 2.5 ml of sterile air subcutaneously to the back of the mice 3 and 6 days before the experiment. Before use, peptides were dissolved with pyrogen-free PBS (Invitrogen, catalog number 14190-094). Peptides or vehicle were administered intravenously at a final volume of 200 μl, at the indicated doses immediately before intra-pouch injection of 1 mg of zymosan A (Sigma). Four hours post-treatment, air pouches were washed with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 3 mm EDTA and 25 units/ml of heparin and kept on ice. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil content was determined by staining an aliquot of the lavage with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-GR-1 monoclonal antibody (eBiosciences). An irrelevant phycoerythrin-conjugated rat IgG2b antibody served as isotype control. Samples were analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences). For determination of total leukocytes, lavages diluted 1:10 in Turk's solution (0.01% crystal violet in 3% acetic acid) were analyzed using Neubauer hemocytometer and light microscope (Olympus B061). Statistical differences were determined by analysis of variance, plus Student Newman Keuls test. A p value <0.05 was taken as significant. Generation of in Silico Predicted Human GPCR-activating Peptides—A list of the 100 highest scoring peptides as potential GPCR ligands were manually examined and ranked according to additional peptide characteristics (see “Experimental Procedures”). Finally, 33 peptides were synthesized and screened against 152 GPCRs. Screening Results, Ca2+ Flux Assay—Screening was carried out on all types of GPCRs by utilizing the promiscuous Gα16 to divert signaling to the Gq pathway, thus enabling readouts of Gs,Gi, and Gq for the GPCR activation by testing for Ca2+ flux (17.Liu A.M. Ho M.K. Wong C.S. Chan J.H. Pau A.H. Wong Y.H. J. Biomol. Screen. 2003; 8: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The efficiency of this method in diverting either cAMP signaling into Ca2+ flux was estimated at ∼70% for Gi/Gs-activating receptors. Of the 152 receptors screened 54 were orphan receptors (according to the literature), and 98 GPCRs had known activating ligands (non-orphan). Of the 98 non-orphan receptors that were screened, 68 (∼70%) showed a response to a known agonist stimulation. Out of the 152 receptors screened by the Ca2+ flux activation assay, four receptors (MRGX1, MRGX2, MAS1, and FPRL1) showed distinct activation with at least one of the novel peptides added at a concentration of 1 μm. Six peptides (peptides P33, P58, P60, P61, P63, and P94; see Table 1) that showed either a moderate or a strong hit for either receptor were further examined by dose response on the specific GPCRs they activated. Curve analysis and affinity (EC50) calculation of the dose-response experiments were compared with the most potent activator for the receptor as described in the literature, and the results are illustrated in Table 2 and Fig. 1. In all cases, we were able to demonstrate a dose-dependent activation of Ca2+ flux with good correlation to the positive control used (Table 2).TABLE 2GPCRs activation and specificity by screened peptidesReceptorPositive controls (EC50 μm)P60P61P94P63P58P33P59P74Other GPCRsaReceptors were included in the screening.

Open table in a new tab We observed activation of MRGX1 with our peptide P60 (Tables 1 and 2). According to the dose-response experiments we conducted (Fig. 1), P60 activates MRGX1 in a dose-dependent manner, with affinity estimated within the nanomolar range, slightly lower than that of the positive control used (BAM22) (18.Burstein E.S. Ott T.R. Feddock M. Ma J.N. Fuhs S. Wong S. Schiffer H.H. Brann M.R. Nash N.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, further experimental results indicate that P60 and BAM22 differ in their activation of opioid-related receptors (19.Wollemann M. Benyhe S. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although BAM22 activates the latter, P60 is specific to MRGXs (activating MRGX1 and weakly activating MRGX2), and it did not activate any of the known opioid receptors (D1, M1, L1, and K1) that were included in the screen. For MRGX2, we identified several potential peptides (Table 2). According to dose-response experiments, the affinity of two of the novel peptides, P94 and P63 (Table 1), was similar to that of the positive control, cortistatin-14 (18.Burstein E.S. Ott T.R. Feddock M. Ma J.N. Fuhs S. Wong S. Schiffer H.H. Brann M.R. Nash N.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). However, unlike cortistatin-14, none of the peptides had any effect upon the receptors of the somatostatin family (SSTR 1–5) that are known to be activated by cortistatin-14. The FPRL1 (ALX) receptor is involved in regulation of inflammation by controlling leukocytes activities such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis (20.Iribarren P. Zhou Y. Hu J. Le Wang J.M. Immunol. Res. 2005; 31: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Perretti M. D'Acquisto F. Inflamm. Allergy Drug Targets. 2006; 5: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We identified several peptides that activated this receptor, P58, P94, and P33 (Tables 1 and 2). The leading hit, peptide P58, exhibited in dose-response experiments higher potency and higher affinity than formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, which was used as a positive control, although it is not the most potent agonist for this receptor (22.VanCompernolle S.E. Claek K.L. Rummel K.A. Todd S.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Importantly, P58, as well as none of the other peptides examined, did not activate another family member, FPR1. However, a recent experiment 3I. Hecht, J. Rong, A. L. F. Samapio, C. Hermesh, C. Rutledge, R. Shemesh, A. Toporik, M. Beiman, L. Dassa, H. Niv, G. Cojocaru, A. Zuberman, G. Rotman, M. Perretti, J. Vinten-Johansen, and Y. Cohen, manuscript in preparation. indicates a dose-dependent activation of FPRL2, a closer family member (data not shown). We also identified two peptides, P61 and P33 (Table 1), that dose-dependently activated the MAS1 receptor (Table 2 and Fig. 1). In agreement with previous publications, we were unable to demonstrate calcium flux induction by the positive control (Ang 1–7), a known ligand for MAS1 (23.Santos R.A. Simoes e Silva A.C. Maric C. Silva D.M. Machado R.P. de Buhr I. Heringer-Walther S. Pinheiro S.V. Lopes M.T. Bader M. Mendes E.P. Lemos V.S. Campagnole-Santos M.J. Schultheiss H.-P. Speth R. Walther T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). However, our peptides did activate the receptor at concentrations similar to that found for dynorphin A (an established surrogate, lower affinity activator of MAS1). Our peptides were specific to MAS1 and did not activate AT1 or AT2, angiotensin II receptors which are known to be weakly activated by Ang 1–7 (Table 2). Cyclic AMP Screening Assay Results—Because the promiscuous Gα16 does not always divert a cAMP-related signal to Ca2+ accumulation, a subset of 13 GPCRs with very low activation by either the positive controls or any of the novel examined peptides was selected to be tested for Gi/Gs activation by 2 of the 33 examined peptides. These receptors were screened for cAMP accumulation (Gs) or inhibition (Gi) as described below. Two of the peptides (P59 and P74, see Table 1) showed distinct Gi-dependent activation of two related GPCRs (LGR7 (RXFP1) and LGR8 (RXFP2), see Table 2 and Fig. 2). Both of these receptors were recently identified as being activated by Relaxin and INSL3, respectively (24.Halls M.L. Bathgate R.A. Summers R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A much weaker hit on LGR4, an orphan family member (data not shown), was also observed. Specificity was examined by GPR135 (RXFP3), a receptor for Relaxin 3, which was not activated by peptide P59 (Table 2). In Vivo Activation of the FPRL1 Receptor by P58—FPRL1 activation promotes resolution of inflammation, an active and tightly synchronized process, involving counter-regulation of leukocytes, which leads to a prominent anti-inflammatory effect (21.Perretti M. D'Acquisto F. Inflamm. Allergy Drug Targets. 2006; 5: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To study the in vivo activity of our novel FPRL1 peptide agonist, P58, and two of its derivatives (P58-4 and P58-5), we used a model of acute inflammation, involving zymosan-induced leukocyte recruitment into the murine dorsal air pouch (see “Experimental Procedures”). The novel peptide P58 as well as P58-4 and P58-5 were tested at doses of 20 and 80 nmol per mouse and were given intravenously at the time of zymosan A injection (time 0). These doses correspond to 50 and 200 μg of P58 per mouse, respectively; and equivalent doses were used for the shorter peptides. Cell recruitment into the air pouches was determined at the 4-h time point, using both light microscopy (for total leukocyte count) and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for Gr1-stained cells (for assessment of PMNs). A significant inhibition of about 50% was observed in the infiltration of PMNs into the air pouch with P58 at 20 nmol/mouse (Fig. 3). Out of the two derivatives tested, P58-4 displayed a 47% inhibition of Gr1+ cell migration into air pouches at the highest dose tested (80 nmol/mouse). P58-5 produced a discrete effect at the highest dose that was not statistically significant. Similar effects were observed on total leukocyte counts (data not shown). In this work we describe the results of a screen for novel peptide GPCR agonists. A subset of the predicted candidate peptides was screened on a large group of GPCRs, and eight peptide agonists were identified for six different GPCRs. The peptides activity was further validated experimentally using established biochemical assays such as dose-dependent induction of calcium flux and by assessing the efficacy in vivo in one case. By utilizing bioinformatic capabilities and machine learning, tools both related to identifying all potential secreted proteins (the secretome), and predicting all potential Arg/Lys cleavage sites, we were able to create a comprehensive peptidome that includes hundreds of thousands of potential peptides, ranked and prioritized by computational scores. Sequences of the predicted peptidome were further analyzed for features and assigned a probability score of being GPCR ligands by a machine learning algorithm. This collection contained hundreds of candidate peptides that were scored and ranked by distinct parameters and expert examination. The highest scoring candidates were checked for novelty and synthesized for further screening for activation on a group of target GPCRs. The screening included 33 peptides that were screened for activation of 152 GPCRs selected according to relevance and availability. Out of the 33 peptides screened, 8 (∼25%) showed a distinct activation of at least one receptor. The ratio of successful candidates is remarkable when compared with the average ratio of novel GPCR peptide ligand discovery rate, which is on average around two to three new candidates per year in the past decade (25.Katugampola S. Davenport A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 30-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All of these peptides are novel, and most of them are derived from hypothetical protein precursors. Most of the peptides that showed initial hits also displayed dose-response activation. Furthermore, one of the peptides, designated peptide P58 (now named CGEN855A), which showed a dose-dependent activation of the FPRL1 receptor, was further examined for in vivo activation of the FPRL1 receptor using a murine model of acute inflammation. The activation of FPRL1, as determined by inhibition of PMNs infiltration, was found to be significant. Moreover, out of two subsequent peptides derived from P58, P58-4 (now CGEN-855B) and P58-5 (now CGEN-855C), at least one (P58-4) was found to invoke an in vivo response mediated by the FPRL1 receptor, similar to the original P58 peptide. An examination of the activation of the receptors by the novel peptides shows cross-hits of the same peptides on several different GPCRs. This does not seem surprising because some of the receptors, such as the two relaxin-related GPCRs, namely RXFP1 (LGR7) and RXFP2 (LGR8), belong to the same family, whereas the others (MAS1, MRGX1, MRGX2, and FPRL1) belong to the same evolutionary branch (according to Ref. 26.Joost P. Methner A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 63Crossref Google Scholar). Even though no sequence homology was found between the newly discovered peptides and the known GPCR ligands, we predict that other structural properties (such as secondary structure) might show a mechanistic resemblance between the novel and known peptides. A preliminary computational structural prediction of the eight novel peptides by using the PSIPRED (27.McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) secondary structure predictor revealed that all of them contain at least one helical stretch, a feature common in many known peptide GPCR ligands (data not shown). We conclude that we were able to show efficacy and a proof of concept for our discovery platform of GPCR peptide agonists. We believe that we will be able to broaden our analysis and discover additional novel peptide GPCR ligands by this method. We further predict that more of the newly discovered and validated activators found for these GPCRs will be further investigated for their potential as therapeutic compounds targeted at receptors involved in distinct diseases and conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2071506601,"Transposable elements, originally discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock, are discrete DNA segments that can insert into new chromosomal locations either by a “cut and paste” or by a “copy and paste” mechanism. Transposable elements are involved in a wide variety of biological transactions including genome alteration by element insertion or deletion and homologous recombination between element copies. They fall into two classes according to whether their transposition intermediate is RNA (class 1 or retrotransposons) or DNA (class 2 or DNA-based transposons). Recent genome sequencing projects have revealed that transposable elements make up a major portion of most vertebrate genomes. For example, transposable elements account for almost 50% of the human genome. This table summarizes different types of transposable element content in human, mouse, opossum, platypus, chicken, and fugu."

Intensive insulin treatment can delay the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy and other vascularopathies, yet little is known about insulin regulation of anti-apoptotic and antioxidant molecules such as HO-1 in vascular cells. Intravitreous injection or in vitro addition of insulin increased HO-1 protein expression in rat retina and in cultured bovine retinal pericytes, retinal endothelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells. In bovine retinal pericytes, insulin induced mRNA and protein expression of HO-1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Using HO-1 promoter analysis, the luciferase reporter assay showed that induction of HO-1 expression by insulin is mediated by additional response elements in the ho-1 promoter gene, which was not responsive to antioxidants. Insulin-induced HO-1 mRNA expression through activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway without affecting ERK and p38 MAPK. Overexpression of an adenoviral vector of native IRS1, IRS2, and Akt dominant negative or small interfering RNA transfection of Akt1 and Akt2 targeted gene demonstrated that insulin regulated HO-1 expression via IRS1 and Akt2 pathway, selectively. Further, insulin treatment prevented H2O2-induced NF-;B and caspase-8 activation and apoptosis via the IRS1/PI3K/Akt2/HO-1 pathway in the pericytes. In conclusion, we suggest that the anti-apoptotic properties of insulin are mediated partly by increasing HO-1 expression at transcriptional level via IRS1/PI3K/Akt2 activation, a potential explanation for how insulin is retarding the progression of microvascular complications induced by diabetes.

Oxidative stress, as a result of hyperglycemia and diabetes, has been postulated to be a major metabolic abnormality causing a variety of cellular dysfunctions and vascular pathologies (1Duckworth W.C.

Ruderman N.B. Schmieder F. Boden G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2005-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Large clinical studies such as Diabetes Complications and Control Trial and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications trials have clearly identified hyperglycemia as one of the main initiating factors of diabetic complications that can be mitigated by insulin treatment in type 1 diabetic patients (7Author A.B. the DCCT Research GroupN. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (22519) Google Scholar, 8The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research GroupN. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). One of the earliest and most specific histopathological findings associated with hyperglycemia and diabetic retinopathy is the selective loss of retinal capillary pericytes, probably because of apoptosis (9Kuwabara T. Cogan D.G. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1963; 69: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Many studies have proposed that oxidative stress via elevation of glucose levels is one of the potential triggers of the increased rate of pericyte apoptosis (10Kim J. Kim K.S. Shinn J.W. Oh Y.S. Kim H.T. Jo I. Shinn S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Mustata G.T. Rosca M. Biemel K.M. Reihl O. Smith M.A. Viswanathan A.

Antioxidant treatments have been reported to ameliorate diabetic retinopathy by preserving retinal vascular pericytes in rodent models of diabetes (12Kowluru R.A. Acta Diabetol. 2001; 38: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in large clinical studies, including the Heart Outcomes Prevention Study, antioxidant treatments such as vitamins C and E did not provide substantial improvement of microvascular or cardiovascular damage in individuals who had diabetes for several years (13Gerstein H.C. Bosch J. Pogue J. Taylor D.W. Zinman B. Yusuf S. Diabetes Care. 1996; 19: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that in addition to normalizing hyperglycemia, insulin may directly affect the endogenous antioxidant defense to neutralize the intracellular elevation of oxidants induced by the metabolism of elevated levels of glucose or free fatty acids.Heme oxygenase (HO) plays an important key role in regulating the intracellular heme level by catalyzing the initial and rate-limiting step of heme degradation, in which oxidative cleavage of the porphyrin ring results in formation of biliverdin, CO, and free iron (14Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 15Shibahara S. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 370-376PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated the potent antioxidant activity of biliverdin and bilirubin and the cytoprotective action of CO on vascular cells (16Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Sciences (N. Y.). 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar). To date, three isoforms of mammalian HO have been identified: HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3 (15Shibahara S. Semin. Hematol. 1988; 25: 370-376PubMed Google Scholar, 17McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, HO-1, the inducible 32-kDa isoform, is highly expressed in liver and spleen, whereas HO-2, the constitutive 36-kDa isoform, is expressed mainly in brain and testis. HO-3, a 33-kDa isoform that closely resembles HO-2, has been detected in many tissues including the spleen, liver, thymus, prostate, heart, kidney, brain, and testis but has very low enzyme activity compared with that of the other two isoforms (17McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The HO-1 isozyme is a phase II enzyme, a member of the family of heat shock proteins, and its expression is triggered by diverse stress stimuli including hypoxia (18Motterlini R. Macdonald V.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), heavy metals, UV radiation, ROS such as H2O2 (19Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), reactive nitrogen oxides such as NO (20Hara E. Takahashi K. Takeda K. Nakayama M. Yoshizawa M. Fujita H. Shirato K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-;, interleukin-1;, interferon-; (21Willis D. Moore A.R. Frederick R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), and phenolic compounds such as curcumin and caffeic acid (22Immenschuh S. Ramadori G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The biological functions of HO-1 are thus believed to be associated with a fundamental adaptive and defensive response against oxidative and cellular stress. Indeed, inhibition of HO-1 by using HO inhibitors such as zinc protoporphyrin or tin protoporphyrin resulted in a worsening of the diseases in which these stresses operate, such as graft rejection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, cisplatin nephrotoxicity, and endotoxin-induced septic shock (23Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). In contrast, HO-1 inducers, such as cobalt protoporphyrin, and selective overexpression of HO-1 by genetic manipulation produced beneficial effects in cultured cells and in a variety of animal models of various diseases in brain, heart, kidney, lung, and liver (23Ryter S.W. Alam J. Choi A.M. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 583-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests a vital role for HO-1 in both cell growth and cell death, especially involvement of the enzymes in the regulation of apoptosis (24Wagner M. Cadetg P. Ruf R. Mazzucchelli L. Ferrari P. Redaelli C.A. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1564-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also reported that HO-1 can serve as a downstream effecter of interleukin-10 providing evidence of potential anti-inflammatory approaches for treating diseases (25Lee T.S. Chau L.Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Thus, HO-1 represents a crucial mediator of antioxidants that comprises a key component of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic stress defense mechanisms documented in various tissues including heart, kidney, and brain.HO-1 has been described to be elevated in the myocardium, glomeruli, and retina of diabetic animals as well as in diabetic patients associated with insulin resistance (26Farhangkhoee H.

Recent studies have shown increased expression of HO-1 attenuated cytokine- and glucose-mediated cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vitro and decreased endothelial cell signaling in diabetes rodent animals (29Abraham N.G. Kushida T. McClung J. Weiss M. Quan S. Lafaro R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wolin M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because intensive insulin treatment can substantially decrease the progression of vascular disease, we have characterized the effects of insulin on HO-1 expression and actions as a possible antioxidative target. Despite the increasing evidence that insulin has multiple actions on vascular cells, its effect on the regulation of HO-1 has not been studied in detail. In this study, we have evaluated the effect of insulin on HO-1 expression and its actions in cultured BRPC and dissected the signaling pathways leading to HO-1 regulation. Our results indicate that insulin activates HO-1 expression by increasing its promoter activity selectively by the IRS1/PI3K/Akt2-dependent pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen.

BREC were subsequently propagated with DMEM and 10% FBS, 50 mg/liters heparin, and 50 ;g/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Roche Applied Science) and grown on collagen I-coated dishes (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). BRPC were cultured in DMEM and 20% FBS and BRPE in DMEM and 10% FBS. The cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and the media were changed every other day. BREC and BRPC were characterized for homogeneity by immunoreactivity with anti-factor VIII antibody and monoclonal antibody 3G5, respectively (32Lindahl P. Johansson B.R. Leveen P. Betsholtz C. Sciences. 1997; 277: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The authenticity of BRPE was verified by the presence of pigment granules on transmission electron microscopy. BREC from passages 2-7, and BRPC and BRPE from passages 2-5 were used in these experiments. The cells remained morphologically unchanged under these conditions, as confirmed by light microscopy. Stock solution of hemin was prepared freshly in 0.05 n sodium hydroxide. BRPCs were precultured respectively in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA overnight before the induction of HO-1. HO-1 expression was induced by adding 20 ;m hemin or different concentrations of insulin to the culture medium and incubating at 37 °C for various time points.Immunoblot Analyses—The cells were stimulated with the compounds indicated after overnight starvation in 0.1% BSA. The cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 ;g/ml aprotinin, 10 ;g/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4; Sigma). The protein amount was measured with BCA kit (Bio-Rad). The lysates (50 ;g protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 5% skim milk. Antigens were detected using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for Western blot and detected with the ECL system (GE Healthcare). Protein content quantification was performed using computer-assisted densitometry (Image-quant; GE Healthcare).Real Time PCR Analyses—Real time PCR was performed to evaluate mRNA expressions of HO-1 in cultured BRPC. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with TRI-REAGENT, as described by the manufacturer and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA was treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen) to remove any genomic DNA contamination. Approximately 1 ;g of RNA was used to generate cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 60 min. PCR primers and probes were: bovine HO-1 (GenBank™ NM 001014912), forward 5′-CTTCTTCACTTTCCCCAATA-3′; reverse 5′-TCATCTCCAGAGTGTTCATG-3′; TaqMan probe 5′6FAM-CGCCAGTGCCACCAAGTTCAAGCAGCTAMRA3′. 18 S ribosomal RNA expression was used for normalization. PCR products were gel-purified, subcloned using QIA quick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), and sequenced in both directions to confirm identity.Luciferase Reporter Constructs and Expression Plasmids—An HO-1 luciferase reporter plasmid, HO-1-(-4045/+74), was amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR and subcloned into the pGL2 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). This HO-1 promoter was described previously (33Chung S.W. Chen Y.H. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4578-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HO-1-(-3527/+74), HO-1-(-2986/+74), HO-1-(-2413/+74), HO-1-(-1857/+74), HO-1-(-295/+74), HO-1-(-137/+74), HO-1-(-117/+74), HO-1-(-66/+74), and HO-1-(-35/+74) deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification with HO-1-(-4045/+74) as the template.Cell Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HO-1 reporter constructs were used for transient transfection assays of BRPCs as described previously (34Sekine O. Nishio Y. Egawa K. Nakamura T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36631-36639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, BRPCs were seeded on 60-mm cell culture plates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were 60-80% confluent. The BRPCs were cotransfected with 0.2 ;g of luciferase expression plasmid and 0.05 ;g of PRL-TK plasmid as normalization reference for transfection efficiency, and 0.75 ;g of each expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions for the reagent. After 48 h transfection, the cells were harvested. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined by using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) with signal detection duration of 30 s by a luminometer (Moonlight 3010; Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego CA).siRNA Transfection—The transfection of siRNA was performed using the Amaxa basic nucleofactor kit for primary cells (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and following the Amaxa guidelines. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in the basic nucleofector solution. Cell suspension (100 ;l) at a density of 1-3 × 105/ml mixed with 2 ;g of pmax green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector plus 1 ;l of 100 ;m siRNA were transferred to a cuvette and nucleofected with an Amaxa nucleofector apparatus. The cells were transfected using specific pulsing parameter and were immediately transferred into wells containing 37 °C prewarmed culture medium in 6-well plates. Untreated cells and cells in nucleofector solution, without siRNA and with the application of the electroporation program, were both used as negative controls. Twenty-four hours after the electroporation, the cells were stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 12 h and then lysed for immunoblot analyses.Adenoviral Vector Transfection—cDNA of native IRS1 and IRS2 were generously gifted by Dr. Morris White and Dr. C. Ronald Kahn's laboratories, respectively. Dominant negative Akt was constructed by substituting Thr-308 to Ala and Ser-473 to Ala as described previously (35Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Adenovirus was applied at a concentration of 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml, and adenovirus with the same parental genome carrying GFP or LacZ gene was used as controls. Expression of each recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and expression was increased ∼10-fold with all constructs as compared with the cells infected with control adenovirus.DNA Fragmentation Analysis—DNA fragmentation was measured by quantitation of cytosolic oligonucleosome-bound DNA using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were grown in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of DMEM and 20% FBS. After incubation with insulin (24 h) and/or H2O2 (1 h), the cells were lysed directly on the plate. The cytosolic fraction was used as antigen source in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with primary anti-histone antibody coated to the microtiter plate and a secondary anti-DNA antibody coupled to peroxidase. From the absorbance values, the fragmentation in comparison with controls was calculated according to the following formula: ratio of control = 100 × (absorbance stimulated cells - absorbance blank)/(absorbance control cells - absorbance blank).Nuclear Extract and NoShift Transcription Factor Assay—The cells were stimulated with the conditions and compounds indicated after overnight starvation in 0.1% BSA. After stimulation, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed, and nuclear-specific proteins were isolated using the NucBuster protein extraction kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of NF-;B in the nucleus was quantified using the NoShift transcription factor assay kit (Novagen). Briefly, 20 ;g of nuclear protein was incubated with biotin-labeled wild-type DNA (10 pm) alone or in combination with 10-fold molar excess biotin-labeled mutant DNA or cold wild-type DNA. The reactions were added to streptavidin-coated plates and incubated for an hour. The wells were washed three times and treated with primary antibody (anti-p65 subunit) for an hour. The wells were then washed three times and exposed with the anti-mouse secondary antibody. After five washes, 3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine substrate was added, and the reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 1 n HCL. The absorbance was read at 450 nm (EL808; BIO-Tek Instruments, Inc., Highland Park, VT) to quantify the nuclear NF-;B levels.Statistical Analysis—These data were shown as the means ± S.D. for each group. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t test or by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test correction for multiple comparisons. All of our results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSInsulin-induced HO-1 Expression in Retinal Vascular Cells in Culture and in Vivo—The effect of insulin on HO-1 expression was characterized in several retinal cells because insulin can regulate multiple biological actions in retinal endothelial cells and pericytes (36Bronson S.K. Reiter C.E. Gardner T.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1817-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kobayashi T. Puro D.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, various reports have shown that insulin signaling in the retina is impaired in diabetes (38Reiter C.E. Wu X. Sandirasegarane L. Nakamura M. Gilbert K.A. Singh R.S. Fort P.E. Antonetti D.A. Gardner T.W. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of insulin to modulate HO-1 expression was studied in retinal vascular cells such as BRPC, BRPE, and BREC. After overnight incubation with 0.1% BSA, the cells were treated with insulin (100 nm) for a period of 6 h or in the presence of low (5.6 mm) or high glucose concentration (HG; 25 mm) for 24 h (Fig. 1A). As compared with cells exposed to low glucose, exposure to HG elevated HO-1 protein expression only in BREC by 62% (p < 0.05) but, surprisingly, not in BRPE or BRPC. In contrast to HG exposure, insulin stimulation significantly increased the protein expression of HO-1 in all retinal cell types (BRPE = 51%; BRPC = 55%; BREC = 40%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the effect of insulin in increasing HO-1 expression has physiological significance, insulin was injected into the vitreous of Sprague-Dawley rats, increasing HO-1 protein expression in the whole retina by 57% (p = 0.02) after 24 h as compared with saline-injected retina (Fig. 1B).Time- and Concentration-dependent Effects of Insulin in mRNA and Protein Expression of HO-1 in BRPC—Because insulin increased HO-1 protein expression in several retinal cells, we characterized the actions of insulin in BRPC, which has been shown to be very sensitive to insulin. In addition, unlike BREC and BRPE, pericyte apoptosis has been clearly demonstrated to be a specific and consistent finding in diabetic retinopathy (39Hammes H.P. Horm. Metab. Res. 2005; 37: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Insulin (100 nm) increased time-dependent HO-1 mRNA and protein expression with maximum effect at 3 h (by 3-fold; p < 0.05) and 12 h (2.4-fold; p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Using these time points, the dose-response effect of insulin was also evaluated. Insulin increased HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner with maximum effect at 10 nm by 1.8- and 3.4-fold (p < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). HO-2, which is constitutively expressed in the cell, was not affected by the addition of insulin (Fig. 2, A and C) or hemin (data not shown).FIGURE 2Time- and dose-dependent effect of insulin on HO-1 mRNA and protein expression. BRPC were treated with insulin in a time- (A and B) and dose-dependent manner (C and D). HO-1 (black bars) and HO-2 (white bars) protein (A and C) and mRNA (B and D) expressions were measured by Western blot and RT-PCR analyses and normalized either by actin or 18 S expression. The experiments were done in triplicate, and one experiment representative of three immunoblots is shown with densitometric quantitation (means ± S.D.) from three separate experiments. *, p < 0.05 versus PBS-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insulin Regulates Transcriptional Activity of HO-1—The effect of insulin on HO-1 expression was further examined to determine its action on the transcriptional activities of HO-1. The results in Fig. 3A show that the elevation of HO-1 mRNA expression by insulin was completely prevented by using actinomycin D (5 ;g/ml), an inhibitor of transcription (p < 0.05). Further, the effect of insulin to modulate the transcriptional level of HO-1 was characterized by measuring insulin action on the promoter activity of HO-1-(-4045/+74) luciferase reporter construct. We observed that insulin increased HO-1 promoter activity by 3-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that insulin can increase HO-1 transcription by modulating the promoter activity in the 5′ sequence region of HO-1.FIGURE 3Insulin regulated HO-1 transcriptional and promoter activity. BRPC were stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 3 h with or without actimomycin D (5 ;g/ml). HO-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR (A). BRPC were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid HO-1-(-4045/+74) (250 ng/well). After transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle or insulin (100 nm) for 24 h and then harvested for luciferase assay. The luciferase activity w"

The mechanism by which MutS searches for and recognizes mismatches and subsequently signals repair remains poorly understood. We used single-molecule analyses of atomic force microscopy images of MutS-DNA complexes, coupled with biochemical assays, to determine the distributions of conformational states, the DNA binding affinities, and the ATPase activities of wild type and two mutants of MutS, with alanine substitutions in the conserved Phe-Xaa-Glu mismatch recognition motif. We find that on homoduplex DNA, the conserved Glu, but not the Phe, facilitates MutS-induced DNA bending, whereas at mismatches, both Phe and Glu promote the formation of an unbent conformation. The data reveal an unusual role for the Phe residue in that it promotes the unbending, not bending, of DNA at mismatch sites. In addition, formation of the specific unbent MutS-DNA conformation at mismatches appears to be required for the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by MutS that signals initiation of repair. These results provide a structural explanation for the mechanism by which MutS searches for and recognizes mismatches and for the observed phenotypes of mutants with substitutions in the Phe-Xaa-Glu motif.

MutS homologs, which are highly conserved throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are responsible for the initiation of MMR and are also involved in DNA damage-induced activation of cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (1Iyer R.R.

To initiate MMR, MutS must first locate and recognize base pair mismatches or base insertion/deletions (IDLs) in duplex DNA. MutS proteins are dimers with DNA binding and ATPase activities, both of which are essential for MMR (1Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L. Chem.

In the presence of ATP, binding of MutS to a mismatch or IDL, but not to homoduplex DNA, results in a conformational change in MutS, such that it forms a mobile clamp state that can move along the DNA (1Iyer R.R.

It must find mismatches or IDLs among the vast excess of correctly paired DNA in a timely manner. Unlike most DNA repair enzymes, such as DNA glycosylases and AP endonucleases that recognize chemical modifications of the DNA base or backbone, MutS must recognize normal bases that differ only in their noncovalent interactions with the complementary strand. This task is further complicated by the requirement that MutS must recognize multiple different mismatches, and the most common mismatches, such as GT, AC, or single IDLs, do not destabilize or distort double-stranded DNA significantly (8Isaacs R.J.

The majority of contacts between MutS and DNA are nonspecific, with only two amino acids from one subunit of the dimer making specific interactions with the mismatch. These residues belong to a Phe-Xaa-Glu motif that is conserved in prokaryotes and in the Msh6 subunit of eukaryotic MutSα, and mutation of either Phe or Glu to alanine results in defective MMR in vivo (18Bowers J.

The conserved Phe stacks with a mismatched or inserted base, which is rotated out into the minor groove by ∼3 Å, and the Glu forms a hydrogen bond with the N-3 of a mismatched thymine or the N-7 of mismatched purines (11Lamers M.H.

These structural data led to the idea that local flexibility of a mismatch or IDL site underlies mismatch recognition by MutS (2Schofield M.J. Hsieh P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 579-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A recent study using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize directly MutS proteins bound to mismatches and to homoduplex DNA (9Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y. Lee S.D. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. Alani E. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14822-14827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MutS-DNA complexes exhibit a single population of conformations in which the DNA is bent at homoduplex sites (nonspecific complexes), but two populations of conformations, bent and unbent, at mismatch sites (specific complexes). These findings led to a model of MutS action in which the kinked conformation observed in the crystal structures represents an initial recognition complex (IRC) that is an intermediate in the pathway toward an unbent conformation, which is the ultimate recognition complex (URC) that signals repair (3Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 9Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y. Lee S.D. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. Alani E. Hsieh P.

The proposed unbent URC provides a structural explanation for the observed inverse correlation between the ease with which a mismatch is bent (or kinked) and the efficiency with which it is repaired (3Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 9Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y. Lee S.D. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. Alani E. Hsieh P.

However, several important questions still remain about the process of mismatch recognition and signaling of repair. How does MutS find mismatches or IDLs in DNA? What roles do the conserved Phe and Glu residues play in the formation of bent and unbent complexes at mismatches and at homoduplex sites on DNA? How do the distributions of bent and unbent MutS-DNA complexes correlate with mismatch or IDL recognition and initiation of repair by MutS? To address these questions, we used AFM to characterize the binding affinities and conformational properties of wild type MutS (wtMutS) and two MutS mutants, each with a single mutation in the Phe-Xaa-Glu motif, interacting with specific (mismatches and IDLs) and nonspecific (homoduplex) sites on DNA (see Fig. 1). We have recently developed methods to determine protein-DNA binding constants and specificities (ratio of the affinity for a specific site to nonspecific sites) from AFM images, by analyzing the occupancy of a protein on DNA as a function of its position on the DNA (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We previously used this method to measure the binding affinities and specificities of wild type T. aquaticus MutS for a T-bulge and a GT mismatch and demonstrated that the binding parameters determined using this method are consistent with those from fluorescence anisotropy measurements (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This AFM method is particularly useful for proteins, such as MutS, that have high affinities for DNA ends, which can prevent accurate determination of the specificity for a mismatch using bulk methods (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Comparison of the binding affinities and conformations of specific and nonspecific MutS-DNA complexes of wild type and mutant proteins provides information on the mechanism by which MutS finds and recognizes a mismatch. In addition to these AFM studies, we examined the ATPase activities of the mutant MutS proteins in the presence of homoduplex DNA or DNA containing a mismatch or an IDL, which allows a detailed comparison of structure, stability, and function, thereby providing a better understanding of how these conserved residues contribute to the ability of MutS to initiate DNA mismatch repair. MutS Proteins and DNA Substrates—T. aquaticus MutS F39A and E41A were purified as described previously for wtMutS except that a gentle procedure of heat denaturation was used during purification (25Biswas I.

DNA substrates for AFM were created by ligating three fragments as described previously (9Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y. Lee S.D. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. Alani E. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14822-14827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The sequences of the individual strands of the fragment middle pieces containing the mismatches are: 1) 5′-GTG TCG GGT TCG CGT CAT ATG GCG GGT GTC GGG GCT GGC TTA AGG TGT GAA ATA CCT CAT CTC GAG (G)CG TGC CGA TAT TTC-3′ and 2) 5′-ATA TCG GCA CGT CTC GAG ATG AGG TAT TTC ACA CCT TAA GCC AGC CCC GAC ACC CGC CAT ATG ACG CGA ACC CGA CAC TAC-3′. For generating 783-bp T-bulge DNA (783T-bulge), the middle G underlined in the sequence of oligonucleotide 1 was omitted (indicated by the base being in brackets in the sequence). Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were annealed to produce the middle fragment for 783T-bulge and for the 783-bp GT mismatch DNA (783GT). In the 783-bp DNA fragments, both the T-bulge and the GT mismatch are located 27% of the total DNA length (213 bp) from one of the fragment ends. Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the DNA fragments used in the AFM experiments. The ATPase assays were performed with 23-bp duplexes formed by annealing: 1) 5′-GCG CGA CGG TAT ATA GCT GCC GG-3′ and 2) 5′-CC GGC AGC TAT XTA CCG TCG CGC-3′, where X was absent, G, or A to form T-bulge, GT mismatch, and AT homoduplex substrates, respectively. Atomic Force Microscopy—Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 10-20 nm T. aquaticus MutS F39A or E41A dimers with 1-5 nm of the DNA substrates for 1-10 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica (Spruce Pine Mica Company) at room temperature. After <1 min of incubation, the mica surface was rinsed with high pressure liquid chromatography grade water, blotted dry, and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. Although the samples are “dried,” the surface, the protein, and the DNA remain hydrated because mica is extremely hygroscopic. The images were captured in air with a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments) microscope in tapping mode. Pointprobe® tapping mode silicon probes (Molecular Imaging Corporation) with spring constants of ∼50 n·m-1 and resonance frequencies ∼170 kHz were used for all imaging. The images were collected at a speed of 3 Hz, a size of 1 μm × 1 μm, and a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. Image Analysis—Either NANOSCOPE software (Digital Instruments, Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) or Scion Image was used to measure the DNA contour lengths, the position of the proteins on the DNA, and the MutS-induced DNA bend angles, as described previously (9Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y. Lee S.D. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. Alani E. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14822-14827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The program Origin (Microcal Inc.) was used for statistical analysis of the data. For each data set, images from at least three independent experiments were analyzed, compared, and pooled. The positions of MutS binding on the DNA fragments were determined by measuring the distance from the bound MutS protein to each end. The binding position is defined as the ratio of the length of the shorter DNA tract divided by the total contour length. Complexes with centers within one standard deviation of the expected mismatch position were categorized as specific complexes. We did not end label the DNA to unequivocally identify the DNA ends, which means that some nonspecific complexes will be counted as specific complexes but not vice versa. For wtMutS and MutS-E41A, less than 1% of the nonspecific complexes will be counted as specific because the specific complexes are significantly more stable than the nonspecific complexes (see Table 1 and Ref. 9Wang H. Yang Y. Schofield M.J. Du C. Fridman Y. Lee S.D. Larson E.D. Drummond J.T. Alani E. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14822-14827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). DNA bending was determined by measuring the angle, θ, at the intersection of the two DNA arms at the position of the DNA-bound protein. The DNA bend angle is defined as 180° - θ. DNA molecules having MutS bound to more than one internal site or to more than one DNA fragment were not included in the statistical analysis of bend angles.TABLE 1DNA dissociation constants and specificitieswtMutSaThe data for wtMutS are taken from Ref. 24.MutS-F39AMutS-E41AKdSpecificityKdSpecificityKdSpecificitynMnMnMGT77 ± 8300 ± 36>2800bAlthough we do not detect any preference of MutS-F39A for a GT or a T-bulge (supplemental Fig. S1), the resolution of the position distributions limits our detection of binding preferences to specificities ≤10.

Open table in a new tab Binding Constants and Specificities—Binding specificities and constants were calculated as described previously (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, the analysis method is based on the determination of the average occupancy of MutS at nonspecific and specific (mismatch) sites on the DNA as well as at the DNA ends. Knowledge of the position of the mismatch in the DNA fragment (at 27% of DNA length for 783GT and 783T-bulge) allows us to determine the frequencies of MutS bound to specific and nonspecific sites. It is important to note that each DNA fragment contains one specific site, two DNA ends, and 769 nonspecific sites (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consequently, at 1 nm DNA fragment, the concentrations of specific sites, DNA ends, and nonspecific sites are 1, 2, and 769 nm, respectively. The high concentration of nonspecific sites makes it possible to determine the binding affinity of MutS for homoduplex DNA, even though it is weak (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). From the AFM images, only DNA fragments with lengths within one standard deviation from the average measured length were considered in the analysis. A Gaussian fit to the distribution of positions of MutS on the DNA provides the specificity of the protein for the mismatch (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Typically, the resolution of the positions of protein on the DNA allows detection of mismatch specificities ≥10. The binding constants for DNA mismatches, DNA homoduplex sites, and DNA ends are calculated from the specificities and fractional DNA occupancies, as described previously (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ATPase Assays—Stopped flow phosphate (Pi) release assays using E. coli phosphate-binding protein labeled with MDCC-PBP were performed with wild type and mutant MutS proteins, as described previously (27Antony E. Hingorani M.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13115-13128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of 2 μm MutS dimer, in the absence or presence of 8 μm DNA, was mixed with 40 μl of 16 μm MDCC-PBP and 1 mm ATP in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.7, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, at 40 °C, and the change in fluorescence upon MDCC-PBP binding to Pi was measured by excitation at 425 nm and emission at >450 nm. The burst kinetics traces were fit to a an exponential + linear equation, [Pi] = (A0e−kt + Vt + F0)/mPi(Eq. 1) where [Pi] corresponds to phosphate concentration, A0 is the amplitude, k is the observed burst rate constant, V is the velocity of the linear phase, F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity, t is time, and mPi is the slope of the Pi standard curve measured under the same conditions. For the AFM studies, we employed two 783-bp heteroduplex DNA substrates containing either a single GT mismatch (783GT) or a single T-bulge (783Tbulge) 213 bp (27%) from one end (Fig. 1a). Because we know the position of the mismatch along the DNA, we can discriminate between MutS bound to a mismatch or to homoduplex DNA by measuring the distance of the complex from the ends of the DNA fragment (see “Materials and Methods”). The T. aquaticus MutS mutants each possess a single mutation in the Phe-Xaa-Glu motif: Phe39 to Ala (F39A) and Glu41 to Ala (E41A). Representative AFM images of heteroduplex DNA deposited in the presence of wtMutS, MutS-F39A, and MutS-E41A are shown in Fig. 1. From a large number of AFM images, we determined the occupancies of the proteins as a function of position on the DNA to calculate the binding affinities and specificities (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”), and we measured the MutS-induced DNA bend angles to characterize the conformations of the complexes. Effect of Phe39 on DNA Affinity and Bending—Inspection of the position distributions of MutS-F39A bound to DNA substrates containing either a GT mismatch or a T-bulge reveals that unlike wtMutS (24Yang Y. Sass L.E. Du C. Hsieh P. Erie D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4322-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), MutS-F39A does not exhibit any significant preference for mismatch or IDL sites relative to homoduplex DNA (see supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). The resolution of the position distributions limits our detection of binding preferences to specificities ≥10. Consequently the binding affinity of MutS-F39A to a GT mismatch or T-bulge could be up to 10-fold tighter than to nonspecific sites (Table 1). Although there is a loss of specificity for the mismatch, the binding affinity of MutS-F39A to homoduplex DNA is the same as wtMutS, and the binding affinity for DNA ends is only slightly reduced relative to wtMutS (Table 1). These results are consistent with previous biochemical studies that reported a dramatic loss of affinity of MutS-F39A for mismatches and some apparent loss of binding to homoduplex DNA (19Yamamoto A. Schofield M.J. Biswas I. Hsieh P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 366: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the F39A mutation on the conformation of MutS-DNA complexes, we measured the bend angles induced by MutS-F39A at homoduplex sites and specific sites (GT mismatch and T-bulge). Although MutS-F39A does not exhibit significant specificity for the mismatches, we can still determine the bend angles at these sites because we know their positions in the DNA. The distributions of DNA bend angles (Fig. 2, d-f) show that MutS-F39A exhibits a single population of complexes with an average bend angle of ∼60° for the GT mismatch and T-bulge,"
https://openalex.org/W2157479134,"Many different signaling pathways share common components but nevertheless invoke distinct physiological responses. In yeast, the adaptor protein Ste50 functions in multiple mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, each with unique dynamical and developmental properties. Although Kss1 activity is sustained and promotes invasive growth, Hog1 activity is transient and promotes cell adaptation to osmotic stress. Here we show that osmotic stress activates Kss1 as well as Hog1. We show further that Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50 and that phosphorylation of Ste50 limits the duration of Kss1 activation and prevents invasive growth under high osmolarity growth conditions. Thus feedback regulation of a shared component can restrict the activity of a competing MAP kinase to ensure signal fidelity.

Thus feedback regulation of a shared component can restrict the activity of a competing MAP kinase to ensure signal fidelity. All living organisms respond to specific external cues and initiate the appropriate developmental or metabolic responses. In many cases, extracellular stimuli lead to activation of MAP 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; OSM, osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3; GST, glutathione S-transferase. kinases, which in turn initiate distinct, and often mutually exclusive, cellular behaviors including cell growth, movement, differentiation, and death. Therefore the regulation and coordination of multiple kinases are essential for the cell to respond appropriately to a changing environment (1Turjanski A.G. Vaque J.P. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3240-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms ensuring pathway fidelity are not well understood. The MAP kinases in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide a powerful model to study the mechanisms of signal specificity. Two different MAP kinases, Fus3 and Kss1, function in the mating-response pathway leading to fusion of haploid a- and α-type cells. In this case, pheromone stimulation leads to activation of a protein kinase cascade that includes Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, and ultimately Fus3 and Kss1 (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Nutrient-poor conditions lead to activation of the same kinase components, with the exception of Fus3 (3Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 4Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In this alternate developmental pathway, the cells exhibit altered budding, formation of long branching filaments, as well as increased adherence and invasion of the substratum. A third pathway leads to activation of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response kinase Hog1 (5Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 6Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The HOG response is initiated by stimulation of two putative osmosensing proteins, Sln1 and Sho1 (7Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 8Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Sln1 activates two partially redundant kinases, Ssk2 and Ssk22, which then activate the MAP kinase kinase Pbs2 and ultimately Hog1. Sho1 recruits a distinct kinase Ste11 to activate Pbs2 and Hog1. In either case, Hog1 induces production of glycerol that serves to balance intracellular osmotic pressure with the external environment and thereby enables cell survival (9O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. O'Shea E.K. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Saito H. Tatebayashi K. J.

Thus Ste11 is required for signaling by Sho1 as well as by mating pheromones. Another shared component is Ste50, which forms a stable complex with Ste11 (12Rad M.R. Xu G. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Xu G. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Hollenberg C.P. Ramezani Rad M. Mol.

Although the Sho1 branch of the Hog1 pathway shares components with the Fus3 and Kss1 pathways, osmotic stimulation does not normally induce mating or invasive growth. If Hog1 expression or catalytic activity is abrogated, however, osmotic stimulation leads to inappropriate activation of the mating response (18O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus Hog1 mediates the HOG response and simultaneously acts to prevent induction of the mating or invasive growth pathways. The manner by which Hog1 inhibits cross-talk to these parallel signaling systems has not been determined previously. In this study, we examine the role of Hog1 in ensuring pathway fidelity. Because our interest is in mechanisms of signaling specificity, we have restricted our investigations to the Sho1 branch of the pathway (ssk1Δ). First we show that Kss1, together with Hog1, is transiently activated by osmotic stimulation. We demonstrate further that Hog1 phosphorylates a shared upstream component Ste50, and this feedback-phosphorylation event limits the duration of pathway activation. When Ste50 phosphorylation is abrogated, Kss1 activity is sustained, and the cells undergo invasive growth in response to osmotic stress. This work reveals a novel negative feedback loop that controls the dynamics of MAPK activation and thereby ensures signal fidelity. Standard methods for maintenance of yeast and bacteria, manipulation of DNA, purification and analysis of protein kinases, protein immunodetection, and analysis of cellular responses to pheromone and salt stimulation were used throughout. Full experimental procedures and any associated references are available in the supplemental materials. It is well established that osmotic stress leads to activation of the MAPK Hog1 (6Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that osmotic stress can also activate the mating pathway. This form of inappropriate cross-talk has been observed in cells lacking HOG pathway components (Pbs2- or Hog1-deficient cells). The mutant phenotype was first documented by indirect measurements of MAPK-mediated gene transcription, using a mating pheromone-responsive reporter (FUS1 promoter, lacZ reporter) (18O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become feasible to detect Fus3 and Kss1 activation directly using antibodies that recognize the dually phosphorylated (fully activated) form of each protein (19Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Using the antibody detection method, we monitored Fus3 and Kss1 activity over time, in response to a salt stimulus. Wild-type cells and cells expressing a catalytically inactive Hog1K52R mutant were treated with 0.5 m KCl and then lysed and resolved by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. As expected, Kss1 was strongly activated in the hog1 mutant cells (20Davenport K.D. Williams K.E. Ullmann B.D. Gustin M.C. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Flatauer L.J. Zadeh S.F. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we observed very weak activation of Fus3 (Fig. 1A). Most surprisingly, we found that Kss1 is activated by salt even in wild-type cells expressing fully functional Pbs2 and Hog1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Indeed, the amplitude of Kss1 phosphorylation can be compared with that observed after treatment with pheromone at 1 μm (Fig. 1B). Moreover, there was a striking difference in the dynamics of Kss1 phosphorylation. Although pheromone stimulation normally results in sustained phosphorylation of Kss1, osmotic stress results in a transient response, with peak activity occurring 5 min after the initial stimulus. A similar time course is typically observed for Hog1 (Fig. 1, A and B). In the absence of Hog1 activity, however, a salt stimulus results in sustained phosphorylation of both Hog1 and Kss1 (Fig. 1A). From these data, we conclude that osmotic stress activates Kss1 as well as Hog1 and that activation is in each case highly transient. When Hog1 catalytic activity is abrogated, activation of both MAP kinases is sustained. The data presented above reveal that Kss1 activation mirrors that of Hog1 and that Kss1 and Hog1 are affected equally by loss of Hog1 activity. Given the requirement for Hog1 catalytic activity, we presumed that Hog1 promotes a feedback phosphorylation event that limits the duration of pathway activation. Indeed, feedback phosphorylation of an upstream component was predicted based on genetic (18O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and theoretical (22Mettetal J.T. Muzzey D. Gomez-Uribe C. van Oudenaarden A. Science. 2008; 319: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) considerations. Given that both Kss1 and Hog1 are affected equally, we presumed that the target of feedback phosphorylation is a component upstream of both MAP kinases. Upstream components shared by both pathways include Sho1, Ste11, and Ste50. We have documented previously that Sho1 is phosphorylated by Hog1. However, the result in this case is to dampen overall pathway activity, but not duration, and occurs only under extreme osmotic stress conditions (23Hao N. Behar M. Parnell S.C. Torres M.P. Borchers C.H. Elston T.C. Dohlman H.G. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 659-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus we focused our investigations on Ste11 and Ste50. Hog1 Phosphorylates Ste50 in Response to Osmotic Stress—Ste11 is a MAPK kinase upstream of both Hog1 and Kss1. Ste50 is an adaptor protein required for the catalytic activity of Ste11 (14Wu C.

Although Ste50 was originally identified as a component of the yeast mating pathway (12Rad M.R. Xu G. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), further genetic studies revealed that deletion of Ste50 has a relatively modest effect on pheromone responses (13Xu G. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Hollenberg C.P. Ramezani Rad M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, ste50 mutants block invasive growth (24Jansen G. Buhring F. Hollenberg C.P. Ramezani Rad M. Mol. Gen. Genomics. 2001; 265: 102-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ramezani-Rad M. Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as the Sho1-dependent branch of the HOG pathway (13Xu G. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Hollenberg C.P. Ramezani Rad M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol.

Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5788-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Given that invasive growth and HOG signaling are mediated by Kss1 and Hog1, respectively, we regarded Ste50 as a potential target for feedback regulation affecting both pathways. Protein phosphorylation will in many cases result in a mobility shift detectable by gel electrophoresis. Moreover, Ste50 is known to be phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo (14Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Wu C. Arcand M. Jansen G. Zhong M. Iouk T. Thomas D.Y. Meloche S. Whiteway M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To examine whether Ste50 is phosphorylated in response to osmotic stress, cells expressing FLAG-tagged Ste50 were treated with 0.5 m KCl and then lysed and resolved by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, Ste50 undergoes a rapid and transient reduction in electrophoretic mobility, peaking ∼15 min after osmotic stimulation. The time course of the mobility shift lags slightly behind the peak of Hog1 activation, noted in Fig. 1. Such a lag would be expected if Hog1 activation must precede phosphorylation of Ste50. Furthermore, Ste50 failed to undergo a mobility shift in the absence of Hog1 expression. The shift was also not observed after pheromone stimulation and was not affected by deletion of either Fus3 or Kss1 (data not shown). From these data, we conclude that Ste50 undergoes a salt stimulus- and Hog1-dependent post-translational modification. To determine more directly whether Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50, we monitored phosphorylation in vitro. Hog1 was purified from yeast treated with 0.5 m KCl and then mixed with Ste50 purified from bacteria. As shown in Fig. 2B, purified Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50, whereas catalytically inactive Hog1K52R does not (23Hao N. Behar M. Parnell S.C. Torres M.P. Borchers C.H. Elston T.C. Dohlman H.G. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 659-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We conclude that Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50 directly and does not require an intermediary kinase. To identify candidate Ste50 phosphorylation sites, we mutated each of seven Ser or Thr residues located within a MAPK consensus sequence (Ser or Thr followed by Pro). Among these individual mutants, five (Ser-155, Ser-196, Ser-202, Ser-248, Thr-341) exhibited a reduced mobility shift upon osmotic stress. In addition, all five mutants conferred elevated induction of a Kss1-responsive transcription reporter (data not shown, see below). We then replaced all five sites in combination (Ste505A). This mutant failed to undergo any mobility shift in vivo (Fig. 2A) and was no longer phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 2B). Thus Hog1 appears to phosphorylate Ste50 directly, at multiple sites, and in response to salt stimulation. The mobility shift observed in vivo is entirely dependent on Hog1 catalytic activity and on the integrity of substrate phosphorylation sites. The same sites required in vivo are also required in vitro. Ste50 Phosphorylation Limits the Duration of Pathway Activation—To this point, we have shown that Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50 and that Hog1 limits the duration of pathway activation. To investigate whether Ste50 phosphorylation per se contributes to regulation of signaling dynamics, we genetically replaced wild-type STE50 with the phosphorylation-deficient mutant STE505A and monitored Hog1 and Kss1 activity over time. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells expressing Ste505A exhibit sustained Hog1 and Kss1 phosphorylation upon osmotic stimulation. Indeed, the initial time course of phosphorylation resembles that seen in the absence of Hog1 catalytic activity (hog1Δ or hog1K52R) (Fig. 1). Again, no Fus3 phosphorylation was detected in either the wild-type or the mutant strains. Phosphorylation of Hog1K52R is more sustained at later time points, possibly due to the loss of later adaptation responses including new transcription and increased glycerol production, as documented previously (9O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. O'Shea E.K. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Saito H. Tatebayashi K. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Thus although Ste50 phosphorylation contributes substantially to the early adaptation response, it is also evident that other sites or targets must also exist, particularly for the later responses. To corroborate the kinase activation results, we examined Hog1- and Kss1-mediated gene induction. Activation of Hog1 can be monitored using a transcription reporter containing the GPD1 promoter (28Harris K. Lamson R.E. Nelson B. Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Roberts C.J. Boone C. Pryciak P.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1815-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Activation of Kss1 is commonly monitored using the Ty1 or TEC1 promoters (29Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, in our experience, these reporters exhibit high basal activity and in some cases are activated in a Kss1-independent manner. As an alternative, we used the FUS1-lacZ reporter. The FUS1 promoter is strongly and selectively activated by Fus3 or Kss1 (30Gartner A. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); FUS1-lacZ can be used in this case given that Kss1 is activated by osmotic stress. As shown in Fig. 3B, Kss1-mediated gene transcription is significantly elevated in the Ste505A mutant following salt stimulation. In contrast, Hog1-mediated transcriptional responses are unaffected by Ste505A despite the fact that Hog1 phosphorylation is sustained (Fig. 3C). We conclude that the high osmolarity glycerol pathway is fully activated, whether activation of Hog1 is transient or sustained. We then examined the effect of the Ste505A mutant with respect to pheromone signaling. Activation in this case is mediated by both Fus3 and Kss1 and is normally sustained. Again we found minimal differences comparing the wild-type and Ste505A mutant. We also found small differences in the magnitude or duration of Fus3 and Kss1 phosphorylation and transcriptional induction (data not shown). Thus a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated exhibits sustained Hog1 and Kss1 activation but is otherwise fully competent to activate the pheromone- and osmotic stress-response pathways. Finally we examined how Ste50 phosphorylation affects Hog1- and Kss1-mediated cellular differentiation responses. It was demonstrated previously that Ste50 is required for growth in high salt media (13Xu G. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Hollenberg C.P. Ramezani Rad M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 26Posas F. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5788-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although ste50 mutant cells grew poorly in the presence of 0.5 m KCl, cells expressing the Ste505A mutant grew as well as wild-type (Fig. 3D). These results confirm that Ste505A is fully competent with respect to high osmolarity responses despite sustained activation of Hog1. On the other hand, sustained Kss1 activation has been shown to induce invasive growth, characterized by an elongated cell morphology and penetration into solid medium (21Flatauer L.J. Zadeh S.F. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Maleri S. Ge Q. Hackett E.A. Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9221-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Andersson J. Simpson D.M. Qi M. Wang Y. Elion E.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus we examined whether loss of feedback phosphorylation promotes the invasive growth response. We spotted wild-type, ste50Δ, and STE505A mutant cells on solid medium containing 0.5 m KCl, and after 1 or 2 days, washed off non-adherent cells to detect invasion. As shown in Fig. 3D, the Ste505A mutant cells exhibited invasive growth behavior, whereas the wild-type strain did not. Moreover, these adherent cells exhibited an elongated morphology characteristic of invasive growth (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our results indicate that Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50 in response to osmotic stress. This feedback phosphorylation event leads to more transient activation of Kss1, as well as of Hog1. When feedback phosphorylation is abrogated, Ste50 can sustain normal cellular responses to osmotic stress and mating pheromone but no longer restricts salt activation of the invasive growth pathway. It has long been held that the mating, invasive, and high osmolarity response pathways each act via distinct MAP kinases. Although pheromone-induced growth arrest requires Fus3, nutrient-driven invasive growth requires Kss1, and growth under osmotic stress conditions requires Hog1. The underlying assumption has been that cross-activation would occur only in the absence of the primary MAPK. For example, Kss1 can act in place of Fus3 to sustain mating (33Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Likewise, osmotic stress will induce mating, but only if Hog1 activity is absent (18O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that Kss1 is activated by pheromone even in wild-type cells that express Fus3 (19Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here we show that Kss1 is activated by osmotic stress even in cells that express functional Hog1; activation is transient, however, and under normal circumstances, fails to promote Kss1-mediated invasive growth. Given that both Kss1 and Hog1 require the same upstream kinase Ste11, we considered whether Ste11 or its adaptor protein Ste50 contributes to pathway fidelity. We showed that Hog1 phosphorylates Ste50 in vivo, as well as in vitro, and mapped the sites of phosphorylation. When these sites are mutated, Kss1 activity is more sustained, and the cells exhibit invasive growth behavior under osmotic stress conditions. Although precise regulation is required to ensure signaling specificity, limited activation of multiple MAP kinases may be beneficial under some circumstances. For example, new evidence has revealed that Kss1, once believed to be redundant with Fus3, promotes unique mating-related responses such as elongated growth at very low doses of pheromone. In contrast to Kss1, Fus3 activation occurs at higher doses of pheromone, elicits a more switch-like dose-response profile, and is required for elongated growth toward a pheromone gradient (34Paliwal S. Iglesias P.A. Campbell K. Hilioti Z. Groisman A. Levchenko A. Nature. 2007; 446: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 35Hao N. Nayak S. Behar M. Shanks R.H. Nagiec M.J. Errede B. Hasty J. Elston T.C. Dohlman H.G. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 649-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Such elongated or chemotropic growth could allow yeasts, which are otherwise non-motile, to orient new bud formation in the direction of a weak pheromone stimulus and thus toward a distant mating partner (36Erdman S. Snyder M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 919-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Kss1 activation in the HOG response might be advantageous in certain circumstances. For instance, high osmotic stress together with external cAMP induces pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells (37Zaragoza O. Gancedo J.M. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Even if osmostress-stimulated Kss1 does not normally lead to chemotropic or invasive growth, it may “prime” the cellular signaling system in preparation for a possible shift to poor growth conditions and the need for invasion (38McClean M.N. Mody A. Broach J.R. Ramanathan S. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that transcription induction is not required for yeast to respond to an initial hyperosmotic stress stimulus, although it does allow cells to better adapt to subsequent stress stimuli (22Mettetal J.T. Muzzey D. Gomez-Uribe C. van Oudenaarden A. Science. 2008; 319: 482-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 39Westfall P.J. Patterson J.C. Chen R.E. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 12212-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Likewise, simultaneous activation of Kss1 might prepare cells for the need to undergo invasive growth, and thereby, escape further stress stimuli. In this way, Kss1 activation could help to provide an appropriate alternative response in the face of a rapidly changing environment. It is noteworthy that pheromone stimulation activates Fus3 and Kss1 but not Hog1, whereas osmotic stress activates Hog1 and Kss1 but not Fus3. Thus only a subset of MAP kinases is activated at any given time, although all three share upstream signaling proteins including Ste11 and Ste50. This suggests that signal identity is determined by additional components upstream of Fus3 or Hog1. For example, the scaffold protein Ste5 is required for Fus3 activation and likely limits cross-activation of Fus3 by other external stimuli (21Flatauer L.J. Zadeh S.F. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The scaffold protein Pbs2 might serve a similar function for Hog1 (6Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that Kss1 is activated as part of the invasive growth, mating, and HOG pathways; however, no cross-talk among these pathways has been observed. Treatment of cells with pheromone or salt does not normally induce invasive growth (6Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 33Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Given that Kss1 is activated by multiple stimuli, how does Kss1 interpret these different input signals? We have shown that the dynamics of Kss1 activation vary depending on the nature of the stimulus. Although Kss1 activation is transient upon osmotic stress, it is somewhat prolonged in response to pheromone stimulation (Fig. 1A). When Kss1 activity is fully sustained, the cells undergo invasive growth (21Flatauer L.J. Zadeh S.F. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Maleri S. Ge Q. Hackett E.A. Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9221-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Andersson J. Simpson D.M. Qi M. Wang Y. Elion E.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations imply that signaling dynamics are particularly important for dictating signaling specificity (supplemental Fig. S1). Indeed, the importance of signaling dynamics in yeast has striking parallels with signaling specificity in mammalian cells. In one oft-cited example, epidermal growth factor induces transient activation of the ERK MAPK and leads to cell proliferation, whereas nerve growth factor promotes sustained ERK activation and results in cell differentiation (40Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar). The mammalian ortholog of Hog1 (p38) is regulated by an adaptor protein called OSM (osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3). Given the strong similarities between OSM and Ste50 (41Uhlik M.T. Abell A.N. Johnson N.L. Sun W. Cuevas B.D. Lobel-Rice K.E. Horne E.A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Johnson G.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether OSM is subject to feedback regulation by p38. Currently, we are investigating how Ste50 function is altered by phosphorylation. Ste50 has been reported to bind to nearly two dozen proteins; 3STE50/YCL032W Summary in the Saccharomyces Genomic Database. many of these binding partners are required for Hog1 signaling, including Ste11 and Ste50 itself (in the form of a dimer) (14Wu C. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Jansen G. Buhring F. Hollenberg C.P. Ramezani Rad M. Mol. Gen.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2192-2201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus it will be interesting to determine whether Ste50 phosphorylation alters the expression, catalytic activity, subcellular localization, or trafficking of any of the reported binding partners. Another question is how Ste50 cooperates with other adaptation mechanisms that are likely to regulate Kss1 or Hog1 activation. For example, Hog1 phosphorylates proteins that contribute to pathway adaptation, including transcription factors that (over a longer time scale) up-regulate components, leading to glycerol production (11Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that signal identity is encoded to a large extent by the dynamics of kinase activation. We have shown how one MAPK can limit the activity of a competing MAPK through feedback phosphorylation of a shared upstream component, and more generally, how feedback inhibition contributes to signal fidelity. Given that the MAPK signaling apparatus is highly conserved among all eukaryotes, the mechanisms outlined here are likely applicable to other signaling pathways in yeast as well as in more complex organisms.

PR3, initially described as an elastin-degrading protease, is also known as the principal target antigen of antineutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (c-ANCA) that are formed in Wegener granulomatosis patients. This latter disease is characterized by necrotizing granulomas of the respiratory tract and perivascular inflammation of small blood vessels (reviewed in Ref. 3Kallenberg C.G. Heeringa P.

Often two subsets of PMNs carrying low and high amounts of PR3 can be distinguished among freshly isolated PMNs of an individual. The proportion of strongly and weakly PR3-positive PMNs is stable over time and is also maintained after PMN priming and subsequent PMN activation (reviewed in Ref. 5von Vietinghoff S. Schreiber A.

Upon PMN priming, additional amounts of PR3 reach the extracellular milieu either as a freely secreted or as a membrane-bound protease (reviewed in Refs. 1Korkmaz B. Moreau T. Gauthier F.

Upon binding of c-ANCA to neutrophil membranes, PMNs are fully activated, produce reactive oxygen species, and release lysosomal enzymes from their azurophil granules, including PR3, to the pericellular environment (reviewed in Ref. 6Rarok A.A. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 74: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An association of PR3 with membrane lipid rafts and potential interactions of PR3 with the β2-integrins CD18 and CD11b and the FcγRIIIb receptor has been reported some time ago (7David A. Fridlich R. Aviram I. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Fridlich R. David A. Aviram I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PR3 was also associated with a myristoylated membrane protein with a translocase activity, phospholipid scramblase 1, present in lipid rafts (9Kantari C. Pederzoli-Ribeil M. Amir-Moazami O.

Recently, a direct physical interaction of PR3 with NB1 neutrophil antigen, which is also known as CD177, was demonstrated (10Bauer S. Abdgawad M. Gunnarsson L. Segelmark M. Tapper H. Hellmark T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11von Vietinghoff S. Tunnemann G. Eulenberg C. Wellner M. Cristina C.M. Luft F.C. Kettritz R. Blood. 2007; 109: 4487-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NB1 is a 58-64-kDa glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored surface receptor, belonging to the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor superfamily, expressed exclusively by PMNs, neutrophilic metamyelocytes, and myelocytes, but not by other blood cells (reviewed in Refs. 12Stroncek D.F. Caruccio L. Bettinotti M. J. Transl. Med. 2004; 2: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar and 13Stroncek D.F. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like membrane-bound PR3, neutrophil antigen NB1 shows variable expression on PMNs ranging from 0 to 100! (10Bauer S. Abdgawad M. Gunnarsson L. Segelmark M. Tapper H. Hellmark T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). NB1, an as yet poorly characterized membrane receptor, appears to play a role in PMN transmigration as it interacts with PECAM-1 on endothelial cell membrane (14Sachs U.J. Andrei-Selmer C.L. Maniar A. Weiss T. Paddock C. Orlova V.V. Choi E.Y. Newman P.J. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. Santoso S. J. Biol.

Interactions between the positively charged PR3 and PMN membranes cannot simply be due to a charge effect as PR3 binding was not blocked by the highly positively charged granzyme B (15Kurschus F.C.

Direct interactions of PR3 to reconstituted lipid bilayers and lipid vesicles were recently studied, and a dissociation constant of 4.5 μm relating to lipid vesicles with a mixed composition has been determined. A hydrophobic surface patch of PR3 consisting of Phe-166, Ile-217, Trp-218, Leu-223, and Phe-224 was suggested to insert into lipid bilayers (16Goldmann W.H. Niles J.L. Arnaout M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Hajjar E. Mihajlovic M. Witko-Sarsat V. Lazaridis T. Reuter N. Proteins. 2008; 71: 1655-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analyzing the diversity and residue substitutions in PR3 homologs from other closely related primates, we noticed that the hydrophobic patch of human PR3 (hPR3) was not conserved on gibbon (Hylobates pileatus) PR3 (gPR3) and other primates. This finding prompted us to examine whether gPR3 is still able to interact directly with membranes and with cells that express the human NB1 receptor as a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein. Although gPR3 (Leu-166, Arg-218, His-223) did not adhere to lipid membranes and to the human NB1 receptor, a human-gibbon hybrid carrying the respective hydrophobic residues of hPR3 was capable of binding to cells that stably expressed the human NB1 receptor. In conclusion, PR3-NB1 interactions are of hydrophobic nature and retain the hPR3 molecule on cellular membranes. Production and Purification of Recombinant PR3 Variants—Recombinant proPR3 of human and gibbon origin were expressed in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells using the Flip-In technology (Invitrogen). The expression vector used in this study was based on pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen). An Igκ chain secretion signal peptide followed by an S-peptide tag was integrated into the pcDNA5/FRT vector using the oligonucleotide duplex (sequences on request) DJ2972 and DJ2973 (Metabion/Martinsried). Full-length cDNA of hPR3 was amplified with DJ3153 and DJ3156 (Metabion/Martinsried). Hereby, an enterokinase cleavage site (4×Asp-Lys) was introduced at the N terminus of mature PR3. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the PmlI/AgeI sites after digestion. This construct was named pcDNA5/FRT/hPR3-H6. Gibbon cDNA was amplified from blood granulocyte cDNA using two primer pairs, firstly DJ2924 and DJ2929 and subsequently the primers DJ3153 and DJ3156. The final gPR3 product was subcloned (pcDNA5/FRT/gPR3-H6) as described for hPR3. The two human/gibbon chimera were obtained by replacing a 390-bp BlpI/AgeI fragment in pcDNA5/FRT/hPR3-H6 and pcDNA5/FRT/gPR3-H6 with that from the other species. Flp-In HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10! fetal calf serum. Transfection of 1.8 μg of pOG44 (encoding the Flp-In recombinase) and 0.2 μg of expression vector was done in 100 μl of serum-free OptiMEM medium containing 7 μl of FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Two days later, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10! fetal calf serum containing 75 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were visible after 14 days. Recombinant human, gibbon, and hybrid proforms of PR3 were purified from culture supernatants by single step nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Purified proforms were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The N-terminal S-tag peptide was cleaved off by calf enterokinase (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1 to 20 at room temperature. Production and Purification of Recombinant NB1 Receptor—Full-length NB1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (18Kissel K. Santoso S. Hofmann C. Stroncek D. Bux J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by PCR using 5′-GTCATGGGCCGGGTATTACTGCT-3′ and 5′-CGTGAGAAGCGTGATGTGCAG-3′ as the forward and backward primer, respectively, and previously described plasmids as a template (18Kissel K. Santoso S. Hofmann C. Stroncek D. Bux J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 2 × 106 High Five insect cells in 1 ml of Express Five SFM medium were transfected with 1 μg of NB1 pcDNA3.1 plasmid using Cellfectine (Invitrogen). After 3 days, stable transfected cells were selected in culture medium containing blasticidin (80 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Recombinant NB1 protein from 2-liter culture supernatants was purified using a mAb 7D8 affinity column as described previously (14Sachs U.J. Andrei-Selmer C.L. Maniar A. Weiss T. Paddock C.

Purified NB1 was dialyzed in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and stored frozen. Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid (BCA protein assay; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expression of NB1 in CHO Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10! fetal calf serum and 0.5! penicillin/streptomycin and were transfected with the full-length NB1 cDNA in pcDNA3.1 as described previously (14Sachs U.J. Andrei-Selmer C.L. Maniar A. Weiss T. Paddock C. Orlova V.V. Choi E.Y. Newman P.J. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. Santoso S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23603-23612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected with Zeocin (200 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and subcloned. Transfectants expressing recombinant NB1 receptor were identified by flow cytometry using mAb 7D8 against NB1. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences FACSort flow cytometer. The presence of the NB1 receptor on stably transfected CHO cells before and after incubation (1 h, room temperature) with hPR3 (1-5 μg/ml) was analyzed by double labeling using a murine anti-NB1 mAb (MEM-166, Biolegend) and donkey anti-mouse (1:200, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. NB1 receptor transfected CHO cells in suspension culture were incubated (1 h, room temperature) with 2 μg/ml purified prohPR3 and active hPR3 and stained with the anti-PR3 mAbs CLB12.8 (Peli-Cluster), MCPR3-2 (Thermo Scientific), or 4A5 (WieslabAB). The presence of hPR3 after treatment with 2 mg/ml α1-PI (Sigma-Aldrich) and elafin (Proteo Biotech AG, Kiel, Germany) (2 h, room temperature) was analyzed using mAb 4A5. Results were obtained from three independent experiments. Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy Analysis—Adherent NB1 transfected CHO cells were fixed with 3! paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and stained using a 1:75 dilution of a murine anti-NB1 monoclonal antibody (MEM-166, Biolegend) and an Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary donkey anti-mouse Ab (1:200) at room temperature for 1 h. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1.5! bovine serum albumin. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss confocal microscope. Suspended NB1 receptor transfected CHO cells were incubated with 1-2 μg/ml hPR3 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1! bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. After centrifugation and resuspension, cells were stained using a mouse anti-PR3 monoclonal antibody CLB12.8 (1:100) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary donkey anti-mouse Ab at room temperature for 1 h. Degradation of Soluble Recombinant NB1 Receptor by hPR3—A secreted version of the His-tagged NB1 receptor was purified with mAb 7D8 affinity column and incubated with hPR3 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. The proform of hPR3 was produced in HEK293 cells and converted to its active form by enterokinase after purification. After SDS-PAGE and silver staining, we observed a complete disappearance of the NB1 receptor band (∼60 kDa) (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained after incubations with commercially available HNE and CG preparations (not shown). By contrast, CHO cells expressing the entire human NB1 receptor showed positive staining after hPR3 incubations. Confocal microscopy analysis of adherent NB1 receptor-expressing CHO cells confirmed the proper sorting and surface anchorage of the receptor in CHO cells (Fig. 1B). After incubations with 1 μg/ml hPR3 at room temperature for 2 h, the NB1 receptor was still present on the cellular surface as shown by flow cytometry after anti-NB1 staining (Fig. 1C). NB1 receptors on the surface of CHO cells are evidently resistant to hPR3, as well as to HNE and CG (not shown) as opposed to its soluble form, which is rapidly degraded by all three enzymes. Membrane NB1 Binds Not Only the Mature hPR3 but Also Its Proform—Proforms and mature forms of serine proteases display conformational differences and, therefore, differ in their proteolytic activities. This transition is known to affect the conformation of three surface loops, the 142-152 loop (so-called autolysis loop), the 186-194 loop, and the 217-225 loop (reviewed in Ref. 19Jenne D.E. Kuhl A. Clin. Nephrol. 2006; 66: 153-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 186-194 loop of hPR3 carries three positively charged residues Arg-186A, Arg-186B, and Lys-187, and the 217-225 loop carries the four hydrophobic residues Ile-217, Trp-218, Leu-223, and Phe-224 (20Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using three different monoclonal anti-PR3 antibodies (CLB12.8, 4A5, MCPR3-2), we analyzed the binding of the proform and the mature form of hPR3 to NB1 on CHO cells. Both forms of hPR3 were detected on the plasma membrane of NB1 receptor-expressing CHO cells (Fig. 2, A and B). No interaction was observed with nontransfected CHO cells using recombinant proPR3 and hPR3 at concentrations of 2 μg/ml. Flow cytometry results were confirmed by fluorescent and confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2C). At high concentrations (15 μg/ml), hPR3 (but not gPR3) adhered to membranes of NB1 receptor-negative CHO cells, indicating that an additional mechanism of hydrophobic binding, direct lipid insertion (16Goldmann W.H. Niles J.L. Arnaout M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was operating under these conditions (supplemental Fig. 1A). We examined whether N-linked carbohydrates were involved in membrane and receptor interactions. hPR3 from the culture supernatant of HEK293 cells is highly glycosylated in contrast to naturally occurring hPR3 from PMNs, which carries only few carbohydrate moieties (22Specks U. Fass D.N. Finkielman J.D. Hummel A.M. Viss M.A. Litwiller R.D. McDonald C.J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We confirmed these previous results by mass spectrometry analyses of natural and recombinant hPR3 before and after endoglycosidase F treatment. Using a human proPR3 variant with the natural Ala-Glu-propeptide and without N-linked glycosylation sites (22Specks U. Fass D.N. Finkielman J.D. Hummel A.M. Viss M.A. Litwiller R.D. McDonald C.J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we also found PR3 binding to NB1 receptor transfected CHO cells (not shown). As prohPR3 is proteolytically inactive and cannot degrade NB1 receptor in solution, we examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay whether soluble recombinant NB1 was able to interact with immobilized prohPR3. No interaction of the two proteins was observed under these conditions, suggesting that glycolipid-anchored NB1 receptors on cell surfaces either have a different conformation or act in concert with other cell surface components. NB1-bound hPR3 Is Active and Inhibited by α1-PI and Elafin—Next we examined whether NB1-bound membrane-associated hPR3 is still active toward a fluorogenic substrate Abz-VADnorVADRQ-EDDnp (21Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and whether macromolecular inhibitors can access the active site region of PR3-NB1 complexes. To this end, we recorded cleavage activities in suspensions of hPR3 bound by NB1 transfected CHO cells and in association with washed and resuspended cells. Approximately 20! of the hPR3 activity was found in the phosphate-buffered saline wash solution, whereas 80! remained associated with cellular membranes (Fig. 3A). Exogenously added α1-PI completely inhibited the activity of membrane-bound hPR3 (Fig. 3B). To investigate the fate and behavior of hPR3 after α1-PI binding, we analyzed the cells by flow cytometry using the anti-PR3 mAb 4A5 that binds to PR3 even in a complex with α1-PI or NB1. Strongly decreased fluorescence after treatment with α1-PI indicated a loss of the PR3 antigen from the cellular surface (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with NB1 receptor transfected CHO cells that were fixed with paraformaldehyde after incubation with α1-PI to prevent possible dissociation of α1-PI-hPR3 complexes from NB1 receptor during washing and staining (supplemental Fig. 1B). Elafin (6 kDa), a canonical low molecular weight inhibitor, abolished the activity of hPR3 on NB1-positive CHO cells, but in contrast to α1-PI, this interaction did not result in a dissociation of the hPR3-NB1 complex on CHO membranes (supplemental Fig. 1B). Complex formation between elafin and hPR3 did not change the ratio between receptor-bound hPR3 and soluble hPR3 (20!) of the supernatant. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that NB1-bound hPR3 on cellular membranes is accessible to physiological substrates and inhibitors, but only α1-PI is able to dissociate the hPR3 from membranes. The same results were obtained with activated PMNs from human blood. 5B. Korkmaz, J. Jaillet, M. L. Jourdan, A. Gauthier, F. Gauthier, and S. Attucci, manuscript submitted. We conclude that the NB1 receptor presents an active hPR3, and at sites or conditions of low α1-PI concentrations, NB1 receptor-bound hPR3 may significantly contribute to tissue injury and pericellular proteolysis before PMNs are fully activated by exogenous danger signals. Molecular Surface Differences between Human and Gibbon Proteinase 3—The primate gibbon (H. pileatus) PR3 (gPR3) was cloned from PMNs of a freshly isolated blood sample and sequenced. 6A. Kuhl, B. Korkmaz, B. Utecht, W. Samtleben, U. Schönermarck, U. Specks, and D. E. Jenne, manuscript in preparation. It differs from its human homolog by only 16 residues. Comparative structural analysis of hPR3 and gPR3 revealed the location of amino acid variations, which almost exclusively mapped to loops and modified the molecular surface. Natural substitutions on the protein surface have been selected by the evolutionary process and are, therefore, compatible with the biological function and folding pathways of PR3. The substitutions found on gPR3 are not equally distributed but are clustered on one side of the surface of two β-barrels. With one exception, all substitutions are located on the front site of the molecule in a clear distance from the active site region. Critical residues like Asp-61, Lys-99, and Arg-143 that determine substrate binding and cleavage specificity are not altered on gPR3 (21Korkmaz B. Hajjar E. Kalupov T. Reuter N. Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Moreau T. Godat E. Juliano L. Gauthier F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The N-terminal β-barrel carries seven substitutions (Val-35, Ser-38A, Leu-38B, Gln-60, His-63A, Gln-90, Gln-74). Nine substitutions in gPR3, two of which are highly conservative Ile-Val exchanges (Val-204, Val-208), are localized on the C-terminal β-barrel (Thr-146, Leu-166, Gly-187, Arg-218, Ala-219, His-223, Ala-229). Val-204 and Ala-229 are located in the inner portion of the molecule. The most striking difference between gPR3 and hPR3 is the replacement of three hydrophobic residues (Phe-166, Trp-218, Leu-223) by positively charged or more polar residues (Leu-166, Arg-218, His-223) on the surface of gPR3. In particular, the positively charged Arg-218 interrupts the surface-exposed hydrophobic patch on gPR3 (Fig. 4, A-C). The strongly hydrophobic patch of hPR3 is also not found on PR3 homologs from other species and on HNE or CG (Fig. 4D). By contrast to hPR3, the latter two enzymes bind to PMNs by charged dependent mechanisms via heparan sulfate- and chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycans (24Campbell E.J. Owen C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14645-14654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Korkmaz B. Attucci S. Jourdan M.L. Juliano L. Gauthier F. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that hydrophobic surfaces of the NB1 receptor and hPR3 account for the membrane binding of hPR3. This hypothesis implied that only hPR3, but not gPR3, was able to interact with human NB1-expressing cells. Mapping of the NB1-interacting Region on hPR3—These considerations were consistent with our initial experimental results indicating that hPR3, but not gPR3, was able to bind to NB1-expressing CHO cells (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 1C). To define the NB1-interacting area at the structural level, we constructed human-gibbon hybrids with the N-and C-terminal β-barrels, which are the smallest independently folding subdomains of serine proteases. These two subdomains of chymotrypsin-type serine proteases are homologous to each other and can be reassembled into catalytically active hybrid molecules that retain the functional properties of the parental subdomains (26Hopfner K.P. Kopetzki E. Kresse G.B. Bode W. Huber R. Engh R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9813-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We produced in HEK293 cells the g/hPR3 hybrid (N-terminal β-barrel from gPR3 and C-terminal β-barrel from hPR3) and the h/gPR3 hybrid (N-terminal β-barrel of human origin), which lacks three hydrophobic residues in the 217-225 loop. Only the g/hPR3 hybrid, but not the h/gPR3 variant, was detected on the surface of NB1-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5, C and D). As the most radical changes affected the surface area of closely clustered hydrophobic residues (Phe-165, Phe-166, Ile-217, Trp-218, Leu-223, Phe-224) and no other area of the C-terminal subdomain, there is little doubt that Phe-166, Trp-218, and Leu-223 are located within the contact area between NB1 and hPR3. Covalent complexation between serpins like α1-PI and serine proteases triggers a number of conformational changes in the bound protease. In particular, the surface loop 217-225 is distorted relative to the free structure, as reported for the α1-PI-pancreatic elastase complex (27Dementiev A. Dobo J. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3452-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As this segment of hPR3 contains four hydrophobic residues, Ile-217, Trp-218, Leu-223, and Phe-224, and forms a γ-turn between Ile-217 and Gly-219 with Trp-218 in the center (20Fujinaga M. Chernaia M.M. Halenbeck R. Koths K. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), distortion of the 217-225 loop in the complex with α1-PI most likely disrupts the binding site for NB1. As a consequence, hPR3 dissociates from the NB1 receptor during its interaction with α1-PI. Our findings explain why cell-bound PR3 autoantibodies were not detectable on PMN membranes in whole blood from Wegener granulomatosis patients as membrane-bound hPR3 is rapidly removed from the NB1 receptor at the usually high levels of α1-PI in human blood (28Abdel-Salam B. Iking-Konert C. Schneider M. Andrassy K. Hansch G.M. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The approach chosen by us is original and insightful and clarifies the hydrophobic nature of PR3 interactions with cellular membranes at the structural level. The binding of hPR3 to cellular surfaces has attracted a great deal of attention for various reasons in the past. Different mechanisms for its hydrophobic interactions with membranes have been inferred, but the molecular basis for this unique property of hPR3 has so far not been clarified. Hence it is important to map the structural determinants that mediate this unusual property of hPR3. Membrane-bound human PR3 of PMNs is the genuine target of c-ANCA that can activate PMNs. Surface-bound autoantibodies trigger perivascular inflammation in Wegener granulomatosis. Surface-bound PR3 may also contribute to pericellular proteolysis and tissue damage around cytokine-primed PMNs in general. The surface-accessible epitopes of PR3-NB1 complexes are presumably the prime target of pathogenic anti-PR3 autoantibodies. We appreciate the technical assistance of S. Werth, C. Hofmann, H. Kittel, and E. Stegmann. We thank Dr. U. Specks for providing HEK293 cells expressing the prohPR3 variant that lacks N-linked glycosylation sites. Download .pdf (.73 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2010232769,"The tumor suppressor protein kinase LKB1 exerts its effects by phosphorylating and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and members of the AMPK-related kinase family, such as the brain-specific kinases BRSK1/BRSK2 (SAD-B/SAD-A). LKB1 contains a conserved serine residue near the C terminus (Ser-431 in mouse LKB1) that is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK. Although some studies suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and is not rate-limiting for activation of AMPK, others have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-431 is necessary to allow LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate AMPK and other downstream kinases. Prompted by our discovery of an LKB1 splice variant (LKB1S) that lacks Ser-431, we have reinvestigated this question. In HeLa cells (which lack endogenous LKB1), co-expression with STRADα and MO25α of wild type LKB1, the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1, or LKB1S gave equal levels of activation of endogenous AMPK. Similarly, recombinant STRADα·MO25α complexes containing these LKB1 variants were equally effective at phosphorylating and activating AMPK, BRSK1, and BRSK2 in cell-free assays. Finally, all four LKB1 variants and a truncated LKB1 lacking the C-terminal region altogether were equally effective at causing cell cycle arrest when co-expressed with STRADα and MO25α in the G361 melanoma cell line. Our results do not support the idea that phosphorylation of Ser-431 increases the ability of LKB1 to phosphorylate downstream targets.

In HeLa cells (which lack endogenous LKB1), co-expression with STRADα and MO25α of wild type LKB1, the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1, or LKB1S gave equal levels of activation of endogenous AMPK. Similarly, recombinant STRADα·MO25α complexes containing these LKB1 variants were equally effective at phosphorylating and activating AMPK, BRSK1, and BRSK2 in cell-free assays. Finally, all four LKB1 variants and a truncated LKB1 lacking the C-terminal region altogether were equally effective at causing cell cycle arrest when co-expressed with STRADα and MO25α in the G361 melanoma cell line. Our results do not support the idea that phosphorylation of Ser-431 increases the ability of LKB1 to phosphorylate downstream targets.

Metabolic stresses that inhibit ATP synthesis (e.g. hypoxia, hypoglycemia) or that stimulate ATP consumption (e.g. muscle contraction) cause an increase in the cellular ADP:ATP ratio that is amplified by adenylate kinase into a much larger increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. AMP and ATP bind antagonistically to two sites formed by the four tandem cystathionine β-synthase motifs on the γ subunit (3Scott J.W. Hawley S.A. Green K.A. Anis M. Stewart G. Scullion G.A.

This latter effect is triggered by a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ without requiring any increase in AMP.The sequence around Thr-172 is highly conserved in a family of kinases whose catalytic domains are closely related to those of AMPK. These AMPK-related kinases (ARKs) also require phosphorylation at the threonine residue equivalent to Thr-172 before they become active. They include the brain-specific kinases BRSK1/2 (also known as SAD-A/-B), SIK1/2/3 (SIK/QIK/QSK), NUAK1/2 (ARK5/SNARK), MARK1/2/3/4, and the testis-specific kinase SNRK (12Lizcano J.M. Go¨ransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 13Jaleel M. McBride A. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Toth R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In LKB1–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts those ARKs that are expressed are dephosphorylated and inactive, whereas they are phosphorylated and active in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (12Lizcano J.M. Go¨ransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar).Although LKB1 is required for the activity of AMPK and the ARKs in most cells, several lines of evidence suggest that it is constitutively active. Thus, in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts that are stimulated with phenformin or AICAR, the activities of LKB1 and the ARKs are constant, despite increased phosphorylation and activation of AMPK (12Lizcano J.M. Go¨ransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Ma¨kela¨ T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activities of LKB1 and the ARKs are unchanged in muscle during contraction, although the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK increases (14Sakamoto K. Goransson O. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E310-E317Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results suggest that LKB1 is constitutively active and continually phosphorylates AMPK. The effects of AICAR, phenformin, or contraction to promote Thr-172 phosphorylation appear to be due instead to the ability of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside monophosphate (which increases in response to AICAR (15Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar)) or AMP (which increases in response to phenformin (9Hawley S.A. Pan D.A.

In hypomorphic mouse mutants with loxP sites in the Lkb1 gene, the expression of the protein in skeletal muscle is reduced by ≈50% in the heterozygote and >90% in the homozygote. However, activation of the α2 isoform of AMPK by electrically stimulated contraction was unaffected in the heterozygote and only moderately reduced, by ∼50%, in the homozygote (16Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Hardie D.G. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the effect of ischemia in cardiac muscle (20Sakamoto K. Zarrinpashneh E. Budas G.R. Pouleur A.C. Dutta A. Prescott A.R. Vanoverschelde J.L. Ashworth A. Jovanovic A. Alessi D.R. Bertrand L. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E780-E788Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It was only when LKB1 expression was totally eliminated, by crossing with a strain expressing Cre recombinase from a muscle-specific promoter, that activation of AMPK-α2 by contraction or ischemia was abolished (16Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Hardie D.G. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 20Sakamoto K. Zarrinpashneh E. Budas G.R. Pouleur A.C.

These results suggest that LKB1 is not normally rate-limiting for AMPK activation in muscle and that further activation of LKB1 would have little effect.Contrasting with this view are reports suggesting that the C-terminal region of LKB1, distal to the kinase domain, might serve a regulatory function. This region is phosphorylated in intact cells at Ser-431 in mouse LKB1 by both cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and p90-RSK, and an S431A mutation was reported to prevent the ability of LKB1 to reduce proliferation of G361 cells (21Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19469-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Glucagon caused phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser-431 in perfused rat liver, and this correlated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK at the activating site, Thr-172 (22Kimball S.R. Siegfried B.A. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54103-54109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-431 by protein kinase Cζ was reported to be required for phosphorylation of Thr-172 on AMPK in response to metformin treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells (23Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-431 on LKB1 appears to be required for axon specification in the developing nervous system in response to agents such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, by promoting the ability of LKB1 to activate BRSK1/BRSK2 (SAD-B/SAD-A) (24Barnes A.P.

Finally, in Drosophila melanogaster the residue equivalent to Ser-431 (Ser-535) can also be phosphorylated (26Martin S.G. St. Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in the lkb1 gene caused defects in polarity of the oocyte, and this could be rescued by low level expression in the germ line of wild type LKB1 or the potentially phosphomimetic S535E mutant, but not by the nonphosphorylatable S535A mutant, although the latter was effective if overexpressed (26Martin S.G. St. Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).In view of the conflicting evidence as to whether LKB1 exerts a regulatory role in vivo, we felt that it was important to re-examine the role of Ser-431 phosphorylation. This study was also prompted by our recent findings that variants of LKB1 exist because of alternate splicing at the 3′ end of the mRNA. The newly described short variant (LKB1S) contains an unique 38-residue sequence at the C terminus and lacks the Ser-431 site (27Towler M.C. Fogarty S. Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Martin D.M.A. Morrice N.

For all experiments, the cells were cultured on 60- or 100-mm-diameter dishes and lysed in situ in 0.25–0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (34Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol.

The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Expression of GST Fusion Proteins in HEK293 Cells and Affinity Purification—Dishes (10 cm) of HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of the pEBG-2T constructs together with FLAG-STRADα and myc-MO25α using the PEI method. After 36–48 h the cells were lysed, and the clarified lysates were incubated for 2 h on a rotating platform with glutathione-Sepharose (25 μl/dish of lysate) previously equilibrated in Buffer A.

Post-transfection (36 h), the cells were treated with nocodazole (70 ng/ml) and grown for an additional 18 h to induce a G2/M block. The cells were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, treated with RNase (50 μg/ml; Qiagen), and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). The cell cycle profiles of GFP-positive cells were determined by flow cytometry.RESULTSMutation or Phosphorylation of Ser-431 Does Not Affect the Activation of AMPK in HeLa Cells—We initially utilized HeLa cells, which do not express LKB1 so that AMPK has a very low activity unless an ionophore or other agent that increases cellular Ca2+ is added to activate endogenous calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (7Hawley S.A.

HeLa cells stably expressing wild type LKB1L or an S431A mutant of LKB1L have been previously generated (30Sapkota G.P. Deak M. Kieloch A. Morrice N. Goodarzi A.A. Smythe C. Shiloh Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As expected, the cells expressing wild type LKB1L exhibited an increased AMPK activity compared with untransfected control cells, and this was associated with a large increase in phosphorylation of the downstream target of AMPK, ACC, at the AMPK site (Ser-79). However, there were identical increases in AMPK activity (Fig. 1A) and ACC phosphorylation (Fig. 1B) in the cells expressing the S431A mutant. The addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to activate calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β, either to control cells or cells stably expressing wild type LKB1L (Fig. 1C) or to normal HeLa cells transiently transfected with DNAs encoding wild type LKB1L, STRADα, and MO25α (Fig. 1D), caused a larger increase in AMPK activity that was not additive with the effect of LKB1L expression. Next, we transiently transfected normal HeLa cells with DNAs encoding STRADα, MO25α, and wild type LKB1L, or several variants of it, including a kinase-inactive mutant (D194A), a nonphosphorylatable mutant (S431A), and a potentially phospho-mimetic mutant (S431E), as well as the short splice variant, LKB1S, that lacks the Ser-431 site. Fig. 1E shows that, by Western blotting using an antibody (anti-LKB1(N)) that recognizes an N-terminal epitope common to all variants, LKB1L and all mutants of it expressed at approximately equal levels, whereas LKB1S expressed at a significantly lower level. It also shows that all active variants, but not the D194A mutant, increased the activity of endogenous AMPK, and its phosphorylation at Thr-172, to an equal extent compared with untransfected control cells. LKB1S was just as effective as the three active LKB1L variants, even though its level of expression was much lower. These experiments were repeated with or without forskolin to activate endogenous cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, which is known to phosphorylate Ser-431 (21Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M.

As expected, Ser-431 was phosphorylated (assessed using a phosphospecific antibody) in response to forskolin only when LKB1L (or the kinase-inactive D194A mutant) and not when the S431A or S431E mutants of LKB1L, or LKB1S, were expressed. Even though Ser-431 phosphorylation was stimulated by forskolin using wild type LKB1L, the activation of endogenous AMPK, or its phosphorylation on Thr-172, was not significantly increased (Fig. 1F).Phosphorylation of Ser-431 Does Not Stimulate Phosphorylation of AMPK, BRSK1, or BRSK2 in Cell-free Assays—Because it has been proposed that phosphorylation of Ser-431 on LKB1L promotes its ability to phosphorylate and activate BRSK1/2 and hence axon specification (24Barnes A.P.

Because these “brain-specific” kinases are not expressed in HeLa cells, this analysis was performed in cell-free assays after expression of GST fusions of LKB1 complexes in HEK-293 cells and of BRSK1 and BRSK2 in bacteria. Fig. 2A shows the results of purification of LKB1 complexes on glutathione-Sepharose, after co-expression of GST fusions of LKB1 variants with FLAG-tagged STRADα and myc-tagged MO25α in HEK-293 cells. All LKB1 variants, including wild type LKB1L, the D194A, S431A, and S431E mutants of LKB1L, and wild type LKB1S, expressed equally well and (unlike free GST, not shown) co-purified with FLAG-STRADα and myc-MO25α. We initially tested these complexes using a bacterially expressed GST fusion of the AMPK-α1 kinase domain, which is dephosphorylated and inactive because of the lack of upstream kinases in bacteria (28Scott J.W. Norman D.G. Hawley S.A. Kontogiannis L. Hardie D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The wild type, S431A, and S431E complexes of LKB1L all phosphorylated Thr-172 and activated the GST-α1 kinase domain fusion equally well, whereas the inactive D194A mutant did not increase phosphorylation and activity above that in a control without kinase, as expected (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained for phosphorylation and activation of GST fusions of BRSK1 and BRSK2 (Fig. 2, D and E), although the level of phosphorylation and activation of BRSK2 was much less than that of BRSK1. The similar levels of activation obtained with the wild type, S431A, and S431E variants of LKB1S were not due to the assays being saturated with upstream kinase, because in every case LKB1S gave an even larger level of both phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 2, B–E).FIGURE 2Phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, BRSK1, and BRSK2 by LKB1 variants in cell-free assays.

Prior gene knock-in of the human NDI-causing AQP2 mutation T126M produced mutant mice that died by age 7 days. Here, we used a novel ""conditional gene knock-in"" strategy to generate adult, AQP2-T126M mutant mice. Mice separately heterozygous for floxed wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-T126M were bred to produce hemizygous mice, which following excision of the wild-type AQP2 gene by tamoxifen-induced Cre-recombinase gave AQP2(T126M/-) mice. AQP2(T126M/-) mice were polyuric (9-14 ml urine/day) compared to AQP2(+/+) mice (1.6 ml/day) and had reduced urine osmolality (400 vs. 1800 mosmol). Kidneys of AQP2(T126M/-) mice expressed core-glycosylated AQP2-T126M protein in an endoplasmic reticulum pattern. Screening of candidate protein folding ""correctors"" in AQP2-T126M-transfected kidney cells showed increased AQP2-T126M plasma membrane expression with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). 17-AAG increased urine osmolality in AQP2(T126M/-) mice by >300 mosmol but had no effect in AQP2(-/-) mice. Kidneys of 17-AAG-treated AQP2(T126M/-) mice showed partial rescue of defective AQP2-T126M cellular processing. Our results establish an adult mouse model of NDI and demonstrate partial restoration of urinary concentration function by a compound currently in clinical trials for other indications."
https://openalex.org/W2031626514,"Use of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin (RTX) as analgesics is an attractive therapeutic option. RTX opens the cation channel inflammatory pain/vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) permanently and selectively removes nociceptive neurons by Ca(2+)-cytotoxicity. Paradoxically, not only nociceptors, but non-neuronal cells, including keratinocytes express full length TRPV1 mRNA, while patient dogs and experimental animals that underwent topical treatment or anatomically targeted molecular surgery have shown neither obvious behavioral, nor pathological side effects.To address this paradox, we assessed the vanilloid sensitivity of the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line and primary keratinocytes from skin biopsies.Although both cell types express TRPV1 mRNA, neither responded to vanilloids with Ca(2+)-cytotoxicity. Only ectopic overproduction of TRPV1 rendered HaCaT cells sensitive to low doses (1-50 nM) of vanilloids. The TRPV1-mediated and non-receptor specific Ca(2+)-cytotoxicity ([RTX]>15 microM) could clearly be distinguished, thus keratinocytes were indeed resistant to vanilloid-induced, TRPV1-mediated Ca(2+)-entry. Having a wider therapeutic window than capsaicin, RTX was effective in subnanomolar range, but even micromolar concentrations could not kill human keratinocytes. Keratinocytes showed orders of magnitudes lower TRPV1 mRNA level than sensory ganglions, the bona fide therapeutic targets in human pain management. In addition to TRPV1, TRPV1b, a dominant negative splice variant was also noted in keratinocytes.TRPV1B expression, together with low TRPV1 expression, may explain the vanilloid paradox: even genuinely TRPV1 mRNA positive cells can be spared with therapeutic (up to micromolar) doses of RTX. This additional safety information might be useful for planning future human clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2007187935,"Background For generations many families in and around Florida's Apalachicola National Forest have supported themselves by collecting the large endemic earthworms (Diplocardia mississippiensis). This is accomplished by vibrating a wooden stake driven into the soil, a practice called “worm grunting”. In response to the vibrations, worms emerge to the surface where thousands can be gathered in a few hours. Why do these earthworms suddenly exit their burrows in response to vibrations, exposing themselves to predation? Principal Findings Here it is shown that a population of eastern American moles (Scalopus aquaticus) inhabits the area where worms are collected and that earthworms have a pronounced escape response from moles consisting of rapidly exiting their burrows to flee across the soil surface. Recordings of vibrations generated by bait collectors and moles suggest that “worm grunters” unknowingly mimic digging moles. An alternative possibility, that worms interpret vibrations as rain and surface to avoid drowning is not supported. Conclusions Previous investigations have revealed that both wood turtles and herring gulls vibrate the ground to elicit earthworm escapes, indicating that a range of predators may exploit the predator-prey relationship between earthworms and moles. In addition to revealing a novel escape response that may be widespread among soil fauna, the results show that humans have played the role of “rare predators” in exploiting the consequences of a sensory arms race."
https://openalex.org/W2054921818,"Background Honey bees display a complex set of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits that correlate with the colony storage of surplus pollen (pollen hoarding). We hypothesize that the association of these traits is a result of pleiotropy in a gene signaling network that was co-opted by natural selection to function in worker division of labor and foraging specialization. By acting on the gene network, selection can change a suite of traits, including stimulus/response relationships that affect individual foraging behavior and alter the colony level trait of pollen hoarding. The ‘pollen-hoarding syndrome’ of honey bees is the best documented syndrome of insect social organization. It can be exemplified as a link between reproductive anatomy (ovary size), physiology (yolk protein level), and foraging behavior in honey bee strains selected for pollen hoarding, a colony level trait. The syndrome gave rise to the forager-Reproductive Ground Plan Hypothesis (RGPH), which proposes that the regulatory control of foraging onset and foraging preference toward nectar or pollen was derived from a reproductive signaling network. This view was recently challenged. To resolve the controversy, we tested the associations between reproductive anatomy, physiology, and stimulus/response relationships of behavior in wild-type honey bees. Methodology/Principal Findings Central to the stimulus/response relationships of honey bee foraging behavior and pollen hoarding is the behavioral trait of sensory sensitivity to sucrose (an important sugar in nectar). To test the linkage of reproductive traits and sensory response systems of social behavior, we measured sucrose responsiveness with the proboscis extension response (PER) assay and quantified ovary size and vitellogenin (yolk precursor) gene expression in 6–7-day-old bees by counting ovarioles (ovary filaments) and by using semiquantitative real time RT-PCR. We show that bees with larger ovaries (more ovarioles) are characterized by higher levels of vitellogenin mRNA expression and are more responsive to sucrose solutions, a trait that is central to division of labor and foraging specialization. Conclusions/Significance Our results establish that in wild-type honey bees, ovary size and vitellogenin mRNA level covary with the sucrose sensory response system, an important component of foraging behavior. This finding validates links between reproductive physiology and behavioral-trait associations of the pollen-hoarding syndrome of honey bees, and supports the forager-RGPH. Our data address a current evolutionary debate, and represent the first direct demonstration of the links between reproductive anatomy, physiology, and behavioral response systems that are central to the control of complex social behavior in insects."
https://openalex.org/W1989128549,"LKB1 is an upstream activating kinase for the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and at least 12 other AMPK-related kinases. LKB1 therefore acts as a master kinase regulating the activity of a wide range of downstream kinases, which themselves have diverse physiological roles. Here we identify a second form of LKB1 generated by alternative splicing of the LKB1 gene. The two LKB1 proteins have different C-terminal sequences generating a 50-kDa form (termed LKB1L) and a 48-kDa form (LKB1S). LKB1L is widely expressed in mouse tissues, whereas LKB1S has a restricted tissue distribution with predominant expression in the testis. LKB1S, like LKB1L, forms a complex with MO25 and STRAD, and phosphorylates and activates AMPK both in vitro and in intact cells. A phosphorylation site (serine 431 in mouse) and a farnesylation site (cysteine 433 in mouse) within LKB1L are not conserved in LKB1S raising the possibility that these sites might be involved in differential regulation and/or localization of the two forms of LKB1. However, we show that phosphorylation of serine 431 has no effect on LKB1L activity and that both LKB1L and LKB1S have similar patterns of subcellular localization. These results indicate that the physiological significance of the different forms of LKB1 is not related directly to differences in the C-terminal sequences but may be due to their differential patterns of tissue distribution.

These results indicate that the physiological significance of the different forms of LKB1 is not related directly to differences in the C-terminal sequences but may be due to their differential patterns of tissue distribution. LKB1 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor because inactivating mutations in the LKB1 gene lead to a cancer predisposition disease in humans, termed Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. LKB1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that forms a complex with two other proteins, STRAD (STE20-related adaptor) (1Baas A.F. Boudeau J. Sapkota G.P. Smit L. Medema R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Clevers H.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3062-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and MO25 (mouse protein 25) (2Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). STRAD shares extensive sequence identity with protein kinases but lacks several residues required for catalytic activity and therefore has been termed a pseudokinase. MO25 binds to the C-terminal 3 amino acids of STRAD (1Baas A.F. Boudeau J. Sapkota G.P. Smit L. Medema R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Clevers H.C.

Biol. 2004; 11: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and binding of MO25 markedly increases the binding of STRAD to LKB1 (2Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition to enhancing the catalytic activity of LKB1, it has been reported that binding of STRAD and MO25 causes LKB1 to relocalize from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (4Boudeau J. Scott J.W. Resta N. Deak M. Kieloch A. Komander D. Hardie D.G. Prescott A.R. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6365-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, there has also been a report that claims that phosphorylation of serine 428 at the C terminus of human LKB1 (equivalent to Ser-431 in mouse) is necessary for LKB1 export from the nucleus (5Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, another study reported that phosphorylation at this site does not result in relocalization (6Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The cytosolic localization of LKB1 appears to be important for its tumor suppressor functions, because mutants of LKB1 that are unable to enter the nucleus retain their full capability to suppress cell growth (7Tiainen M. Vaahtomeri K. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).

Although a complete understanding of the physiological relevance of the different upstream kinases in the AMPK cascade is some way off, it appears that LKB1 has a predominant role in activating AMPK in some tissues. For example, deletion of LKB1 in liver led to an almost complete loss of AMPK activity (16Shaw R.J. Lamia K.A. Vasquez D. Koo S.H. Bardeesy N. Depinho R.A. Montminy M. Cantley L.C. Science. 2005; 310: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), and in skeletal muscle a lack of LKB1 abolished activation of the α2-containing AMPK complexes (17Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Grahame Hardie D. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). More recently, LKB1 has been shown to phosphorylate 12 AMPK-related kinases within their T-loop regions, and this phosphorylation is essential for their activation (18Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). LKB1 itself is phosphorylated on at least 8 serine/threonine residues. Four of these are autophosphorylation sites, whereas the remaining 4 sites are phosphorylated by other kinases (19Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To date there is no evidence to suggest that phosphorylation at any of these sites has a direct effect on the activity of LKB1 in vitro (6Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Sapkota G.P. Boudeau J. Deak M. Kieloch A. Morrice N. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19469-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have reported that LKB1 activity is unaltered by stimuli that cause significant activation of AMPK (10Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar, 18Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M.

Alessi D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E310-E317Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that LKB1 is constitutively active. However, despite the lack of evidence for the direct regulation of LKB1 catalytic activity, several studies have indicated that the function of LKB1 may be subject to indirect modes of regulation. Mutation of Thr-336 to a glutamic acid residue, but not to an alanine, prevented LKB1 from suppressing cell growth in G361 cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue has an inhibitory effect on LKB1 activity (20Sapkota G.P. Boudeau J. Deak M. Kieloch A. Morrice N. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this finding is unclear because phosphorylation of Thr-336 has only been reported to occur using manganese ATP as a substrate, rather than magnesium ATP, the physiologically relevant form of ATP (20Sapkota G.P. Boudeau J. Deak M. Kieloch A. Morrice N. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ser-431 in mouse LKB1 (equivalent to Ser-428 in the human sequence) has been shown to be phosphorylated by a number of kinases, including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (21Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol.

Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-431 to either alanine or glutamic acid prevented LKB1 from suppressing cell growth (21Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19469-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that this residue is required for some aspect of LKB1 function. Recently, a role for the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of LKB1 has been proposed based on studies examining LKB1 in neuronal polarization (23Barnes A.P. Lilley B.N. Pan Y.A. Plummer L.J. Powell A.W.

Cell. 2007; 129: 565-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that phosphorylation of Ser-428 in human LKB1 is involved in relocalization of LKB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that this is required for the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK (5Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Here we describe the identification of a previously uncharacterized form of LKB1, generated by alternative splicing, that has a different C-terminal sequence from the previously studied form and lacks the equivalent residue corresponding to Ser-428/431. We have called the new form of LKB1, LKB1S (for LKB1 short form) and the originally published form LKB1L (corresponding to LKB1 long form). We show that the new form of LKB1 associates with STRAD and MO25, is catalytically active, and can activate AMPK in cells. LKB1S is highly expressed in testis, with low levels of activity detected in other tissues. The predominant expression of LKB1S in testis provides indirect evidence that it maybe involved in male fertility because male mice lacking LKB1S are infertile. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of Ser-428/431 has no effect on LKB1 activity and is not involved in relocalization of the LKB1 complex between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Materials—Forskolin, hydrogen peroxide, and oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse and human testis cDNA were obtained from Ambion. All of the microarray products were purchased from Agilent Technologies UK unless otherwise noted. Tissue Harvesting and Preparation—Tissues from male mice (C57/Bl6), ∼10 weeks old were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Prior to analysis, the tissues were roughly chopped in two volumes of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine) and then briefly homogenized with a rotor-stator homogenizer. Triton X-100 was added to the homogenates to 1% (v/v), and the homogenates were incubated on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Protein content in the supernatant was determined using the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Antibodies—We raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against full-length mouse LKB1L (expressed as a His tagged-fusion protein in Escherichia coli). A peptide (CMWKSQGAGLPGEE) corresponding to residues 390–403 of mouse LKB1S was used to raise anti-LKB1S antibodies (termed anti-sLKB1) in rabbit. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the serum using the immunizing-peptide coupled to thiol-activated Sepharose. Affinity-purified sheep antibody raised against residues 24–39 of human LKB1 was a kind gift from Prof. Dario Alessi (University of Dundee). Mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing both LKB1L and LKB1S (Ley37D/G6) and anti-STRADα (STRAD N13) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing Ser(P)-428 in human LKB1L, monoclonal anti-MO25, and phospho-CREB (Ser-133, 87G3) were from Cell Signaling Technology. FLAG (M2) and anti-CREB were from Sigma, and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from AbCam. A pan-β-specific AMPK antibody has been described elsewhere (26Woods A. Cheung P.C.

Western Blot Analysis—Primary antibodies were detected with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to either Alexa-Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (LI-COR) and scanned on the Li-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Quantification of results was performed using Odyssey software 2.0 (LI-COR Biotechnology). LKB1 and AMPK Activity Assays—LKB1 activity was determined by a two-step assay that measures the ability of LKB1 to activate recombinant AMPK (10Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). For endogenous LKB1S activity, mouse tissue extracts were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C, and then LKB1S was immunoprecipitated by incubation with rabbit anti-sLKB1antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. LKB1 activity in transiently transfected cells was immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-FLAG resin. In each case, the immune complexes were washed extensively with buffer A and then incubated with 0.2–1 μg of recombinant AMPK (α1β1γ1) and 0.2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 in buffer A (20 μl of total volume) for 20 min at 37 °C. AMPK activation of was quantified by removing an aliquot (5 μl) of the reaction and measuring AMPK activity using the SAMS peptide assay (27Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). AMPK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (50 μg of total protein) using an anti-pan-β AMPK antibody, and the activity was measured by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide. Synthesis of cDNA Expression Constructs—cDNA encoding LKB1S was amplified from human or mouse testis cDNA with LKB1S-specific oligonucleotide primers using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). The primers used were: human, forward primer (including FLAG tag (underlined) and EcoRI restriction site in italics), AAGCTTGAATTCATGGATTATAAAGATGATGACGATAAAGCCATGGAGGTGGTGGACCCGCAG; and reverse primer (including XhoI restriction site in italics), TCTAGACTAGTCTCGAGCTACTGCGGCGCCGGCCGAGAGG; mouse, forward primer (including FLAG tag (underlined) and EcoRI restriction site in italics), AAGCTTGAATTCATGGATTATAAAGATGATGACGATAAAGCCATGGACGTGGCGGACCCCGAG; and reverse primer (including XhoI restriction site in italics), TCTAGACTAGTCTCGAGCTACACTAAAGCCCCAAACCCC. The products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and cloned into pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The authenticity of the inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNA encoding human LKB1L was amplified from an IMAGE clone with an N-terminal FLAG tag sequence engineered at the 5′ end and cloned into pCDNA3 (a kind gift from Dr. Naveenan Navaratnam, Medical Research Council Clinical Sciences Centre). cDNAs encoding mouse LKB1L and mouse LKB1L harboring a mutation of aspartic acid 194 to alanine (LKB1D194A) were a kind gift from A. Ashworth. The cDNAs were amplified to include a FLAG tag at the N terminus and cloned into pCDNA3. The point mutations (S431A and S431E) were introduced into mouse LKB1L using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. cDNAs encoding human STRADα and MO25α (a kind gift from Prof. Dario Alessi, University of Dundee) were cloned into pCDNA3. Mammalian Cell Culture—CCL13 and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, N-glutamine (2 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were transferred to serum-free medium 2 h prior to treatment with either 20 μm forskolin for 30 min or 0.5 mm H2O2 for 5 min. Following treatment, the cells were washed briefly with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 500 μl ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Cell Transfection—Plasmid DNA was prepared using a Qiagen maxiprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (CalPhos™ mammalian transfection kit; Clontech), following the standard manufacturers protocol. After ∼18 h the cells were washed in PBS and shocked with 10% (v/v) Me2SO for 2 min. The cells were treated 36 h post-transfection. Immunofluorescence—CCL13 cells were plated on glass coverslips for transfection. 36 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS containing 5% (v/v) donkey serum and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin before incubation with primary antibody. After thorough washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (conjugated with Alexafluour 488; Invitrogen). After further washing, the cells were mounted on coverslips with Vectashield and visualized on a Leica TCS SP1 confocal microscope. Image analysis was performed using Leica software. Subcellular Fractionation—Mouse testis extract or HEK293 cell lysates were subjected to cell fractionation using a Qproteome Cell-Compartment kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Microarray Analysis—RNA was extracted from whole mouse testis using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by purification on an RNeasy column (Qiagen) according to the standard manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and concentration was assessed using an Agilent bioanalyzer. 1 μg of RNA and 5 μl of (1:2500 dilution) Agilent One-Color RNA Spike-In RNA were labeled with reagents supplied in the Agilent low RNA input linear amplification kit PLUS, one-color according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The labeled cRNA was purified with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Hybridization and Scanning—The Agilent hybridization kit was used in conjunction with Agilent Mouse whole genome Oligo Arrays. 2 μg of the labeled sample RNA were used for hybridization according to the Agilent one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis protocol. The hybridization was performed for 17 h at 65 °C with 10 rpm rotation. The slides were then washed as described in the manufacturer’s manual. The slides were then washed in acetonitrile for 1 min followed by 30 s in Agilent stabilization and drying solution. The slides were scanned with the Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner system. Data Extraction and Deposition into Gene Expression Omnibus—For data extraction and quality control, the Agilent G2567AA feature extraction software (version 9.1) was used. The data files were deposited into the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus to comply with Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment requirements. Gene Expression Analysis—The data were analyzed using Genespring GX 7.3 Expression Analysis software (Agilent Technologies). Text tab delimited raw files were imported into Genespring. Standard data transformation, chip, and gene normalizations were applied, in addition to standard QC procedures. Differences in testis gene expression between the two groups were identified using Volcano Plot analysis. The data were corrected for multiple testing corrections with adjusted p values using the method of Hotchberg and Benjamini with a user-defined false discovery rate of 5%. We investigated the amount of LKB1 protein in mouse tissues following immunoprecipitation with a sheep polyclonal anti-LKB1 antibody. Western blot analysis of the resulting LKB1 immune complexes with an anti-LKB1 monoclonal antibody revealed a band migrating with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa in all of the tissues analyzed. In addition, a second cross-reacting band, migrating with a molecular mass of ∼48 kDa, was detected in testis (Fig. 1A). The same pattern was observed using a different LKB1 antibody for immunoprecipitation (data not shown), suggesting that both bands are related to LKB1. We refer to the 50-kDa protein as LKB1L (for long form) and to the 48-kDa protein as LKB1S (for short form). Quantification of the blots showed that the 50-kDa protein is most highly expressed in brain and testis. Previous studies have shown that LKB1 requires binding of two other proteins, MO25 (2Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and STRAD (1Baas A.F. Boudeau J. Sapkota G.P. Smit L. Medema R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Clevers H.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3062-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) for activity, and so we blotted the immune complexes with antibodies specific for the α isoforms of these two proteins. As can be seen from Fig. 1, both MO25α and STRADα co-immunoprecipitate with LKB1 in all of the tissues examined. In brain, a second slower migrating band was detected strongly by the STRADα antibody. However, this band was not detected when a different LKB1 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (data not shown), and so we remain uncertain as to the nature of this cross-reacting protein. We ruled out protein degradation as a likely explanation for the appearance of the 48-kDa band, because it was only detected significantly in the testis, and similar patterns of detection were observed on multiple occasions in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors in the buffers used for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Next, we considered the possibility that alternative splicing of the LKB1 gene might give rise to LKB1S. Upon re-examination of the mouse LKB1 gene, we identified a potential exon within the intron between exons VIII and IX of the previously determined gene structure (28Smith A. Ward M.P. Garrett S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This additional exon, which we termed IXa (exon IX becoming IXb), is conserved within the human and mouse LKB1 genes (Fig. 2A) and contains a termination codon. Alternative splicing of the LKB1 gene after exon VIII would lead to the different C-terminal amino acid sequences shown in Fig. 2B. Interestingly, the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by exon IXa lacks a phosphorylation site (Ser-428/431) and the farnesylation site (Cys-430/433) within the previously identified LKB1 sequence. We raised an antibody (termed anti-sLKB1) against a predicted C-terminal peptide sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”) of mouse LKB1S and determined whether it could immunoprecipitate LKB1 from mouse tissues. Using this antibody, LKB1 activity, as determined by activation of recombinant AMPK, was readily detectable in immune complexes isolated from testis (Fig. 3A). Low, but detectable, activity was also observed in lung, heart, liver, and kidney, whereas no detectable activity was present in brain or muscle (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that the 48-kDa band is greatly depleted (greater than 85% of a control immunoprecipitation) from testis homogenates immunoprecipitated using the LKB1S antibody. This confirms that the 48-kDa band seen in Western blots corresponds to LKB1S. Immunoprecipitates of LKB1 isolated using an antibody raised to an N-terminal peptide sequence (which is present in both LKB1L and LKB1S) were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to total LKB1 or LKB1S (Fig. 3C). A doublet migrating at ∼48 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the novel LKB1 protein, is recognized by both antibodies in testis but not in any other tissue tested. These results show that the 48-kDa protein highly expressed in testis is the alternative LKB1 splice variant and that this form of LKB1 is capable of phosphorylating and activating AMPK in vitro. Based on the sequence of mouse and human LKB1S, we used specific oligonucleotide primers to amplify the cDNA from mouse or human testis. In both cases, single products of ∼1.2 kb were obtained, and sequence analysis showed that they encoded the expected amino acid sequence of mouse or human LKB1S (data not shown). The cDNA products were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with a FLAG tag engineered at the N termini. Fig. 4A shows overexpression of LKB1S, LKB1L, and a catalytically inactive mutant, LKB1D194A in CCL13 cells, which do not express endogenous LKB1. To investigate the ability of these expressed proteins to associate with MO25α and STRADα, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody to isolate the expressed LKB1. The resulting immune complexes were probed with antibodies specific for MO25α and STRADα. All three forms of LKB1 co-immunoprecipitate with endogenously expressed MO25α and STRADα (Fig. 4B). The activity of endogenous AMPK immunoprecipitated from cells overexpressing LKB1 was measured using the SAMS peptide assay. Expression of either LKB1L or LKB1S results in activation of AMPK under basal conditions, compared with cells overexpressing LKB1D194A. Overexpression of LKB1D194A had no effect on AMPK activity compared with an untransfected control. Previous reports have suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-428/431 may be responsible for regulation of LKB1 activity (6Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R."

Less is understood concerning factors that limit this process. Experiments performed using dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-3 (DYRK3) knock-out and transgenic mice reveal that erythropoiesis is attenuated selectively during anemia. DYRK3 is restricted to erythroid progenitor cells and testes. DYRK3-/- mice exhibited essentially normal hematological profiles at steady state and reproduced normally. In response to hemolytic anemia, however, reticulocyte production increased severalfold due to DYRK3 deficiency. During 5-fluorouracil-induced anemia, both reticulocyte and red cell formation in DYRK3-/- mice were elevated. In short term transplant experiments, DYRK3-/- progenitors also supported enhanced erythroblast formation, and erythropoietic advantages due to DYRK3-deficiency also were observed in 5-fluorouracil-treated mice expressing a compromised erythropoietin receptor EPOR-HM allele. As analyzed ex vivo, DYRK3-/- erythroblasts exhibited enhanced CD71posTer119pos cell formation and 3HdT incorporation. Transgenic pA2gata1-DYRK3 mice, in contrast, produced fewer reticulocytes during hemolytic anemia, and pA2gata1-DYRK3 progenitors were compromised in late pro-erythroblast formation ex vivo. Finally, as studied in erythroid K562 cells, DYRK3 proved to effectively inhibit NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) transcriptional response pathways and to co-immunoprecipitate with NFATc3.

Erythroid cell production is highly regulated, and ∼1011 red blood cells are formed daily by the adult erythron. During anemia, erythropoiesis can be accelerated further by several factors.

As tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) orthologues, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and Fas ligand each can attenuate erythroid progenitor cell proliferation and/or survival (6Socolovsky M.

Previously, our laboratories reported on the erythroid-restricted expression of a novel DYRK (dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase) family dual-specificity kinase, DYRK3/REDK (14Lord K.A.

Upon antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of DYRK3 expression, enhanced murine and human colony-forming unit-erythroid formation also was observed (14Lord K.A. Creasy C.L. King A.G. King C.

Interestingly, this suggested that DYRK3 might act to attenuate erythroblast development.DYRK kinase orthologues also exist in lower species and have been studied functionally in yeast, Dictyostelium, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, stress in the form of glucose depletion stimulates the DYRK kinase YAK1p. YAK1p then phosphorylates a Pop2p transcription factor complex which regulates cell cycle entry and progression (16Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, a YAKA orthologue likewise is stimulated due to nutrient depletion and acts to inhibit growth stage genes in part by phosphorylating and inhibiting a cprD growth-phase factor (17Taminato A. Bagattini R. Gorjao R. Chen G. Kuspa A. Souza G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). YAKA loss-of-function also leads to accelerated cell growth. In C. elegans, a minibrain kinase DYRK kinase exerts inhibitory effects, but these are directed toward a MEI-1 substrate which itself attenuates the transition of oocytes to developing zygotes (18Stitzel M.L. Pellettieri J. Seydoux G. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, in Drosophila, a “minibrain” phenotype (Mnb) has been attributed to the mutation of minibrain as a DYRK family kinase (19Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Minibrain is important for optic and central lobe development and best corresponds to DYRK1a among five vertebrate DYRKs (20Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Campbell L.E. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Vertebrate DYRKs are best studied in man and mice, with two classes represented. Class-1 includes DYRK1a and DYRK1b/M1RK kinases. DYRK1a interestingly maps to a critical region of Down syndrome trisomy-21 (22Epstein C.J. Nature. 2006; 441: 582-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice haplo-insufficient for DYRK1a exhibit decreased brain size and compromised pyramidal cell complexity (23Fotaki V.

DYRK1a also has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the neuronal proteins α-synuclein (26Kim E.J. Sung J.Y. Lee H.J. Rhim H. Hasegawa M. Iwatsubo T. Min do S. Kim J. Paik S.R. Chung K.C. J. Biol.

DYRK1b is structurally most related to DYRK1a. To date, gene disruption experiments have not revealed specific roles for DYRK1b. However, DYRK1b has been implicated as an anti-apoptotic factor within several solid tissue tumors (28Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Shah S. Naqvi A. Friedman E.

Bone W. Gottwald U. Fritsch M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 267: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DYRK2 is more broadly expressed and, like at least certain DYRKs of lower species, appears to be stress-activated and to attenuate cell growth (16Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S.

In its gene and kinase domain substructures, DYRK3 is most related to DYRK2 (33Zhang D. Li K. Erickson-Miller C.L. Weiss M. Wojchowski D.M. Genomics. 2005; 85: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is predominantly cytoplasmic, and among hematopoietic cells is narrowly restricted in its expression to erythroid lineage (14Lord K.A.

Kuspa A. Souza G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and YAK1p (34Pratt Z.L. Drehman B.J. Miller M.E. Johnston S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), DYRK3 also has been associated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as well as cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathways (35Li K. Zhao S. Karur V. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47052-47060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DYRK3 in vivo functions, however, are poorly understood.To test hypothesized roles of DYRK3 as a candidate lineage-specific regulator of erythropoiesis, we presently have generated DYRK3-/- mice and have examined effects of DYRK3-deficiency on erythropoietic capacities. In several anemia models, and in analyses of primary bone marrow erythroblast development ex vivo, the absence of DYRK3 conferred a meaningful advantage for erythroid cell formation. By comparison, transgenic expression of DYRK3 from a pA2gata1 vector (36Miller C.P. Heilman D.W. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Zhang D.

Hematol. 2001; 29: 1278-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) significantly attenuated late-stage erythropoiesis. We, therefore, propose that DYRK3 may act via intrinsic erythroid cell mechanisms to selectively place an upper limit on stress erythropoiesis. One such mechanism for DYRK3 action which was tested involved possible modulation of NFAT activity. This was based on recently discovered intersections between DYRKs and NFAT signaling as investigated via small interfering RNA studies in Drosophila S2 cells (38Gwack Y. Sharma S. Nardone J. Tanasa B. Iuga A. Srikanth S. Okamura H. Bolton D. Feske S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In human erythroid cells, DYRK3 in fact is presently shown to efficiently inhibit NFAT transcriptional activation capacities. Based on these characterized suppressor properties, DYRK3 may further constitute a new rational target for small molecule inhibitors aimed at treating acute anemia. Potential significance is underlined by an emerging need for alternatives to EPO for the treatment of anemia due to cancer and chemotherapy (39Sytkowski A.J. Sci. STKE 2007. 2007; : pe38Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMouse Models—mDYRK3 genomic clones were isolated from a 129svJ λ phage library by hybridization to an hDYRK3 cDNA. DYRK3 gene deletion was in E14 ES cells using a floxed PGKneo targeting vector. Targeted cells were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Progeny of chimerics were bred with C57BL/6 mice (five generations) and with C57BL/6 EII2A-Cre mice. DYRK3+/- mice were bred to yield DYRK3-/- mice (which were further backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice). Wild-type controls were DYRK3+/+ littermates or C57BL/6J stocks. EpoR-HM mice (expressing a minimal EPO receptor allele) were as described (40Menon M.P. Fang J. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2005; 107: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PCR primer pairs were as follows: wild type DYRK3 allele, 5′-CCA-GCT-GCT-TCG-AGT-ATC-AGA-AG-3′ and 5′-GTA-CTT-GGC-ACG-TTT-GGA-TTG-C-3′; DYRK3-/- allele, 5′-GAG-GAG-ATC-CGG-ATC-TTG-GAG-CAT-CTT-3′ and 5′-GTA-AGT-CCC-TCC-CCG-CTC-TGA-GGG-3′. Transgenic pA2gata1-DYRK3 mice were prepared using an Myc epitope-tagged mDYRK3 cDNA (15Geiger J.N. Knudsen G.T. Panek L. Pandit A.K. Yoder M.D. Lord K.A. Creasy C.L. Burns B.M. Gaines P. Dillon S.B.

For all mice and protocols used (see below), review and approval was provided by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.Hematological Analyses—Blood cell counts were analyzed with an Advia system (Bayer). Hematocrits also were assayed by microcapillary centrifugation. Blood smears were stained with new methylene blue, and reticulocytes were assayed using Retic-COUNT (BD Biosciences). Burst- and colony-forming unit-erythroids were assayed in MethoCult M3234 medium (Stem Cell Technologies) containing murine SCF (100 ng/ml) plus EPO (5 units/ml). Colony forming unit granulocytic/monocytic colonies were assayed in MethoCult GF M3534 containing murine SCF (50 ng/ml), murine interleukin-3 (IL-3; 10 ng/ml), and human IL-6 (10 ng/ml).Anemia Models—Hemolytic anemia was induced by phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg, 1 and 24 h). 5-Fluorouracil-induced anemia was generated via intraperitoneal injection (150 mg/kg). In transplantations, B6.Ptprca.GPI-a recipients were irradiated (550 rads) at 5 and 1.5 h before transplant. Donor bone marrow from DYRK3-/- or C57BL/6 controls was injected via tail vein (5 × 106 cells). At day 13, recipients were analyzed for donor contributions based on Ly5.2 positivity, and frequencies of splenic CD71highTer119pos erythroblasts were determined (together with Ly5.2pos B220pos progenitors).Erythroblast Expansion and Proliferation Assays—Progenitor cells from DYRK3-/- and wild-type bone marrow were prepared as detailed previously (3Menon M.P. Karur V. Bogacheva O. Bogachev O. Cuetara B. Wojchowski D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Menon M.P. Fang J. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2005; 107: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Erythroid progenitors were expanded in SP34 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5 units/ml EPO, 100 ng/ml murine SCF (Peprotech Inc.), 1 μm dexamethasone, 1 μm β-estradiol, 75 μg/ml human transferrin, 1% bovine serum albumin (Stem Cell Technologies), and 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (SP34-EX medium). At 24 h, 0.6 volumes of SP34-EX were added. At 48 h, cells were replated. In 3HdT incorporation assays, KitposCD71high progenitors were isolated (by lineage depletion and magnetic cell sorting and separation system) and plated in SP34-EX medium (1 × 105 cells/ml) with erythropoietin and/or SCF. At 20 h, 1 μCi of 3HdT was added, and at 5 h, incorporation rates were determined.Flow Cytometry—In flow cytometry (BD FACScalibur), washed cells (1 × 106 per 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were incubated with rat IgG (1 μg) and stained with 1 μg each of APC-Ly5.2 or Ly5.1 (eBioscience), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-B220, or PE-Ter119 plus FITC-CD71 (BD Biosciences) antibodies. Analyses of erythroblast development ex vivo utilized PE-Ter119 plus FITC-CD71.Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR—RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared with SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR utilized iQ SYBR® Green and an i-Cycler (Bio-Rad). PCR primer pairs were from SuperArray Bioscience as follows: Nfatc1, NM_016791; Nfatc2, NM_010899; Nfatc3, NM_010901; Nfatc4, NM_ 023699; Nfat5, NM_018823; Dyrk3, NM_145508; β-actin, NM_007393.Cell Lines and Transcriptional Reporter Assays—K567/NFAT-Luc cells (Panomics) were maintained as recommended (in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin-B). Lines expressing (Myc)DYRK3 or GFP only (vector control) were prepared by transduction with VSVg-packaged MIEG3 retroviruses. Stably transduced GFPpos populations were isolated by FACS (BD Biosciences FACS Aria). Endogenous NFAT was activated using A23187 plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Induced luciferase levels were assayed using Promega reagents (#E4030 system) and a Turner Modulus luminometer.Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitations—Lysates from transfected 293 cells or primary erythroblasts were prepared as described previously (41Pircher T.J. Zhao S. Geiger J.N. Joneja B. Wojchowski D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3684-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In immunoprecipitations, rabbit antiserum to a DYRK3 peptide was utilized. Western blots utilized antibodies to a Myc epitope (Sigma) or to NFATc3 (Cell Signaling).RESULTSDYRK3 Deficiency Confers Erythropoietic Advantages during Anemia due to Hemolysis, 5-Fluorouracil, or Marrow Transplantation—To advance loss-of-function analyses, gene targeting was used to disrupt exon-3 of the DYRK3 gene, which encodes the DYRK3 catalytic domain and unique C-terminal region (33Zhang D. Li K. Erickson-Miller C.L. Weiss M. Wojchowski D.M. Genomics. 2005; 85: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Exon-3 targeting in ES cells and derived mice was confirmed initially by Southern blotting and subsequently by genomic PCR (Fig. 1). Reverse transcription-PCR further was employed to assess transcript expression in primary erythroblasts expanded from the bone marrow of DYRK3-/- mice. In initial analyses of phenotypes in DYRK3-/- mice, no effects of DYRK3 deficiency on reproductive capacities or other basic physiological parameters were observed (despite high level expression in testes) (14Lord K.A. Creasy C.L. King A.G. King C. Burns B.M. Lee J.C. Dillon S.B. Blood. 2000; 95: 2838-2846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Geiger J.N. Knudsen G.T. Panek L. Pandit A.K. Yoder M.D. Lord K.A. Creasy C.L. Burns B.M. Gaines P. Dillon S.B. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). With regard to hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cell counts and frequencies of myeloid progenitor cells in marrow (as determined via colony-forming assays) were essentially unaffected (data not shown). Within spleen and among DYRK3-/- mice, however, BFUe levels were reproducibly decreased. Specifically, DYRK3-/- BFUe frequencies were 37.3 ± 1.5 per 2 × 105 splenocytes versus 69.3 ± 4.6 per 2 × 105 splenocytes for wild-type congenic controls. For splenic granulocytic and monocytic lineages, no significant differences between DYRK3-/- progenitors and DYRK3+/+ progenitors were observed (data not shown). When the erythron is stressed, increases in splenic erythroid progenitor cell levels often are observed (5Longmore G.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 626-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 42Socolovsky M. Nam H. Fleming M.D. Haase V.H. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3261-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Observed decreases in splenic BFUe in DYRK3-/- mice, therefore, were consistent with possibly advantaged erythropoiesis. This notion was next tested in several anemia models.Mice first were treated with phenylhydrazine to induce hemolytic anemia. At days 8 and 12, DYRK3-/- mice produced reticulocytes at levels 1.6- and 2.4-fold above wild-type controls, respectively (Fig. 2A). In repeated experiments this advantage was maximal at day 10 post-phenylhydrazine dosing (Fig. 2B) but was not reflected by substantially increased hematocrits. For DYRK3-deficient red cells, this was not associated with any detectable increase in erythrocyte sensitivity to lysis by phenylhydrazine or hyposmotic solutions. Next, DYRK3-/- and congenic control mice were treated with 5-fluorouracil to deplete proliferating early progenitor cell pools. In this distinct anemia model, reticulocyte production in DYRK3-/- mice again was significantly elevated over controls (Fig. 3, upper panel). DYRK3 deficiency furthermore proved to protect against the sharp drop in hematocrits experienced by wild-type controls after 5-fluorouracil dosing (Fig. 3, lower panel). Capacities of donor DYRK3-/- progenitor cells to contribute to short term reconstitution in irradiated recipients also were assessed. Here, donor contributions were determined based on CD45-5.1 marking of hosts, and mice with >90% CD45-5.2 donor contributions were considered. Analyses were of donor-derived CD71highTer119pos erythroblasts in spleen at day-13 post-transplantation. Representative outcomes are illustrated in Fig. 4 and reveal an approximate 2-fold increase in DYRK3-/- CD71highTer119pos erythroblast formation. By direct comparison, no such difference was observed between DYRK3-/- and control donor-derived lymphoid B220pos cells.FIGURE 2Increased reticulocyte production in DYRK3-/- mice during phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia. A, DYRK3-/- and wild-type (wt) mice were dosed with phenylhydrazine at 1 and 24 h (60 mg/kg, n = 4 mice per group). On days 8 and 12 reticulocyte levels were determined (means ± S.D.) A1, reticulocyte populations also were analyzed by methylene blue staining (A2). B, in independent experiments reticulocyte production was monitored over an extended time-course (B1). Hematocrits in phenylhydrazine-treated DYRK3-/-, and wild-type congenic controls also were determined (B2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Increased reticulocyte production in DYRK3-/- mice during 5-fluorouracil induced anemia. DYRK3-/- and wild-type (wt) control mice were administered 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg, n = 3 mice per group). At the indicated intervals, reticulocyte levels and hematocrits were determined.

In transplantation experiments, bone marrow preparations from donor DYRK3-/- or wild-type (wt) control mice were used to repopulate irradiated Ly5.1-marked recipients. On day 13 and for mice with >90% Ly5.2 engraftment, levels of splenic CD71high Ter119pos erythroblasts were determined (in parallel with Ly5.2pos B220pos B-cells).

This involved the expansion of bone marrow progenitors in a serum-free SP34-EX medium with optimized supplements and sources (including KIT ligand, EPO, transferrin, bovine serum albumin, dexamethasone and β-estradiol). Erythroblast expansion depended upon KIT ligand and dexamethasone (as well as EPO), and in these regards reflects stress erythropoiesis (1Munugalavadla V. Kapur R. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

https://openalex.org/W2138273727,"Getting older is associated with a decline of cognitive and sensorimotor abilities, but it remains elusive whether age-related changes are due to accumulating degenerational processes, rendering them largely irreversible, or whether they reflect plastic, adaptational and presumably compensatory changes. Using aged rats as a model we studied how aging affects neural processing in somatosensory cortex. By multi-unit recordings in the fore- and hindpaw cortical maps we compared the effects of aging on receptive field size and response latencies. While in aged animals response latencies of neurons of both cortical representations were lengthened by approximately the same amount, only RFs of hindpaw neurons showed severe expansion with only little changes of forepaw RFs. To obtain insight into parallel changes of walking behavior, we recorded footprints in young and old animals which revealed a general age-related impairment of walking. In addition we found evidence for a limb-specific deterioration of the hindlimbs that was not observed in the forelimbs. Our results show that age-related changes of somatosensory cortical neurons display a complex pattern of regional specificity and parameter-dependence indicating that aging acts rather selectively on cortical processing of sensory information. The fact that RFs of the fore- and hindpaws do not co-vary in aged animals argues against degenerational processes on a global scale. We therefore conclude that age-related alterations are composed of plastic-adaptive alterations in response to modified use and degenerational changes developing with age. As a consequence, age-related changes need not be irreversible but can be subject to amelioration through training and stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1991525204,"A great amount of data has been accumulated on genetic variations in the human genome, but we still do not know much about how the genetic variations affect gene function. In particular, little is known about the distribution of nonsense polymorphisms in human genes despite their drastic effects on gene products.To detect polymorphisms affecting gene function, we analyzed all publicly available polymorphisms in a database for single nucleotide polymorphisms (dbSNP build 125) located in the exons of 36,712 known and predicted protein-coding genes that were defined in an annotation project of all human genes and transcripts (H-InvDB ver3.8). We found a total of 252,555 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 8,479 insertion and deletions in the representative transcripts in these genes. The SNPs located in ORFs include 40,484 synonymous and 53,754 nonsynonymous SNPs, and 1,258 SNPs that were predicted to be nonsense SNPs or read-through SNPs. We estimated the density of nonsense SNPs to be 0.85x10(-3) per site, which is lower than that of nonsynonymous SNPs (2.1x10(-3) per site). On average, nonsense SNPs were located 250 codons upstream of the original termination codon, with the substitution occurring most frequently at the first codon position. Of the nonsense SNPs, 581 were predicted to cause nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of transcripts that would prevent translation. We found that nonsense SNPs causing NMD were more common in genes involving kinase activity and transport. The remaining 602 nonsense SNPs are predicted to produce truncated polypeptides, with an average truncation of 75 amino acids. In addition, 110 read-through SNPs at termination codons were detected.Our comprehensive exploration of nonsense polymorphisms showed that nonsense SNPs exist at a lower density than nonsynonymous SNPs, suggesting that nonsense mutations have more severe effects than amino acid changes. The correspondence of nonsense SNPs to known pathological variants suggests that phenotypic effects of nonsense SNPs have been reported for only a small fraction of nonsense SNPs, and that nonsense SNPs causing NMD are more likely to be involved in phenotypic variations. These nonsense SNPs may include pathological variants that have not yet been reported. These data are available from Transcript View of H-InvDB and VarySysDB (http://h-invitational.jp/varygene/)."

The detailed mechanism of this conformational change remains unknown.

Chaperonin complexes containing wild-type subunits and mutant subunits with impaired ATP-dependent conformational change ability or ATP hydrolysis activity, one by one, exhibited high protein refolding ability. The effects of the mutant subunits correlate with the number and order in the ring. In contrast, the use of a mutant lacking helical protrusion severely affected the function.

However, their conformational change is likely to be transient. They captured denatured proteins even in the presence of ATP, whereas addition of ATP impaired the ability of the wild-type chaperonin to protect citrate synthase from thermal aggregation.

Chaperonins, a ubiquitous class of molecular chaperones, are double-ring assemblies of about 60-kDa subunits. Each ring has a large central cavity in which a non-native protein can undergo productive folding in an ATP-dependent manner (1.Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar, 2.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Chaperonin complexes change their conformations to close their chamber and encapsulate the bound substrate, providing a protected environment for protein folding. Opening and closing of the folding chamber is controlled by a conformational cycle driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis. Chaperonins are divided in two groups as follows: group I and group II chaperonins. Group I chaperonins are found in bacteria and endosymbiotic organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts), and subsets of bacterially related homologs in methanogens (3.Klunker D. Haas B. Hirtreiter A. Figueiredo L. Naylor D.J. Pfeifer G. Muller V. Deppenmeier U. Gottschalk G. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33256-33267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the other hand, group II chaperonins are found in archaea (known as thermosome) (4.Kagawa H.K.

Whereas group I chaperonins are homo-oligomeric, eukaryotic and archaeal group II chaperonins are generally hetero-oligomeric (6.Spiess C. Meyer A.S. Reissmann S. Frydman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All chaperonins share a similar subunit architecture consisting of three distinct domains as follows: an ATP-binding equatorial domain, a distal apical domain harboring the polypeptide-binding sites, and an intermediate hinge domain (7.Ditzel L.

The most striking structural difference between the two groups is the lid of the chaperonin cavity. The co-chaperonin (GroES in Escherichia coli) acts as a detachable lid for group I chaperonins by forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure. It interacts with one or both GroEL rings in an ATP-dependent fashion, thereby sealing the cavity from the outside (1.Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

In contrast, group II chaperonins have a built-in lid, which is composed of an extension of the apical domain called the helical protrusion (7.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H.

There are also reports on the requirements of ATP hydrolysis for the conformational transitions of group II chaperonins (13.Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J.

It might be plausible that the conformational change occurs at the transition state of ATP hydrolysis.The helical protrusion is not required for substrate binding but is indispensable for ATP-dependent conformational transitions and protein folding (16.Reissmann S.

The allosteric conformational changes in eukaryotic group II chaperonin are found to spread around the ring in a sequential manner, whereas allosteric transitions in the group I chaperonin GroEL occur in a concerted manner (18.Kafri G. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23.Rivenzon-Segal D. Wolf S.G. Shimon L. Willison K.R. Horovitz A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

However, despite these findings, the detailed mechanism of this cooperative action in ATP binding/hydrolysis or between helical protrusions for the ATP-dependent conformational changes of group II chaperonins remains obscure. To elucidate these issues, we investigated the details of the intraring cooperativity for ATP-dependent conformational change using a hyperthermophilic archaeal group II chaperonin from Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 (25.Yoshida T. Yohda M. Iida T. Maruyama T. Taguchi H. Yazaki K. Ohta T. Odaka M. Endo I. Kagawa Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previously, group I chaperonins composed of various combinations of wild-type and mutated subunits were constructed by covalent assembly of seven subunits (26.Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similar to this construction, we constructed chaperonin complexes composed of wild-type and mutant subunits. Analyzing these chaperonin complexes, we demonstrated that ATP binding/hydrolysis causes the independent conformational change of the subunit, and further conformational change for the complete closure of the lid is induced by the interaction between helical protrusions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, Reagents, and Protein—E. coli strains used in this study were DH5α for plasmid preparation and BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) for protein expression. KOD-plus-DNA polymerase and restriction endonucleases were obtained from Toyobo Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan), respectively. ATP, ADP, and thermolysin were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Citrate synthase from porcine heart and Thermoplasma acidophilum were obtained from Sigma. The ammonium sulfate suspension of CS from porcine heart was desalted on an NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare), as described previously (27.Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Ishii N. Zako T. Takahashi K. Maki K. Inobe T. Kuwajima K. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40375-40383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), before use. ADP was treated with hexokinase (Hoffmann-La Roche) plus glucose to remove contaminating ATP before use as described previously (28.Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentrations of chaperonins were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and they are expressed as molar concentrations of hexadecamer.Construction and Purification of Covalently Linked Chaperonins—To express covalently linked chaperonins, three types of fragments containing a wild-type or mutant chaperonin subunit gene were prepared by PCR. The initiation fragment, type “a” fragment, encodes a chaperonin subunit with initiation codon but without termination codon, which contains the NdeI and BamHI digestion sites. It was obtained using the primer pair (forward A, 5′-CAT-ATG-GCA-CAG-CTT-AGT-GGA-CAG-CCG-G-3′, and reverse A, 5′-CGG-GAT-CCA-TTA-CCA-CGA-GGA-TAC-ATG-CCC-ATT-CCG-CCG-GG-3′). Forward A primer contains the N-terminal sequence with an initiation codon in the NdeI site. Reverse A primer corresponds to the C-terminal sequence without the translation termination codon and contains the sequence for the thrombin digestion site and BamHI digestion site. The intermediate fragment, type “b” fragment, is the connecting fragment lacking both initiation codon and termination codon. It is obtained by PCR using the primer pair (forward B, 5′-GAA-GAT-CTG-CAC-AGC-TTA-GTG-GAC-3′, and reverse A). Forward B primer corresponds to the N-terminal sequence with a replacement for the insertion of BglII site and removal of the initiation codon. The terminal fragment, type “c” fragment, is for the C-terminal subunit, which is amplified with the primer pair (forward B and reverse B, 5′-GGA-TCC-TCA-CAT-GCC-CAT-GTC-CAT-TCC-GCC-3′). Reverse B primer contains the C-terminal sequence with termination codon and BamHI site.The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and their sequences were verified. The inserted DNA fragments were excised with NdeI/BamHI (type a) or BglII/BamHI (type b and c) and then purified for further use. For construction of two-, four-, and eight-subunit linked chaperonin complexes, the fragments were inserted into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET9a (Novagen) in the order of a–c, a–b–b–c, and a–b–b–b–b–b–b–c, respectively. At first, the a fragment was inserted into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET9a. Then the type b or type c BglII/BamHI fragment was ligated into the BamHI site. After the confirmation of the orientation of the gene, the next fragment was inserted into the BamHI site, which is located at the C terminus of the last subunit. Insertion of the fragment continues until the insertion of the type c fragment.All constructed chaperonin complexes were purified as described previously (11.Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K.

Subsequently, the purified chaperonins were incubated with thrombin protease (100 units/mg, GE Healthcare) at 22 °C for 40 h to digest the linker sequences. After digestion, thrombin was removed by size exclusion chromatography.Protein Folding Assay—The GFP employed in this study is a thermostable mutant used in assays performed at 60 °C (29.Yoshida T.

GFP (5 μm) was denatured in TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 m HCl at room temperature, and it was diluted 100-fold in the preincubated TKM folding buffer with or without chaperonin (100 nm) at 60 °C for 10 min. Nucleotide was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 1 mm 5 min after dilution of denatured GFP. The fluorescence of GFP at 510 nm with excitation at 396 nm was continuously monitored for 20 min using a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction mixtures were continuously stirred at 60 °C throughout the assays. As a control, native GFP was diluted in the folding buffer without chaperonin. The fluorescence intensity of native GFP was taken as 100%.CS from T. acidophilum was subjected to a refolding assay at 50 °C. T. acidophilum CS (19.8 μm, as a monomer) was denatured in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 60 min at 50 °C and then diluted 60-fold in the dilution buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, and 300 mm KCl) in the absence or presence of chaperonins (0.5 μm). The refolding reactions were conducted for 60 min at 50 °C. 1 mm ATP was added to the mixture 10 min after the dilution. After the refolding reactions, aliquots were removed from the mixture, and the recovered enzyme activity was assayed as described by Furutani et al. (31.Furutani M. Iida T. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. J.

The activity of enzyme refolded by wild-type chaperonin was taken as 100%.ATPase Activity Measurement—ATPase activities were measured at 60 °C in TKM buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 50 μg/ml chaperonin. The amount of Pi produced was measured using the malachite green assay as described previously (30.Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).SAXS Measurement—The SAXS experiments were performed with beamline 15A at the Photon Factory of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan. Measurements were obtained with protein concentrations of 5 mg/ml in TNM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) at 60 °C. Before data collection, the protein solutions were incubated with or without nucleotides (1 mm) at 60 °C. Scattering patterns were recorded by a CCD-based x-ray detector, which consisted of a beryllium-windowed x-ray image intensifier (Be-XRII) (V5445P-MOD, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), an optical lens, a CCD image sensor, and a data acquisition system (C7300, Hamamatsu Photonics), as described previously (32.Arai M.

Pair distribution (P(r)) functions were calculated using the GNOM program (34.Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The values for radius of gyration (Rg) and maximum particle distance (Dmax) were derived from the P(r) function.Protease Sensitivity Assay—Chaperonin (100 nm) was incubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) at 60 °C in TKM buffer under continuous mixing. Digestion with thermolysin (1 ng/μl) was carried out for 10 min at 60 °C. Proteins in the reaction mixture were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed on 10% SDS gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Fluorescence Intensity Assay—The chaperonin complexes were labeled with fluorescein 5-maleimide (Invitrogen). The fluorescence spectra were measured at 60 °C with Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. Chaperonin complexes (50 nm) in TKM buffer were preincubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) at 60 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 493 nm, and emission was recorded at wavelengths ranging from 500 to 650 nm. All fluorescence intensity spectra were independently analyzed three times.Fluorescence Polarization Assay—The chaperonin complexes prepared for fluorescence intensity assay were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR, Invitrogen). This assay was measured at 60 °C with a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a fluorescence polarization unit (Jasco). TMR-labeled chaperonin complexes (50 nm) in TKM buffer were preincubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) at 60 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 552 nm, and the emission was set at 570 nm, which is the maximum of emission intensity of TMR. Fluorescence polarization of TMR-labeled chaperonins was analyzed by a time course assay for 60 s. All fluorescence polarization assays were independently carried out three times.Thermal Aggregation Measurement—Thermal aggregation of CS from the porcine heart was monitored by measuring light scattering at 500 nm with a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500) for 20 min at 50 °C. Native CS was diluted to a final concentration of 100 nm (as a monomer) in TNM buffer with or without chaperonin (25 nm) and 1 mm nucleotide. The reaction mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 50 °C and continuously stirred throughout the measurement.RESULTSConstruction of Chaperonin Complexes Composed of Wild-type and Mutated Subunits in the Defined Order—Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 chaperonin is a double-ring complex that contains eight subunits per ring. The crystal structure of Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 chaperonin has shown that the resolvable N-terminal Val-9 residue of one subunit and C-terminal Ala-526 residue of the next subunit are closely located in the central cavity (8.Shomura Y. Yoshida T. Iizuka R. Maruyama T. Yohda M. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previously, we have constructed two- or four-subunit covalently linked Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 chaperonins by connecting the N-terminal Val-9 residue to the C-terminal Ala-526 residue. Although these chaperonins formed proper double-ring structures capable of capturing unfolded proteins and ATPase activity, they lacked ATP-dependent protein folding activity (35.Furutani M. Hata J. Shomura Y. Itami K. Yoshida T. Izumoto Y. Togi A. Ideno A. Yasunaga T. Miki K. Maruyama T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We attributed the loss of folding activity to the decreased flexibility of the N and C termini subunits necessary for the ATP-dependent conformational change. We then tried to obtain active chaperonin complexes by specific digestion of the linker sequence. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of the wild-type subunit was substituted with the thrombin recognized sequence (MYPR↓GN), and then two, four, and eight subunits were covalently connected with flexible linkers (Gly-Ser) (Fig. 1A). These covalently linked chaperonins were expressed and purified in the same manner as the wild type (11.Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The chaperonin complexes composed of covalently linked dimers, tetramers, and octamers were designated as cCpn(W2)8, cCpn(W4)4, and cCpn(W8)2, respectively. cCpn(W2)8 designates a connected (c) chaperonin hexadecameric complex composed of eight doubly connected wild-type subunits. They were then subjected to thrombin digestion at 22 °C for 40 h, and then the thrombin was removed by size exclusion chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography analysis showed that the prepared linker-digested chaperonin complexes (named as Cpn(W2)8, Cpn(W4)4, and Cpn(W8)2, respectively) retained proper oligomeric structures similar to that of the wild-type chaperonin, CpnWT (data not shown). By SDS-PAGE, cCpn(W2)8 and cCpn(W4)4 appeared as bands of two and four times the size of a chaperonin subunit. They changed to bands of the size corresponding to the chaperonin subunit monomer after thrombin digestion (data not shown). In contrast, cCpn(W8)2 did not appear as a single band of eight times the size of the single subunit, but after thrombin digestion, a single band corresponding to the molecular weight for one chaperonin subunit was detected. The cCpn(W8)2 was likely digested around the thrombin digestion site by the endogenous proteases in E. coli to various sizes of connected chaperonins. GFP folding activities of all covalently linked chaperonins were lower than that of CpnWT. This activity was recovered to the same level as that of the wild-type by thrombin digestion. Cpn(W8)2 also showed protein folding activity, but it was lower than the others (Fig. 1B).Using the two- and four-subunit connection system, we constructed various chaperonins composed of wild-type and mutant subunits in the defined order to investigate the molecular mechanism of the cooperative actions between subunits with regard to protein folding activity as well as the ATP-dependent conformational change of group II chaperonins (Fig. 1A). We used the mutants impaired in ATP-dependent conformational change ability (G65C) (designated as C) and ATP hydrolysis activity (D64A/D393A) (designated as A), and also the helical protrusion-deleted mutant Δ245–276 (Δhelical) (designated as H). The ATP hydrolysis activity of the homo-oligomer of G65C, CpnG65C, was almost twice of CpnWT, but conformational change was not induced by the ATP binding signal (30.Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The homo-oligomer of D64A/D393A, CpnD64A/D393A, showed only trace ATP hydrolysis activity and lacked protein folding ability. The homo-oligomer of Δ245–276, CpnΔhelical, did not show any ATP-dependent conformational change and was also deficient in protein folding activity in spite of the fact that it had ATPase activity and was capable of capturing an unfolded protein (17.Iizuka R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18834-18839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Connected chaperonin complexes containing wild-type and mutant subunits were constructed and then subjected to thrombin digestion. The chaperonin complex containing wild-type and G65C one by one, which was designated as Cpn(WC)8, was prepared from the connected complex of the wild-type and G65C. The subscript 8 designates that 8 units of WC (wild-type and G65C) are contained in a hexadecameric chaperonin complex. The complex containing W and C one by one in the same manner prepared from the four connected complexes was named Cpn(WCWC)4. The other chaperonin complexes composed of wild-type and mutant subunits were designated in the same manner.Functional Characterization of Chaperonin Hetero-complexes Containing G65C or D64A/D393A—To examine cooperative action in ATP binding and hydrolysis between subunits in the ring of group II chaperonins, Cpn(WC)8, Cpn(WWCC)4, Cpn(WCCC)4, Cpn(WWWC)4, Cpn(WA)8, Cpn(WWAA)4, Cpn(WAAA)4, and Cpn(WWWA)4 were constructed and characterized. The protein folding activities of these chaperonins were assessed using GFP (27 kDa) and citrate synthase from T. acidophilum (42 kDa) as substrates. The CpnWT arrests spontaneous folding of GFP and refolds it in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas CpnG"

In this model the relay helix tilts around its pivoting point formed by a phenylalanine cluster (Phe481, Phe482, and Phe652), which moves the lever arm of myosin. To study the effect of the elimination of the proposed pivoting point, these phenylalanines were mutated to alanines in two Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain constructs (MF481A, F482A and MF652A). The relay movement was followed by the fluorescence change of Trp501 located in the relay region. The steady-state and transient kinetic fluorescence experiments showed that the lack of the phenylalanine fulcrum perturbs the formation of the “up” lever arm state, and only moderate effects were found in the nucleotide binding, the formation of the “down” lever arm position, and the ATP hydrolysis steps. We conclude that the lack of the fulcrum decouples the distal part of the relay from the nucleotide binding site upon the recovery step. Our molecular dynamics simulations also showed that the conformation of the motor is not perturbed by the mutation in the down lever arm state, however, the lack of the pivoting point rearranges the dynamic pattern of the kink region of the relay helix.

Myosins are ATP-driven molecular motors that generate force and move along actin filaments.

A. 2005; 102: 6873-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) composed a model that describes the structural transition between the pre- and post-recovery states (down and up lever arm states, respectively) by simulating the intermediate structures using an unconstrained minimum-energy pathway method. The resulting structural trajectory shows that the relay helix moves in a seesaw-like fashion coupling the movement of switch 2 and the rotation of the lever arm: the closure of switch 2 pulls down the relay helix near its N-terminal end and due to a fulcrum in the middle of the helix, serving as the pivoting point, the C-terminal end of the relay helix swings upwards and finally unwinds in a second phase (Fig. 1). Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the seesaw-like motion and the pivoting role of this hydrophobic fulcrum (11Mesentean S. Koppole S. Smith J.C. Fischer S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Yu H. Ma L. Yang Y. Cui Q. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), however, experimental validation is still lacking. The recovery step is an experimentally well characterized process by the fluorescence change of the conserved Trp501 (Dictyostelium numbering, homologous to Trp510 in rabbit skeletal myosin), which is located at the C-terminal end of the relay helix (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Scheme 1 shows the reaction steps of the myosin basal ATPase cycle characterized by the use of a mutant motor domain, containing a single Trp501 (MW501+ construct) (14Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Steps 1 and 2 (K1K2 in Scheme 1) represent a two-step inducedfit ATP binding process. M†·ATP, which has a 20% lower fluorescence than the M apo state (Protein Data Bank code 1q5g), corresponds to the down lever arm state (i.e. pre-recovery, open, post-rigor; PDB 1FMW and 1MMD). This state has an open switch 2 and thus the lever arm is in the down orientation. The ATP binding process is followed by the recovery step (step 3a in Scheme 1) when switch 2 loop closes and the relay/converter/lever arm region rotates into the up lever arm state (i.e. post-recovery, pre-power stroke state; M*·ATP in Scheme 1, PDB codes 1VOM and 1MND (7Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Note that in the post-recovery state myosin contains ATP, whereas in the pre-power stroke state it has ADP·Pi, however, there structures are similar.). The closed switch 2 is required for the hydrolysis of ATP (15Bauer C.B. Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38494-38499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Holmes K.C. Geeves M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The forward direction of the recovery step results in a 110% fluorescence emission intensity increase of Trp501, serving a useful signal to follow the conformational change in the relay/converter region. This article demonstrates experimental investigations on the role of the relay helix fulcrum during the recovery step. This hydrophobic fulcrum is formed mainly by three conserved phenylalanine residues: Phe652 (part of the central ;-sheet), Phe481 and Phe482 (relay helix). Two mutant constructs were produced in the MW501+ construct, in which different parts of the fulcrum were replaced with alanines. MF481A, F482A construct has a reduced fulcrum in the side of the relay helix, whereas MF652A contains a reduced support for the relay helix. The steady-state and transient kinetic measurements show that the three phenylalanines form a real functional unit because the functional properties of the two constructs were very similar to each other. The mutations cause very specific changes in the mechanism of the basal ATPase cycle. No change was detected in the conformations of the apo and the down lever arm states, but a dramatic effect was found in the formation of the up lever arm state (step 3a). K3a is dramatically reduced and the conformation of this state is perturbed. In good agreement with these experimental results our molecular dynamics simulations show that the mutations changed the conformation of the relay region only in the up lever arm state. Interestingly, we also found that the mutations cause site-specific dynamic changes of the relay helix unwinding region in the down lever arm state without significant conformational change. This effect could be an indication of the reaction trajectory perturbation in the recovery step. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, except nucleotides (Roche Applied Sciences) and 3′-(N-methyl-anthraniloyl)-2′-deoxy-ATP (Jena Bioscience GmbH, Germany) and [;-32P]ATP (Izinta Ltd., Hungary). Protein Engineering, Expression, and Purification—F481A/F482A or F652A mutations were introduced into the single tryptophan containing W501+ Dd myosin motor domain II M761 cDNA fragment (14Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Dd AX2-ORF+ cells and purified using His-tagged chromatography as described previously (14Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Preparations were dialyzed against an assay buffer (40 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl, and 2 mm mercaptoethanol), in which all experiments were performed. Actin preparation and pyrene labeling were done as described previously (17Gyimesi M. Tsaturyan A.K. Kellermayer M.S. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—These measurements were carried out with a Fluoromax Spex-320 fluorimeter equipped with a 150-watt Xe lamp. Tryptophan was excited at 296 nm with 2-nm bandwidth excitation and emission slits and fluorescence was detected in 310–420 nm range at 20 and 6 °C. During acrylamide quenching experiments the time courses of tryptophan fluorescence were detected at 340 nm and the 3 ;m motor domains were titrated with acrylamide in a 0.05–0.4 mm concentration range. Stopped-flow Measurements—The stopped-flow measurements were carried out on a KinTek SF-2004 (KinTec Corporation) or on a BioLogic SFM-300/400 (BioLogic SAS, France) stopped-flow fluorimeter, both equipped with 150-watt Superquiet Hg-Xe lamps (Hamamatsu Photonics, UK). Tryptophan was excited at 297 nm, slits were 4 nm and a 340-nm interference filter (Corion CFS-001999 9L134) was used on the emission side. Pyrene was excited at 365 nm and fluorescence was detected with a WG420 cut-off filter (Comar Instruments, UK). The dead time of the KinTec SF-2004 was determined to be 1 ms at 18 ml/s flow rate, the BioLogic stopped-flow has 0.2- and 2-ms dead time with the ;FC-08 cuvette and FC-15 cuvette, respectively, at the same flow rate. All concentrations noted are post-mix concentrations, and all experiments were carried out at 20 °C, unless otherwise stated. Quench-flow Experiments—The quench-flow experiments were carried out on a RQF-3 quench-flow apparatus (KinTec Corporation) using [;-32P]ATP radioactive nucleotide. Samples were handled as in Ref. 18Toth J. Varga B. Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Vertessy B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33572-33582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and the radioactivity of the ;-32P-hydrolytic product was measured with a Wallac 1409 Liquid Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The indicated concentrations are post-mix concentrations. Actin-activated ATPase—The actin-activated ATPase were determined by the use of a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay as described earlier (19Trentham D.R. Bardsley R.G. Eccleston J.F. Weeds A.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm KCl. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—For the molecular dynamics simulations two Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain crystal structures were prepared. InsightII 2000 software was used for generating the missing parts of 1MMD (pre-recovery (up lever arm) structure). The ADP·BeFx located in the nucleotide binding site was replaced with ATP by changing the BeFx to phosphate group. Then equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation was performed to achieve relaxed conformations and by averaging the coordinates of 125 structures picked up at each 2-ps time point of the equilibrium phase, we visualized a relaxed conformation. For the up lever arm state we used a structure from Jon Kull, 2J. Kull, unpublished data. which has exactly the same conformation as 1VOM, and just contains all of the residues. In this structure the BeFx was also replaced by the phosphate group. Mutations F481A, F482A, or F652A were introduced into these structures and further molecular dynamics simulation were done in the same way. Constant volume periodic boundaries were used with the box dimensions of 134.7 Á. Then the structures were solvated by TIP3P water with a 12-Á cut-off value. Finally, the system was mechanically minimized with parm03 parameters and equilibrated for 2 ns at 300 K by the SHAKE algorithm with 2-fs time steps in the AMBER9 program. Temperature control parameters were set up based on the method of Berendsen (26Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684Crossref Scopus (22550) Google Scholar). We determined the amplitude (;) of the torsional mobility of the :, : angles according to Equation 1, δ=Σ(x−x¯)2n−1 (Eq. 1) where x is the actual torsion angle, [overbar]x is the average of all the : or : angles of the given residue, and n the number of data points. The experiments were repeated three times and averaged, each based on 125 collected structures picked up at each 2-ps time point from 250-ps long equilibrium phases. Steady-state Fluorescence of MF481A, F482A and MF652A—The effects of the mutations on the steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of Trp501 were studied by comparing MF481A, F482A and MF652A to the MW501+ in the presence of different nucleotides at 20 °C (Fig. 2). In the absence of nucleotide the three constructs have similar emission spectra (emission maximum at 342 nm). Also, the fluorescence spectra of the mutants were identical to that of MW501+ in the presence of ADP (15% quenches and 2-nm blue shifts compared with the apo states). On addition of ATP the mutants show decreased fluorescence enhancements compared with the MW501+. Although the fluorescence of MW501+ increases by 100% compared with the ADP-bound fluorescence level (14Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the fluorescence intensity increases of MF481A, F482A and MF652A were only 10 and 5%, respectively. These observations have raised the question, whether the smaller fluorescence enhancements of the mutants are due to the formation of new fluorescent states, or just K3a of the mutants are pulled to the M†ATP states. The comparison of the fluorescence intensities of the ADP·AlF4-bound forms answers this question, because the ADP·AlF4 induces the up lever arm state of myosin, which is the high fluorescence state of MW501+. Fig. 2 shows that, whereas the fluorescence level of the MW501+·ADP·AlF4 state is 110% higher than the MW501+·ADP state, that of the MF481A,F482A·ADP·AlF4 and MF652A·ADP·AlF4 are just 40 and 35% higher, respectively. To demonstrate that the ADP·AlF4-bound mutant constructs are also single fluorescent states just as MW501+·ADP·AlF4 (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and not a mixture of the low and high fluorescent states of MW501+, the temperature dependence of the fluorescence emissions were determined (see supplemental Fig. S1). Because the relative fluorescence intensities of the apo, ADP-, and ADP·AlF4-bound forms were not influenced by temperature and the former states are known to be single fluorescent states, MF481A,F482A·ADP·AlF4 and MF652A·ADP·AlF4 populate predominantly a single fluorescent state, which is structurally different from the wild type up lever arm state (MW501+·ADP·AlF4). Acrylamide Quenching Experiment—To explore the possible structural differences between the ADP·AlF4-bound forms of the mutants and the MW501+ in the Trp501 environment, we performed acrylamide fluorescence quenching experiments. The effect of the acrylamide collisional quenching on the intensity of the fluorescence emission depends on the exposure of the fluorophore to the solvent. We titrated all three constructs with up to 0.4 m acrylamide in the absence and presence of ADP, ATP, and ADP·AlF4 (supplemental Fig. S2). MW501+·ATP and MW501+·ADP·AlF4 show significantly decreased Stern-Volmer constants compared with the apo and ADP-bound forms, indicating the more buried tryptophan fluorophore, which is a characteristic of the up lever arm conformation (14Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MF481A, F482A and MF652A do not show such differences in the Stern-Volmer constants when ATP or ADP·AlF4 is bound compared with the ADP-bound state (Table 1).TABLE 1Stern-Volmer constants of the acrylamide quenching experiments 3 ;m MW501+, MF481A, F482A, and MF652A were titrated with up to 0.4 m acrylamide in the absence and presence of different nucleotides at 20 °C (supplemental Fig. S2). In MW501+ the difference in the Stern-Volmer constants of the “up” (ADP·AlF4) and the “down” (ADP) lever arm states is significantly larger than the mutants'.NucleotideStern-Volmer constant (M–1)MW501+MF481A, F482AMF652ANone4.11 ± 0.094.10 ± 0.083.77 ± 0.08ADP3.73 ± 0.073.70 ± 0.083.34 ± 0.12ATP3.20 ± 0.083.74 ± 0.083.26 ± 0.10ADP·AlF42.98 ± 0.043.58 ± 0.073.15 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab Transient Kinetic Characterization of Trp501 Signal Changes— The fluorescence changes of Trp501 allowed us to characterize the kinetics of the nucleotide binding steps of MF481A, F482A and MF652A in a stopped-flow device and compare them to MW501+. By mixing them with different concentrations of ADP under pseudo-first order conditions, an ∼10–15% fluorescence quench was observable in all three constructs. Single exponentials were fitted to the records and the rate constants were plotted as a function of ADP concentration (supplemental Fig. S3). We found that the quenches of the mutants show two-step binding kinetics of an induced fit mechanism as it was described earlier using MW501+ (steps 6 and 7 in Scheme 1) (14Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16135-16146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The second-order rate constants of ADP binding to the mutants are 5-fold less compared with the wild type (Table 2). Because the ADP off-rates of the mutants also decrease ∼10 times as measured by mant-ADP chasing experiments (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S4), the ADP affinities are only slightly affected by the mutations.TABLE 2Rate constants and equilibrium constants of some reaction steps in Scheme 1 K3a = M*·ATP/M†·ATP and K3b = M*·ADP·Pi/M*·ATP were calculated from the amplitude of the Pi burst (Kapphydrolysis = M*·ADP·Pi/(M†·ATP + M*·ATP)) and the amplitude of the fluorescence enhancement upon ATP binding ( Kapprecovery step = (M*·ATP + M*·ADP·Pi)/M†ATP). and M*·ATP = M*(total) – M*·ADP·Pi).

At 20 °C the subsequent fast recovery step coupled to the fluorescence enhancement does not allow the detection of the transient fluorescence quench. At 6 °C the recovery step slows down compared with the binding event, therefore the fluorescence quench transiently appears in the stopped-flow record (5Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovacs M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the ATP binding stopped-flow records of the mutants and that of the MW501+ at 6 °C. The fluorescence quenches can be seen in all three cases. The observed rate constants of the fitted exponentials plotted against ATP concentration show that the mutants bind ATP 5 times slower than the MW501+ just like in the case of ADP (supplemental Fig. S5A and Table 2). The subsequent recovery step coupled to the fluorescence enhancement is detected only in the case of MW501+. At 20 °C, where the high fluorescent state is more populated (based on the emission spectra), both mutants show a small increase (MF481A, F482A and MF652A, 3 and 2%, respectively) after the quench (Fig. 3B). At higher ATP concentrations, when the accelerating fluorescent quench has already separated from the enhancement phase, the enhancement phase does not show ATP concentration dependence, the rate constants for MF481A, F482A and MF652A are 5 and 2 s-1, respectively. In MW501+ the amplitude of the ATP-induced fluorescent enhancement is larger by almost 2 orders of magnitude compared with the mutants. In contrast to the mutants this enhancement has two phases. The first fast enhancement phase is the recovery step (>150 s-1), whereas the second phase is represented by the hydrolysis step (kobs = (K3a/(1 + K3a)) × k3b + k-3b = 25 s-1), which pulls the previous equilibrium toward the high fluorescent M*ATP state (supplemental Fig. S5B). Characterization of the ATP Hydrolysis Steps—The hydrolytic activities of the mutant motor domains were determined by quenched-flow experiments using 32P-labeled ATP (Fig. 4). The experiments were carried out under multiple turnover conditions. All three constructs show a burst phase of the phosphate (Pi) production followed by a steady-state phase, indicating that the observed rate of the ATP hydrolysis step is faster than the rate-limiting step of the enzyme cycle. The amplitude of the burst is three and six times smaller in the case of MF481A, F482A and MF652A, respectively, than that of the MW501+ (Fig. 4). The steady-state ratio of the pre- and post-hydrolytic states gives the apparent equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step (Kapphydrolysis = M*·ADP·Pi/(M†·ATP + M*·ATP)), which is 4 and 9 times smaller than that of the MW501+ (Table 2). The rate constants of the exponentials fitted to the Pi burst phases of the mutants (kobserved hydrolysis = 5.3 s-1 of MF481A, F482A, kobserved hydrolysis = 2.2 s-1 of MF652A) are identical to the rate constants of the single phase fluorescence enhancements upon adding ATP. In the case of MW501+ the observed rate of the Pi burst phase is identical to that of the second phase of the fluorescence enhancement upon ATP binding (25 s-1). The rate constants of the steady-state phases of the quenched-flow experiments were slightly faster in the case of the mutants than in that of MW501+ (Table 2) and identical to the steady-state turnover rate (k4+ in Scheme 1) measured by pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. Determination of K3a and K3b—The fluorescence experiments prove the existence of the down lever arm state of the mutants and a subsequent conformational change that is analogous with the recovery step in the wild type. Furthermore, the quench-flow experiments indicate that the mutants can hydrolyze ATP in this structurally distorted up lever arm state. These findings indicate that the mutations do not change basically the reaction mechanism represented by Scheme 1. According to this scheme three states (M†·ATP, M*·ATP, and M*·ADP·Pi) are populated in the steady-state before the rate-limiting conformational change (step 4) (20Gyimesi M. Kintses B. Bodor A. Perczel A. Fischer S. Bagshaw C.R. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8153-8163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To calculate the steady-state fraction of the low (M†·ADP) and the high (M*(total) = M*·ATP + M*·ADP·Pi) fluorescent states we used the fluorescence intensities of the spectra at the emission maximum (F): (M† = (FADP·AlF4 - FATP)/(FADP·AlF4 - FADP) and (M* = (FATP - FADP)/(FADP·AlF4 - FADP)). The ratio of the high and low fluorescent states gives the apparent equilibrium constant of the recovery step Kapprecovery step = M*(total)/M†·ADP). In the case of MF481A, F482A and MF652A, Kapprecovery step is 19 and 38 times smaller than that of MW501+ (Table 2). As the steady-state fraction of the M*·ADP·Pi state can be estimated by the relative amplitude of the Pi burst of the quench-flow experiment, the relative population of the three states (M†·ATP, M*·ATP, and M*·ADP·Pi), the equilibrium constants of the recovery step (K3a), and the hydrolysis step (K3b) can be calculated as it shown in Table 2. The greatest perturbation was observed in K3a, which is 20 and 30 times smaller in MF481A, F482A and MF652A, respectively, compared with that of MW501+. Although, the Pi bursts of the mutants are also decreased several times, K3b do not show significant differences. It is the consequence of the changed conformation of the up lever arm state that pulls back K3a and hence decreases the Pi burst. Effects of the Eliminated Pivoting Point in the Presence of Actin—We also investigated the effect of the reduced fulcrum on actin binding. In a stopped-flow device, we determined the observed rate constants of actin binding by mixing pyrene-labeled actin with myosin up to 2 ;m in the absence and presence of ADP. The observed rate constants as a function of the myosin concentration were plotted (supplemental Fig. S6) and the on- and off-rates of actin binding were determined (k+A and k-A, respectively, in Table 3) and compared with MW501+ (17Gyimesi M. Tsaturyan A.K. Kellermayer M.S. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). They show that the actin affinity (Kd,A) of MF481A, F482A and MF652A compared with MW501+ decreased by 10 and 5 times, respectively. As the actin affinity of the mutants weakened similarly in the presence of ADP (Kd,DA), the thermodynamic coupling ratios did not change significantly.TABLE 3Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the actin-myosin interaction and actin activationExperimentParameterMW501+MF481A, F482AMF652AATP induced actin-myosin dissociationK1k+2 (;m–1s–1) of ATP0.181.31.5kmax (s–1)121600700Actin bindingk+A (;m–1s–1)1.60 ± 0.04aPublished in Ref. 170.41 ± 0.050.61 ± 0.04k–A (s–1)0.047 ± 0.002aPublished in Ref. 170.14 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.03Kd,A (;m)0.03aPublished in Ref. 170.340.16k+DA (m–1s–1)0.22 ± 0.02aPublished in Ref. 170.07 ± 0.0020.12 ±k–DA (s–1)0.027 ± 0.002aPublished in Ref. 170.11 ± 0.0030.108 ± 0.008Kd,DA (;m)0.12aPublished in Ref. 171.570.90Actin-activated ATPase activity;max (s–1)3.81.21.2Km (;m)676198a Published in Ref. 17Gyimesi M.

Myosin preincubated with pyrene-labeled actin was mixed with up to 1 mm ATP in the stopped-flow. The observed rate constants were plotted as a function of the ATP concentration (supplemental Fig. S7). We found that the second-order rate constants of ATP binding and the maximum rate constants of the mutants were several times larger than those of the MW501+ (Table 3). We also measured the actin-activated ATPase activities by protein kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (supplemental Fig. S8). We found that the Vmax values of the mutants are one-third of that of the MW501+, whereas half-saturation (Km) does not differ significantly (Table 3).

Amoeboid migration is characterised by membrane blebbing that is dependent on the Rho effectors, ROCK1/2. We identify LIMK2 as the preferred substrate for ROCK1 but find that LIMK2 did not induce membrane blebbing, suggesting that a LIMK2 pathway is not involved in amoeboid-mode migration. In support of this hypothesis, novel FRET data demonstrate a direct interaction between ROCK1 and LIMK2 in polarised but not blebbing cells. Our results point to a specific role for the ROCK1:LIMK2 pathway in mesenchymal-mode migration."

To determine the expression of LAR in ROS-induced apoptosis, we investigated hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and signaling in aortic VSMCs from wild-type and LAR-/- mice. Histone-associated DNA fragmentation and caspase-3/7 activity were significantly enhanced, mitochondrial membrane integrity was compromised, and cell viability was significantly decreased following H2O2 treatment in LAR-/- VSMCs compared with wild-type cells. Stronger and sustained increase in autophosphorylation and activity of Fyn, an Src family tyrosine kinase, was observed in LAR-/- cells compared with wild-type cells following H2O2 treatment. LAR binds to activated Fyn in H2O2-treated VSMCs, and recombinant LAR dephosphorylates phosphorylated-Fyn in vitro. In addition, LAR deficiency enhanced H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). PP2, a Fyn-specific inhibitor, blocked JAK2, STAT3, and p38 MAPK activation and significantly attenuated apoptosis induced by H2O2. AG490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, significantly attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis, and blocked H2O2-induced activation of STAT3, but not p38 MAPK in both wild-type and LAR-/- VSMCs. Attenuation of Fyn expression by short hairpin RNA significantly decreased H2O2-induced downstream signaling and apoptosis in VSMCs. Together, these data indicate that LAR regulates Fyn/JAK2/STAT3 and Fyn/p38 MAPK pathways involved in ROS-induced apoptosis."

Activation of Gq/G11 results in an increase in the enzymatic activity of β-isoforms of phospholipase C, leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. This subsequently results in an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration as well as activation of various protein kinases, including protein kinase C (19Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of G12/G13 leads to stimulation of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway via a subgroup of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (20Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S.

However, studies analyzing the role of G-proteins in the regulation of neurite morphology via G-protein-coupled receptors have been based primarily on the use of constitutively active mutants of G-protein α-subunits. In addition, regulation of neuronal morphology via G-protein-coupled receptors has been studied mainly in neuronal cell lines, whereas the role of these regulatory processes in primary neurons as well as in the developing nervous system is unclear. We therefore analyzed the role of the Gq/G11- and G12/G13-mediated signaling pathways in the regulation of neurite morphology by thrombin and LPA in primary hippocampal neurons derived from mice lacking the α-subunits of Gq/G11 or G12/G13 selectively in neuronal cells. We found that G13 mediates neurite retraction and growth cone collapse induced by LPA, whereas G12 mediates the effects of thrombin on neuronal morphology. Surprisingly, neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11 showed a strongly increased response to LPA and thrombin, indicating that G12/G13- and Gq/G11-mediated signaling have opposing effects on neurite morphology. Mice—Mice with nervous system-specific Gαq/Gα11 and Gα12/Gα13 deficiency have been described (24Moers A. Nürnberg A. Goebbels S. Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2005; 25: 1942-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Primary Cultures from Mouse Hippocampus and Cortex—Cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (24Moers A. Nürnberg A. Goebbels S. Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1480-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hippocampi and cerebral cortices from embryonic day 17.5 mouse embryos were dissected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 30 mm HEPES and 33 mm glucose (pH 7.38), washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 0.05! trypsin (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C, and triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Cells were seeded in minimum essential Eagle's medium supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen), 25 mm glucose (Sigma), and 25 μm glutamic acid (Sigma) on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated plastic dishes (Nunc, Falcon) at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well (∼1 × 104 cells/cm2, for live cell imaging) or 2 × 106 cells/well (2 × 105 cells/cm2, for G-LISA assays), respectively, and maintained at 37 °C in 5! CO2. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement and 0.5 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen), and the cells were cultured for 12–18 h without changing the medium. To inactivate Gi, pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml; Calbiochem) was added to the medium 8–10 h before experiments. Live Cell Imaging—Growth cone collapse and neurite retraction assay was performed on a Leica DM IRE2 microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 37 °C/5! CO2 environmental control chamber. Live cell images were recorded using a Leica DC 350 FX camera and Leica FW4000 software. Images from randomly selected positions were acquired once before and 2, 5, or 20 min after bath application of LPA (BIOMOL), thrombin (Sigma), or ephrin A5/Fc (R&D Systems). Alternatively, image sequences were recorded at a rate of six images/min 1 min before and 5–6 min after addition of agonists. Before use, ephrin A5/Fc was preclustered with anti-human immunoglobulin G/Fc (Sigma) as described previously (26Knöll B. Kretz O. Fiedler C. Alberti S. Schutz G. Frotscher M. Nordheim A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Acquired images were analyzed using the NIH ImageJ program (available at rsb.info.nih.gov.ij) (27Rasband W.S. ImageJ. 2nd Ed. Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1997–2007Google Scholar), and the percentage of growth cones and average length of neurites before and after stimulation were calculated for 15–20 cells/experiment. Retraction was defined as neurite shortening expressed as percent of the initial length. Results are presented as the means ± S.E. of 3–11 independent experiments. Dose response to LPA was approximated with the following equations: y =–1.35 + 22.19/(1 + 10–6.55–x) and R2 = 0.97 for wild-type neurons and y =–1.35 + 60.54/(1 + 10–7.107–x) and R2 = 0.98 for Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons. Statistical significance was determined by the two-tailed t test; analysis of variance and Bonferroni's correction were used for multiple comparisons. Reverse Transcription-PCR—mRNA was prepared from hippocampal neurons using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), and reverse transcription was performed according to standard procedures. LPA receptor expression was detected by the TaqMan assay using a TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix kit. The following gene expression assays (all from Applied Biosystems) were employed: LPA-1, Assay ID Mm00439145_m1; LPA-2, Assay ID Mm00469562_m1; LPA-3, Assay ID Mm01312593_m1; LPA-4, Assay ID Mm01228533_m1; and LPA-5, Assay ID Mm01190818_m1. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Assay ID 4352932E) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Assay ID Rn01527838_g1) were used as reference genes. Reactions were performed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems) and detected using an ABI PRISM™ 7700 sequence detection system equipped with 7500 Fast System software (Applied Biosystems). Gα12 (Gna12), Gα13 (Gna13), RhoA, and β-actin were amplified using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad) and the following primers: Gna12, 5′-TGCTTCGACGGCATCACA-3′ and 5′-GAAGTGCTTCTTAATGCTCACA-3′; Gna13, 5′-TGCTGGTAGATGCCCGAGA-3′ and GATCGTAGGCATTCTGTATACCA-3′; RhoA, 5′-CCATCAGGAAGAAACTGGTGA-3′ and 5′-CACCTCGATATCCGCCACA-3′; and β-actin, 5′-TGACGTTGACATCCGTAAAGAC-3′ and 5′-TGCTAGGAGCCAGAGCAGTAA-3′. Reactions were detected on a Chromo4 reverse transcription-PCR detector equipped with Opticon Monitor 3.1 software (Bio-Rad). Relative expression ratios normalized by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (LPA receptors) or β-actin (Gna12, Gna13, and RhoA) and statistical significance were calculated using the relative expression software tool REST© (28Pfaffl M.W. Horgan G.W. Dempfle L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data from three to four samples are presented as log2 of the ratio of gene expression ± S.E. in Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons compared with wild-type neurons. Determination of RhoA and Rac Activity—RhoA and Rac1 activation assays were performed using G-LISA RhoA and Rac1 activation assay kits (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated for the indicated time periods with vehicle alone (phosphate-buffered saline) or 10 μm LPA, immediately washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated in microplate wells coated with a RhoA- or Rac1-GTP-binding protein, and bound active RhoA/Rac1 was detected using a RhoA/Rac1-specific antibody and chemiluminescence. The data represent -fold stimulation ± S.E. from three to four independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by the Mann-Whitney U test. To analyze the role of particular signaling pathways that mediate the regulation of neurite morphology via G-protein-coupled receptors, we prepared hippocampal neurons at embryonic day 17.5 from mice with nervous system-specific Gαq/Gα11 or Gα12/Gα13 deficiency (Nes-Cre;Gnaqflox/flox; Gna11–/– or Nes-Cre;Gna12–/–Gna13flox/flox, respectively) (24Moers A. Nürnberg A. Goebbels S. Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1480-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Wettschureck N. Moers A. Wallenwein B. Parlow A.F. Maser-Gluth C. Offermanns S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1942-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Embryonic hippocampal neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11 or Gα12/Gα13 were basically indistinguishable from wild-type neurons. Wild-type and mutant neurons had the same number and average length of neurites at stage 2/3 (Fig. 1, A and B), and there was no difference in the differentiation of neurons in vitro (Fig. 1C). However, neurons lacking Gαq and Gα11 showed a slightly reduced number of growth cone-positive neurites compared with wild-type or Gα12/Gα13-deficient neurons (Fig. 1D). Murine wild-type hippocampal neurons at stage 2/3 rapidly respond to LPA and thrombin with growth cone collapse and retraction of their neurites (Figs. 2 (A and B) and 3 (A, B, D, and E) and supplemental Movie 1). In contrast, neurons lacking Gα12/Gα13 were completely unresponsive, showing no neurite retraction and growth cone collapse when exposed to 10 μm LPA (Figs. 2A and 3 (A and D) and supplemental Movie 2) or 1 unit/ml thrombin (Figs. 2B and 3 (B and E)). Gα12/Gα13-deficient neurons were not generally unresponsive as indicated by the effect of ephrin A5, which acts independently of G-protein-mediated signaling pathways and induced growth cone collapse as well as neurite retraction in both wild-type and Gα12/Gα13-deficient neurons (Figs. 2C and 3 (C and F)).FIGURE 3Role of different G-protein-mediated signaling pathways in the regulation of neurite and growth cone morphology by LPA and thrombin. Wild-type (WT), Gα12/Gα13-deficient (12/13 KO), Gαq/Gα11-deficient (q/11 KO), and pertussis toxin-pretreated (WT+PTX, q/11 KO+PTX) hippocampal neurons were analyzed before and after addition of LPA (A and D), thrombin (B and E), and ephrin A5 (C and F). A and B, number of growth cone-positive neurites before (0 min) and 2 and 5 min after addition of 10 μm LPA (A) or 1 unit/ml thrombin (B).

Whereas both stimuli reduced the percentage of growth cone-positive neurites in wild-type neurons to 10–30!, no growth cones were detectable after exposure of Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells to LPA and thrombin (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, the effect of LPA and thrombin on neurite retraction was largely increased in the absence of Gαq/Gα11. Whereas LPA and thrombin reduced wild-type neurite length by ∼20 and 10!, respectively, the extent of neurite retraction was increased by 2–3-fold in the absence of Gαq/Gα11 (Fig. 3, D and E). The overshooting response of neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11 was not due to a general overresponsiveness of these cells as demonstrated by the normal effect of ephrin A5 on growth cone and neurite morphology (Figs. 2C and 3 (C and F)). Uncoupling of receptors from Gi-type G-proteins by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin had no significant effect on LPA-induced neurite retraction or growth cone collapse in wild-type neurons or Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons (Fig. 3, A and D). Thus, G12/G13- and Gq/G11-mediated signaling pathways obviously play opposing roles in the regulation of neurite morphology via G-protein-coupled receptors. Whereas G12 and G13 are critically involved in the induction of growth cone collapse and neurite retraction, Gq and G11 appear to counteract the activity of G12/G13-mediated signaling. To test whether individual G-proteins are responsible for the observed effects of Gα12/Gα13 and Gαq/Gα11 deficiency on the regulation of growth cone and neurite morphology, we analyzed the effect of LPA and thrombin in neurons lacking only Gα12 or Gα13.Gα13-deficient neurons behaved similarly to Gα12/Gα13-deficient cells and showed almost no response to LPA, whereas neurons lacking Gα12 behaved like wild-type cells (Fig. 4, A and C). Interestingly, thrombin effects were strongly reduced in the absence of Gα12 but not in the absence of Gα13 (Fig. 4, B and D). This indicates that LPA-induced regulation of neurite morphology involves primarily G13, whereas thrombin effects are mediated preferentially by G12. Neurons lacking only Gα11 showed slightly overshooting responses to both LPA and thrombin (Fig. 4). However, the phenotype was not as excessive as that of neurons lacking both Gαq and Gα11, indicating that both G-protein α-subunits are involved in the effects of LPA and thrombin. To further analyze the overshooting response of Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons to agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors, we determined the dose-response relationship of LPA-induced neurite retraction in wild-type and Gαq/Gα11-deficient cells (Fig. 5A). In both cell types, LPA induced maximal neurite retraction at concentrations of 3–10 μm while being about three times more efficacious in neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11. However, also the potency of LPA to induce neurite retraction appeared to be slightly increased in the absence of Gαq/Gα11. Whereas LPA induced neurite retraction in wild-type cells with an EC50 of 280 nm, the EC50 of LPA effects in Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons was ∼80 nm. The massively enhanced effect of LPA in the absence of Gαq/Gα11 could be due to the fact that activation of the Gq/G11-mediated signaling pathway exerted a stimulatory effect on neurite and growth cone extension, which under wild-type conditions counteracts the effect of G12/G13 activation on neurite retraction and growth cone collapse. Alternatively, excessive neurite retraction and growth cone collapse in the absence of Gαq/Gα11 could result simply from an overactivation of the G12/G13-mediated signaling pathway due to altered expression levels of the receptors or an increased coupling efficiency of receptors to G12/G13 in the absence of Gαq/Gα11. Quantitative PCR showed that the expression levels of LPA1, LPA2, and LPA4 receptors as well as of Gα12, Gα13, and RhoA were unchanged in Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons (Fig. 5B). For LPA3 and LPA5 receptors, no corresponding mRNA was detected. To test whether coupling efficiency of receptors to G12/G13 was increased in the absence of Gq/G11, we determined the activity of RhoA, the main effector of G12/G13, in untreated and LPA-treated wild-type, Gα12/Gα13-deficient, and Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons. The increase in RhoA activity was comparable in wild-type cells and cells lacking Gαq/Gα11, whereas no RhoA activation could be observed in Gα12/Gα13-deficient neurons (Fig. 5C). This indicates that Gαq/Gα11 deficiency does not result in overactivation of G12/G13-mediated signaling in response to LPA. Because LPA and thrombin can activate Rac in parallel with RhoA (29Moolenaar W.H. van Meeteren L.A. Giepmans B.N. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 30Yang S.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we determined LPA effects on Rac activity in wild-type and Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons. Interestingly, the LPA-induced activation of the small GTPase Rac, which could be seen in wild-type neurons, was absent in neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11 (Fig. 5D). This indicates that in wild-type neurons both RhoA and Rac are activated and that the Gq/G11-mediated Rac activation that promotes neurite and growth cone extension may counteract the effect of G12/G13-mediated RhoA activation on neurite retraction and growth cone collapse under wild-type conditions. A variety of G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be able to mediate the induction of neurite retraction and growth cone collapse (9Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N.

Receptors that are able to stimulate neurite retraction and growth cone collapse couple to G12/G13, Gq/G11, and Gi-type G-proteins. The fact that pretreatment of neurons with pertussis toxin did not affect the ability of LPA or thrombin to reduce neurite retraction and growth cone collapse (see Fig. 3) (11Tigyi G. Fischer D.J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) strongly indicates that Gi-type G-proteins are not involved in these effects. It has been difficult to evaluate the relative roles of G12/G13 and Gq/G11 in the regulation of neurite morphology because there are no appropriate inhibitors available that specifically block either of the G-protein families. Based on the expression of constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 in various cell culture lines, there is good evidence that these G-protein α-subunits can mediate growth cone collapse and neurite retraction (21Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, the role Gq/G11 plays in these processes has been controversial. Data involving Gq/G11 in mediating neurite retraction and growth cone collapse in response to LPA and thrombin are based on the use of constitutively active mutants of Gαq that, after expression in various cell lines, have been shown to cause neurite retraction similarly to Gα12/Gα13 (21Katoh H.

Signal. 2006; 18: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, other groups have reported that expression of constitutively active Gαq causes massive cell death in neurons and other cells (22Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 38Xu N. Bradley L. Ambdukar I. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6741-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be difficult to differentiate the toxic effects of activated mutants of Gαq from cellular responses specifically induced via physiological Gq activation. In addition, blockade of Gq/G11-mediated signaling in a neuronal cell line has been shown to be without any effect on LPA-induced neurite retraction (39Lee C.W. Rivera R. Dubin A.E. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4310-4317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Yanagida K. Ishii S. Hamano F. Noguchi K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5814-5824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of different G-protein-mediated signaling pathways in the regulation of neurite morphology, we took a genetic approach to study the regulation of neurite and growth cone morphology via endogenous receptors in primary neurons lacking either Gαq/Gα11 or Gα12/Gα13. Our data clearly show that G12 and G13 are required for LPA- and thrombin-induced neurite retraction and growth cone collapse. Surprisingly, we observed overshooting responses in neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11, which strongly indicates that these G-proteins do not promote neurite retraction and growth cone collapse but are rather involved in a pathway that counterregulates the stimulation of neurite retraction and growth cone collapse via G12/G13. Interestingly, it has been shown in Drosophila that expression of an activated version of Drosophila Gαq results in the ectopic midline crossing of neurons (41Ratnaparkhi A. Banerjee S. Hasan G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Gq/G11-mediated signaling may regulate axonal pathfinding by inhibiting repulsive effects and by promoting neurite and growth cone extension. The excessive response of Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons to LPA and thrombin was obviously not due to an enhanced activation of the G12/G13-mediated pathway as indicated by the unaltered RhoA activation in neurons lacking Gαq/Gα11. Because the effects of a G-protein-independent activator of neurite retraction and growth cone collapse like ephrin A5 were not affected by Gαq/Gα11 deficiency, unspecific effects can be ruled out. Thus, Gq/G11-mediated signaling per se has an unexpected inhibitory effect on Rho/Rho kinase-mediated neurite retraction and growth cone collapse. Given the fact that Gq and G11 couple receptors to β-isoforms of phospholipase C, resulting in transient increases in [Ca2+]i, the promotion of neurite extension via Gq/G11-mediated signaling is likely to be mediated by Ca2+. Recent evidence indicates that the spatiotemporal pattern of intracellular Ca2+ signals can have profound effects on axonal growth cones. Whereas small and large elevations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration result in repulsion, moderate elevation promotes growth cone extension (42Gomez T.M. Zheng J.Q. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 43Zheng J.Q. Poo M.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 375-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Increases in [Ca2+]i have been shown to induce activation of Rac in nonneuronal and neuronal cells (44Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 45Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Nieswandt B. Offermanns S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39413-39421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that the LPA-induced Rac activation that was seen in wild-type neurons was absent in Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons. Rac activation is well known to counteract RhoA activation, to inhibit neurite retraction, and to promote growth cone extension. It is therefore most likely that the Gq/G11-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i via activation of the small GTPase Rac inhibits neurite retraction and growth cone collapse. When we tested the effect of LPA and thrombin on neurite and growth cone morphology in cells lacking only Gα12 or Gα13, we observed that Gα12 deficiency blocked thrombin-induced effects, whereas lack of Gα13 resulted in a loss of LPA-induced effects. This is consistent with observations made in fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney cells, in which LPA effects appear to be mediated by G13, whereas thrombin effects involve G12 (48Gohla A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14936-14939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Evidence has been provided that this is due to the preferential coupling of LPA receptors to G13 and of thrombin-activated receptors to G12 in intact cells (49Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14936-14939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 50Riobo N.A. Manning D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 146-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that G12 and G13 are absolutely required for neurite retraction and growth cone collapse induced by the blood-borne factors thrombin and LPA. Interestingly, analysis of single Gα12- and Gα13-deficient neurons showed that the effects of thrombin were primarily mediated by G12, whereas the LPA effects depended on G13. Surprisingly, the overshooting response of Gαq/Gα11-deficient neurons revealed a so far unknown role of the neuronal Gq/G11-mediated signaling pathway in antagonizing the effects of G12/G13-mediated signaling. Inhibition of G12/G13-mediated activation of Rho/Rho kinase signaling has been suggested as a strategy to improve neurite growth and sprouting after neural injury (3Mueller B.K. Mack H. Teusch N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).

We hypothesized that cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) contributes to this protection. Prolonged contracture (10 min) of demembranated human cardiomyocytes at half-maximal Ca2+ resulted in a 37 ± 5% reduction of active force (p < 0.01), whereas no decrease (2 ± 3% increase) was observed in the presence of the cytosol (reconstituted myocytes). The PKC inhibitors GF 109203X and Gö 6976 (10μmol/liter) partially antagonized the cytosol-mediated protection (15 ± 5 and 9 ± 2% decrease in active force, p < 0.05). Quantitation of PKC isoform expression revealed the dominance of the Ca2+-dependent PKCα over PKCδ and PKC∊ (189 ± 31, 7 ± 3, and 7 ± 2 ng/mg protein, respectively). Ca2+ stimulations of reconstituted human cardiomyocytes resulted in the translocation of endogenous PKCα, but not PKCβ1, δ, and ∊ from the cytosol to the contractile system (PKCα association: control, 5 ± 3 arbitrary units; +Ca2+, 39 ± 8 arbitrary units; p < 0.01, EC50,Ca = 645 nmol/liter). One of the PKCα-binding proteins were identified as the thin filament regulatory protein cardiac troponin I (TnI). Finally, the Ca2+-dependent interaction between PKCα and TnI was confirmed using purified recombinant proteins (binding without Ca2+ was only 28 ± 18% of that with Ca2+). Our data suggest that PKCα translocates to the contractile system and anchors to TnI in a Ca2+-dependent manner in the human heart, contributing to the maintenance of contractile force.

Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). Multiple PKC isozymes are often expressed in the same cell, mediating specific functions. Conventional and novel PKCs can be activated by lipids, like the endogenous diacylglycerol (DAG) or the exogenous phorbol ester PMA. It was reported decades ago that PMA activation of PKC leads to the translocation of PKC from the soluble to the particulate fraction (2Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Cooper H.L. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3193-3196Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This observation has been confirmed by later works, and some of the binding proteins for activated PKC isozymes were identified (receptors for activated C kinases) (3Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 4Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Binding to its respective receptors for activated C kinase localizes each PKC isozyme in the vicinity of a subset of substrates and away from others, and hence this spatial organization may well explain the specificity of PKC isozymes in their intracellular signaling. It is of interest that from the many PKC isozymes expressed in the heart (5Shin H.G. Barnett J.V. Chang P. Reddy S. Drinkwater D.C. Pierson R.N. Wiley R.C. Murray M.T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), PKCα is the single isozyme that translocates to the contractile system upon Ca2+ stimulation in the rat heart (6Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), suggesting a unique physiological role for PKCα in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of myofibrillar contractility. As a matter of fact, PKCα has been implicated in models of ischemic heart failure, myocardial hypertrophy, hypertension, and atherosclerosis (7Murphy S. Frishman W.H. Cardiol. Rev. 2005; 13: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins such as desmin (8Huang X.P. Li J. Foster D. Lemanski S.L. Dube D.K. Zhang C. Lemanski L.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), myosin light chain (9Venema R.C. Raynor R.L. Noland T.A. Kuo J.F. Biochem.

In contrast, limited information is available on the possible role of PKC under physiological conditions in human heart and the possible PKC-binding proteins responsible for myofibrillar targeting of PKC. Here we show that endogenous PKCα participates in the maintenance of contractile force upon long term Ca2+ stimulations (a condition associated with ischemia-reperfusion) and identify the sarcomeric regulatory protein TnI as a PKCα targeting protein. Our data suggest a new physiological role for PKCα and pinpoints its intermolecular interaction with TnI as a possible pharmacological target to regulate in vivo PKCα activity in a sarcomer-specific manner. Tissue Source—Healthy human hearts were obtained from five general organ donor patients (two men and three women with a mean age of 39.2 years) whose hearts were explanted to obtain pulmonary and aortic valves for valve replacement surgery (donor hearts). The donors did not show any sign of cardiac abnormalities and did not receive any medication except plasma volume expanders, dobutamine, and furosemide. The causes of death included cerebral contusion caused by accidents and cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoidal hemorrhage caused by stroke. These experiments complied with the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association and were approved by the Hungarian Ministry of Health (number 323-8/2005-1018EKU). Left ventricular wall samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Myocyte Preparation and Measurement of the Mechanical Properties—Left ventricular tissue samples (about 0.2 g of wet weight) were treated and isolated as described earlier (26Borbely A. Toth A. Edes I. Virag L. Papp J.G. Varro A. Paulus W.J. van d.V. Stienen G.J. Papp Z. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In short, the tissue was mechanically disrupted in isolating solution (containing 4 mmol/liter Na2ATP, 1 mmol/liter Mg2+, 145 mmol/liter KCl, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter imidazole, pH 7.0), and the particulate fraction was separated from the cytosol by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 5 min; supernatant is referred as cytosol). The mechanically isolated cardiac myocytes in the particulate fraction were demembranated by Triton X-100 (0.3%, stirring on ice for 5 min) containing isolation solution. Then the demembranated myocytes were separated by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 5 min; pellet: demembranated cardiomyocytes). The cytosol fraction was kept on ice until further experiments, and the myocytes were washed three times in cell isolation solution without Triton X-100 before measurements. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Sigma-Aldrich) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of Physiological Properties—Demembranated single cardiomyocytes were mounted between two thin needles with silicone adhesive (Dow Corning, Midland) while being viewed under an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135, Zeiss, Germany). One needle was attached to a force transducer element (SensoNor, Horten, Norway), and the other was attached to an electromagnetic motor (Aurora Scientific Inc., Aurora, Canada). The measurements were performed at 15 °C, and the average sarcomere length was adjusted to 2.2 μm as described previously (26Borbely A. Toth A. Edes I. Virag L. Papp J.G. Varro A. Paulus W.J. van d.V. Stienen G.J. Papp Z. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A mounted cardiomyocyte is shown on Fig. 1A from both vertical and horizontal directions. The pCa (-log[Ca2+]) values of the relaxing and activating solutions (pH 7.2) were 9 and 4.75, respectively. Solutions with intermediate free Ca2+ levels were obtained by mixing activating and relaxing solutions. All of the solutions for force measurements contained 1 mmol/liter Mg2+, 5 mmol/liter MgATP, 15 mmol/liter phosphocreatine, and 100 mmol/liter BES. The ionic equivalent was adjusted to 150 mmol/liter with KCl. Isometric force was measured after the preparation had been transferred from the relaxing solution to a Ca2+-containing solution. When a steady force level was reached, the length of the myocyte was reduced by 20% within 2 ms and then quickly restretched (release-restretch maneuver). As a result, the force first dropped from the peak isometric level to zero (difference = total peak isometric force) and then started to redevelop. The passive force component was determined in relaxing solution following the Ca2+ contractures. The Ca2+-activated isometric force was calculated as the difference of the passive and maximal active isometric force. Representative recordings are shown on Fig. 1 (B and C). After the first maximal activation at pCa 4.75, resting sarcomere length was readjusted to 2.2 μm, if necessary. Then cells were subsequently exposed to a series of solutions with intermediate pCa to construct a force-pCa relationship. After obtaining the first (control) force-pCa, the myocytes were incubated in the presence of a Ca2+ concentration, which evoked ∼50% of maximal force for 10 min and then the functional parameters (force-pCa relationship and passive tension) were measured again to reveal the effects of the Ca2+ stimulation (representative experiments are shown on Fig. 1). Ca2+-force relations were fitted to a modified Hill equation as described earlier (26Borbely A. Toth A. Edes I. Virag L. Papp J.G. Varro A. Paulus W.J. van d.V. Stienen G.J. Papp Z. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 67: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), F=F0[Ca2+]nHill/(pCa50nHill+[Ca2+]nHill)(Eq. 1) where F is the steady-state force, F0 is the steady isometric force at saturating Ca2+ concentration, the Hill coefficient nHill is a measure of the steepness of the relationship, and pCa50 is the mid-point of the relation. The values are given as the means ± S.E. for n myocytes. The differences were tested by means of Student's paired t test comparing the values before and after treatments. The level of significance was p < 0.05. Reconstitution of Human Cardiomyocytes—Human cardiomyocytes were reconstituted by adding the cytosol to the demembranated myocytes at a dilution of ∼1 mg of myocyte protein/ml. In case of stimulation, reconstituted cardiomyocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of PMA (10 μmol/liter), Ca2+ and PKC inhibitors GF 109207X and Gö 6976 (10 μmol/liter) for 10 or 30 min (physiological and biochemical assays, respectively). For the biochemical assays, the myocytes were pelleted and subsequently washed three times (centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 2 min) in 450 μl of cell isolation solution, containing the same concentration of Ca2+ and PMA as during the incubations mentioned above. The pellets were then resuspended in 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), and 30 μl was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis. In Vitro Phosphorylation—Human ventricular heart muscle homogenates were incubated with PKCs α, γ, δ, ∊, and η (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 60 min at 37 °C in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing: for PKCα and PKCγ:20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 200 μg/ml l-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 20 μg/ml 1.2 DAG, 100 μmol/liter [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μmol/liter CaCl2; for PKCδ, PKC∊, and PKCη:20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 200 μg/ml l-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 20 μg/ml DAG, 100 μmol/liter [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μmol/liter EGTA (chemicals were from Sigma, except [γ-32P]ATP, which was from ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). In parallel to the phosphorylation of myocardial proteins, kinase activities were measured using 1 mg/ml histone IIIS (Sigma) substrate. The kinase activities on this control substrate were 14 ± 5, 24 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 23 ± 9, and 23 ± 4 pmol phosphate incorporation/min for PKCs α, γ, δ, ∊, and η, respectively. The reactions were initiated by adding the radioactive ATP. After the phosphorylation, the reaction mixtures were boiled with 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (Sigma) for 5 min. The proteins were then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie and dried. The stained, dried gels were then subjected to autoradiography. In parallel, 5 μl of reaction mixture was dropped onto P81 phosphocellulose papers (Whatmann, Fairfield, NJ). After drying, the papers were washed with 0.5% phosphoric acid three times each for 5 min and with acetone. After drying the radioactivity bound to the papers was measured by a TriCarb scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western Immunoblot—Human left ventricular tissue samples were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as standard, and the concentration of the homogenates were adjusted to 4 mg/ml. Then the homogenates were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (Sigma) and were boiled for 10 min before electrophoresis. 50 μg of proteins was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and after separation transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies against PKCα (Sigma-Aldrich; dilution, 1:5 000) PKCδ and PKC∊ (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; dilution, 1:1 000), and the signal was detected by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG-specific antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; dilution, 1:50 000). For the assessment of PKC isozyme expression in the human heart, recombinant human PKC isozymes were loaded on the same gels/membranes as control proteins (Sigma-Aldrich). Then the bands were visualized by ECL and evaluated by Image J software. Only bands on the same membrane were used to avoid alterations because of different transfer efficiency or other technical reasons. Investigation of the Translocation of PKC Isozymes—Demembranated myocytes were incubated with cytosol (1 mg/ml concentration, 450 μl/tube) in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (5 mmol/liter) and PMA (10 μmol/liter) for 30 min. Then the myocytes were washed three times with isolation solution (centrifugation by 1,000 × g, 2 min; supernatants were discarded) containing the same concentration of Ca2+ and PMA, as it was used during the incubations to avoid dissociation of the translocated proteins. After the last washing, the supernatants were carefully removed, and the myocytes (pellet) were boiled with 60 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (Sigma) for 5 min. 30 μl of this solution was subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against PKCα, β1, δ, and ∊. The bands were visualized by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reaction. The intensities of the bands were quantitated by ImageJ, and the results are expressed as optical densities (arbitrary units). Determination of Free Ca2+ Concentrations in the Presence of Cytosol Fraction—In the case of measurement of Ca2+ dependence of PKCα association (Fig. 4B), demembranated cardiomyocytes were incubated with the cytosol, and 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mmol/liter Ca2+ was added to the supernatant. The free Ca2+ concentrations were determined using a Fluo-3 (Sigma-Aldrich) calibration curve, measured by a BMG NOVOstar fluorescent plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The calculated values are shown on Fig. 6B.FIGURE 6Ca2+ dependent translocation of PKC isozymes in human cardiomyocytes. Demembranated human left ventricular cardiomyocytes were incubated with the cytosol alone (control), cytosol + 1 mmol/liter Ca2+, cytosol + 10 μm PMA, and with the cytosol + 1 mmol/liter Ca2+ + 10 μm PMA for 30 min. Then association of PKCα, β1, δ, and ∊ to the contractile protein machinery was tested by Western blot (A). Representative blots are shown on the top. The relative band intensities were measured by densitometry. The bar graph represents the means and S.E. of the three or more independent experiments. Significant differences (p < 0.05) from the control are shown by asterisks. The Ca2+ dependence of PKCα translocation was also tested by the addition of 0–10 mmol/liter Ca2+ to the cytosol fraction containing 2 mmol/liter EGTA (B). The free Ca2+ concentrations were determined by a fluo-3 calibration curve (for concentrations below 5 μm) or by calculation (for concentrations above 5 μm). A representative experiment is shown on the top. The blots were evaluated as mentioned for A. The graph represents the means and S.E. of three independent determinations (significant differences (p < 0.05) are shown by asterisks).

After blocking, the membranes were incubated with 2 μg/ml purified, recombinant PKCα (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 10 μmol/liter PMA and 5 mmol/liter Ca2+ in 1% milk powder containing TBS for 2 h, followed by three rinses with TBS, supplemented with 5 mmol/liter Ca2+. The membranes were then processed for Western blotting with an anti-PKCα antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:20,000) as described above, except that all of the solutions were supplemented with 5 mmol/liter Ca2+. The controls were incubated with 1% milk powder containing TBS and 5 mmol/liter Ca2+ without the recombinant PKCα. In Vitro Binding of Recombinant Human PKCα to Recombinant Cardiac TnI or Troponin Complex—Recombinant, purified PKCα (0.1 μg; Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with recombinant, purified TnI (0.1 μg/ml TnI) or reconstituted troponin complex (0.3 μg/ml; 1:1:1 stoichiometry of TnI, TnC, and TnT) in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (5 mmol/liter) for 2 h at room temperature. TnI was precipitated with an anti-TnI antibody (clone 16A11; Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) or with mouse IgG (control, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and then pulled down with a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were washed five times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and the respective concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. 7B). The precipitates were analyzed by Western immunoblot for PKCα as detailed above. Immunohistochemistry—Human heart samples were sectioned in a cryostate at -20 °C to obtain 10-μm-thick slices. The slides were fixed with ice-cold acetone for 5 min. All of the subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Fixed slides were then rinsed in PBS (containing 150.7 mmol/liter NaCl, 3.22 mmol/liter KCl, 0.735 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 8.6 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and blocked for 1 h in normal goat serum. Rabbit anti-PKCα (1:100 dilution in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and mouse anti-TnI (clone 22B11, 1:100 dilution; Research Diagnostics Inc.) were used as primary antibodies and incubated for 60 min followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution in PBS; Vector Laboratories Inc.) to visualize PKCα or with biotin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:200 dilution in PBS; Vector Laboratories Inc.), followed by Cy2-conjugated streptavidin (1:100 dilution; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) to visualize TnI. Effects of Endogenous Protein Kinase C on the Ca2+-activated Contractile Force of Human Ventricular Cardiomyocytes—Incubation of demembranated human cardiac myocytes with a Ca2+ concentration evoking about half-maximal force production (pCa 5.8, active force during the incubation: 62 ± 1% of the maximum) for 10 min resulted in a 37 ± 5% reduction in the maximal Ca2+-activated (active) force determined at pCa 4.75 (n = 6, p < 0.05, representative experiment; Figs. 1B and 2). In contrast, demembranated cardiac myocytes stimulated with Ca2+ (active force during the incubations: 56 ± 8% of the maximum) in the presence of the cytosol were completely protected from the decrease in the contractile force (2 ± 3% increase in the maximal active force, n = 5, representative experiment; Figs. 1C and 2). In parallel, the structural effects of the maintained contractions were also recorded as a means of light microscopy. Apparently, the maintained contractions evoked some deterioration of the cross-striation pattern of the myocytes, both in the presence and in the absence of cytosol (Fig. 1, B and C). Next, the possible contribution of cytosolic proteins (probably with Ca2+-regulated activity) was investigated. From the many candidates, our attention has been attracted to PKC because of its ability (i) to regulate contractility, (ii) to translocate from the soluble fractions to the particulate fractions, and (iii) to be activated by Ca2+ (classical PKC isoforms). The administration of the general PKC activator PMA (10-min application) apparently affected neither the contractility (maximal active force: 96 ± 1% of the maximal active force obtained before the treatment; Fig. 3, n = 5), nor the cytosol-mediated protection upon prolonged Ca2+ contractions (maximal active force: 98 ± 1% of the maximal active force obtained before the treatment; Fig. 3, n = 10). In contrast, inhibition of PKC by GF 109203X and by Gö 6976 (10 μmol/liter) partially antagonized the cytosol mediated protection (a decrease of active force by 15 ± 5%, p < 0.05, n = 6 and by 9 ± 2%, p < 0.05, n = 8, respectively, as shown on Fig. 4). In addition, control experiments with GF 109203X showed no effects on the active force in the absence of Ca2+ incubations (2 ± 3% increase in the maximal active force, n = 5; Table 1).TABLE 1Catalogue of values determined in the mechanical measurements There are four parameters determined in the mechanical measurements: active force (force evoked by increased Ca2+ concentrations), passive force (passive tension of the cardiomyocytes at 2.2-μm sarcomere length), pCa50 value (Ca2+ sensitivity of the contraction), and Hill value (representing the cooperativity in the development of force upon Ca2+ stimuli). These values are shown in respect to the applied treatments. The number of individual experiments are also shown. Absolute force values stand for the measured contractile force (in millinewtons) divided by the cross-sectional area (in mm2) of the cardiomyocytes, whereas relative force values are the percentage of the response after treatments compared with the measured values before treatments.TreatmentnActive force beforeActive force (relative) afterPassive force beforePassive force (relative) afterpCa50HillBeforeAfterBeforeAftermillinewtons/mm2millinewtons/mm2+Ca2+624.17 ± 3.7963 ± 5aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments1.89 ± 0.20302 ± 46aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments5.92 ± 0.045.97 ± 0.032.06 ± 0.121.94 ± 0.34Cytosol + Ca2+519.80 ± 2.84102 ± 31.61 ± 0.24146 ± 9aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments5.89 ± 0.025.97 ± 0.02aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments2.03 ± 0.212.10 ± 0.10Cytosol + PMA521.02 ± 4.2096 ± 12.05 ± 0.51115 ± 116.00 ± 0.036.05 ± 0.012.06 ± 0.162.58 ± 0.20Cytosol + GF525.96 ± 4.72102 ± 31.56 ± 0.4192 ± 65.96 ± 0.066.03 ± 0.04aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments1.65 ± 0.162.14 ± 0.16aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatmentsCytosol + PMA + Ca2+1021.67 ± 3.0498 ± 12.07 ± 0.24176 ± 20aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments5.90 ± 0.046.04 ± 0.05aSignificant differences were found (p < 0.05, paired t test) between the values obtained before and after treatments2.10 ± 0.282.09 ± 0.19Cytosol + Ca2+ + Gö828.87 ± 2.9091 ± 2aSignificant di"

Crystallographic studies reveal that the active tetramer is a flat ring structure composed of four monomers, with their active sites arranged around a narrow central pore. This model explains why many of the preferred substrates of tryptase are short peptides; however, it does not explain how tryptase cleaves large protein substrates such as fibronectin, although a number of studies have reported in vitro mechanisms for generating active monomers that could digest larger substrates. Here we suggest that alternate mRNA splicing of human tryptase genes generates active tryptase monomers (or dimers). We have identified a conserved pattern of alternate splicing in four tryptase alleles (;II, ;I, ;III, and ;I), representing three distinct tryptase gene loci. When compared with their full-length counterparts, the splice variants use an alternate acceptor site within exon 4. This results in the deletion of 27 nucleotides within the central coding sequence and 9 amino acids from the translated protein product. Although modeling suggests that the deletion can be easily accommodated by the enzymes structurally, it is predicted to alter the specificity by enlarging the S1′ or S2′ binding pocket and results in the complete loss of the “47 loop,” reported to be critical for the formation of tetramers. Although active monomers can be generated in vitro using a range of artificial conditions, we suggest that alternate splicing is the in vivo mechanism used to generate active tryptase that can cleave large protein substrates.

Tryptases belong to a family of serine proteases and are named based on their similarity to the pancreatic enzyme trypsin. The most intensively studied tryptases are the ;/; tryptases (now known to be the products of two separate gene loci); they are reported to be selectively expressed in mast cells, where they are stored in granules in association with proteoglycans. Large quantities of these proteases are produced by mast cells, often representing around a quarter of the total cellular protein content (1Schwartz L. Lewis R. Austen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11939-11943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recently published reports by Caughey and co-workers (2Vanderslice P. Ballinger S. Tam E. Goldstein S. Craik C. Caughey G.

It may be due to the presence of multiple tryptase gene products, the presence of different post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, or more likely a combination of causes.Tryptase has been implicated in the development of a number of clinical conditions, including asthma (9Clark J.M. Abraham W.M. Fishman C.E. Forteza R. Ahmed A. Cortes A. Warne R.L. Moore W.R. Tanaka R.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Sekizawa K.

Furthermore, the detection of different forms of tryptase can be used as a diagnostic feature. For instance increased plasma levels of ; tryptase, apparently constitutively expressed by all mast cells, are indicative of the increased mast cell burden of mastocytosis (15Schwartz L.B. Sakai K. Bradford T.R. Ren S. Zweiman B. Worobec A.S. Metcalfe D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2702-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the detection of ; tryptase indicates the presence of activated mast cells of allergic conditions and anaphylaxis (16Buckley M.G. Variend S. Walls A.F. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Interest in the biology of tryptases has increased because of their proposed role in inflammatory diseases such as asthma. Although the underlying cause of many of these diseases is not fully understood, multiple lines of evidence support a link between tryptases and an inflammatory phenotype. For example, inflamed tissue is often characterized by an increase in mast cell numbers (and tryptase levels) when compared with uninflamed control tissue (17Holgate S.T. Hardy C. Robinson C. Agius R.M. Howarth P.H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1986; 77: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and both murine and human tryptases can act directly or indirectly to recruit inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils (18Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.-T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar, 19He S. Peng Q. Walls A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6216-6225PubMed Google Scholar).One of the most interesting findings that accompanied the publishing of the human genome was that the number of discrete genes was much lower than anticipated (20Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F781-F794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously it was thought that the biochemical complexity of an organism was proportional to the size of its genome. Therefore, it was surprising that arguably the most complex organism, humans, possessed a genome not dramatically larger than that of an earthworm, and indeed significantly smaller than that of many plants (20Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F781-F794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On closer inspection the relationship between the perceived complexity of an organism and the size of its genome holds true only for the so-called “lower organisms,” where there is roughly a 1:1 ratio between the number of individual genes and their resulting protein products. What becomes obvious is that in the “higher” organisms, complexity may be facilitated by increasing the number of distinct protein products that can be generated from a single gene. This may be accomplished by processes such as post-translational modifications or by generating multiple forms of mRNA from a single primary transcript, the process of alternate splicing. The human transcriptome is apparently distinguished from that of other organisms by the dramatically increased number of alternately spliced transcripts (20Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F781-F794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we report the cloning and initial characterization of alternately spliced forms of human ;II, ;I, ;III, and ;I tryptase. The pattern of alternate splicing is identical in all four tryptases, and it results in the loss of 27 nucleotides from the mature transcript and 9 amino acids from the translated protein product, when compared with their full-length counterparts. The resulting proteases are predicted to have altered substrate specificities, at least partly due to the predicted inability of the splice variant tryptases to form tetramers. These splice variant tryptases were shown to be expressed in multiple human tissues. Alternate splicing is a mechanism that results in an increase in the number of functionally distinct human tryptases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSources of RNA—Total RNA from adult lung, heart, stomach, spleen, skin, and colon, fetal heart and fetal lung, and poly(A+) RNA isolated from human lung were obtained from commercial sources (Invitrogen). In addition, total RNA was isolated from human mast cell-1 (HMC-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HMC-1, human mast cell-1; BAPNA, N;-benzoyl-dl-arginine p-nitroanilide; EK, enterokinase; SV, splice variant; tosyl-GPR-pNA, N-(p-tosyl)-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; RT, reverse transcription; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. cells (5 × 106, a kind gift from Dr. J.

Poly(A+) RNA (300 ng) or total RNA (1.5 ;g) and 1 ;l of oligo(dT) primer were heated to 65 °C for 10 min to remove secondary structure. Reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 1 ;l of RNase inhibitor, 4 ;l of 5× RT buffer, 1 ;l of 100 mm dNTPs, 1 ;l of 80 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.5 ;l of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction was terminated by incubating the mixture at 95 °C for 2 min and was then placed immediately on ice.PCR Amplification and Cloning of ;II and ;I Tryptase cDNAs—PCR amplification of first strand cDNA was performed within 2 h of the reverse transcription reaction. Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify cDNAs were designed based on the published sequences of the ;II and ;I tryptase genes: ;II, A2 forward, 5′-AGT GGC CAG GAT GCT GAG C-3′, and A2 reverse, 5′-GGA AGC AGT GGT GTT TTG GAC AG-3′; ;II, nested NA2 forward, 5′-GCC TAC GCG GCC CCT GCC CCA GTC-3′, and NA2 reverse, 5′-CCC AGG TGG ACA CCC CAG GCC TGA-3′; ;I, DF1, 5′-TGC AGC AAA CGG GCA TTG TTG-3′, and DR1 5′-AAA GCT GTG GCC CGT ATG GAG-3′.All PCR amplifications were performed with a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCRs were carried out with 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 ;l of the reverse transcriptase reaction mixture. The total reaction volume was 50 ;l with a final concentration of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 0.1 ;m of the appropriate 5′ and 3′ primers. After an initial incubation for 5 min at 95 °C, samples were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR (45 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 58 °C, and 60s at 72 °C), followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min.PCR products (10 ;l) were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. Appropriately sized products were excised from the gel, purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated into the plasmid vector pCR®2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The ligation mixture was then used to transform TOP10 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). The transformation mixture was plated onto LB/agar plates containing ampicillin (50 ;g/ml) and coated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-;-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to enable blue/white color selection.Screening of Plasmid Colonies—Plasmids containing the appropriate sized inserts were screened by PCR for the presence of ;II and ;I tryptase inserts using the appropriate primer sets listed above. Plasmid DNA was then purified using a commercial kit (Qiagen). Nucleotide sequencing was performed either in-house using an ABI Prism® BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and an ABI377 PRISM DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or at a core facility (SUPAMAC, Sydney, Australia).dbEST Data Base Screening—EST databases accessed through the National Institutes of Health information website (www.ncbi.org) were screened using the sequences of the clones identified above.Real Time PCR Assays—A real time fluorescence-based RT-PCR assay was designed to detect all alternatively spliced (G234–G260) tryptase transcripts isolated in this study. To estimate the approximate ratio of alternatively spliced to full-length tryptase transcripts, an additional assay was designed to detect splice variant ;/;/; tryptase transcripts. Specificity was conferred by designing the forward primer spanning the junction of the deleted nucleotides (splice variant) or locating them in the deleted region (full length). The full-length primer was as follows: forward, 5′-CAC CCT CAG GGT GCA ACT G-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ATG TAG AAC TGT GGG TGC ACG AT-3′; the splice variant was as follows: forward primer, 5′-TGG GAC CGG TGC AAC TG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TAG AAC TGT GGG TGC ACG AT-3′; Taqman probe was as follows: 5′-6-FAM-AGC AGC ACC TCT ACT ACC AGG ACC AGC TG-TAMRA-3′.Reverse transcription of total human lung, heart, stomach, spleen, and skin RNA (1 ;g) was performed using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCRs were carried out in a 25-;l mixture containing 2 ;l of reverse transcript sample, 12.5 ;l of 2× universal master mix buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 600 nm reverse primer, 600 nm forward primer, and 250 nm probe. After initial heating at 50 °C for 2 min, PCR consisted of 45 cycles, including a 15-s denaturation step at 95 °C and a 1-min annealing-extension at 59 °C. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Using the sequence detector system (version 1.7, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), fluorescence intensity was plotted against cycle number. Standard curves were constructed with serial dilutions of plasmid DNA containing a normally spliced (;II) or a splice variant (;IISV) tryptase insert, allowing the copy number to be calculated for each sample using appropriate software (Copy Calculator, version 1.1). Human tryptase transcripts resulting from the alternate splicing pattern described in this study will be annotated hereafter with superscript SV, e.g. ;IISV tryptase, ;ISV tryptase, etc.The specificity of the primers was tested by examining their ability to amplify cloned templates of full-length or splice variant tryptase cDNAs. Control amplifications were performed in the absence of template DNA.Three-dimensional Protein Modeling—Three-dimensional structures of the novel tryptase sequences were modeled from the reported 3.0 Á x-ray structure of human ;II tryptase (Protein Data Bank identification code 1AOL) (21Pereira P.J.B. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The nine-residue segment DVKDLATLR missing in the splice variants was deleted from a single monomer of the structure before energy minimization with AMBER 4.1 (22Pearlman D. Case D. Caldwell J. Ross W. Cheatham T. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Singh U. Weiner P. Kollman P. AMBER. Version 4.1, University of California, San Francisco, CA1995Google Scholar) to produce a new model. Modified monomers were superimposed on the wild-type tetramer structure for visualization.Generation of Polyclonal Anti-peptide Antibodies to ;IISV Tryptase—To determine whether splice variant tryptases are translated into protein products in vivo, we developed an antibody that recognized ;IISV and ;ISV tryptase, but which may also cross-react with splice variant ;II and ; tryptases. Anti-;IISV antibodies were raised in New Zealand White rabbits (Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Gilles Plains, SA, Australia) by immunizing with an ;IISV-specific peptide, based on the “novel” juxtaposition of residues Pro48 and Val58. Therefore, an immunizing 10-mer peptide, His44-Cys45-Leu46-Gly47-Pro48-Val58-Gln59-Leu60-Arg61-Glu62, was designed consisting of the five amino acid residues on either side of the deletion, conjugated to diphtheria toxin (Mimotopes, Melbourne, Australia). Anti-;IISV antibodies were affinity-purified from antisera using the immunizing peptide conjugated to thiopropyl-Sepharose.Western Blot Analysis—The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot. 1 ;g of purified recombinant r;ISV tryptase and r;I tryptase (Escherichia coli) and recombinant ;II tryptase (Promega, Madison, WI) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk powder, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with affinity-purified ;IISV tryptase anti-peptide antibody (1 ;g/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 h, room temperature). Bound primary antibody was detected using a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:1000 for 30 min at room temperature, followed by exposure to a horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence substrate for 30 s (ECL Western blotting substrate; Pierce). The resulting bands were visualized by exposure to Biomax ML photographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The blot was stripped (62.5 mm Tris/HCl, 2% SDS, 10 mm ;-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) and re-probed with the mouse monoclonal anti-tryptase antibody AA1 diluted 1:1000 (Dako) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate.Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-;m serial sections cut from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of human aorta adventitia, lung, colon, spleen, lymph node, and breast cancer. Sections were deparaffinized, dehydrated, and rinsed in tap water. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving the sections in citrate buffer (10 mm trisodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) for 10 min on high and then allowed to cool for 10 min. Sections were then rinsed with TBS and blocked with 20% normal goat serum/TBS at room temperature for 20 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibody diluted in TBS, 2% bovine serum albumin (;IISV tryptase = 4 ;g/ml overnight at 4 °C, normal rabbit IgG = 4 ;g/ml overnight at 4 °C, and AA1 anti-tryptase antibody = 1:1000-dilution for 1 h at room temperature). Sections were then washed four times for 5 min in TBS and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in TBS, 2% bovine serum albumin/goat anti-rabbit for ;IISV tryptase and normal rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse for AA1 tryptase antibody. Sections were washed four times for 5 min in TBS, incubated with avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature, and then washed four times for 5 min in TBS. The sections were incubated in the dark for ∼15 min with alkaline phosphatase substrate (Vector Red, Vector Laboratories), which gives a red reaction product in the presence of alkaline phosphatase. All incubations were performed in a humidified chamber. Sections were rinsed in tap water, counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s, rinsed in tap water and coverslipped with CrystalMount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Stained sections were examined using an Olympus BX-60 microscope and images captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).Generation of Recombinant ;I Tryptase and ;ISV Tryptase—When compared with their full-length counterparts, the splice variant tryptases identified in this study have a 9-amino acid deletion, Asp49–Arg57. To determine whether a splice variant tryptase may be proteolytically active, recombinant ;I tryptase and its splice variant ;ISV were expressed in bacterial cells to test splice variant antibody specificity and in yeast to test for the ability to cleave a trypsin-sensitive substrate.The recombinant fusion protein included an N-terminal His6 tag (to enable purification), an enterokinase (EK) recognition site (to allow activation of the pro-enzyme), and the mature ;Ior ;ISV tryptase sequence. The construct was made in bacteria (E. coli) using the pET30 EK/ligation-independent cloning vector (Merck), and the following primers: forward, 5′-GAC GAC GAC AAG AAT ATC GTC GGG GGT CAG-3′, and reverse; 5′-GAG GAG AAG CCC GGT TCA CGG CTT TTT GGG-3′, using ligation independent cloning, and the construct was used to transform BL21 DE3 cells. Following the addition of isopropyl ;-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration), the bacterial cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C while being agitated vigorously. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (Cellytic B, Sigma). The lysate was centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and the His-6 tagged recombinant protein was purified from the supernatant using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen).The construct was made in yeast (Pichia pastoris) by insertion of the mature ;Ior ;ISV tryptase sequence into the pPIC9; vector (Invitrogen), similar to a method described previously (23Niles A.L. Maffitt M. Haak-Frendscho M. Wheeless C.J. Johnson D.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 28: 125-131PubMed Google Scholar), using the following primers: EKBI forward, 5′-GAT GAC GAC GAC AAG ATC GTT GGG GGT-3′, and BII reverse, 5′-ACG ACG GCG GCC GCT TCA CGG CTT TTT GGG GAC ATA GTG-3′; HISEKF forward, 5′-CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAC GAT GAC GAC GAC AAG-3′; KEXHIS forward, 5′-GGG CCC CTC GAG AAA AGA CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT-3′. These primers were used to amplify ;II tryptase sequence and to add a His6 and EK cleavage site upstream of the mature tryptase sequence. The KEXHIS forward primer encodes the KEXI cleavage site, as well as an XhoI restriction site. The reverse primer encodes a NotI restriction site and the mature ; tryptase sequence. The vectors were linearized with SalI, and GS115 cells were transformed using electroporation (XCell II, Bio-Rad). These cells were grown on minimal dextrose/agar plates, followed by minimal methanol/agar plates to screen for colonies expressing ;ISV tryptase, as described previously (24Wung J.L. Gascoigne N.R. BioTechniques. 1996; 21 (810, 812): 808Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Positive colonies were grown in BMMY media, containing 1% methanol.Recombinant ;I and ;ISV tryptase purified as above were activated for 16 h at room temperature in cleavage buffer (10 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm CaCl2, pH 6.1) using 1 unit of EK. After enzyme activation, EK was removed using EKapture-agarose beads (EMD Biosciences-Novagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions.The enzymatic activity of the recombinant ;ISV tryptase was evaluated by testing its ability to cleave peptide substrates, and N;-benzoyl-dl-arginine p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) (Sigma) or N-(p-tosyl)-Gly-Pro-Arg p-nitroanilide (tosyl-GPR-pNA) (Sigma), or the physiological substrate human fibronectin. The cleavage pattern was compared with that of ;I tryptase.For the tosyl-GPR-pNA assay, ;I tryptase was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), whereas ;ISV tryptase was purified using Affi-Gel Hz (Bio-Rad) conjugated to the AA1 tryptase antibody (Dako), as per the manufacturers' protocol. EK activated and unactivated (as described above) ;I and ;ISV tryptase (25 ;l), and an EK control was incubated with tosyl-GPR-pNA (0.5 ;l, 20 mg/ml) in 200 ;l of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was read at 405 nm. The EK control consisted of 1 unit of EK, which was then removed using Ekapture-agarose beads; this was done to control for any residual EK in the tryptase preparations activated with EK.For the BAPNA assay, yeast supernatants were concentrated five times using a Microcon centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and 40 ;l of concentrated supernatant was added to 110 ;l of reaction buffer (2 mm BAPNA, 100 mm Tris, HCl, 1 m glycine, pH 8.0) in a 96-well plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was read at 405 nm.Human fibronectin (1 ;g; Invitrogen) was added to the activated tryptases and incubated for 18 h at room temperature. To ensure tetramer formation, heparin (1 mg, Sigma) was added to the activated enzymes. Digests were then separated on a non-reduced 7.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel, fixed, and visualized by silver staining.RESULTSIdentification and Cloning of Alternatively Spliced Human Tryptase cDNAs—RT-PCR was performed using ;II tryptase-specific primers on total RNA derived from human lung and using ; tryptase-specific primers on total RNA derived from the HMC-1 cell line. When the resulting PCR products were electrophoresed and visualized on an agarose gel, the amplimers from each reaction appeared to run as a “doublet.” One amplimer in each lane was of the expected size for a human tryptase, and the second, or doublet, was slightly smaller (data not shown). All PCR products were isolated from the gel, cloned into the pCR2.1 vector, and sequenced.Sequencing revealed that the larger cDNA generated using ;II tryptase primers was 884 nucleotides in length and included an ATG translation start codon and TGA stop codon at position 826. The sequence of this fragment (Fig. 1A, submitted as GenBank™ accession number AF206665) matched the predicted exonic sequence of the ;II tryptase gene (4Pallaoro M. Fejzo M.S. Shayesteh L. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3355-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the smaller cDNA generated using these same primers revealed an 805-bp cDNA fragment that matched the ;II-tryptase cDNA exactly, except for a 27-nucleotide deletion from nucleotides 234 to 260 (Fig. 1A, submitted as GenBank™ accession number AF206666).Analysis of cloned PCR products generated using the ; tryptase-specific primers revealed similar results. The sequence of the larger PCR product matched that of ;I tryptase, as described by us previously (5Wang H.-W. McNeil H.P. Husain A. Liu K. Tedla N. Thomas P.S. Raftery M. King G.C. Cai Z.Y. Hunt J.E. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5145-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sequence of the smaller cDNA also matched that of ;I tryptase, except for the same 27-nucleotide deletion present in the truncated ;II cDNA described above (Fig. 1B, submitted as GenBank™ accession number AF421357).Using the truncated tryptase sequences as a query, a BLAST search of dbEST da"

The properties of the ear are such that it is difficult to construct an experiment of which the result is neither obscured by an unavoidable margin of error nor capable of alternative interpretations. We believe that the following experiment is unobjectionable on either of these grounds and constitutes a valid proof that the resonance hypothesis is true, and that the resonators of the ear (at all but the lowest audible frequencies) are only lightly damped."

https://openalex.org/W1970095091,"THE Huxley Memorial Lecture for 1947, under the auspices of the Royal Anthropological Institute, was delivered by Dr. W. L. H. Duckworth, reader emeritus in human anatomy in the University of Cambridge. The subject was ""Some Complexities of Human Structure""*. The approach was frankly anatomical and was a meticulous and masterful analysis of the facts, anatomical and racial, relating to the organs of speech in man. Duckworth wasted no time on the classical definitions of anthropology; he ignored the subdivisions of the subject and refused to be drawn into the finer distinctions of zoological anthropology, physical anthropology, social and cultural anthropology and ethnology. He kept clear of the pathological and avoided the theories of aphasia from Broca and Bastian to Henry Head. Here was the approach to the anatomical aspect as emphasized by Galen in his ""Methodus Medendi"" : ""The magnitude of a disease is in proportion to its deviation from the healthy state ; and the extent of the deviation can be ascertained by him only who is perfectly acquainted with the healthy state"". Hence the justification for the intensive study of normal structure and function in man as distinct from booksellers' notes about positive health and social medicine."
