https://openalex.org/W1627180673,"Food-chain length is an important characteristic of ecological communities: it influences community structure, ecosystem functions and contaminant concentrations in top predators. Since Elton first noted that food-chain length was variable among natural systems, ecologists have considered many explanatory hypotheses, but few are supported by empirical evidence. Here we test three hypotheses that predict food-chain length to be determined by productivity alone (productivity hypothesis), ecosystem size alone (ecosystem-size hypothesis) or a combination of productivity and ecosystem size (productive-space hypothesis). The productivity and productive-space hypotheses propose that food-chain length should increase with increasing resource availability; however, the productivity hypothesis does not include ecosystem size as a determinant of resource availability. The ecosystem-size hypothesis is based on the relationship between ecosystem size and species diversity, habitat availability and habitat heterogeneity. We find that food-chain length increases with ecosystem size, but that the length of the food chain is not related to productivity. Our results support the hypothesis that ecosystem size, and not resource availability, determines food-chain length in these natural ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W2024480366,"We have determined the crystal structure of an active, hexameric fragment of the gene 4 helicase from bacteriophage T7. The structure reveals how subunit contacts stabilize the hexamer. Deviation from expected six-fold symmetry of the hexamer indicates that the structure is of an intermediate on the catalytic pathway. The structural consequences of the asymmetry suggest a “binding change” mechanism to explain how cooperative binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides are coupled to conformational changes in the ring that most likely accompany duplex unwinding. The structure of a complex with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog provides additional evidence for this hypothesis, with only four of the six possible nucleotide binding sites being occupied in this conformation of the hexamer. This model suggests a mechanism for DNA translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1662043995,"Languages, like molecules, document evolutionary history. Darwin observed that evolutionary change in languages greatly resembled the processes of biological evolution: inheritance from a common ancestor and convergent evolution operate in both. Despite many suggestions, few attempts have been made to apply the phylogenetic methods used in biology to linguistic data. Here we report a parsimony analysis of a large language data set. We use this analysis to test competing hypotheses--the ""express-train"" and the ""entangled-bank"" models--for the colonization of the Pacific by Austronesian-speaking peoples. The parsimony analysis of a matrix of 77 Austronesian languages with 5,185 lexical items produced a single most-parsimonious tree. The express-train model was converted into an ordered geographical character and mapped onto the language tree. We found that the topology of the language tree was highly compatible with the express-train model."

https://openalex.org/W1561542953,"Noble-gas concentrations in ground water have been used as a proxy for past air temperatures, but the accuracy of this approach has been limited by the existence of a temperature-independent component of the noble gases in ground water, termed 'excess air' whose origin and composition is poorly understood. In particular, the evidence from noble gases in a Brazilian aquifer for a cooling of more than 5 C in tropical America during the Last Glacial Maximum has been called into question. Here we propose a model for dissolved gases in ground water, which describes the formation of excess air by equilibration of ground water with entrapped air in quasi-saturated soils. Our model predicts previously unexplained noble-gas data sets, including the concentration of atmospheric helium, and yields consistent results for the non-atmospheric helium isotopes that are used for dating ground water. Using this model of excess air, we re-evaluate the use of noble gases from ground water for reconstructing past temperatures. Our results corroborate the inferred cooling in Brazil during the Last Glacial Maximum, and indicate that even larger cooling took place at mid-latitudes."

To determine if PI is an essential phospholipid of mycobacteria, we identified the pgsA gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis encoding the phosphatidylinositol synthase enzyme and constructed a pgsAconditional mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis. The ability of this mutant to synthesize phosphatidylinositol synthase and subsequently PI was dependent on the presence of a functional copy of the pgsA gene carried on a thermosensitive plasmid. The mutant grew like the control strain under permissive conditions (30 °C), but ceased growing when placed at 42 °C, a temperature at which the rescue plasmid is lost. Loss of cell viability at 42 °C was observed when PI and phosphatidylinositol dimannoside contents dropped to ∼30 and 50% of the wild-type levels, respectively. This work provides the first evidence of the essentiality of PI to the survival of mycobacteria. PI synthase is thus an essential enzyme of Mycobacterium that shows promise as a drug target for anti-tuberculosis therapy.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 215-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mycobacterial cell envelope is the site of action of many of the first-line antimycobacterial agents (2Chopra I. Brennan P.J. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1997; 78: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the biochemistry and genetics of the pathways leading to the synthesis of envelope components required for cell viability or survival in the host will provide a basis for the rational design of new drugs. Among the potentially attractive drug targets are the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the main mycobacterial phospholipids: phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),1 phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL) (3Goren M.B. Kubica G.P. Wayne L.G. The Mycobacteria: A Sourcebook. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1984: 379-415Google Scholar). It is expected that a deficiency in some of these phosphoglycerides would affect the structural and functional organization of the mycobacterial plasma membrane, presumably resulting in the death of the bacterium. Contrary to PE, PG, PS, and CL, which are frequently encountered in all living organisms, PI is an essential phospholipid of eukaryotic cells (4Nikawa J.-I. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Nikawa J. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nikawa J.-I.

Actually, the distribution of PI in prokaryotes seems to be confined to some actinomycetes (Mycobacterium,Corynebacterium, Nocardia,Micromonospora, Streptomyces, and Propionibacterium) (3Goren M.B.

Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are prominent and important phospholipids/lipoglycans. PI and PIMans are regarded as essential for membrane stability and thus for cell viability (3Goren M.B. Kubica G.P. Wayne L.G. The Mycobacteria: A Sourcebook. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1984: 379-415Google Scholar). Lipoarabinomannan is an important modulator of the immune response in the course of tuberculosis and leprosy (18Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) as well as a key ligand in the interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and macrophages that ultimately may facilitate the survival of the tubercle bacillus within phagocytic cells (19Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, although PI is regarded as an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall, positive proof of an essential role of this molecule was lacking. Previously,de novo synthesis of PI in mycobacterial cell wall extracts had been described involving the exchange of the CMP moiety of CDP-diacylglycerol (DAG) for inositol (20Salman M. Lonsdale J.T. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we undertook the identification of the gene encoding the M. tuberculosis PI synthase and addressed the question of the essentiality of this gene through the construction of a conditional mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue, the strain used in this study for cloning experiments, was routinely propagated in LB-Lennox medium (10 g/liter peptone from casein, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter sodium chloride; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C. M. smegmatisstrain mc2155 (21Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) was routinely grown at 30, 37, or 42 °C in LB-Lennox liquid medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80. LB-Lennox medium was used as the solid medium for all bacteria. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 20 μg/ml; hygromycin, 50 μg/ml; and streptomycin, 20 μg/ml. When required, 10% sucrose was added to the solid medium. Electrocompetent cells of E. coli XL1-Blue and M. smegmatismc2155 were prepared as described (22Pelicic V. Reyrat J.M. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and electrotransformed using a Gene Pulser unit (Bio-Rad). Purification of DNA restriction fragments and PCR fragments was performed using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit, the QIAquick gel extraction kit, and the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Plasmids were isolated from E. coli XL1-Blue using the QIAprep miniprep kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Partial M. smegmatis chromosomal DNA libraries were constructed using PstI-, SalI-, and SmaI-digested and dephosphorylated “ready-to-clone” pUC18 vectors (Appligene, Illkirch, France). These libraries were transformed into E. coli XL1, and colonies harboring a plasmid carrying the M. smegmatis pgsA gene were identified by colony hybridization using the M. tuberculosis pgsA gene as a probe (PCR-amplified using primers A1.a/A1.b; see below). Three plasmids were isolated in this way: pUCpgsA.P carrying the M. smegmatis pgsA on a 2.0-kb PstI restriction fragment, pUCpgsA.S carrying the pgsA gene on a 2.6-kb SalI restriction fragment, and pUCpgsA.Sm carrying the pgsA gene on a 4.0-kb SmaI restriction fragment. They were used for DNA sequencing of the M. smegmatis pgsA gene and surrounding ORFs. Southern blot analysis and colony hybridization were performed as described (23Jackson M. Portnoı̈ D. Catheline D. Dumail L. Rauzier J. Legrand P. Gicquel B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2883-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of double-stranded plasmids were obtained by Macromolecular Resources (Colorado State University) using an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer. DNA sequence comparisons were done by BLAST analysis (National Center for Biotechnology Information) (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.M. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70353) Google Scholar). Sequences were assembled and processed by using the DNA Strider program (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Standard PCR strategies with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) were used to amplify the M. tuberculosis H37Rv pgsA,pgsA2, and pgsA3 genes. PCR amplifications consisted of one cycle of denaturation (95 °C, 10 min), followed by 30 cycles of amplification that included denaturation (95 °C, 1 min), annealing (61 °C, 1 min), and primer extension (72 °C, 1 min). The primers used were as follows: A1a (5′-cccccccccatatgagcaagctgcccttcctgtcc-3′) and A1b (5′-cccaagcttccggtcgccctttccaggaatc-3′) for the pgsA gene, A2a (5′-cccccccccatatggagccggtgctcacgcag-3′) and A2b (5′-cccaagcttgccacgttcaccagcgttctg-3′) for the pgsA2 gene, and A3a (5′-cccccccccatatgagcaggtcaacccgttattc-3′) and A3b (5′-cccaagcttgctggcggtctggcggatccc-3′) for the pgsA3 gene. They were designed to provide PCR-amplified fragments containing an NdeI and a HindIII restriction site, enabling direct cloning into the pVV16 expression vector, a derivative of pMV261 (25Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) harboring a kanamycin resistance marker, a hygromycin resistance marker, the phsp60 promoter, and a six-histidine tag for the expression of C-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. The resulting expression vectors, named pVVpgsA, pVVpgsA2, and pVVpgsA3, were transformed into M. smegmatis mc2155, and transformants were selected on LB-Km-hygromycin plates. The expression of the PgsA, PgsA2, and PgsA3 proteins in the recombinant strains of M. smegmatis was checked by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-His antibodies (Penta-His antibody, QIAGEN Inc.). M. smegmatis crude extracts were prepared by harvesting cultures of the recombinant strains (A600 nm = 0.6–0.7), washing them twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, subjecting them to probe sonication for 3 min in the form of 3 × 60-s pulses with 60-s cooling intervals between pulses, and removing the unbroken cells and bacterial debris by centrifugation of the sonicate at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was estimated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot experiments were carried out as described previously (23Jackson M. Portnoı̈ D. Catheline D. Dumail L. Rauzier J. Legrand P. Gicquel B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2883-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 100 μg of proteins were loaded onto the gels. The protocol used for immunodetection was as recommended by QIAGEN Inc. Transfer membranes were incubated with the anti-His antibody diluted 1:1000 and with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 (Sigma). For radiolabeling of whole M. smegmatis cells with 32Pi,M. smegmatis was grown in LB-Lennox medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80, 200 μg/ml myo-inositol, 20 μg/ml glycerol, and kanamycin at 37 °C under agitation. 1 μCi/ml32Pi (carrier-free; specific activity of 1–60 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was added to the medium when cultures reached A600 nm = 0.05 (or A600 nm = 0.01 for strain mc2/pVVpgsA3). The incubation was terminated after 24 h when cells reached mid-log phase (early log phase for mc2/pVVpgsA3). Cultures were then pelleted and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline prior to lipid extraction. For radiolabeling of the M. smegmatis conditional mutant with [14C]acetate, the conditional mutant strain was first grown at 30 °C in LB-Lennox medium supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 and kanamycin. This culture was then diluted in fresh medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate (specific activity of 54 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) to A600 nm < 0.1 and placed at 42 °C for different periods of time prior to lipid extraction. A pUC18 vector harboring the M. smegmatis pgsA gene on a 2.0-kb PstI restriction fragment (vector pUCpgsA.P) was isolated by colony hybridization using the M. tuberculosis pgsA gene (PCR-amplified with primers A1.a/A1.b) as a probe. The M. smegmatis pgsA gene and flanking regions were excised from this plasmid on a 1.8-kb SmaI restriction fragment and cloned into the HindIII-cut and blunt-ended pXYL4 vector (a pBluescript derivative carrying the xylE colored marker) (26Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pPGSX. The Km cassette from pUC4K conferring kanamycin resistance and carried on a 1.2-kb HincII fragment was then cloned into the HindIII-cut and blunt-ended pPGSX plasmid, yielding plasmid pPGSXK. Finally, p27PGSXK, the construct used for allelic exchange, was obtained by transferring a 4.2-kb BamHI fragment from pPGSXK containing pgsA:: Km and xylE into BamHI-cut pPR27, a temperature-sensitive mycobacterial vector carrying the counter-selectable marker sacB (26Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). pCG76, a Mycobacterium/E. coli shuttle plasmid derived from pCG63, harboring a mycobacterial thermosensitive origin of replication and a streptomycin resistance cassette (27Guilhot C. Gicquel B. Martin C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 98: 181-186Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was used to carry functional copies of the M. smegmatis pgsA gene in the M. smegmatis pgsA mutant. One of these complementing vectors, pCGpis.1, was constructed by inserting the 1.8-kb SmaI restriction fragment from pUCpgsA.P into BamHI-cut and blunt-ended pCG76. The second complementing vector, pCGpis.2, was constructed by cloning the 2.6-kb blunt-ended SalI fragment from pUCpgsA.S into BamHI-cut and blunt-ended pCG76. These temperature-sensitive vectors are able to replicate at 30 °C, but not at 42 °C. M. smegmatiscultures collected at A600 nm = 0.6–0.7 were washed, and cells were resuspended at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.9), 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm MgCl2). The cell suspension was subjected to probe sonication (1-cm probe, Soniprep 150, MSE, Sussex, United Kingdom) for 10 min in the form of 10 × 60-s pulses with 90-s cooling intervals between pulses. After the whole sonicate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A. The crude cell wall fraction was obtained upon centrifugation of this resuspended pellet at 3000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris and unbroken cells. Proteins were kept frozen in small aliquots at −70 °C. Crude cell wall fractions were assayed for PI synthase activity in a final volume of 400 μl (20Salman M. Lonsdale J.T. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture contained crude cell wall preparation (∼1 mg of protein), 0.1 mm ATP, 5 mm glucose, 300 μm CDP-diacylglycerol (dipalmitoyl; Sigma), 0.4% CHAPS, 22 μCi of [3H]inositol (2.5 μm final concentration; specific activity of 22 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and buffer A up to 400 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. At the end of incubations, the reactions were terminated by the addition of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, 3 ml/400 μl of reaction mixture), followed by centrifugation to separate the pellet. The pellet was extracted once more with 3 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The combined extracts were washed once with 0.9% NaCl (1.2 ml) and once with 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48) to yield the washed CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) lipids. Since no labeled product other than PI was found in the washed lipid extract, quantification of the reaction was performed directly by scintillation counting of the washed lipid extract. Lipids from labeled and unlabeled cells were extracted by two consecutive overnight extractions in 4 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The combined CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) extracts were washed once with 0.9% NaCl and once with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48) to yield a fraction containing the phospholipids including PIMan2s. When phosphatidylinositol pentamannosides and linear LM were to be extracted, the insoluble pellet resulting from the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) extraction was further extracted overnight with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3). Characterization of the various PIMans followed earlier work (28Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and was based on fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analysis, one- and two-dimensional thin-layer chromatographic patterns of the intact PIMans (16Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), sugar analysis by gas chromatography, and fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (29Hunter S.W. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 917-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PIMan2s were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analysis either directly in the negative ion mode or as acetyl derivatives (100 μl of pyridine/acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) for 24 h) in the positive ion mode. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Fisons VG AutoSpec mass spectrometer with a cesium ion gun operating at 25 kV. Samples (30 μg) were applied to a m-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix. Triacylated PIMan2 and lyso-PIMan2 were purified by preparative TLC in the solvent systems described below. TLC was conducted in one- and two-dimensions on aluminum-backed plates of Silica Gel 60 F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Solvents used for the analysis of phospholipids and PIMan2s were CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/HCOOH/H2O (35:15:6:2:0.3) and CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6), respectively. Analysis of phosphatidylinositol pentamannosides and linear LM was performed in the same solvent as the one used for PIMan2s. Two-dimensional TLCs were performed using solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60:30:6) in the first dimension and solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (40:25:3:6) in the second dimension. An α-naphthol spray (1% α-naphthol in ethanol), a Dittmer-Lester spray (30Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a cupric sulfate spray (10% CuSO4 in an 8% phosphoric acid solution) were used to detect carbohydrate-containing lipids, phosphorus-containing lipids, and all organic compounds, respectively. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing chromatograms to Kodak X-Omat AR films at −70 °C usually for 1–4 days. Plates were also scanned for radioactivity using a Bio-Scan System 200 imaging scanner with Autochanger 3000, or relevant spots were scraped off for scintillation counting. l-α-Phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma),l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (Sigma),l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Sigma),l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (Sigma), and cardiolipin (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) commercial standards were used to identify the mycobacterial phospholipids on thin-layer chromatograms. The search for the mycobacterial PI synthase gene was based on the fact that all the enzymes (with the exception of phosphatidylserine synthases of Gram-negative bacteria) capable of catalyzing the transfer of a free alcohol (inositol, serine, or glycerol) onto CDP-diacylglycerol share a common motif in their primary sequence, named the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase signature (Prosite accession number PS00379).

The presence of the psd gene encoding a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase responsible for the synthesis of PE from PS adjacent to the pssA gene in addition to sequence similarities the M. tuberculosis PssA enzyme shares with known PS synthases (32Matsumoto K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a) strongly suggest that the pssA gene encodes a PS synthase. Therefore, this gene was not considered to be a PI synthase candidate gene. The three other genes, pgsA, pgsA2, and pgsA3, were PCR-amplified and placed under the control of the phsp60 promoter (25Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T.

These three plasmids were electrotransformed into M. smegmatismc2155. The production of recombinant proteins in each recombinant strain was checked using anti-His antibodies (data not shown). Interestingly, in LB-Km liquid medium at 37 °C, the mc2/pVVpgsA and mc2/pVVpgsA2 strains exhibited the same growth rate as the mc2/pVV16 control strain, whereas mc2/pVVpgsA3 exhibited a much slower growth due to an extended lag period that lasted ≅24 h instead of 10–12 h for all the other strains (data not shown). On LB-Km solid medium at 37 °C, mc2/pVVpgsA3 colonies appeared after 8 days instead of 3 days for the other strains. The phospholipid composition of the three recombinant strains and that of the control strain were analyzed by measuring the distribution of labeled 32Pi among the major lipid classes.32Pi labeling was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 h of labeling, when bacterial cultures reached mid-log phase (early log phase for mc2/pVVpgsA3), bacteria were pelleted, and their lipids were extracted and analyzed. This experiment was performed on two different mc2/pVVpgsA transformants, two different mc2/pVVpgsA2 transformants, and one mc2/pVVpgsA3 transformant. TableI shows the radiolabeled phospholipid composition of each strain in one typical experiment. The mc2/pVVpgsA2 strain exhibited the same pattern of32Pi distribution as the mc2/pVV16 control strain. The mc2/pVVpgsA recombinant strain exhibited a slightly higher quantity of PI (PI represented 34% of the total phospholipids as compared with 21–23% for the mc2/pVVpgsA2 and control strains), suggesting that pgsA may encode a PI synthase. The mc2/pVVpgsA3 strain had a completely different pattern of32Pi distribution, with the appearance of a new highly labeled compound that was barely detected in the other strains. This compound comigrated with the phosphatidylglycerol commercial standard, suggesting that pgsA3 encodes a phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase. This result is consistent with the sequence similarities that the PgsA3 enzyme of M. tuberculosis shares with other known PG synthases (Fig.1 b). Overproduction of PG thus appeared to be the cause of the slow growth of strain mc2/pVVpgsA3. The distribution of 32Pi among other PI-containing compounds such as PIMans and linear LM was identical for all strains (data not shown).Table IPhospholipid composition of M. smegmatis control and recombinant strainsmc2pVV16mc2pVVpgsAmc2pVVpgsA2mc2pVVpgsA3%%%%Origin2.82.31.97.2PIMan24.53.94.76.5PI23.434.521.318.0PE31.629.131.724.1PG0.40.60.323.5CL37.329.640.120.7The 32P1-labeled lipids were extracted and separated by TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and radioactivity distribution among phospholipids was determined using a Bio-Scan System 200 imaging scanner. Open table in a new tab The 32P1-labeled lipids were extracted and separated by TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and radioactivity distribution among phospholipids was determined using a Bio-Scan System 200 imaging scanner. PI synthase cell-free assays were performed on crude cell wall preparations of each strain. Results are presented in Fig. 2 (a and b). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the cell wall preparation of the mc2/pVVpgsA recombinant strain exhibited a PI synthase activity that was 2–2.5-fold greater than that of the other strains (Fig. 2 a). A comparative time course of PI synthesis by the crude cell wall preparations of mc2/pVVpgsA and mc2/pVV16 further reflected the overproduction of PI synthase in the recombinant strain mc2/pVVpgsA (Fig. 2 b), strongly suggesting that the mycobacterial PI synthase is encoded by the pgsAgene. Although no obvious function could be attributed to the PgsA2 enzyme from these experiments, it is likely that this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin. It has been suggested that mycobacteria possess a eukaryotic type of cardiolipin synthase activity involving the transfer of a phosphatidyl group from CDP-diacylglycerol to PG to form CL and CMP (33Mathur A.K.

Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, although it has been suggested that mycobacteria are also able to make CL from the usual prokaryotic reaction, PG + PG → CL + glycerol (33Mathur A.K. Suryanarayana-Murthy P. Saharia G.S. Venkitasubramanian T.A. Can. J.

This suggests that the synthesis of CL from PG and CDP-diacylglycerol may be prevalent in mycobacteria and catalyzed by an enzyme of the same"

(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 40, 25734 ‐25740), we have carried out an analysis with quinone structural variants. We show that three functional classes can be defined: (i) PTP inhibitors (ubiquinone 0, decylubiquinone, ubiquinone 10, 2,3-dimethyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone, and 2,3,5-trimethyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone); (ii) PTP inducers (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-hydroxydecyl)-1,4-benzoquinone and 2,5-dihydroxy-6undecyl-1,4-benzoquinone); and (iii) PTP-inactive quinones that counteract the effects of both inhibitors and inducers (ubiquinone 5 and 2,3,5-trimethyl-6-(3-hydroxyisoamyl)-1,4-benzoquinone). The structure-function correlation indicates that minor modifications in the isoprenoid side chain can turn an inhibitor into an activator, and that the methoxy groups are not essential for the effects of quinones on the PTP. Since the ubiquinone analogs used in this study have a similar midpoint potential and decrease mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species to the same extent, these results support the hypothesis that quinones modulate the PTP through a common binding site rather than through oxidation-reduction reactions. Occupancy of this site can modulate the PTP open-closed transitions, possibly through secondary changes of the PTP Ca 21 binding affinity."

The PTS is a group transfer pathway; a phosphoryl group derived from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is transferred sequentially along a series of proteins to the carbohydrate molecule. The sequence of phosphotransfer is from PEP to the general cytoplasmic PTS proteins enzyme I (EI) and HPr and, in the case of glucose, further to the carbohydrate-specific cytoplasmic IIAGlc, membrane-bound IICBGlc (the glucose permease), and glucose. For other carbohydrates, specific enzymes II exist (with the A, B, and C domains present either as a single polypeptide or as multiple proteins, depending on the carbohydrate that is transported), which accept the phosphoryl group from HPr (1Meadow N.D.

Biophys.

Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C.

The presence or absence of a PTS substrate affects the IIAGlc phosphorylation state; in the absence of PTS substrate, phosphorylated IIAGlc predominates, which activates adenylate cyclase and hence increases the intracellular cyclic AMP level, thereby affecting the expression of a large number of genes. The presence of a PTS substrate, on the other hand, will lead to dephosphorylation of IIAGlc. Unphosphorylated IIAGlc can bind stoichiometrically to the uptake systems for some non-PTS substrates for growth, inhibiting these uptake systems allosterically by so-called “inducer exclusion” and preventing the entry of the alternative carbon substrates into the cell to induce their own catabolic genes.The individual components of the PTS have been characterized extensively, using kinetic and structural approaches (for a review, see Refs. 1Meadow N.D.

In the kinetic analysis of the PTS proteins, many K m values for their substrates and products, as well as the equilibrium constants of the phosphotransfer reactions have been determined. A recent development is the direct determination, using a rapid quench method, of the forward and reverse rate constants of phosphotransfer between HPr and IIAGlc ofEscherichia coli (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Metabolic control analysis is a quantitative framework developed by Kacser and Burns (7Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar) and Heinrich and Rapoport (8Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) for describing the steady-state behavior of metabolic systems and the dependence of cellular variables (e.g. fluxes or intermediate concentrations) on parameters (e.g. enzyme concentrations). The intracellular concentrations of all four glucose PTS proteins inSalmonella typhimurium (9van der Vlag J. van't Hof R. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and of IICBGlc inE. coli (10Ruijter G.J.G. Postma P.W. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6184-6191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been modulated in turn to determine the extent to which each of these proteins controls the PTS-mediated uptake rate in vivo. These dependences were quantified with so-called flux response coefficients, defined as the percentage change in the uptake rate upon a 1% increase in the enzyme concentration (see “” for mathematical definitions). Furthermore, titrations with different amounts of E. coli cell-free extracts (11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have enabled the quantification of the extent to which the glucose PTS proteins together control PTS-mediated phosphorylation activity in vitro at different protein concentrations. There was a remarkable difference between the results obtained in vitro and in vivo; in vivo, the four flux response coefficients added up to 0.8 (9van der Vlag J. van't Hof R. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas in vitro, this sum varied between 1.5 and 1.8 depending on the total protein concentration (11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A value of greater than unity for this sum is in itself remarkable, since it reflects a higher order than linear dependence of flux on total protein concentration and contrasts strongly with the linear relationship between reaction rate and enzyme concentration usually found in enzyme kinetics. However, following these experiments, two additional questions are still unresolved. (a) What is the cause of the discrepancy between the sum of the flux response coefficients of the PTS proteins in vivoand in vitro, and why does this sum vary in vitroas the protein concentration changes? (b) Metabolic control analysis of group transfer pathways predicts that the sum of the enzyme flux response coefficients should lie between 1 and 2 (12Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 256-274Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In vivo, this sum is less than 1; however, the flux response coefficients toward PEP, pyruvate, and glucose were not determined (9van der Vlag J. van't Hof R. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Is it reasonable to assume that this sum increases to values above 1 if flux responses toward these “boundary metabolites” are included?To address these questions and to determine whether such different behavior under conditions in vivo and in vitromay realistically be expected from the same metabolic system, we constructed a detailed kinetic model of the PTS in enteric bacteria, using literature data to assign values to the rate constants of the elementary phosphotransfer reactions. The results of steady-state calculations with the model are compared with experimental data, and the difference between experimental behavior of the PTS in vivo and in vitro is proposed to be the result of a novel aspect, i.e. the formation of long living transition state complexes between the different PTS proteins and the bound phosphoryl group.The PTS may well be regarded as a paradigm for what has been termed “nonideal” metabolism (13Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 52-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is a group transfer pathway with special control properties (12Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 256-274Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); it is a perfect mechanistic example of metabolic channeling and therefore affected by macromolecular crowding (11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); it is involved in signal transduction through catabolite repression and inducer exclusion (see above); and a similar sequence of phosphoryl transfer is ubiquitous in the “two-component regulatory systems” (14, 15Ninfa A.J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd Ed. Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

Tommassen J. Westerhoff H.V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 309-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any attempt at a deeper understanding of such cellular processes at a level beyond map making, component identification, and characterization will have to put the pieces of the puzzle together in a quantitative “systems framework.” This paper is such an attempt.RESULTSHere, we shall describe the kinetic behavior of the model and compare this to experimental results obtained in vivo andin vitro. Furthermore, a parameter sensitivity analysis will be presented to determine to what extent the results depended on assumptions that were made during the derivation of the rate constants of the elementary steps from the phenomenological kinetic constants measured experimentally (see “”).Steady-state BehaviorThe steady-state flux predicted by the enzyme kinetic parameters of the PTS is shown in TableII for simulation of a PTS uptake assayin vivo and a phosphorylation experiment in vitroat two different protein concentrations. The corresponding experimental values are for comparison. For the modeled flux, agreement between model and experiment was good; although the modeled value was always lower than the experimental value, the discrepancy was only approximately 30% (i.e. less than a factor of 2) for conditions in vivo and in vitro. This discrepancy is small considering the fact that the calculation was based exclusively on experimentally determined parameters; no parameter value was fitted.Table IParameters of the kinetic modelParametersUnitsIn vivoIn vitro2 mg of protein/ml6 mg of protein/mlPTS protein concentrations [EI]totalμm50.040.12 [HPr]totalμm500.41.2 [IIAGlc]totalμm400.320.96 [IICBGlc]totalμm150.120.36Boundary metabolite concentrations PEPμm2800400012,000 Pyruvateμm90000 MeGlcμm50010,00010,000 MeGlc 6-Pμm5000Rate constants (PTS step in parentheses) k 1 (PEP to EI)μm−1min−1 1960 1-aIdentical values were used for the rate constants under all conditions. k −1 (PEP to EI)min−1480,000 k 2 (PEP to EI)min−1108,000 k −2(PEP to EI)μm−1 min−1294 k 3 (EI to HPr)μm−1min−114,000 k −3 (EI to HPr)min−114,000 k 4 (EI to HPr)min−184,000 k −4 (EI to HPr)μm−1 min−13360 k 5 (HPr to IIAGlc)μm−1min−121,960 k −5 (HPr to IIAGlc)min−121,960 k 6 (HPr to IIAGlc)min−1 4392 k −6 (HPr to IIAGlc)μm−1min−13384 k 7 (IIAGlcto IICBGlc)μm−1min−1880 k −7 (IIAGlcto IICBGlc)min−1880 k 8 (IIAGlc to IICBGlc)min−12640 k −8 (IIAGlc to IICBGlc)μm−1min−1960 k 9 (IICBGlcto Glc)μm−1 min−1260 k −9 (IICBGlc to Glc)min−1389 k 10(IICBGlc to Glc)min−14800 k −10 (IICBGlc to Glc)μm−1min−15.4 × 10−31-a Identical values were used for the rate constants under all conditions.

Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated whether the model would match experimental data obtained by varying the concentrations of the PTS proteins. The effect of changing in turn the concentrations of EI, HPr, IIAGlc, and IICBGlc on PTS uptake activity (while keeping enzyme concentrations other than the modulated one constant) has been determined experimentally (9van der Vlag J. van't Hof R. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); these experiments were mimicked by numerical simulation. First we considered small variations, expressing the results in terms of response coefficients (i.e. the percentage change in flux for a 1% increase in enzyme concentration). Table II shows that the calculated response coefficients matched their experimental counterparts remarkably well.A reservation concerning the use of response coefficients is that they refer to small parameter changes, whereas in biologically relevant cases, changes may well exceed 50%. We therefore also considered large variations in enzyme concentrations. Again the simulation results agreed remarkably well with experimental data: the modeled fluxversus PTS protein concentration profiles matched the experimental ones (Fig. 1). An exception was the decrease in PTS uptake activity for high EI levels (9van der Vlag J. van't Hof R. van Dam K. Postma P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which was not observed in the simulations. Fig. 1 also shows that changing the concentrations of EI, HPr, and IIAGlc around their wild-type levels had little effect on the flux; this was quantified by calculating the flux response coefficients of these proteins, as indicated on the graphs. The flux response coefficients of IIAGlc and IICBGlc were slightly higher than the experimentally reported values (cf. Table II).A kinetic model will gain credibility if it can describe experimental data in vivo as well as in vitro without the need for adjustment of the kinetic parameters. The effect of concomitant changes in the concentrations of all proteins of the glucose PTS on its phosphorylation activity in vitro has been investigated experimentally by performing a PTS activity assay with different amounts of cell extract (11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We mimicked these experiments by numerical simulation (Fig. 2). As was observed experimentally (Figs. 1 and 2 in Ref. 11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the dependence of the flux on total protein concentration was more than linear but less than quadratic (Fig. 2 a). Accordingly, the combined PTS flux response coefficient ( RPTS J ) decreased from almost 2 to around 1.7 as the protein concentration was increased from low values to 6 mg/ml (Fig. 2 b).Figure 2Dependence of the calculated PTS fluxin vitro on the total protein concentration when increasing all PTS proteins and PEP together. Simulations were performed with the kinetic parameters in vitro of Table I. The concentrations of the PTS proteins for a certain protein concentration were calculated by assuming a total intracellular protein concentration of 0.25 g/ml, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentration of PEP in mm was set to twice the protein concentration in mg/ml, corresponding to the experiments in Ref. 11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar. The addition of the macromolecular crowding agent PEG 6000 to the assay mixture was simulated by increasing the rate constants that lead to complex formation between proteins by a factor α and decreasing the rate constants of protein-protein complex dissociation by the same factor α (see also Ref. 11Rohwer J.M.

The rate constants for interactions between a protein and a boundary metabolite were left unchanged. Thus, k 3,k −4, k 7, andk −8 were multiplied by α, andk −3, k 4,k −7, and k 8were divided by α. The flux J (a) and the combined flux response coefficient of EI, HPr, IIAGlc, and IICBGlc ( RPTS J ) (b) are shown as a function of protein concentration for α = 1, 4, and 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In previous experiments, the macromolecular crowding agent PEG 6000 (37Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 38Garner M.M. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C877-C892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been added to a PTS activity assay to mimic high intracellular macromolecule concentrations, and its effect was simulated with a simple kinetic model (11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We now proceeded to model macromolecular crowding with the complete model of the PTS by following a similar approach as in Ref. 11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar; the addition of PEG 6000 to the assay mixture was assumed to increase the on-rate constants for complex formation between the proteins and decrease the off-rate constants for complex dissociation by the same factor, α. Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 1, a and b, in Ref. 11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, we see that the model agreed well with the experimental results; the addition of 9% PEG 6000 (simulated by α = 7) stimulated the flux slightly at low protein concentrations and inhibited the flux at higher protein concentrations. A lower concentration (4.5%) of PEG 6000 (simulated by α = 4) stimulated the flux over the whole range of protein concentrations. As was the case with PEG 6000 addition experimentally, the combined flux response coefficientR PTS J decreased more sharply in the model when the parameter α was increased (Fig.2 b); the decrease was sharper for 9% PEG 6000 and α = 7 than for 4.5% PEG 6000 and α = 4.Metabolic control analysis of group transfer pathways has provided us with an analytical proof that the sum of the flux response coefficients of the proteins in a group transfer pathway can range from below 1 to 2 (12Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 256-274Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that values closer to 1 can result from increased complex formation between the proteins or a protein and a boundary metabolite. The absence of these complexes, on the other hand, leads to a value of 2 for this sum (39van Dam K. van der Vlag J. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As has been pointed out under “Discussion” of Ref. 11Rohwer J.M. Postma P.W. Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10547-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, decreasing RPTS J values with increasing protein concentration suggest increased complex formation between the proteins of the PTS. We investigated this point further by calculating with the kinetic model, using parameter values simulatingin vivo and values simulating in vitro at protein concentrations of 2 and 6 mg/ml (Table I), the fraction of the different PTS proteins that was free (uncomplexed) and the fraction that was complexed with other proteins or boundary metabolites (TableIII). For each condition, the concentrations of all the species and their relative proportions are indicated. The kinetic parameters implied that the major fraction of the PTS proteins should exist in the complexed state in vivo(Table III). This was in accordance with the RPTS J value close to 1 (Table II). Simulating conditions in vitro showed that the fraction of the proteins that existed in the complexed state was much lower but increased significantly with an increase in the protein concentration from 2 to 6 mg/ml. We also verified that increasing the parameter α to mimic macromolecular crowding caused a further increase in the fraction of PTS proteins existing in the complexed state (data not shown).Table IIISimulated distribution of PTS protein species under different conditionsSpeciesIn vivoIn vitroConcentrationPercentage of total2 mg of protein/ml6 mg of protein/mlConcentrationPercentage of totalConcentrationPercentage of totalμm%nm%nm%EI species EI · P · Pyr3.161.00.120.30.90.7 EI0.275.40.010.020.020.02 EI · P1.223.839.799.311898.3 EI · P · HPr0.499.80.160.41.21.0 Total EI5.010040100120100HPr species EI · P · HPr0.51.00.20.0410.1 HPr1.32.6276.8675.5 HPr · P3059.636490.9106989.1 HPr · P · IIAGlc1836.992.2635.2 Total HPr501004001001200100IIAGlc species HPr · P · IIAGlc1846.292.8636.6 IIAGlc0.61.6268.2636.6 IIAGlc · P1538.528087.479883.1 IIAGlc · P · IICBGlc5.513.751.6373.8 Total IIAGlc40100320100960100IICBGlc species IIAGlc · P · IICBGlc5.554.75.16.33715.2 IICBGlc1.414.17290.218376.4 IICBGlc · P0.11.20.010.010.040.02 IICBGlc · P · MeGlc3.029.92.83.5208.4 Total IICBGlc1010080100240100Proteins in complexes63410Proteins uncomplexed379690Steady-state calculations were performed with the parameters of Table Ifor conditions in vivo and two protein concentrationsin vitro. Open table in a new tab Parameter Sensitivity AnalysisOf course, the kinetic parameters used in the derivation of the rate constants (see “”) were subject to experimental variability. In addition, insufficient data were available in some cases to calculate the rate constants from the kinetic parameters, and assumptions had to be made (e.g. Equation 21). To establish how strongly the behavior of the model depended on the choices for the kinetic parameters, the sensitivity of the steady-state flux under conditions in vivo to changes in these parameters was calculated as outlined under “.” The sensitivity of the calculated flux to an uncertainty in a parameter value is quantified by the corresponding response coefficient.The flux response coefficients of all model parameters (when simulating conditions in vivo) are listed in TableIV. In general, the flux response coefficients were small, indicating that the calculated flux did not depend crucially on the absolute magnitude of the chosen parameters, also when the reported literature values varied over a considerable range (e.g. K mPEP or Km HPr*). Notably, the parameters, the values of which had to be assumed altogether to solve for the rate constants of phosphotransfer reactions II–IV (K aII,K aIII, andK aIV), had low flux response coefficients, which precludes any unusually large uncertainty in the calculated flux. The only parameters with large flux response coefficients were Km IIAGlc·P*,k IV, K mGlc,k V, and [IICBGlc]total(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, and 0.9, respectively). This was not entirely unexpected for the following reasons. First, modulations in both Km IIAGlc·P* andk IV resulted in an equal relative change in the rate constant k 8 (Equation 40), and the flux control coefficient of reaction 8 (i.e. from IIAGlc · P · IICBGlc to IIAGlcand IICBGlc · P) in the model was high ( C8 J = 0.6); second, modulations in both K mGlc andk V"
https://openalex.org/W2008708118,"Pex5p is the receptor for the vast majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins. Here, we show that about 15% of rat liver Pex5p is found in the peroxisomal fraction representing 0.06% of total peroxisomal protein. This population of Pex5p displays all the characteristics of an intrinsic membrane protein. Protease protection assays indicate that this pool of Pex5p has domains exposed on both sides of the peroxisomal membrane. The strong interaction of Pex5p with the membrane of the organelle is not affected by mild protease treatment of intact organelles, conditions that result in the partial degradation of Pex13p. Cytosolic Pex5p is a monomeric protein. In contrast, virtually all peroxisomal Pex5p was found to be part of a stable 250-kDa protein assembly. This complex was isolated and shown to comprise just two subunits, Pex5p and Pex14p."

Lee N.H. Pellegrino S.M. Kerlavage A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 113-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These seven transmembrane (TM) proteins are capable of transducing messages as different as photons, organic odorants, nucleotides, nucleosides, peptides, lipids, and proteins. After ligand binding, GPCRs interact with a specific subset of heterotrimeric G-proteins that can in the activated forms inhibit or activate various effector enzymes and/or ion channels (2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). One subfamily of GPCRs has a large amino-terminal ectodomain containing leucine-rich repeats connected to the seven TM region. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) consist of the classic gonadotropin and thyrotropin (TSH) receptors (3Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

These gain-of-function receptor mutants not only allow the understanding of the etiology of different pathological states but also provide the unique opportunity to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which GPCRs are activated. The allosteric ternary complex model proposes the isomerization of GPCRs from an inactive to an active state capable of coupling to the G proteins (11Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This isomerization involves conformational changes that may occur spontaneously or be induced by agonists or appropriate mutations, which abrogate the normal constraining function of the receptor, allowing it to ‘relax’ into the active conformation. Although the majority of gain-of-function mutations in LH and TSH receptors, like most other GPCRs, are present in the TM region (9Laue L. Chan W.Y. Hsueh A.J. Kudo M. Hsu S.Y. Wu S.M. Blomberg L.

Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1431-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the ectodomain of the glycoprotein hormone receptors could constrain the TM region. Because the key serine residue in the hinge region between leucine-rich repeats and the TM region of the TSH receptor is conserved in the homologous LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors, we performed mutagenesis analysis to test the constitutive activation of LH and FSH receptors following serine substitutions. Taking advantage of the observation that the human LH receptor is more constrained than the TSH receptor, we further substituted Ser-277 of this receptor with all natural amino acids and demonstrated the importance of a nonpolar hydrophobic residue in this position for receptor activation. In addition, substitution of an angular proline immediately adjacent to Ser-277 with a flexible glycine but not a more rigid alanine also led to receptor activation. Purified human CG (hCG, CR-129) was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and human recombinant FSH (Org32489) was from Organon (Oss, The Netherlands). Anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody and FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma.125I-sodium iodine and myo-[3H]inositol were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis was performed to generate mutant LH and FSH receptor cDNAs as described previously (10Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol.

Polymerase chain reaction was performed with Vent DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. All cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and the plasmids were purified using the Maxi plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction products was confirmed by sequencing on both strands of the final constructs before use in expression studies. Human 293T cells derived from embryonic kidney fibroblast were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Before transfection, cells (2 × 106/culture) were seeded in 10-cm dishes (Nalge, Nunc International, Naperville, IL). When cells were 70–80% confluent, transient transfection was performed with 10 μg of plasmid using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) following replacement of culture medium. After 18–24 h of incubation with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates, medium was replaced with DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS), harvested from culture dishes, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells (2 × 105/ml) were placed on 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) and preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.25 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma) before treatment with or without hormones for 16 h. For studies using increasing amounts of plasmids, transfection was also performed in 12-well culture plates using calcium phosphate precipitation. Each well was transfected separately with different amounts of plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, each well was washed once with D-PBS, replaced with DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and incubated for 16 h. Total cAMP in each well was measured in triplicate by a specific radioimmunoassay as described previously (19Davoren J.B. Hsueh A.J. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 33: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For inositol phosphate (IP) measurement, transfected cells were labeled for 24 h with myo-[3H]inositol (4 μCi/ml) in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in a 10-cm dish. After washing cells three times with D-PBS, 2 × 105 cells were preincubated for 30 min in D-PBS containing 20 mmLiCl, and treated with or without hormones at 37 °C for 45 min. Total IPs were extracted and separated as described previously (20Hirsch B. Kudo M. Naro F. Conti M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1127-1137PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times using cells from independent transfections. To monitor transfection efficiency, 0.5 μg of the Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase (RSV·β-gal) plasmid (21Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar) was routinely included in the transfection mixture, and β-galactosidase activity in cell lysate was measured as described previously (22Su J.G. Hsueh A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Human CG (CR-129) and recombinant human FSH were iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method (23Miyachi Y. Vaitukaitis J.L. Nieschlag E. Lipsett M.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1972; 34: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and characterized by radioligand receptor assay using recombinant human LH or FSH receptors expressed in 293T cells. Specific activity and maximal binding of the labeled hCG was 150,000 cpm/ng and 30%, respectively. These values for labeled FSH were 220,000 cpm/ng and 15%, respectively. To estimate ligand binding to the cell surface, transfected cells were washed two times with D-PBS and collected in D-PBS before centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in D-PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (binding assay buffer). Resuspended cells (2 × 105/tube) were incubated with increasing doses or a saturating dose of 125I-hCG or 125I-FSH at room temperature for 22 h in the presence or absence of unlabeled hCG (Pregnyl, Organon, 100 IU/tube) or FSH (Pergonal, Organon, 50 IU/tube), respectively. At the end of the incubation, cells were centrifuged and washed twice with the binding assay buffer. Radioactivity in the pellets was determined in a gamma spectrometer. Data from saturation binding studies were used to derive equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values based on Scatchard plot analysis. In addition to multiple gain-of-function mutations found in the TM regions of LH or TSH receptors, recent studies further indicated that replacement of Ser-281 in the human TSH receptor with isoleucine, threonine, or asparagine is associated with constitutive activation of the receptor, thereby leading to nonimmune hyperthyroidism (14Kopp P.

As shown in Fig.1 A, this serine is situated in a stretch of residues (YPSHCCAF XN) conserved in all three glycoprotein hormone receptors. This conserved region is present in the hinge between the nine leucine-rich repeats in the ectodomain and the seven TM bundles (Fig. 1 B); the corresponding positions for Ser-281 in the TSH receptor are Ser-277 for the LH receptor and Ser-273 for the FSH receptor, respectively. Based on observed structural conservation, we mutated Ser-277 and Ser-273 in the LH and FSH receptors, respectively, to test for possible constitutive activation of these homologous receptors. As shown in Fig.2 A, transfection of 293T cells with increasing amounts of plasmid encoding the S277I LH receptor mutant but not the wild-type receptor led to dose-dependent increases in basal cAMP production. As expected, transfection with plasmids encoding another mutant LH receptor (D564G) known to have constitutive activity (10Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) also led to increases in basal cAMP production. Furthermore, treatment with increasing doses of hCG further increased cAMP production by both the wild-type LH receptor and the D564G mutant but was minimally effective on the highly activated S277I mutant (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 C and Table I, Scatchard plot analysis further demonstrated that the S277I LH receptor, like the D564G mutant, showed increased ligand-binding affinity.Table IEquilibrium dissociation constants (K d), maximal binding, and basal and maximal cAMP production for wild-type and mutant LH receptorsKdMaximal bindingcAMP productionBasalMaximalpmng/2 × 10 5 cellpmol/ng hCG bindingLHR wild type164.1 ± 15.02.13 ± 0.562.6 ± 0.2208.2 ± 2.1LHR S277A122.9 ± 12.61.48 ± 0.404.1 ± 0.3389.9 ± 8.7LHR S277H118.9 ± 17.81.55 ± 0.388.6 ± 0.3268.0 ± 9.3LHR S277Y118.9 ± 3.91.51 ± 0.3612.6 ± 0.2438.7 ± 70.8LHR S277F34.1 ± 6.91-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.65 ± 0.1526.9 ± 1.4463.0 ± 22.2LHR S277C35.9 ± 8.71-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.46 ± 0.1149.5 ± 1.1608.3 ± 28.8LHR S277T53.3 ± 7.41-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.88 ± 0.2051.7 ± 1.5460.7 ± 66.8LHR S277W37.0 ± 4.21-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.56 ± 0.1274.2 ± 3.0436.2 ± 24.9LHR S277G41.1 ± 9.91-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.49 ± 0.1279.4 ± 2.3721.5 ± 63.0LHR S277E27.4 ± 6.51-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.76 ± 0.19108.2 ± 4.6349.3 ± 14.5LHR S277Q38.2 ± 5.71-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).1.11 ± 0.29138.8 ± 0.8825.0 ± 75.3LHR S277N41.2 ± 10.51-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.66 ± 0.16182.0 ± 10.6897.3 ± 39.0LHR S277P45.5 ± 2.81-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.44 ± 0.11182.4 ± 13.5869.8 ± 56.0LHR S277I41.8 ± 1.71-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.66 ± 0.16513.4 ± 33.4455.4 ± 31.6LHR S277M46.9 ± 4.01-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.28 ± 0.07712.2 ± 41.91166.8 ± 51.3LHR S277V19.0 ± 5.01-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.75 ± 0.18846.1 ± 75.4629.0 ± 40.7LHR S277L55.5 ± 26.00.08 ± 0.021755.1 ± 125.12513.8 ± 126.9LHR P276G53.7 ± 6.91-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.41 ± 0.10457.8 ± 30.41409.3 ± 48.1LHR P276A56.9 ± 12.81-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.59 ± 0.1416.3 ± 0.7956.7 ± 60.5LHR D564G45.4 ± 3.81-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).0.57 ± 0.13225.9 ± 8.2471.6 ± 11.7LHR D578Y93.0 ± 4.51-aSignificantly different from the wild-type receptor in Kd values (p < 0.05).1.21 ± 0.29196.9 ± 11.2236.2 ± 17.3Data are shown as mean ± S.D.

We further monitored cAMP production in cells transfected with plasmids encoding the wild-type FSH receptor or the FSH receptor hinge mutant. As shown in Fig. 2 D, basal cAMP production was increased in cells that expressed increasing amounts of the S273I FSH receptor mutant but not the wild-type receptor. Also, treatment with increasing doses of FSH further stimulated cAMP mediated by either the wild-type or mutant FSH receptor (Fig. 2 E). Similar to the LH receptor mutants, Scatchard plot analysis indicated that the mutant FSH receptor exhibited increased affinity to its ligand as reflected by a decrease in the Kd value (Fig. 2 F,Kd values: wild-type receptor, 666 pm; S273I mutant, 71 pm). To elucidate the molecular basis of the constitutive activation of the LH receptor at residue 277, random mutagenesis was performed to change Ser-277 to each of all natural amino acids or to delete Ser-277. The deletion of Ser-277 or its substitution into charged Arg, Lys, or Asp resulted in defective expression of these mutants as reflected by negligible125I-hCG binding and the lack of cAMP production in response to hCG by transfected cells. However, the remaining 16 mutants showed varying degrees of constitutive activation based on basal cAMP production by cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding each mutant construct (Fig. 3 A). To correct for varying levels of receptor expression, the cAMP results were normalized based on cell surface 125I-hCG binding. When challenged with a saturating dose (100 ng/ml) of hCG, all but two highly constitutively activated mutant receptors (S277V and S277I) showed further increases in cAMP production (Fig. 3 B). With the exception of the four most active mutants (S227L, S277V, S277M, and S277I), these mutant receptors showed maximal cAMP production within 2- to 3-fold of the levels found for the wild-type LH receptor. As shown in Table I, most mutant receptors also showed increased binding affinity to the hCG ligand as reflected by decreases in their Kd values. We plotted the degree of constitutive activation of different LH receptor mutants in relation to the hydropathy index (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) of the individual amino acid residue that was replaced. As shown in Fig.3 C, four mutants with a substitution of Ser-277 by residues with the highest hydropathy values (Leu, Val, Met, Ile) also showed the highest constitutive activity. We further subgrouped the receptor mutants into six categories based on a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis (25Hellberg S. Sjostrom M. Skagerberg B. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) of the substituted residue. The variation in individual amino acid residue is described by three principal properties, z1, z2, and z3, derived from a principal component analysis of a matrix of 29 physicochemical variables for all amino acids. Again, the four mutants with highest basal cAMP production belonged to the same category. Secondary structure analysis (26Garnier J. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) of the hinge region of the LH receptor indicated that the conserved YPSHCCAF region is situated in a structure bend contributed by proline and is preceded by an α-helix and followed by a β-sheet structure. We, therefore, tested whether replacement of the more fixed Pro-276 by a flexible glycine could lead to constitutive activation of the LH receptor. As shown in Fig.4 A, the P276G mutant showed increases in basal cAMP production comparable with that of the S277I mutant. In addition, the P276G mutant showed a higher affinity to hCG (Fig. 4 B and Table I). We further tested whether replacement of Pro-276 with alanine to allow the continuation of the α-helical structure could alter receptor function. As shown in Fig.4 A, P276A substitution only led to minimal increases in basal cAMP production. However, the agonist affinity for this mutant was increased as compared with the wild-type LH receptor (Fig.4 B and Table I). Earlier studies have indicated that treatment of wild-type LH receptors with LH/hCG led to increases in PI turnover, whereas some mutant LH receptors are also associated with increases in basal PI turnover (20Hirsch B. Kudo M. Naro F. Conti M. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1127-1137PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kosugi S. Mori T. Shenker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31813-31817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Gilchrist R.L. Ryu K.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19283-19287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We further tested whether point mutations in the hinge region of the LH receptor are associated with increases in basal PI turnover in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment with hCG led to time-dependent increases in PI turnover in cells expressing wild-type LH receptors or three different mutants (S277I, P276G, or D578Y). In contrast, basal levels of PI turnover were not different between wild-type and mutant receptors, suggesting a preferential activation of the protein kinase A pathway by these mutants. Likewise, basal IP turnover was found to be comparable between the wild-type FSH receptor and the S273I mutant with -fold increases (0 versus 45 min of incubation) of 1.84 ± 0.10 and 1.68 ± 0.09, respectively. Pathological studies in patients provided unique opportunities to investigate the molecular mechanisms of glycoprotein hormone receptor activation. Based on findings of gain-of-function mutants found in the hinge region of TSH receptors in hyperthyroid patients, we have established the importance of this region in the maintenance of an inactive conformation in all three glycoprotein hormone receptors for Gs coupling but not for IP turnover. For the LH receptor, substitution of Ser-277 with a subgroup of hydrophobic residues confers a constitutively active phenotype together with higher agonist-binding affinity. In addition, replacement of the neighboring Pro-276 to a flexible glycine also led to receptor activation. These findings highlight the importance of the hinge region in the maintenance of an inactive protein conformation in this subgroup of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors. It is likely that agonist binding, like hinge region mutations, could lead to changes in receptor conformation important for Gs activation. The observed constitutive activity of various gain-of-function mutants of the LH receptor is closely related to their increased binding affinity to the labeled hCG ligand. Increased agonist-binding affinity is a common observation for constitutively activated GPCRs (29Ren Q. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16483-16487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because Ser-277 is not situated within the leucine-rich repeats of the LH receptor that are postulated to be important for ligand binding, the observed enhancement in agonist binding likely reflects a conformational shift of the mutant receptor toward a more active state. Furthermore, substitution of an angular proline residue adjacent to Ser-277 of the LH receptor to a flexible glycine also led to constitutive receptor activation and higher agonist affinity, further confirming the importance of the conformation of the hinge region in the activation of the glycoprotein hormone receptors. It is also interesting to note that observed increases in basal cAMP production mediated by different LH and FSH receptor mutants were not accompanied by increases in PI turnover, consistent with an earlier report demonstrating that the activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C by these receptors is mediated through different receptor conformational states (28Gilchrist R.L. Ryu K.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19283-19287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Ser-277 to all possible natural amino acids further indicated that the most active gain-of-function mutants belong to the same subgroup of amino acids with similar properties based on QSAR analysis (25Hellberg S. Sjostrom M. Skagerberg B. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In this analysis, the variation in individual amino acid residue was described by three principal properties, z1, z2, and z3, derived from a principal components analysis of a matrix of 29 physicochemical variables for all amino acids. z1 is mainly related to hydrophilicity, z2 is additionally influenced by size and some hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity scales, and z3 contains information from the analysis of p Ka , pI, and 1H NMR values. A similar approach has been used to analyze the role of an aspartate residue in the conserved (E/D)RY sequence for the activation of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (32Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Among the three glycoprotein hormone receptors, we selected the LH receptor for extensive mutagenesis analysis based on its unique activation property. As reported earlier (33Cetani F. Tonacchera M. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the unliganded TSH receptor is less constrained than its homologs and more susceptible to activation by a wide spectrum of mutations. Following overexpression in transfected mammalian cells, the wild-type TSH (but not LH) receptor showed constitutive activity, thus rendering it difficult to analyze minimally active TSH receptor mutants. In contrast, the FSH receptor appears to be highly constrained. Although gain-of-function mutations have been found in patients for both TSH and LH receptors, few cases of constitutively activated mutations were identified for the FSH receptor. Indeed, studies using chimeric LH/FSH receptors have indicated that interactions between TM V and VI of the FSH receptor maintain this receptor in a more constrained state (10Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the hinge region mutation (S273I) in the FSH receptor does lead to constitutive activation; however, the basal cAMP production of the FSH receptor mutant is lower than that of the comparable mutation in the homologous LH receptor. Although LH receptor mutants with Ser-277 substituted by Leu, Val, Met, or Ile residues showed the highest constitutive activity, it is interesting to note that only the Ser to Ile mutation of the TSH receptor was found in patients with toxic thyroid nodules. This is probably because of the fact that only one nucleotide alteration is involved for the Ser to Ile codon switch whereas substitution to the remaining three residues involves two nucleotide changes. Based on studies on LH receptor mutants, it is possible that additional gain-of-function mutations with substitution of these hydrophobic residues could be identified in the future in hyperthyroid patients. Although LH receptor mutations found in patients with male-limited precocious puberty have only been localized to the TM region, it is also of interest to screen for gain-of-function mutations in the hinge region of the LH receptor gene. The GPCRs usually exist in an inactive state in the absence of ligands whereas ligand binding converts the receptor into an active conformation capable of coupling to the G protein. In the “allosteric ternary complex model,” this isomerization of receptor proteins involves conformational changes that may occur spontaneously or be induced by agonists or appropriate mutations that abrogate the normal constraining function of the receptor, allowing it to relax into the active conformation (34Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It appears that at least three regions are important to maintain the LH receptor in an inactive state. Earlier studies analyzed two prominent LH receptor point mutations in greater detail. The Asp-578 side chain in the TM VI serves as a properly positioned hydrogen bond acceptor that is important for stabilizing the inactive state of the LH receptor. A bulky aromatic side chain at this position rather than the negative charge destabilizes the inactive receptor conformation (27Kosugi S. Mori T. Shenker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31813-31817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on the point mutant in Asp-546 of intracellular loop 3 indicated that a negative charge at this position might interact with an unidentified cationic residue to maintain receptor constraint (35Kosugi S. Mori T. Shenker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 894-901PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schulz A. Schoneberg T. Paschke R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The present study documents the amino-terminal hinge region as a third region important in maintaining all three glycoprotein hormone receptors in an inactive conformation. Most constitutively active mutants for GPCRs have been found in the TM domains or connecting loop sequences. To our knowledge, gain-of-function mutations in the amino-terminal sequences have only been observed in glycoprotein hormone receptors and calcium-sensing receptors (37Mancilla E.E. De Luca F. Baron J. Mol. Gen. Metab. 1998; 64: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unlike the majority of GPCRs, the mammalian LGR subfamily of proteins, including glycoprotein hormone receptors and the orphan LGR4 and LGR5, all have large ectodomain-containing leucine-rich repeats presumably important for ligand binding. Of interest, a conserved hinge region between the leucine-rich repeats and the TM domain is also found in the only LGR identified in the completely sequenced genome of Caenorhabditis elegans. Although the nematode LGR showed constitutive activity, its TM region is mainly responsible for its activation (38Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conserved serine found in the hinge region of mammalian glycoprotein hormone receptors (YPSHCCAF) is substituted by a histidine in the worm receptor; however, similar substitution in the LH receptor did not lead to increases in basal cAMP production (Fig. 3 A). It is interesting to note that the hinge region of two other known LGRs from lower species (fly LGR, HSFHCCAF; sea anemone LGR, NGFLCCEF) (39Hauser F. Nothacker H.P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1002-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 40Nothacker H.P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the two mammalian orphan LGRs (LGR4, YAYQCCAF; LGR5, YAYQCCAF) (4Hsu S.Y. Liang S.G. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1830-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are not conserved despite the preservation of two downstream cysteine residues. Future studies are needed to investigate the importance of the hinge region for the activation of these LGRs. At least three different but nonexclusive models could explain the activation of glycoprotein hormone receptors. First, based on studies on hinge mutants of gonadotropin receptors (present study) and the TSH receptor (15Duprez L. Parma J. Costagliola S. Hermans J. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), one can propose that the large ectodomain of these proteins directly constrains the TM region, whereas ligand binding or hinge mutations relax the receptor (Fig.6, R to R*). An earlier study proposed that the ectodomain of the LH receptor makes several contacts with the TM domain (41Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the curved portion of the U- or J-shaped ectodomain of the receptor leads to steric influences on the distances between the “arms” of the ectodomain of the receptor. Although the exact contact sites between the ectodomain and the TM region are still unclear, key residues in exoloops 2 and 3 have been shown to be involved in the modulation of ligand binding by the ectodomain of the LH and FSH receptor, respectively (42Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C.S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28953-28958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is likely that ligand binding to the leucine-rich repeats in the ectodomain leads to conformational alterations in the hinge region, followed by the relaxation of the TM bundles leading to Gs activation. Second, in the “two-step activation” model (44Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. el Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), agonist binding to the ectodomain brings the hormone close to the TM region. After binding mediated by the hormone-specific β-subunit, the common α-subunit directly interacts with the TM domain (45Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 46Kajava A.V. Vassart G. Wodak S.J.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), leading to signal transduction (Fig. 6, AR*). This model is supported by the findings that a mutant LH receptor containing mainly the TM region can mediate hCG stimulation of signal transduction at extremely high ligand concentrations (48Ji I.H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13076-13079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ji I. Ji T.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2648-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Modifications at key residues of the α-subunit of hCG (50Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the first extracellular loop of the LH receptor also suggest direct counterionic interactions between the α-subunit of hCG and the receptor. Although this model does not take into account the hinge region in receptor activation, hinge mutations could independently cause conformational changes in the receptor resembling those induced by the α-subunit following its interaction with the TM bundles. For several LH hinge mutants with the highest constitutive activity (Fig. 3), hCG treatment did not lead to further increases in cAMP production. In addition, basal cAMP production produced by these mutants is higher than the maximal cAMP production following ligand stimulation of the wild-type LH receptor. For the more constrained FSH receptor, point mutation in the hinge region is less effective in inducing constitutive activation, thus allowing further increases in cAMP production induced by FSH. Thus, ligand interaction with the TM region could be important in eliciting and maintaining full signal transduction by the FSH receptor. Finally, several studies have suggested the importance of receptor dimerization or oligomerization in the signal transduction of different GPCRs (52Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), including the LH receptor (53Dufau M.L. Minegishi T. Buczko E.S. Delgado C.J. Zhang R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 54Grewal N. Nagpal S. Chavali G.B. Majumdar S.S. Pal R. Salunke D.M. Biophys.

A. 1983; 80: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ligand binding could confer a conformation that allows the receptors to form dimers. For the LH receptor hinge mutants, one could speculate that substitution of the conserved serine by hydrophobic residues also facilitates receptor dimerization. Future studies on the hinge region of the glycoprotein hormone receptors could elucidate their ligand signaling mechanisms and allow the design of small molecular weight molecules capable of modifying the conformation of these constrained proteins.

Excretion involves at least two steps as follows: uptake of the organic substance into the cell over the basolateral membrane and extrusion via the luminal membrane (1Ullrich K.J. J. Membr.

The cloning of the organic cation transporter 1 from rat kidney (rOCT1)1 (3Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) was followed by subsequent cloning of many more transporters belonging to the OCT1 family (for reviews see Refs. 2Koepsell H.

This opened the possibility to identify the molecular entities responsible for excretion. For organic cation transporters it proved more difficult than expected to assign to each cloned transporter the cellular function it might fulfill physiologically. Agreement exists that organic cations are taken up by renal cells via a voltage-sensitive pathway and are excreted by a voltage-insensitive organic cation/proton exchange or by the ATP-powered multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (2Koepsell H.

It was proposed by several groups, e.g. that OCT2 serves to take up organic cations, like choline and TEA, at the basolateral cell side (11Urakami Y. Okuda M. Masuda S. Saito H. Inui K.I. J.

Saito H. Inui K.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 800-805PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of rOCT1 and the closely related rOCT2 were proposed to consist of 12 transmembrane segments (TM1—TM12) with a large extracellular loop between TM1 and TM2, a large cytoplasmic loop with consensus sites for protein kinases between TM6 and TM7, and the N- and C-terminal ends on the cytoplasmic side (3Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of organic cation transport by these recently cloned transporters is far from understood. So far, cloned organic cation transporters were studied, after heterologous expression, in oocytes with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique or by tracer flux measurements in oocytes or cultured cells. To get more detailed information we applied the giant patch technique (17Hilgemann D.W. Pfluegers Arch. 1989; 415: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Hilgemann D.W. Lu C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) which allows us to measure electrical current under defined ionic conditions on both sides of the membrane. Choline chloride, tetramethylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium chloride, Hepes, EGTA, and reduced glutathione were obtained from Sigma. Quinine hydrochloride dihydrate, Me2SO, and d-sorbitol were obtained from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), and NMG, HCl, and NaOH were obtained from Merck. MgCl2 was purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Tricaine was purchased from Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland). Collagenase A was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Xenopus laevis were anesthetized with 2 g/liter tricaine, and parts from ovaries were removed. Oocytes were separated by incubation for 2–3 h in modified Ringer's solution, containing 1–2 mg/ml collagenase A. Prophase-arrested oocytes of stages V and VI (19Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) were selected for injection of rOCT2 cRNA. rOCT2 cDNA cloned in the pOG2 vector was linearized with NotI. The cRNA was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase, and oocytes were injected with 15–25 ng of cRNA as described before (3Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The oocytes were incubated for 4–7 days at 16 °C in modified Ringer's solution containing 9.5 mg/liter penicillin and 10 mg/liter streptomycin. For storing the oocytes a modified oocyte Ringer's solution was used: 5 mm Hepes, 110 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6. For patch experiments, pipette and bath solutions based on sorbitol or NMG-Cl were used. Sorbitol supported tight seal formation and did not interact with rOCT2. However, addition of high amounts of charged substrates like choline chloride raised the ionic strength of the solution and thus led to increased conductivity in patches from control oocytes. Therefore, in experiments with high organic cation concentrations,e.g. in Fig. 4 A, solutions based on NMG were used. In these solutions, iso-osmolar exchange of NMG against other organic cations diminished the effects on conductivity in control oocytes, but inhibition with quinine revealed NMG-induced currents in rOCT2 cDNA-injected oocytes with a magnitude of maximal 15% (for 112 mm NMG) of the current induced by 5 mmcholine. The K0.5 (apparent binding constant) was estimated to be higher than 300 mm. Although NMG is likely to be transported by rOCT2, the effect was negligible in the performed experiments. Pipette solution based on NMG is as follows: 100 mm NMG, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (HCl). Bath solution based on NMG is as follows: 62.5–112.5 mm NMG, 0–50 mm substrate as chloride salt, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, 2.5 mmglutathione, pH 7.4 (HCl). Pipette solution based on sorbitol is as follows: 190 mm sorbitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm BaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (NaOH). Bath solution based on sorbitol is as follows: 170 mm sorbitol, 22.6 mm NMG, 0–20 mm substrate as chloride salt, 2 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (HCl). Pipette and bath solution based on sorbitol for measurements with choline chloride in the pipette is as follows: 170 mmsorbitol, 0–20 mm choline chloride or TMA chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (NaOH). Immediately before an experiment the oocyte vitelline membrane was removed using sharpened watchmaker's forceps (20Weinreich F. Wood P.G. Riordan J.R. Nagel G. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The devitellinated oocyte was placed in a small Petri dish (35 mm), which was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 25, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For a detailed description of the setup see Ref. 21Friedrich T. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2486-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. Borosilicate glass micropipettes, pulled out in two steps to a tip diameter of 20–30 μm with a PP-83 glass microelectrode puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab., Tokyo, Japan), were used for excising giant membrane patches. The pipettes were filled with pipette solutions based on sorbitol or NMG, depending on the experiment. The pipette was mounted on a MM-203 micromanipulator (Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab., Tokyo, Japan) and attached to the plasma membrane. By gentle suction (2–6 mm H2O) Giga-seals with 1–10 GΩ seal resistance formed within 3–10 min. Membrane patches in inside-out configuration could be excised by pulling the pipette away from the oocyte. After transferring the pipette into a polyethylene chamber the inside-out patch was then accessible from the cytoplasmic side for the perfused bath solutions (exchange time 1–3 s). The bath solutions were, like the pipette solutions, based on sorbitol or NMG-Cl. The substrates choline (0.2–50 mm) and TEA (0.05–20 mm) were added by equi-osmolar exchange with sorbitol or NMG; the inhibitor quinine was added from a 0.1 m stock solution in Me2SO, resulting in a maximal final Me2SO concentration of 0.1%. Me2SO in this concentration had no effect by itself on patch current. Modified electrical valves (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) were employed for solution switching. The electrical measurements were performed with an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–23 °C). The broken line in original recordings of Figs. 1, 4, and 8 indicates zero rOCT2-mediated current and is within a few pA close to absolute zero electrical current.Figure 8rOCT2-mediated inward current and current under conditions of organic cation exchange. A,the pipette was filled with solution containing 20 mmcholine (see “Materials and Methods”, “Solutions”), and the bath was superfused with 2 or 20 mm choline, 2 mm TEA, 100 μm quinine, or no substrate, and voltage pulses from −60 to 60 mV were applied after complete solution exchange (indicated by lowercase letters), see Fig.9 A. Under “symmetric” conditions, i.e. 20 mm choline in pipette and bath (see a andg), zero net current is observed (indicated by broken line). Complete removal of substrate from the bath leads to an inward-directed current (downward, see b and e). A pronounced “rundown” of inward current from b toe is observable. Superfusion with 2 mm choline (f) leads to a reduced inward current. Addition of 100 μm quinine (c) or 2 mm TEA (h) inhibits the inward current almost completely.B, an analogous experiment with 2 mm choline in the pipette. The bath was superfused with 1, 2, 5, or 20 mmcholine, 100 μm quinine, or no substrate. rOCT2-mediated currents are seen below(inward-directed) and above (outward-directed) thebroken line. Lowercase letters indicate application of voltage pulses, see Fig. 9 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Patch current was low-pass filtered (20 or 200 Hz) and continuously recorded on an analog chart recorder (Kipp & Zonen, Delft, The Netherlands) and on a personal computer using KAN1 software (MFK, Niedernhausen, Germany) with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. Outward (positive) current is defined according to the usual convention (22Hille B. Ionic Channels of Exitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), i.e. electrical current flowing in the direction of positive charges from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side of the membrane. For current-voltage relations alternating voltage jumps of 200 ms duration were applied in 20-mV steps from −60 mV to +60 mV. Current was filtered at 500 Hz and digitally recorded at a sampling rate of 1 kHz on a personal computer using ISO3 software (MFK, Niedernhausen, Germany). For analysis, the current evoked by each voltage jump was subtracted from a corresponding current before or after perfusion of substrate or inhibitor. Steady-state levels were evaluated by averaging the difference currents between 100 and 180 ms of the voltage jump. MICROCAL ORIGIN Version 5.0 was used for fitting the data on a personal computer. Electrogenic transport activity of rOCT2 was studied in giant plasma membrane patches from oocytes expressing rOCT2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.1 shows the effect on patch current upon applying the organic cations choline, TEA, or quinine from the cytoplasmic side. In patches from non-injected or water-injected (control) oocytes the effect of application of organic cations was indistinguishable from the normal current fluctuation (∼0.5 pA,n = 15), see Fig. 1 B. Patches from OCT2-expressing oocytes, however, showed a distinct outward current upon application of choline, TMA, or TEA that was inhibited by quinine or TBA, see Fig. 1, A and C, whereas quinine and TBA themselves evoked no change in patch current. Choline-induced outward currents that were analyzed in more detail ranged from several pA to maximally 30 pA at 0 mV. This amplitude is dependent on membrane patch size, degree of rOCT2 expression, and site of membrane patch excision on the oocyte. For comparison, oocytes expressing rOCT2 showed inward currents upon application of 5 mm choline at −40 mV of typically 100–400 nA (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that the choline-induced outward current became smaller during the course of a patch clamp experiment, a phenomenon frequently observed in excised patch experiments and often called rundown. The time constant of this rundown was variable, often in the range from 10 to 50 min. It had to be accounted for when determining constants for half-maximal activation of current by organic cations. Previous measurements with no direct access to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane already indicated that rOCT1 and rOCT2 may also mediate electrogenic efflux of substrates2 (9Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The organic cation-induced outward current in excised patches, see Fig. 1, confirmed these suggestions and allowed us to determine precisely theK0.5 for organic cations at the cytoplasmic side. Therefore we first measured at a membrane potential of 0 mV the outward current induced by different organic cation concentrations. Fig. 3 A summarizes experiments from six different membrane patches where different choline-induced currents were tested. The results could be well described by a simple Michaelis-Menten equation yielding a K0.5 of 2 mm choline at 0 mV. Similarly, the apparent affinity of the organic cation TEA to rOCT2 was tested. Electrogenic transport of TEA saturated at much lower concentrations, resulting in aK0.5 of ∼160 μm at 0 mV, see Fig. 3 B. Maximal TEA-induced outward current, however, reached only ∼50% of maximal choline-induced outward current, see Figs. 3 and 4 B. Next we tested the inhibition of choline-induced outward current by quinine. The beginning of the upper tracein Fig. 4 A shows the concentration dependence of choline-induced outward current (by application of 2, 10, and 50 mm choline), followed by application of 1 μmquinine at different choline concentrations. Obviously 1 μm quinine inhibits less at 50 mm choline than at 2 or 10 mm choline. A similar recording is shown in Fig. 4 B for TEA as transported organic cation. Here 1 μm quinine has virtually no effect at 20 mmTEA, whereas it inhibits TEA-induced outward current to about 50% at 0.1 mm TEA. These observations point to a competitive inhibition of choline- or TEA-induced outward current by quinine. Fig.5 shows Lineweaver-Burk plots for choline- and TEA-induced currents with and without 1 μmquinine, confirming competitive inhibition and yielding aKI (apparent inhibition constant) for quinine of ∼1 μm. In two-electrode voltage clamp experiments on rOCT2-expressing oocytes, however, non-competitive inhibition with a KI of ∼10 μm was found when quinine was applied externally at pH 7.4. 3T. Budiman and G. Nagel, unpublished data. This apparentKI value increased at lower pH and decreased at higher pH indicating membrane permeation of uncharged quinine and inhibition from the cytoplasmic side.3 The voltage dependence of outward currents induced by organic cations was studied by applying short (200 ms) pulses to different membrane potentials. Fig.6 shows as an example current traces in 40 mV steps in the presence (A) as well as in the absence (B) of organic cations in the bath solution. Fig.6 C shows the difference of these currents, i.e.the choline-induced currents at −60 to +60 mV. A nearly linear current-voltage relationship with positive slope was obtained, see Fig.7 A. To discern the influence of voltage on Imax (maximal turnover) andK0.5 we measured the voltage dependence of substrate-induced currents at variable concentrations of organic cations. Fig. 7 (B and C) demonstrates that bothImax and K0.5 are voltage-dependent.Figure 7Voltage dependence ofImax andK0.5. A, the experiment described in Fig. 6 was performed with different choline concentrations (2, 5, 10, and 20 mm choline (CH)), and the steady-state levels of the difference currents were plottedversus the membrane potential. Maximal currentImax (B) and apparent binding constant K0.5 (C) were calculated for each membrane potential by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the averaged data of three experiments (error bars, fitting error). Maximal currents were normalized to maximal currents at 0 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By loading the pipette with organic cations, we were able to demonstrate electrogenic inward current, induced by organic cations, see Fig.8 A. This inward current, induced by 20 mm choline in the pipette, was abolished by application of 20 mm choline to the bath solution,i.e. by eliminating the only driving force at 0 mV, the inward-directed concentration gradient. This interpretation is backed by the demonstration that the competitive inhibitor of outward current, quinine, leads to the same current level, see Fig. 8 A. This must mean that quinine is able to inhibit at the cytoplasmic side the inward-directed current of organic cations. Fig. 8 A also demonstrates the slow release of quinine from its binding site (time constant τ from 9 to 45 s) and a partial reduction of the (20 mm) choline-induced inward current by application of 2 mm choline to the cytoplasmic side. In the same fashion, inward current, induced by 2 mm choline in the pipette, was abolished by cytoplasmic application of 2 mm choline, see Fig. 8 B, to the bath. Establishing an inward-directed concentration gradient by application of 1 mm choline led to a small inward-directed current, whereas outward-directed concentration gradients induced outward-directed currents. The voltage dependence of the choline-induced inward current is shown in Fig.9 A for 20 mmcholine and in Fig. 9 B for 2 mm choline. Difference curves have a similar shape, caused by the voltage dependence of electrogenic inward transport of choline. The voltage dependence of this inward current mirrors the voltage dependence of outward current as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The complete inhibition of electrogenic inward current by cytoplasmic application of 100 μm quinine allowed us to test the current-voltage relationships for conditions with different concentrations of choline on both sides of the membrane (see Figs. 8 and 9). The observed relationships are all to a first approximation linear (in the range from −60 to +60 mV) and yield reversal potentials as expected from the Nernst equation. For example, the reversal potential for 20 mm external and 2 mm cytoplasmic choline is near +60 mV, see Fig. 9 A, whereas the reversal potential for 2 mm external and 20 mm cytoplasmic choline is near −60 mV, see Fig. 9 B. The reversal potentials for equal choline concentrations on both sides are at 0 mV, and the ones for less steep concentration gradients are at their expected positions. Table I lists the observed and from the Nernst equation the expected reversal potentials for different choline concentrations.Table IReversal potentials of the experiments in Fig. 9Choline gradient1-aPipette concentration [mm]: bath concentration [mm].Reversal potentialNernst potentialbCalculated for standard conditions (25 °C).mV20:200020:265602:20−60−602:5−25−242:2002:11518a Pipette concentration [mm]: bath concentration [mm].b Calculated for standard conditions (25 °C). Open table in a new tab Measuring the slopes of the current-voltage relationships led to an interesting observation. For 20 mm choline on both sides, the specific conductance of the difference current in Fig.9 A (squares) is with ∼75 pS clearly reduced when compared with the slope of the corresponding inward current under “zero-trans” conditions, 110 pS (filled circles). For 2 mm TEA at the cytoplasmic side (diamonds), the specific conductance is with ∼30 pS even more reduced. Under conditions of 2 mm choline on both sides, see Fig.9 B (triangles), the specific conductance is with 200 pS about 50% higher than the corresponding conductance for zero-trans conditions ((circles) 130 pS). Similar experiments were performed with 3 or 20 mm TMA in pipette and bath. The I/V (current-voltage relation) curves for inward and exchange current have similar shapes for TMA and choline (data not shown). This result has important consequences for the type of transport, as will be discussed below. After the first cloning of an organic cation transporter from rat kidney (3Grundemann D. Gorboulev V.

DNA Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To characterize in more detail the biophysical properties of organic cation transport, we chose to investigate rOCT2 in excised giant patches of plasma membrane from X. laevis oocytes because in our hands it showed the highest substrate-induced electrical current when measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. At present it is not known if this reflects the highest turnover rate or the highest expression in oocytes. rOCT2 mediated robust choline-induced currents, typically 100–400 nA inward current were induced by 5 mm choline at −40 mV in whole oocytes. Even though we used pipettes with diameters greater than 20 μm, choline-induced outward current in excised patches was small, typically 5–10 pA, and never exceeding 40 pA at 0 mV and 5 mmcholine. Also in the cases where we loaded the pipette with organic cations and measured inward current by inhibition of rOCT2 or by eliminating the inward-directed gradient, the magnitude of this inward current was in the same range. This low ratio of patch to whole oocyte current is not unexpected, however, considering the large surface area of oocytes and having found a similar ratio for bacteriorhodopsin expressed in oocytes (23Nagel G. Mockel B. Buldt G. Bamberg E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but underscores the need for high transporter density when attempting to measure transporters in excised membrane patches. Additional difficulty in studying rOCT2-mediated currents in excised patches emerged from the pronounced rundown of electrogenic transport activity with time. The underlying mechanism for this highly variable inactivation was not found. Dephosphorylation by membrane-bound phosphatases in oocytes as observed, e.g. for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (24Weinreich F. Riordan J.R. Nagel G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), seemed a possibility that was tested. In whole oocytes, however, we observed no effect of forskolin (known to increase cytoplasmic [cAMP]) on rOCT2, but fast inhibition by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (data not shown). Therefore we concluded that, at least in oocytes, rOCT2 activity is not modulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and that 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine is an inhibitor, mediating its effect by direct interaction with rOCT2. The observed outward currents, induced by organic cations, were not unexpected as it was already shown previously for rOCT1 (9Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that tracer efflux and electrical outward current, best explained by cation efflux, can be observed in OCT-expressing cells. It is, however, surprising for an “uptake system” that the apparent affinities at the cytoplasmic side for choline, TMA, and TEA are quite similar to the previously measured affinities at the extracellular side (7Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F890-F898PubMed Google Scholar, 11Urakami Y. Okuda M. Masuda S. Saito H. Inui K.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 800-805PubMed Google Scholar). We measured a K0.5 for TEA of 160 μmat 0 mV at the cytoplasmic side, whereas publishedK0.5 values at the extracellular side are in the range of 50–400 μm. This result is in agreement with the assumption that only membrane potential and concentration gradient,i.e. the electrochemical potential, of an organic cation, drive transport via rOCT2 and that this transport exhibits little rectification. Inhibition of organic cation transport by quinine was already shown in voltage-clamped oocytes for rOCT1 (9Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and rOCT22 (7Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F890-F898PubMed Google Scholar, 11Urakami Y. Okuda M. Masuda S. Saito H. Inui K.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 800-805PubMed Google Scholar), but it came as a surprise when we found that the affinity for quinine at the cytoplasmic side is even higher and that this inhibition is competitive. Whereas in whole oocytes inhibition of rOCT2 by quinine at the extracellular side has a KI of about 10 μm and is not competitive with transported substrates2,3 at neutral or elevated pH, we must infer from our experiments that quinine binds to a cytoplasmic substrate-binding site with a KI of about 1 μm, competitively with the substrates choline or TEA. These numbers make it unlikely that in our experiments quinine inhibits from the extracellular side after crossing the lipid bilayer in its uncharged form. Our observations, however, suggest the intriguing possibility that quinine inhibits from the cytoplasmic side also in experiments with whole oocytes, presumably by crossing the plasma membrane in its uncharged form. Experiments with TEA-induced currents in whole oocytes at different pH values confirmed this suspicion; at higher pH where more quinine exists in the uncharged form and more quinine is taken up by oocytes,2 the apparent KI for quinine inhibition appeared smaller, whereas at lower pH it increased.2,3 More details on the nature of inhibition by externally applied quinine can be found in a paper on specific substrates and inhibitors of rOCT1 and rOCT2.2 The current-voltage relationship of organic cation-induced outward current shows a positive slope in its voltage dependence. Such a voltage-dependent efflux of cations was already suggested for rOCT1 (9Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and rOCT22 by measuring outward current indirectly by subtracting electrical current of choline-incubated oocytes from quinine-inhibited current. A drawback of these measurements, however, was the lacking knowledge about the internal concentration of organic cations. Now we measure electrogenic organic cation efflux at different concentrations, and we show that even at saturating cation concentration outward current is slightly voltage-dependent. This indicates that a charge transfer step in the transport cycle is rate-limiting or the potential-dependent distribution between two states confers a voltage-dependent limiting rate in the transport cycle (25Läuger P. Electrogenic Ion Pumps. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar, 26Hansen U.-P. Gradmann D. Sanders D. Slayman C.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1981; 63: 165-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity for organic cations at the cytoplasmic binding site also shows a slight voltage dependence, indicating either a voltage drop across the cytoplasmic binding site (25Läuger P. Electrogenic Ion Pumps. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar) or a potential-dependent distribution between two states of the empty carrier. The determined voltage dependence of choline-induced outward currents at different non-saturating concentrations gives clear indication for the feasibility of choline efflux at physiological membrane potentials, provided the external concentration is low enough. With organic cations in the solution filling the pipette (external solution), it was possible to measure electrogenic cation influx. This current was visualized by inhibition of rOCT2 (by quinine) or by abolition of the concentration gradient. The magnitude of the inward current was in the same range as the outward current. The voltage dependence shows again a positive slope and seems very similar to electrogenic cation efflux. It confirms previously determined current-voltage relationships, determined with whole oocytes for rOCT1 (9Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and rOCT2.2 At least two mechanistic models can explain the obtained data. i) rOCT2 could be a channel for lipophilic cations allowing the passage of these cations without major conformational changes of the protein itself. ii) rOCT2 could be a transporter with a cyclic transport scheme where binding of the substrate is followed by a conformational change of the transporter, then release of the substrate to the other membrane side, and finally a conformational change of the unloaded transporter exposing the binding site back to the original membrane side, see Fig.10 B. The concentration dependence of the substrate-induced conductance might help to decide between these two models. Conductance from different patches cannot be directly compared, but the I/V values from different experiments can be normalized as in Fig. 10 A. Here the inward current induced by 2 mm choline extracellularly and no choline intracellularly was normalized to −0.5 at 0 mV according to an assumed extracellular K0.5 of 2 mm (confirmed in preliminary outside-out experiments). The corresponding I/V from the same patch under conditions of 2 mm choline on both sides was also plotted. The inward current induced by 20 mm choline extracellularly and no choline intracellularly from another experiment was normalized to −0.91 at 0 mV, again according to an assumed extracellularK0.5 of 2 mm. Now also in this case the corresponding I/V from the same patch under conditions of 20 mm choline on both sides could be plotted and compared with 2 mm choline on both sides. Obviously the conductance at 20 mm choline on both sides is smaller than at 2 mm choline on both sides (ANOVA test,p = 0.04). Such a decrease at high substrate concentrations was not observed so far for channels (22Hille B. Ionic Channels of Exitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Rather it was shown for many channels that single channel conductance saturates with increasing substrate concentration in a Michaelis-Menten-type fashion (22Hille B. Ionic Channels of Exitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). On theoretical grounds, such behavior is, however, possible for multiple substrates, bound in the channel (22Hille B. Ionic Channels of Exitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). A channel-like mechanism for organic cation transport by rOCT2 therefore cannot be excluded but seems rather improbable. The most straightforward explanation for the decrease in conductance at high substrate concentrations on both sides is therefore that rOCT2 is a transporter which, under symmetric conditions of nearly saturating concentrations of organic cations, transverses the membrane most of the time with a cation bound instead of as empty carrier, see Fig. 10 B. The ensuing organic cation exchange is then necessarily electroneutral. The small residual conductance results from the voltage dependence of the apparent binding constantK0.5. For infinite high substrate concentrations the expected conductance would therefore be zero. But for trans-zero conditions this demands a transfer step of the empty carrier-binding site from one side of the membrane to the other. It is quite probable that this transfer of the empty binding site involves a (partial) transfer of charge that will be compensated (or overcompensated) by binding of an organic cation. A similar mechanism was proposed, e.g. for the K+-translocating ATPase from Escherichia coli (27Fendler K. Drose S. Epstein W. Bamberg E. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For rOCT1 it was shown that Asp-475 in TM11 plays a crucial role in substrate binding (28Gorboulev V. Volk C. Arndt P. Akhoundova A. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the analogous aspartate is present also in rOCT2. Pre-steady-state substrate concentration step or voltage step experiments (29Fendler K. Grell E. Bamberg E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Friedrich T.

Nature. 1986; 323: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) might be able to identify charge translocation of the empty or loaded transporter. Our experiments with defined salt solutions on both sides of the membrane yielded the first insight into intracellular affinity for substrates and inhibitors of rOCT2. We confirmed earlier suggestions of electrogenic efflux of substrates, mediated by rOCT1 (9Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and rOCT2,2 even against an opposing membrane voltage. The exact substrate and voltage dependence of this electrogenic efflux, now at hand, should help to clarify the possible role of OCT2 in different organs and cells. Specifically, we confirm that OCT2 is perfectly suited for substrate uptake, driven by the electrochemical potential, i.e. membrane potential and concentration gradient. However, our results emphasize also that it may serve as an efficient efflux pathway, even at negative membrane potential, as long as the external concentration of the organic cation in question is low enough so that the electrochemical potential still provides a driving force for efflux, see reversal potentials for choline for example in Table I. However, there is no evidence that rOCT2 can transport organic cations against a concentration gradient as this is the case for the still unidentified luminal organic cation/proton exchanger (32David C. Rumrich G. Ullrich K.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 430: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our observation of decreased substrate-induced conductance at high concentrations of organic cations on both sides suggests that rOCT2 is a transporter that can engage in electroneutral cation exchange. Further experiments are needed to study the exact trans-stimulation of electroneutral efflux, preferably under voltage clamp conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2006882959,"The initiation of coagulation results from the activation of factor X by an enzyme complex (Xase) composed of the trypsin-like serine proteinase, factor VIIa, bound to tissue factor (TF) on phospholipid membranes. We have investigated the basis for the protein substrate specificity of Xase using TF reconstituted into vesicles of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, or pure phosphatidylcholine. We show that occupation of the active site of VIIa within Xase by a reversible inhibitor or an alternate peptidyl substrate is sufficient to exclude substrate interactions at the active site but does not alter the affinity of Xase for factor X. This is evident as classical competitive inhibition of peptidyl substrate cleavage but as classical noncompetitive inhibition of factor X activation by active site-directed ligands. This implies that the productive recognition of factor X by Xase arises from a multistep reaction requiring an initial interaction at sites on the enzyme complex distinct from the active site (exosites), followed by active site interactions and bond cleavage. Exosite interactions determine protein substrate affinity, whereas the second binding step influences the maximum catalytic rate for the reaction. We also show that competitive inhibition can be achieved by interfering with exosite binding using factor X derivatives that are expected to have limited or abrogated interactions with the active site of VIIa within Xase. Thus, substrate interactions at exosites, sites removed from the active site of VIIa within the enzyme complex, determine affinity and binding specificity in the productive recognition of factor X by the VIIa-TF complex. This may represent a prevalent strategy through which distinctive protein substrate specificities are achieved by the homologous enzymes of coagulation."

PKC-mediated phosphorylation of human (h) IP is a critical determinant of agonist-induced desensitization (Smyth, E. M., Hong Li, W., and FitzGerald, G. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 23258–23266). The regulatory events that follow desensitization are unclear. We have examined agonist-induced sequestration of hIP. Human IP, tagged at the N terminus with hemagglutinin (HA) and fused at the C terminus to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), was coupled to increased cAMP (EC50 = 0.39 ± 0.09 nm) and inositol phosphate (EC50 = 86.6 ± 18.3 nm) generation when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Iloprost-induced sequestration of HAhIP-GFP, followed in real time by confocal microscopy, was partially colocalized to clathrin-coated vesicles. Iloprost induced a time- and concentration-dependent loss of cell surface HA, indicating receptor internalization, which was prevented by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated trafficking and partially reduced by cotransfection of cells with a dynamin dominant negative mutant. Sequestration (EC50 = 27.6 ± 5.7 nm) was evident at those concentrations of iloprost that induce PKC-dependent desensitization. Neither the PKC inhibitor GF109203X nor mutation of Ser-328, the site for PKC phosphorylation, altered receptor sequestration indicating that, unlike desensitization, internalization is PKC-independent. Deletion of the C terminus prevented iloprost-induced internalization, demonstrating the critical nature of this region for sequestration. Internalization was unaltered by cotransfection of cells with G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK)-2, -3, -5, -6, arrestin-2, or an arrestin-2 dominant negative mutant, indicating that GRKs and arrestins do not play a role in hIP trafficking. The hIP is sequestered in response to agonist activation via a PKC-independent pathway that is distinct from desensitization. Trafficking is dependent on determinants located in the C terminus, is GRK/arrestin-independent, and proceeds in part via a dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated vesicular endocytotic pathway although other dynamin-independent pathways may also be involved.

However, the fate of the IP after those events is unclear. One possibility is that GRK-mediated phosphorylation would target the IP for binding by arrestin-like adapter proteins, which in turn might direct it toward sequestration in clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), where dephosphorylation would prepare the IP for recycling to the plasma membrane (32Ferguson S.S.G.

Whereas agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the human (h) IP primarily involves PKC in the desensitization process (25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

We provide evidence that the IP is indeed sequestered following desensitization but that this process occurs independent of both PKC and GRKs. Iloprost, the cAMP radioimmunoassay, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kits, as well as all radiochemicals, were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Convance (Princeton, NJ). Anti-clathrin and anti-caveolin-1 were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). pcDNA III was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego). Isobutylmethylxanthine, ATP, cAMP, GTP, alumina, and lysine were all purchased from Sigma. All cell culture reagents, G418, Albumax, and the PKC α-pseudosubstrate peptide were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. DOTAP, Fugene-6, Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets, and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. AG 1-X8 resin (formate form) and AG W-X4 resin (hydrogen form) were purchased from Bio-Rad. The hIP cDNA was generously donated by Dr. Kathleen Metters (Merck Sharp and Dohme). GRK2 (bovine), GRK3 (bovine), GRK5 (human), GRK6 (human), arrestin-2 (human), arrestin-2-(319–418) (human), and dynamin (human) cDNAs and antibodies to GRK2 and arrestin-2 were generous gifts from Dr. Jeffery Benovic (Jefferson University, Philadelphia). Oligonucleotides were from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the C-terminal end of the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hIP (HAhIP, see Ref. 25Smyth E.M.

The 3′-oligonucleotide (TTTGGATCCGCAGAGGGAGCAGGCGACGCT) contained a BamHI site and the coding sequence for the last seven amino acids of the hIP without the TGA stop codon. The 5′-oligonucleotide containing an internal hIP sequence included a unique EcoNI restriction site. These primers were used in a polymerase chain reaction using the hIP cDNA as a template (15Boie Y. Rushmore T.H. Darmon-Goodwin A. Grygorczyk R. Slipetz D.M. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12173-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product was digested withBamHI and EcoNI and ligated to theHindIII-EcoNI fragment from HAhIP to yield the full HAhIP coding sequence without a stop codon. This was ligated into the GFP-N3 mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to generate a plasmid that contained the HAhIP sequence upstream of, and in-frame with, the GFP coding sequence for expression of HAhIP-GFP. HEK 293 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection; Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm glutamine. All cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA III for transfection, unless otherwise indicated. For stable transfections cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and, the next day, transfected with 10 μg/dish DNA by liposome-mediated transfer (DOTAP) as described previously (25Smyth E.M.

For transient transfections, cells were grown to 60–80% confluence overnight and transfected with 10 μg/100-mm dish DNA by non-liposome-mediated transfer using Fugene6 at a ratio of 1:3 (μg DNA:μl Fugene6). Cells were plated at the time of transfection to multiwell or 60-mm dishes, as required, and assayed 48 h later. HEK transfected with HAhIP-GFP were observed by phase contrast microscopy under a green fluorescent lamp, under normal growth conditions. For confocal microscopy, cells were grown to ∼50% confluence in lysine-coated microwell dishes. Medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and GFP fluorescence was examined in real time by confocal microscopy. For colocalization experiments cells were preloaded with rhodamine-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 250 μg/ml, 60 min) and examined by confocal microscopy. Cells, grown to confluence in 24-well plates coated with lysine (0.1 mg/ml), were treated with iloprost (10 min at 37 °C). Reactions were terminated by aspiration, and cAMP was extracted with ice-cold 65% ethanol for 30 min. Samples were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay as described previously (25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Cells, grown to 70–80% confluence in 12-well plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml lysine, were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol in DMEM (without inositol) containing 0.5% albumax, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Thirty minutes prior to stimulation cells were treated with 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. After stimulation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by aspiration. Total inositol phosphates were extracted with 750 μl of 10 mm formic acid and recovered by anion exchange as described previously (25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23258-23266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris containing 3 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm ATP, 0.05 mm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 2.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine. Each reaction contained 1 unit of myokinase, 1 unit of pyruvate kinase, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol). Reactions were started by the addition of membranes (5 μg per assay tube) and, after 30 min at 30 °C, were quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 30,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP (41 Ci/mmol). Samples were subjected to sequential chromatography through Dowex (AG W-X4, hydrogen form) and alumina (WN-6, neutral).32P and 3H in the eluates were estimated by scintillation counting. PKC activity in total cellular lysates was determined by phosphorylation of the α-pseudosubstrate peptide. Cells in 6-well plates were lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture) by sonication. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 10 mmα-pseudosubstrate peptide, 25 mm ATP, and 7.5 mm magnesium acetate. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, 25 μl of each reaction was spotted onto Whatman PE-81 paper. The paper was washed three times with 0.1 m phosphoric acid and once with acetone and air-dried, and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. Cells were lysed (RIPA, 50 mmTris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 tablet/50 ml of Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture), drawn though a 23-gauge needle 6 times, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. Proteins were resolved on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Receptors were visualized by treating immunoblots, first blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature, with anti-HA (1:1500 dilution) or anti-GFP (1:1000 dilution), as appropriate. This was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by ECL. Surface HAhIP expression was measured by ELISA. Cells were seeded on 24-well dishes coated with lysine (0.1 mg/ml) and, 48 h later, treated with the agent of interest at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by aspiration and fixation (0.4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 4 °C, 10–15 min). Following 3 washes with PBS, cell monolayers were blocked (2% BSA in PBS, room temperature, 30 min) and HA expression quantified by incubation with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:1500 dilution in PBS) for 90 min at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed, following three washes with PBS, by incubation with alkaline peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution in PBS) for 30 min. Cell surface alkaline phosphatase was detected, after four washes with PBS, by following the conversion of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm. A background control in which anti-HA was not added was included in each plate and subtracted from the final absorbance measurements. Absorbance readings above background were negligible in vector control cells (data not shown) indicating that binding of the anti-HA antibody was specific for HAhIP. Data were compared by Student'st test or analysis of variance, followed by Dunnet's test, for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. We have described previously the generation of HEK cells lines that express a HA-tagged hIP (HAhIP-HEK, see Ref. 25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We generated a second HEK cell line expressing HAhIP to which GFP was fused at the C-terminal end (HAhIP-GFP-HEK) to follow the sequestration of hIP without the need for fixation of cells and treatment with antibodies. Lysates from transfected cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-GFP antibody. The HAhIP-GFP appeared as a broad complex with a molecular mass of 70–95 kDa (Fig.1 A), representing glycosylated HAhIP (44–60 kDa, see Ref. 25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) plus the 27-kDa green fluorescent protein fused to the C-terminal end. The identity of this species as HAhIP-GFP was confirmed in parallel immunoblots with anti-HA (Fig.1 A). When living cells were observed in culture under a green fluorescent protein lamp, HAhIP-GFP was localized to the plasma membranes (Fig. 1 B). GFP-vector control cells, in contrast, demonstrated the presence of a 27-kDa GFP band, by SDS-PAGE, and a diffuse cellular pattern of GFP expression in phase contrast micrographs. Treatment of HAhIP-GFP-HEK with the prostacyclin analog iloprost, for 10 min, induced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP (EC50 = 0.39 ± 0.09 nm, n = 3; Fig. 1 C) and inositol phosphate production (EC50 = 86.6 ± 18.3 nm, n = 4; Fig. 1 C) indicating coupling to the two signaling systems similar to that seen for HAhIP and the non-tagged receptor (25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to other studies (27Kallal J. Benovic J.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), addition of the GFP at the C-terminal end of HAhIP did not significantly alter the expression or signal transduction properties of the receptor. Treatment with iloprost induced a rapid sequestration of HAhIP-GFP from the cell membrane into the intracellular space. Internalization was evident after 5 min of agonist treatment and continued over a 45-min time course (Fig. 2 A), as observed by confocal microscopy. Sequestered HAhIP-GFP was partially localized to early endosomes, preloaded with rhodamine-conjugated transferrin (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that early HAhIP sequestration events may occur, at least in part, via a clathrin-coated vesicular endocytotic pathway. Iloprost-induced sequestration of HAhIP was quantified by ELISA. Treatment of HAhIP-HEK with iloprost induced a time- and dose-dependent loss of HA expression at the cell surface indicating internalization of the receptor. The time course for iloprost-induced HAhIP sequestration was similar to that seen in the confocal experiments; HAhIP sequestration was evident within the first 5–10 min of agonist (1 μm) treatment and reached a plateau within 30 min (Fig.3 A). Minimal sequestration was evident following treatment for 60 min with low (<10 nm) concentrations of iloprost (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, substantial (up to 50%) sequestration of HAhIP was evident at higher agonist concentrations (EC50 = 27.6 ± 5.7 nm, n = 7). These concentrations increase inositol phosphate generation and induce PKC-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of the HAhIP (25Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Smyth E.M. Li W.H. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Pretreatment of cells for 30 min with GF109203X inhibited iloprost-stimulated total PKC activity by approximately 60% (Fig. 4 A, inset). The residual kinase activity may be due to GF109203X-insensitive PKC isoforms or non-PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the α-pseudosubstrate peptide. We have demonstrated previously that the majority of rapid, iloprost-induced phosphorylation of HAhIP is inhibited by pretreatment of cells with GF109203X but not the PKA inhibitor H89 (25Smyth E.M.

In immunoassays, the core protein of NG2 binds specifically and saturably to plasminogen, which consists of five kringle domains and a serine protease domain, and to angiostatin, which contains plasminogen kringle domains 1–3. Apparent dissociation constants for these interactions range from 12 to 75 nm. Additional evidence for NG2 interaction with kringle domains comes from its binding to plasminogen kringle domain 4 and to miniplasminogen (kringle domain 5 plus the protease domain) with apparent dissociation constants in the 18–71 nm range. Inhibition of plasminogen and angiostatin binding to NG2 by 6-aminohexanoic acid suggests that lysine binding sites are involved in kringle interaction with NG2. The interaction of NG2 with plasminogen and angiostatin has very interesting functional consequences. 1) Soluble NG2 significantly enhances the activation of plasminogen by urokinase type plasminogen activator. 2) The antagonistic effect of angiostatin on endothelial cell proliferation is inhibited by soluble NG2. Both of these effects of NG2 should make the proteoglycan a positive regulator of the cell migration and proliferation required for angiogenesis.

The proteoglycan is expressed at high levels in immature vessels and then is down-regulated as the vessels mature (3Miller B. Sheppard A. Bicknese A. Perlman A. J. Comp.

In mature animals NG2 is once again up-regulated in the neovasculature that develops during tumor formation and wound healing (4Schlingemann R. Rietvold F. De Wall K. Ferrone S. Ruiter D. Am. J.

Although endothelial cells have been proposed as one source of NG2 expression in neovasculature (6Schrappe M. Klier F.G. Spiro R.C. Waltz T.A. Reisfeld R.A. Gladson C.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4986-4993PubMed Google Scholar), a more likely possibility is that the proteoglycan is expressed by the mesenchymal cell component of the vasculature in question: i.e. cardiomyocytes in the heart, smooth muscle cells in arteries (8Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and pericytes in microvessels (4Schlingemann R. Rietvold F. De Wall K. Ferrone S. Ruiter D. Am. J.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2869-2874PubMed Google Scholar).Current evidence suggests that NG2 may be important for controlling both the motility of cells and their responsiveness to growth factors. NG2 has been shown to bind directly to PDGF-AA1 and bFGF (9Goretzki L. Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16831-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and thus may serve to modulate the effects of these growth factors on their cell surface signaling receptors. For example, we have shown that the PDGF-α receptor is unresponsive to PDGF-AA in aortic smooth muscle cells derived from NG2-null mice, suggesting a role for NG2 in sequestering the growth factor or in presenting it to the signaling receptor (10Grako K.A. Ochiya T. Barritt D. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 905-915PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF and bFGF are both important angiogenic mitogens, so a role for NG2 in modulating the effects of the growth factors would be an important aspect of neovascularization.Cell motility is also an important factor during angiogenesis, because both endothelial cells and pericytes migrate rapidly to sites where capillary beds are expanding. As a membrane-spanning molecule, NG2 interacts with both extracellular and intracellular components and may be able to trigger cytoskeleton-dependent changes in cell morphology and motility in response to the extracellular environment. An association of NG2 with the cytoskeleton has been suggested by several distinct lines of investigation (11Lin X.H. Dahlin-Huppe K. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Lin X.H. Grako K.A. Burg M.A. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 79: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and evidence has been presented in support of the ability of NG2 to initiate changes in cell shape and migration that are dependent on the activation of Rho family GTPases (14Fang X.

The ability of type VI collagen to promote cell migration in an NG2-dependent fashion (19Burg M.A. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) is further evidence of the capacity of the proteoglycan to mediate cellular responses to the environment.NG2 is expressed by the majority of human melanoma cells and for this reason is also known as the human melanoma proteoglycan (15Eisenmann K.M. Simpson M. Keely P. Guan J. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L. Iida J McCarthy J.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Both the growth control and cell motility aspects of NG2 function can be seen in studies on melanoma progression. For example, we have shown that mouse melanomas expressing NG2 are both faster growing and more metastatic than their NG2-negative counterparts (20Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The motility of tumor cells involves not only their ability to adhere to and migrate on extracellular matrix components but also their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix using a number of different proteases (21Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 22Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 23Danø K.

Highly motile cells in normally developing tissues also utilize proteolysis as a tool for enhancing their migration. One proteolytic mechanism that is commonly used by both normal and neoplastic cells is the plasminogen system, wherein plasminogen is cleaved at the Arg561-Val562 peptide bond by the action of urokinase and tissue plasminogen activators to yield the proteolytically active two chain molecule plasmin (24Kwaan H.C.

Our curiosity has been heightened by the fact that plasminogen is also the precursor for another key player in angiogenic mechanisms, namely angiostatin. Full-length angiostatin, which comprises the first four kringle domains of plasminogen, is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth (31Ji W.R. Castellino F., J. Chang Y. Deford M.E.

The angiostatin protein consisting of plasminogen kringles 1–3 (K1–3) retains the ability to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration and thus is also an effective antagonist of angiogenesis and tumor growth (31Ji W.R.

Using solid phase binding assays and surface plasmon resonance technology, we demonstrate strong binding of NG2 to both molecules, interactions that appear to depend on the presence of the kringle domains. Moreover, these interactions with NG2 appear to modulate the functional properties of both molecules. Incubation with purified NG2 accelerates the urokinase-dependent activation of plasminogen and diminishes the ability of angiostatin to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Cell Proliferation AssaysThe Balb/c mouse aortic endothelial cell line 22106 (34Bastaki M. Nelli E. Dell'Era P. Rusnati M. Molinari-Tosatti M. Parolini S. Auerbach R. Ruco L. Possaati L. Presta M. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was provided by Drs. Yu Yamaguchi (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and Robert Auerbach (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. These cells do not express cell surface NG2 as determined by immunofluoresence microscopy.For proliferation experiments, endothelial cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and seeded at 2000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to recover for 8 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS and then incubated for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to allow synchronization of the cell cycle. Preliminary experiments established that optimal proliferation of these cells was achieved by a 72-h incubation period in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FCS and 10 ng/ml bFGF. For determining inhibition of proliferation, angiostatin or plasminogen (along with NG2 when indicated) was incubated with the starved cells for 1 h followed by the addition of the FCS/bFGF-containing medium for the 72-h period of stimulation. After the 72-h proliferation period, cell density was determined using the CellTiter 96 assay (Promega), in which the metabolic activity of viable cells converts tetrazolium dye into a formazan product that can be detected at 490 nm. The optical density is therefore directly proportional to the number of living cells in the wells.AntibodiesRabbit antibody against human plasminogen and mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the kringle 1–3 region were purchased from Calbiochem. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against NG2 have been described (9Goretzki L. Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16831-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-labeled goat antibodies against rabbit and mouse immunoglobulins were obtained from Bio-Rad.Purified ProteinsThe production and characterization of recombinant NG2 fragments have been previously described (18Tillet E.F. Ruggiero A. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10769-10776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four different NG2 fragments were used in our experiments: NG2/EC− (extracellular) without glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, comprising the entire extracellular domain (residues 1–2223 (35Nishiyama A. Dahlin K.J. Prince J.T. Johnstone S.R. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)); NG2/EC+ with GAG chains; central domain 2 (NG2/D2, residues 632–1450); and membrane-proximal domain 3 (NG2/D3, residues 1587–2218). The NG2/D2 preparation contains chondroitin sulfate chains, whereas NG2/D3 does not.Human urokinase (u-PA) and plasminogen (glu-type) from human plasma were obtained from Calbiochem. Plasminogen fragments representing kringles 1–3 (K1–3), kringle 4 (K4), and kringle 5 plus the serine protease domain (miniplasminogen) were obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). These fragments were generated from human glu-type plasminogen by limited digestion with pancreatic elastase. The manufacturer's protocol specifies molecular masses for the fragments as 31.5 (K1–3), 14 (K4), and 38 kDa (miniplasminogen).ReagentsResearch grade CM5 SensorChips (carboxymethylated dextran matrix), Pioneer B1 chips with reduced negative charge, amine-coupling kit [N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide], and HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES with 0.15M NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 at pH 7.4) were all obtained from BIAcore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). TurboTMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) was obtained from Pierce, 6-aminohexanoic acid was purchased from Sigma, and the plasmin substrate S-2251 (H-d-valyl-l-leucyl-l-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride) was purchased from Chromogenix AB (Mölndal, Sweden).Kinetic Measurements Using Surface Plasmon ResonanceA BIAcore 3000 surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIAcore AB) was used to measure binding parameters for the interaction between soluble NG2 fragments (analytes) and various immobilized plasminogen species (ligands). We did not attempt to measure the binding of soluble plasminogen species to immobilized NG2, because the extremely basic nature of plasminogen kringle domains leads to high levels of nonspecific interaction with the negatively charged sensor chips. Instead, plasminogen and plasminogen fragments were immobilized on the sensor chip surface by the amine-coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Low levels of ligand (<500 resonance units) were immobilized to minimize mass transfer effects. For all kinetic measurements we used a flow path involving all four cells of the BIAcore 3000. In one set of experiments, the first flow cell contained a chip coated with glu-plasminogen, the second flow cell contained a chip coated with angiostatin (plasminogen fragment K1–3), and a third flow cell contained a blank chip to serve as a reference surface. The fourth flow cell was not monitored. In a second set of experiments, cell one contained a K4-coated chip, cell two contained a miniplasminogen-coated chip, and cell three again served as a reference. Between binding cycles these coated chips were regenerated by injection of 1 m NaCl. Binding specificity was checked by injecting BSA (1.25 and 2.5 μm) over each of the coated chips.Purified recombinant NG2 species at the indicated concentrations were injected over the coated surfaces in HBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. A wide range of analyte concentrations (∼1–10 ×KD) were applied to assure recovery of data suitable for curve fitting. Typically, sensorgrams were obtained at five different analyte concentrations for each of the analyte/ligand pairs. This set of sensorgrams was analyzed using BIAevaluation software version 3.0. This software corrects for the systematic upward drift that occurs during many measurements and allows for subtraction of background sensorgrams from experimental sensorgrams. These adjustments yield corrected sensorgrams.The association and dissociation phases of corrected sensorgrams were fit simultaneously, assuming a simple bimolecular reaction model: A + B ↔ AB. Both an association rate constant ka (m−1 s−1) and a dissociation rate constant kd (s−1) were obtained for the entire data set (global fit), and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD was obtained from the ratio of the off and on rate constantskd /ka . All our kinetic data were fit most adequately by assuming a simple bimolecular model for interaction between soluble analyte and immobilized ligand, equivalent to the Langmuir isotherm for adsorption to a surface. Fits were not improved by using a mass transport model or a two-state (conformational change) model that assumes cooperativity between multiple binding sites.In addition to the kinetic analysis of binding using association and dissociation rates, we also used Pioneer B1 chips to obtain steady binding data for the interaction of NG2/EC− with plasminogen, angiostatin, and miniplasminogen. The surfaces of these chips have a low degree of carboxymethylation and are therefore less negatively charged than the CM5 chips, resulting in lower levels of nonspecific binding. Very low ligand immobilization levels (∼50 resonance units) were also used in these experiments. The ligand-coated chips were analyzed in flow cells one through three with flow cell four serving as the reference surface. To derive apparent dissociation constants under equilibrium binding conditions, peak response levels achieved in the steady state region of the sensorgrams (R eq) were plotted against analyte concentration (C). This plot was fit to a single site binding equation (Langmuir isotherm) to determine KD values.Solid Phase Binding AssaysPlasminogen and Kringle Domain Binding to Immobilized NG2Assays were performed as described previously (9Goretzki L. Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16831-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, Nuertingen, Germany) were coated with purified NG2 fragments at 4 μg/ml for 24 h at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and then blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBS. Plasminogen or plasminogen fragments dissolved in 100 μl of PBS containing 1% BSA were incubated in the wells for 2 h at 20 °C and then washed three more times as described above. For inhibition experiments, binding of plasminogen or angiostatin to immobilized NG2 was measured in the presence of different concentrations (0.1–50 mm) of the lysine analog 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA).Bound plasminogen, miniplasminogen, and K4 were detected with rabbit anti-plasminogen, whereas bound angiostatin was detected with monoclonal antibody against the plasminogen K1–3 fragment. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, respectively, were used as second antibodies. Quantitation of antibody binding was accomplished using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as the peroxidase substrate. Plates were read at 450 nm with a Titertek microtiter plate reader. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using PRISM software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).NG2 Binding to Immobilized Plasminogen SpeciesWells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 3 μg/ml of plasminogen or plasminogen fragments as described above. The plates were blocked with Blocker BLOTTO (Pierce) for 30 min, followed by incubation for 2 h at 20 °C with NG2 fragments in PBS containing 1% BSA. After washing with PBST, the wells were incubated for 2 h with polyclonal antibodies against NG2 dissolved in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. After three more washes, the wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS/BSA, and bound peroxidase activity was measured after extensive washing as described above. Data were again analyzed by nonlinear regression.Plasminogen Activation AssayPlasmin activity was quantified in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, using the chromogenic substrate S-2251. Triplicates of samples containing 0.15 μm glu-plasminogen, 10 nm u-PA, and 0.5 μm of NG2/EC−, NG2/D2, or NG2/D3 were placed in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After this preincubation period, the production of plasmin was measured by the addition of S-2251 to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Hydrolysis of the substrate by plasmin was monitored at 405 nm after 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min of incubation at 37 °C. Reference samples were incubated in the absence of NG2. Control samples containing 1 μm BSA instead of NG2 were also monitored. In the absence of u-PA, no plasmin generation was observed.DISCUSSIONThe plasminogen/plasmin system is involved in the regulation of development, remodeling, and repair in both normal and pathological tissues (39Vassalli J.D.

Angiostatin, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen, is thought to play a key role in regulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration during the process of angiogenesis (43O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Chen C. Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 44O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H.

Macromolecules that control the localization and/or regulate the activity of plasminogen and angiostatin are therefore of interest in terms of their involvement in these same biological processes. These molecules might be integral membrane components, anchored in the extracellular matrix, or free in solution.In this study we show that the integral membrane proteoglycan NG2 contains high affinity binding sites for human plasminogen. NG2 also binds tightly to plasminogen fragments such as angiostatin, which contain kringle domains, the characteristic disulfide-bonded modules that occupy the N-terminal two-thirds of the plasminogen polypeptide (46Wiman B. Wallen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 47Forsgren M. Raden B. Israelsson M. Larsson K. Helden L.O.

National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 91Google Scholar). Very similar specificities and binding affinities for NG2/plasminogen interactions are observed using both solid phase immunoassays and BIAcore measurements. The apparent dissociation constants for interactions between NG2 and plasminogen species are comparable to those reported for plasminogen binding to extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin (91 nm), thrombospondin (35 nm), and type IV collagen (12 nm) (49Silverstein R.L.

Fibronectin and laminin are thought to bind to the kringle domains of plasminogen, because both molecules bind to the K1–3 and K4 plasminogen fragments lacking the C-terminal serine protease domain (53Moser T.L. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18917-18923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NG2 binds to these same kringle-containing fragments, suggesting that it also interacts with kringle domains. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that strong inhibition of NG2/plasminogen binding is obtained with 6-AHA, which is known to block the lysine binding sites present in kringle domains 1, 2, 4, and 5 (54Lerch P.G. Rickli E.E. Lergier W. Gillessen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 55Rejante M.R. Byeon I.-J.L. Llinas M.

We determined whether cell swelling also stimulates TC uptake and Ntcp translocation via the PI3K and/or MAPK signaling pathway. All studies were conducted in isolated rat hepatocytes. Hepatocyte swelling induced by hypotonic media resulted in: 1) time- and medium osmolarity-dependent increases in TC uptake, 2) an increase in the Vmax of Na+/TC cotransport, and 3) wortmannin-sensitive increases in TC uptake and plasma membrane Ntcp mass. Hepatocyte swelling also induced wortmannin-sensitive activation of PI3K, protein kinase B, and p70S6K. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70S6K, inhibited cell swelling-induced activation of p70S6K but failed to inhibit cell swelling-induced stimulation of TC uptake. Because PD98095, an inhibitor of MAPK, did not inhibit cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake, it is unlikely that the effect of cell swelling on TC uptake is mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that 1) cell swelling stimulates TC uptake by translocating Ntcp to the plasma membrane, 2) this effect is mediated via the PI3K, but not MAPK, signaling pathway, and 3) protein kinase B, but not p70S6K, is a likely downstream effector of PI3K.

Recently, we reported that cAMP activates protein kinase B in hepatocytes and wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, inhibits the ability of cAMP to stimulate PKB and to translocate Ntcp (15Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested a role for the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway in cAMP-mediated stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport. However, cAMP failed to stimulate PI3K when assayed using whole cell lysate (16Reichel C. Gao B. Van Montfoort J. Cattori V. Rahner C. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Kamisako T. Meier P.J.

If the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of hepatic Na+/TC cotransport, other stimuli known to activate PI3K and PKB should also stimulate the cotransport. This hypothesis was tested by studying the effect of cell swelling on hepatic TC uptake.Hepatocytes undergo changes in cell volume in response to hormones, nutrient supply and oxidative stress (17Häussinger D.

Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell swelling-induced activation of PI3K has also been suggested to modulate cholangiocyte ATP release and chloride secretion (20Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Doctor R.B. Salter K.D. Toker A. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30979-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and PI3K plays a significant role in volume regulation in a rat hepatoma cell line (21Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cell swelling also stimulates biliary excretion of TC, and this effect appears to be mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway (18Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the role of MAPK in TC uptake is unknown. In the present study, we determined whether cell swelling induced by hypotonic media also stimulates TC uptake and whether this effect is mediated via the PI3K and/or MAPK signaling pathway. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that cell swelling stimulates Na+/TC cotransport via the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to determine whether cell swelling affects hepatic uptake of bile acids and whether this effect is mediated via the PI3K and/or MAPK signaling pathway. Results suggest that cell swelling induced by hypotonic media stimulates Na+/TC cotransport by translocating Ntcp to the plasma membrane and that this effect is mediated via the PI3K signaling pathway as discussed below.Cell swelling induced by hypotonic media rapidly stimulates TC uptake in hepatocytes in a time- and medium osmolarity-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). The increase in TC uptake is due to an increase in Na+-dependent TC uptake (Fig. 3), indicating stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport. The increase in TC uptake is due to an increase in maximal transport velocity (Fig. 4), raising the possibility of an increase in the number of TC transporter in the plasma membrane. Because Ntcp mediates Na+/TC cotransport, we studied the distribution of Ntcp. Cell swelling was associated with an increase in plasma membrane Ntcp without changes in total cellular Ntcp. These results suggest that the increase in plasma membrane Ntcp is due to translocation of Ntcp instead of an increase in Ntcp synthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that the rapid stimulation of TC uptake by cell swelling results from an increase in plasma membrane Ntcp, which in turn results from a rapid translocation of Ntcp to the plasma membrane. These results are similar to the effect of cAMP on TC uptake and Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes (12Grüne S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17734-17741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Cell swelling induced by hypotonic media has previously been shown to increase biliary excretion of TC (18Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The present study showing that cell swelling also activates TC uptake would indicate that transhepatic transport of TC is stimulated by cell swelling. Such a mechanism would be consistent with the stimulation of hepatic bile formation associated with cell swelling (30Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Bruck R. Haddad P. Graf J. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G806-G812PubMed Google Scholar).Rapid regulation of solute transport by transporter translocation to the plasma membrane is well established for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (32Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism of regulation has also been suggested for solute transport by hepatocytes. For example, cAMP rapidly stimulates Na+/TC cotransport by translocating Ntcp to the plasma membrane (13Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar) and increases translocation of multi-drug-resistant proteins, Mrp2 and Mrp3, and SPGP (Sister of P-GlycoProtein canalicular bile acid transporter) to the canalicular membrane (33Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar, 34Misra S. Ujhazy P. Arias I.M. Varticovski L. Hepatology. 1999; 30 (abstr.): 306Google Scholar). Canalicular multidrug resistance protein (Mrp2), which transports anionic conjugates like cysteinyl leukotrienes, also undergoes rapid and reversible translocation because of changes in cell hydration (35Kubitz R. D'Ruso S. Keppler D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1991; 113: 1438-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, transporter translocation appears to be a common mechanism for rapid regulation of solute transport in hepatocytes. Recent studies, however, suggest that extracellular ATP-dependent down-regulation of organic anion transport involves phosphorylation instead of translocation of OATP1 (36Glavy J.S. Wu S.M. Wang P.J. Orr G.A. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1479-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Our study also indicates that the effect of cell swelling on TC uptake is mediated via the PI3K signaling pathway. Cell swelling has been shown to activate PI3K in hepatocytes (19Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), as we have also observed in the present study. Wortmannin and LY294002, known inhibitors of PI3K (37Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited cell swelling-induced increases in PI3K (data not shown), TC uptake (Fig. 5), and Ntcp translocation (Fig. 6). In a previous study we observed that wortmannin did not affect MAPK activity in hepatocytes (15Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of cell swelling is mediated via the PI3K signaling pathway. Cell swelling-induced increases in ATP release in a rat hepatoma cell line (21Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and increases in ATP release and Cl− secretion in cholangiocytes (20Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Doctor R.B. Salter K.D. Toker A. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30979-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have also been suggested to be mediated via the PI3K signaling pathway. Our previous study suggested that cAMP-mediated stimulation of TC uptake and Ntcp translocation is also mediated via the PI3K signaling pathway (15Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar). Cell swelling has also been shown to stimulate biliary bile acid secretion via the MAPK pathway (18Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, a recent preliminary study showed that cAMP-mediated stimulation of biliary TC secretion involves the PI3K pathway (34Misra S. Ujhazy P. Arias I.M. Varticovski L. Hepatology. 1999; 30 (abstr.): 306Google Scholar). This result raises the possibility that cell swelling-induced increases in biliary secretion of TC may also be mediated via the PI3K pathway. In addition, wortmannin has been shown to decrease bile acid secretion in isolated perfused rat livers (39Folli F. Alvaro D. Gigliozzi A. Bassotti C. Kahn C.R. Pontiroli A.E. Capocaccia L. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 954-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the PI3K signaling pathway may play an important role in the vectorial transport of bile acids across hepatocytes by stimulating both sinusoidal uptake and canalicular excretion.Two downstream effectors of PI3K are PKB and p70S6K (40Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Rahn T. Resjö S. Castan I. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21520-21526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PI3K phosphorylates lipids to produce phosphatidylinositol phosphates, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which in turn affect cellular functions by allowing activation of PKB and p70S6K(41Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). This activation is dependent on the presence of PI3K products and requires sequential phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (42Downward J. Science. 1998; 279 (673): 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The regulatory effect of PI3K in insulin-stimulated translocation of glucose transporter (Glut4) has been proposed to be mediated via PKB (43Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 44Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Th. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In our study, the activation of both PKB and p70S6K by cell swelling was inhibited by wortmannin, indicating PI3K dependence. In addition, the effect on p70S6K was inhibited by rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70S6K (29Chou M.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that either PKB and/or p70S6K may be the downstream effector. However, the effect of cell swelling on TC uptake does not appear to involve the PI3K/p70S6K pathway, because rapamycin failed to inhibit cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake (Fig. 8). Recent studies showed that neither cAMP-stimulated TC uptake nor insulin-stimulated amino acid transport is mediated via the PI3K/p70S6K pathway (15Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 45Su T.-Z. Wang M. Syu L.-J. Saltiel A.R. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3173-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the postulated role of PKB in glucose transporter translocation (43Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 44Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Th. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), it is likely that the PI3K/PKB pathway is involved in cell swelling-induced stimulation of TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. The role of PKB could not be studied directly, because an inhibitor of PKB, like that of p70S6K, is not available. Transfection studies in a suitable cell line will be needed to further define the role of PKB.Cell swelling has been proposed to stimulate biliary excretion of TC via the MAPK pathway (18Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell swelling has been reported to stimulate MAPK in cultured hepatocytes (18Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) but not in freshly prepared hepatocytes (19Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In our study, we used freshly prepared hepatocytes to study TC uptake, because TC uptake is down-regulated in cultured hepatocytes (46Liang D. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 1162-1166PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously (19Krause U. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16668-16673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), cell swelling did not activate MAPK in freshly prepared hepatocytes. One reason for this difference may be that MAPK is already activated in freshly isolated hepatocytes. The presence of phosphorylated MAPK in control hepatocytes will be consistent with this view. However, HGF was able to further activate MAPK in this system. Thus, it is possible that hypotonicity, compared with HGF, is a weak stimulator of MAPK and hence did not produce further activation. In any event, because hypotonicity can still activate TC uptake, it is unlikely that the effect on TC uptake was mediated via the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase, PD98059, failed to affect cell swelling-induced increases in TC uptake. Thus, it is unlikely that the effect of hypotonicity on TC uptake and Ntcp translocation is mediated via the MAPK pathway. This, however, does not rule out a regulatory role of MAPK in Ntcp translocation.Whether the effect of cell swelling on Ntcp translocation is a specific effect on TC transport or a general effect on transporters in hepatocytes is unclear. Considering that stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport would result in an increase in cell volume, a counterproductive effect during cell swelling and the subsequent RVD (28Corasanti J.G. Gleeson D. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G290-G298PubMed Google Scholar, 47Pfaller W. Willinger C. Stoll B. Hallbrucker C. Haussinger D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the latter possibility seems more likely. In fact, cell swelling is also associated with increased biliary excretion of cysteinyl leukotrienes and increased targeting of its transporter, MRP2, to the canalicular membrane (35Kubitz R. D'Ruso S. Keppler D. Häussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1991; 113: 1438-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 48Wettstein M. Noé B. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 235-240PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cell swelling-induced increases in ATP release may involve insertion of transporters in the plasma membrane (21Feranchak A.P. Roman R.M. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14906-14911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that translocation of Ntcp is dependent on intact actin filament (15Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 49Dranoff J.A. McClure M. Burgstahler A.D. Denson L.A. Crawford A.R. Crawford J.M. Karpen S.J. Nathanson M.H. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and cell swelling-dependent stimulation of biliary secretion of TC and cysteinyl leukotrienes is dependent on intact microtubules (48Wettstein M. Noé B. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 235-240PubMed Google Scholar, 50Häussinger D. Saha C. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when exposed to hypotonic media, hepatocytes undergo a rapid increase in cell volume within 2–5 min, and this is followed by RVD, during which cell volume returns to near basal level within 15–20 min (28Corasanti J.G. Gleeson D. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: G290-G298PubMed Google Scholar, 47Pfaller W. Willinger C. Stoll B. Hallbrucker C. Haussinger D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study (Fig. 1), TC uptake did not increase significantly until 10 min, reaching a near maximum level at 25 min. These results may suggest that the activation of TC uptake coincides with the initiation of RVD and continues through RVD. Because exocytosis has been suggested to be increased during RVD (47Pfaller W. Willinger C. Stoll B. Hallbrucker C. Haussinger D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is possible that cell swelling stimulates exocytosis by increasing vesicular trafficking along the cytoskeleton in an effort to decrease cell volume. This process results in the fusion of intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane leading to plasma membrane translocation of various transporters stored in the intracellular vesicles. In summary, the present study shows that cell swelling induced by hypotonic media stimulates Na+/TC cotransport by translocating Ntcp to the plasma membrane, and this effect is mediated via the PI3K signaling pathway. Conjugated bile acids, like taurocholate (TC),1 are efficiently transported across hepatocytes and the Na+-dependent TC uptake at the sinusoidal membrane of rat livers is mediated primarily via Ntcp (1Anwer M.S. Adv. Vet. Sci. Comp. Med. 1993; 37: 1-29PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nathanson M.H. Boyer J.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The rat liver Ntcp is a ∼51-kDa serine/threonine phosphorylated glycoprotein (3Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S.

We demonstrated that cAMP, acting via protein kinase A, rapidly increases transport maximum of Na+/TC cotransport in hepatocytes (12Grüne S. Engelking L.R. Anwer M.S. J. Biol.

Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of cAMP to translocate Ntcp is dependent on cAMP-mediated increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] (3Mukhopadhayay S.

Recently, we reported that cAMP activates protein kinase B in hepatocytes and wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, inhibits the ability of cAMP to stimulate PKB and to translocate Ntcp (15Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested a role for the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway in cAMP-mediated stimulation of Na+/TC cotransport. However, cAMP failed to stimulate PI3K when assayed using whole cell lysate (16Reichel C. Gao B. Van Montfoort J. Cattori V. Rahner C. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Kamisako T. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 688-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting that cAMP may activate the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway at a site downstream of PI3K. If the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of hepatic Na+/TC cotransport, other stimuli known to activate PI3K and PKB should also stimulate the cotransport. This hypothesis was tested by studying the effect of cell swelling on hepatic TC uptake. Hepatocytes undergo changes in cell volume in response to hormones, nutrient supply and oxidative stress (17Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).

Genet. 1998; 19: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), respectively. In the inner ear, the expression of myosin VIIA is restricted to the sensory hair cells in both the cochlea (auditory apparatus) and the vestibule (balance organ) (5Hasson T. Heintzelman M.B.

Antonio M. Beisel K.W. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and harbor a disorganization of the hair cell stereocilia,i.e. the mechanoreceptive structure (13Self T. Mahony M. Fleming J. Walsh J. Brown S.D. Steel K.P. Development. 1998; 125: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the uptake of aminoglycosides by the hair cells is impaired (14Richardson G.P. Forge A. Kros C.J. Fleming J. Brown S.D. Steel K.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9506-9519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a crucial role of myosin VIIA in phagocytosis has recently been demonstrated in the Dictyostelium amoeba (15Titus M.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which suggests that the role of this protein in endocytosis has been conserved throughout evolution. In addition to the eye and inner ear, myosin VIIA is expressed in a variety of organs or tissues including the olfactory epithelium, brain, choroid plexus, intestine, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and testis (16Sahly I. El-Amraoui A. Abitbol M. Petit C. Dufier J.-L. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 196: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Wolfrum U. Liu X. Schmitt A. Udovichenko I.P. Williams D.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the phenotypes associated with myosin VIIA mutations in humans and mice have so far revealed deleterious effects only in the inner ear and the eye. The primary structure of myosin VIIA (Fig. 1 A) is typical of unconventional myosins (18Oliver T.N. Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Myosin VIIA is composed of a N-terminal motor head domain (aa 1–729) containing the ATP- and actin-binding sites, a neck region (aa 730–855) composed of five isoleucine/glutamine (IQ) motifs, which are thought to bind to calmodulin, and a long tail (aa 856–2215) (10Weil D. Lévy G. Sahly I. Levi-Acobas F. Blanchard S. El-Amraoui A. Crozet F. Philippe H. Abitbol M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The tail segments of unconventional myosins contain domains that are believed to interact with other proteins, such as cargo molecules and components of the signal transduction pathways. The tail of myosin VIIA (Fig.1 A) begins with a short coiled-coil domain (79 aa), which has been shown, using the yeast two-hybrid system, to be implicated in the formation of myosin VIIA homodimers (2Weil D. Küssel P. Blanchard S. Lévy G. Levi-Acobas F. Drira M. Ayadi H. Petit C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This dimerization domain is followed by two large repeats (I and II) of about 460 aa each, with a poorly conserved Src homology 3 domain in between (19Chen Z.-Y. Hasson T. Kelley P.M. Schwender B.J. Schwartz M.F. Ramakrishnan M. Kimberling W.J. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Genomics. 1996; 36: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Mburu P. Liu X.Z. Walsh J. Saw D. Cope M.J.T.V. Gibson F. Kendrick-Jones J. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Each repeat is composed of a “myosin tail homology-4” (MyTH4) domain and a “4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin” (FERM)-like domain (21Chishti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M. Jindal H. Liu S.C. Low P.S. Rouleau G.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Conboy J.G. Gascard P. Takakuwa Y. Huang S.C. Benz Jr., E.J. Bretscher A. Fehon R.G. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Solomon F. Marchesi V.T. Tsukita S.

Sci. 1998; 23: 281-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), which characterizes the protein 4.1 superfamily. This family includes protein 4.1, talin, filopodin, and merlin/schwannomin and the ERM proteins, ezrin, radixin, and moesin. The FERM domains of these proteins have been shown to bind, either directly or via an adaptor protein, to various integral membrane proteins (for a review, see Ref. 22Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Accordingly, myosin VIIA could be one of the molecules that cross-link the cortical actin filaments to the plasma membrane (22Mangeat P. Roy C. Martin M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Algrain M. Arpin M. Louvard D. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins that interact with myosin VIIA tail is expected to provide helpful clues for understanding its role at the cell level. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to seek such interacting proteins. Five specific cDNAs were thereby isolated. Here we report on one of these that encodes the type Iα regulatory subunit (RIα) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The bait used for the screening was the C-terminal 464-aa fragment of myosin VIIA (aa positions 1752–2215) derived from cDNA R358 (10Weil D. Lévy G. Sahly I. Levi-Acobas F. Blanchard S. El-Amraoui A. Crozet F. Philippe H. Abitbol M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and cloned in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain (LexABD) in vector pNLX3. The same fragment was also cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) in vector pAS2–1 (CLONTECH). Four plasmids encoding C- or N-terminally truncated baits were constructed: pNLX3-BdC1 (aa 1752–2006), pNLX3-BNdC3 (aa 1698–1859), pNLX3-BdN1 (aa 1896–2215), and pNLX3-BdN2 (aa 2007–2215) (derived from cDNAs R203 and R358 (10Weil D. Lévy G. Sahly I. Levi-Acobas F. Blanchard S. El-Amraoui A. Crozet F. Philippe H. Abitbol M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3232-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)). Two mutated pNLX3 bait constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis: pNLX3-BF1800I and pNLX3-BG2137E, carrying the Phe1800 → Ile mutation of theshaker-1 allele 26SB (20Mburu P. Liu X.Z. Walsh J. Saw D. Cope M.J.T.V. Gibson F. Kendrick-Jones J. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the Gly2137 → Glu mutation of an USH1B-affected patient (25Lévy G. Levi-Acobas F. Blanchard S. Gerber S. Larget-Piet D. Chenal V. Liu X.-Z. Newton V. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Munnich A. Kaplan J. Petit C. Weil D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), respectively. To determine the binding region of RIα, deleted constructs were made to express different portions of RIα fused with the activation domain of GAL4 (GAL4AD) from vectors pGAD-GE and pACT2 (CLONTECH). The following N- and C-terminally deleted constructs were generated from the pGAD-GE-D10 plasmid (see below) by polymerase chain reaction amplification: pGAD-GE-RIα-(1–249), -(77–249), -(1–77), -(1–107), and -(1–147) and pACT2-RIα-(47–249). The internal deletion of aSacI fragment (120 nt) of pGAD-GE-D10 resulted in plasmid pGAD-GE-D10ΔSacI encoding a D10 peptide with deletion of 40 aa (corresponding to the last 22 aa encoded by the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and the first 18 aa of RIα). The region encoding residues 1–286 of RIα, derived from pGAD-GE-D10, was cloned into the polyhistidine tag vector pQE30 (Qiagen) (pQE30-RIα-(1–286)). For the production of biotinylated fusion proteins of the bait and its truncated forms, the following constructs were generated in PinPoint Xa vectors (Promega) (pXa): pXa1-bait (aa 1752–2215), pXa1-BdC1 (aa 1752–2006), pXa1-BdC2 (aa 1752–1931), and pXa2-BdN2 (aa 2007–2215). The sequences of all constructs generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification were confirmed. Human retina poly(A)+ RNA was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA library was constructed by generating random and oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs using the SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs were cloned downstream GAL4AD in pGAD-GE. About 7 × 105 independent clones were obtained. A yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to Vojtek et al. (26Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast cells expressing the LexABD-bait fusion protein were transformed with the human retinal cDNA expression library (see above). The positive clones were rescued, retransformed into fresh L40 yeast cells, and confirmed by growth on plates lacking histidine and β-galactosidase assay. The positive clones were further analyzed by cotransformation with irrelevant baits, used as negative controls (see “Results and Discussion”). DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) on an Applied Biosystems ABI 377 or ABI 373 automatic DNA sequencer. Sequences were analyzed using the Wisconsin Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Data base searches were performed with the BLAST 2.0 algorithm in the nonredundant nucleotide sequence data base (GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ/PDB) and nonredundant peptide sequence data base (GenBankTM CDS translations/PDB/SwissProt/PIR/PRF) maintained at NCBI (available on the World Wide Web). pQE30-RIα () was expressed in E. coli strain M15 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Biotinylated fusion proteins in PinPoint Xa vectors were produced in E. coli strain HB101 following the protocol of the PinPoint protein purification kit (Promega). Grown bacterial cultures were pelleted and resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) with proteinase inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell lysates containing biotinylated myosin VIIA fusion peptides or an unrelated control protein (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) were incubated with tetrameric avidin resin (TetraLink resin; Promega) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, the coated resin was washed three times with buffer B supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). For in vitro binding assay, 100 μl of a bacterial cell lysate containing His6-RIα-(1–286) in buffer B with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 were incubated with 3–6 μl of the coated resins for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The quantity of the protein bound to resin was visualized on a Western blot in order to adjust the amounts of coated resins in the binding experiments. After incubation, the resin was washed five times with 1 ml of buffer HS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were eluted from the resin by boiling in SDS gel-loading buffer, separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar), electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and then submitted to immunoblot analysis. The blot was blocked in 5% powdered nonfat milk. To reveal His6-RIα-(1–286), the blot was incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the polyhistidine tag at 1:2000 dilution (anti-RGS-His, Qiagen). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad; 1:5000 dilution) and the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for detection. To visualize the amounts of biotinylated peptide/proteins used in each binding assay, the same blot was stripped of bound antibodies (by incubation in a buffer containing 62 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min), washed in PBS, blocked in dry milk and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at 1:2000 dilution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein bands were revealed with the ECL chemiluminescence system. HEK293 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 150 units/ml gentamicin. The cells were grown on 10-cm dishes until 50% confluency. They were transfected with a cDNA fragment encoding the entire myosin VIIA tail (aa 848–2215) cloned in pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) (10 μg of total DNA/10-cm dish), using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). After 36 h, cells were rinsed, pelleted, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline). Cell extracts were prepared using 1% deoxycholate as described previously (28Dunah A.W. Luo J. Wang Y.H. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to either RIα or myosin VIIA were preincubated with protein A-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The cell extract was then added, and the mixture incubated was for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, resuspended in SDS gel-loading buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar) in a 4–20% acrylamide gradient. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Blots were incubated overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Antibodies to RIα and to myosin VIIA were diluted at 1:1000 and 1:5000, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for detection. Adult guinea pig inner ears were fixed for 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, and then decalcified for 4 days in 10% EDTA-PBS at 4 °C. Human retinas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, the samples were immersed in 20% sucrose-PBS for 12 h at 4 °C and then frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. embedding medium (Miles). Cryostat sections (10–14 μm) were processed as described previously (6El-Amraoui A. Sahly I. Picaud S. Sahel J. Abitbol M. Petit C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies against the RIα (sc-906) and RIβ (sc-907) regulatory subunits of PKA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); these antibodies are partially cross-reacting. The inner ear hair cells were identified using the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-myosin VIIA antibody (6El-Amraoui A. Sahly I. Picaud S. Sahel J. Abitbol M. Petit C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The specificity of the immunolabeling was verified by omission of the first antibody and use of the preimmune serum. The presence of a FERM domain at the C-terminal end of myosin VIIA is expected to target this molecule to cell membrane proteins and possibly serves as a “cargo binding domain” (21Chishti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M. Jindal H. Liu S.C. Low P.S. Rouleau G.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Conboy J.G. Gascard P. Takakuwa Y. Huang S.C. Benz Jr., E.J. Bretscher A. Fehon R.G.

Sci. 1998; 23: 281-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). This domain is preceded by a MyTH4 domain of unknown function. The same tandem arrangement of the two domains is present in other motor proteins, namely myosin X, myosin XV, and a plant kinesin (18Oliver T.N. Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Chen Z.-Y. Hasson T. Kelley P.M. Schwender B.J. Schwartz M.F. Ramakrishnan M. Kimberling W.J. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Genomics. 1996; 36: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Reddy A.S. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Wang A. Liang Y. Fridell R.A. Probst F.J. Wilcox E.R. Touchman J.W. Morton C.C. Morell R.J. Noben-Trauth K. Camper S.A. Friedman T.B. Science. 1998; 280: 1447-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), suggesting that the association of these domains has a functional significance. Therefore, two peptides covering the C-terminal MyTH4 and FERM domains (repeat II), which differed by their N termini, were tested for their ability to be used as baits in a two-hybrid screen. They were expressed as a fusion protein with LexABD in the pNLX3 vector. The longer peptide (aa 1698–2215) caused a strong activation of the two reporter genes on its own and could not be used. The shorter one (aa 1752–2215) gave a weak activation of the histidine synthetase reporter gene; this was overcome by growing the cells in the presence of 3 mm 3-AT, which restores histidine auxotrophy. This C-terminal 464-aa peptide, comprising the MyTH4 domain (except for the first four aa) and the entire FERM domain, was used as bait (see Fig. 3). Since loss of myosin VIIA in humans results in retinal degeneration (see Ref. 31El-Amraoui A. Petit C. J. Audiol. Med. 1997; 6: 170-184Google Scholar), we constructed a two-hybrid cDNA library from human retina (see “Experimental Procedures”). Approximately 6 × 106 yeast transformants were screened, representing about 10 times the complexity of the cDNA fusion library. More than 1000 colonies were found to grow on histidine-free plates with 3 mm 3-AT; all were also β-galactosidase-positive. Two hundred fifty well-growing colonies were retained for further analysis. To identify redundant clones, library inserts of the 250 colonies were polymerase chain reaction-amplified with primers specific to the library vector, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane, and hybridized with randomly chosen library inserts. This reduced the 250 colonies to 141 clones. To test the specificity of their interaction with the bait, the 141 plasmids were isolated, retransformed into yeast strain AMR70, and mated with the L40 strain containing either the LexABD-bait or the LexABD-lamin C, which served as a negative control. For 27 (19%) of these plasmids, upon coexpression with the LexABD-bait, the His+ LacZ+ phenotype could not be confirmed. Sixty-nine (49%) plasmids showed also an interaction with LexABD-lamin C and were discarded. The remaining 45 plasmids were analyzed further. They were used to transform the Y187 strain, which was mated with the HF7 strain expressing the GAL4BD in fusion with the bait (GAL4BD-bait in pAS2). This switch from LexABD- to GAL4BD-bait fusions eliminates false positives that may arise as a result of binding to the junction region between LexABD and the bait. Finally, clones that would be able to interact with various FERM domains were eliminated by mating these 45 transformed Y187 yeasts with the HF7 strain carrying either the entire or the N-terminal part (containing the FERM domain) of merlin/schwannomin in fusion with GAL4BD (pGBT10-DH3 and pGBT10-DH1, respectively). We thereby identified five independent prey clones that 1) grew well on histidine-free plates with 3 mm 3-AT and displayed strong β-galactosidase activity, when coexpressed with the bait, and 2) showed no interaction with the reporter genes in coexpression with lamin C or merlin/schwannomin. This strongly suggested that the proteins encoded by these clones are binding partners of myosin VIIA. Sequencing of the cDNA inserts of the five clones showed in all of them an open reading frame in direct fusion with the GAL4AD. One of them, clone D10, contained a fragment of the human cDNA coding for the regulatory subunit RIα of PKA (GenBankTM accession number M33336; Ref. 32Solberg R. Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Torjesen P.A. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment that is present in clone D10 starts by 90 nt of the 5′-UTR, followed by the first 857 nt of the RIα coding sequence. The 90 nt of the 5′-UTR form an open reading frame (30 aa) in frame with the RIα coding sequence. The structure of the regulatory subunits (R) of PKA comprises a N-terminal region involved in homodimerization, a hinge that binds to the active site of the catalytic subunit (C) in the absence of cAMP, and two contiguous cAMP-binding domains, A (aa 145–262) and B (aa 263–381). D10 encodes the first 286 aa of RIα, which is all except for the C-terminal cAMP-binding domain (see Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed on lysates from transfected HEK293 cells expressing the entire myosin VIIA tail (see “Experimental Procedures”) confirmed the interaction of the endogenous PKA RIα subunit to myosin VIIA, and also showed the coimmunoprecipitation of the β isoform of RI (RIβ) (Fig.2). The existence of RIα-RIβ heterodimers (33Tasken K. Skalhegg B.S. Solberg R. Andersson K.B. Taylor S.S. Lea T. Blomhoff H.K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Biol.

The PKA holoenzyme is composed of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. Two classes of R subunits exist, RI and RII, which define the type I and type II PKA, respectively (34Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The activation of PKA is triggered by the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which binds to the R subunits, resulting in the dissociation of the holoenzyme and the release of free active C subunits. Active PKA controls the function of various structural proteins and key enzymes by phosphorylating specific serine and threonine residues in these proteins. PKA molecules are targeted to specific subcellular locations, such as the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, nucleus, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and other organelles (for a review, see Refs. 34Dell'Acqua M.L.

The current model proposes that the anchoring of PKA to subcellular structures is a mechanism that ensures a high concentration of PKA near its substrate proteins; this would facilitate their rapid and preferential phosphorylation upon an increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration. In addition, this may allow for activation of localized pools of PKA. The dimerization domain of the PKA RII subunit and, more recently, of the RI subunit, has been implicated in the interaction with AKAPs (36Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2030013085,"Hrs is an early endosomal protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells stimulated with growth factors. Hrs is thought to play a regulatory role in endocytosis of growth factor-receptor complexes through early endosomes. Early endosomal localization of Hrs seems to be essential for Hrs to exert its function in the endocytosis. Hrs has a FYVE finger domain that binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate in vitro. The FYVE finger is a likely domain that mediates membrane association of endosomal proteins. In this study, we examined whether the FYVE finger participates in early endosomal targeting of Hrs. Hrs with a zinc binding-defective FYVE finger was still localized to early endosomes. In addition, the N-terminal FYVE finger-containing fragment of Hrs showed a cytosolic distribution in mammalian cells. These results indicate that the FYVE finger is not required for the localization of Hrs to early endosomes. Furthermore, by analyzing a series of deletion mutants of Hrs, we identified a sequence of about 100 amino acids within the C-terminal proline- and glutamine-rich region as a domain essential for the targeting of Hrs to early endosomes.

Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is a 115-kDa protein that has an N-terminal VHS domain, a FYVE finger domain, a proline-rich region, a coiled-coil motif, and a C-terminal proline- and glutamine-rich region (1Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic experiments revealed that Hrs is localized to the cytoplasmic surface of early endosomes containing the transferrin receptor (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Hrs has 23% sequence homology to the yeast protein Vps27p, which is essential for vacuolar and endocytic trafficking through a prevacuolar compartment (3Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Hrs tightly associates with STAM and Hbp through its coiled-coil motif (4Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, Hrs is thought to play a regulatory role in the endocytosis of growth factor-receptor complexes through early endosomes. Hrs is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells stimulated with cytokines such as interleukin-2 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (4Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K.

Overexpression of the wild-type Hrs suppresses the cytokine-stimulated DNA synthesis, suggesting that Hrs is involved in cell growth signaling or ligand-induced endocytosis of cytokine receptors (4Asao H.

The FYVE domains of these proteins bind specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)1 in vitro (10Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol.

A mutation in the FYVE finger of EEA1 that interferes with zinc binding causes the cytosolic distribution of EEA1 (13Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The FYVE fingers of EEA1, Vps27p, and Vac1p fused to green fluorescent protein are localized to an endocytic compartment in yeast, and this localization changes to be cytosolic in a Vps34p-deficient mutant that completely lacks PtdIns(3)P (10Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The FYVE finger of Hrs also binds specifically to PtdIns(3)P in vitro (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it can replace the FYVE finger of EEA1 with respect to the early endosomal targeting of EEA1 (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, the early endosomal localization of Hrs appears to be mediated through its FYVE finger by binding to PtdIns(3)P. However, a deletion mutant of Hrs lacking the FYVE finger retains early endosomal localization (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting that another domain also participates in the association of Hrs with endosomal membranes. In this study, we first examined whether the FYVE finger participates in early endosomal targeting of Hrs. We found that the domain is not essential for the localization of Hrs to early endosomes. Then, we tried to identify a sequence responsible for early endosomal targeting of Hrs. Analysis of a series of deletion mutants of Hrs revealed that a sequence within the C-terminal proline- and glutamine-rich region is required for the localization of Hrs to early endosomes. The cDNA encoding N-terminally FLAG-tagged Hrs was constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GCGAAGCTTGCGGCCGCCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGTGACAAGGGGCGAGGCAGCGGCACCTTC-3′ and 5′-GCGAAGCTTGCGGCCGCTCAGTCAAGGAGATGAGCTGGGCCTCAC-3′, and mouse Hrs cDNA as a template.

Expression vectors encoding deletion and point mutants of N-terminally FLAG-tagged Hrs were constructed with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA encoding C-terminally FLAG-tagged Hrs mutant, Hrs503–775, was constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GCGAAGCTTGCCATGGCTGAGCGTCAACGCC AGATCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGGCGGCCGCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTCAAAGGAGATGAGCTGGGCCTC-3′, and mouse Hrs cDNA as a template. The cDNA encoding C-terminally FLAG-tagged Hrs mutant, Hrs604–775, was constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GCGAAGCTTGCCATGGGTGTGTATATGAGCCAGCCAGCCC-3′ and 5′-GCGGCGGCCGCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTCAAAGGAGATGAGCTGGGCCTC-3′ and mouse Hrs cDNA as a template. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and NotI and inserted into theHindIII and NotI sites of an expression vector pmiw. The expression vector encoding the HA-tagged Hrs was described previously (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To construct an expression vector with the HA tag sequence, two oligonucleotides, 5′-AGCTTGCCGCCACCATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCGGCCGCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATGGTGGCGGCA-3′, were annealed and inserted into the HindIII and PstI sites of an expression vector pmiw (pmiw-HA). The cDNA encoding N-terminally HA-tagged Hbp was constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCCATGCCTCTGTTCACTGCCAA-3′ and 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCGACTGAGAGGGGAAACTT-3′, and mouse Hbp cDNA as a template. The PCR product was digested with NotI and inserted into the NotI site of the expression vector pmiw-HA.

Stenmark) as a template. The PCR product was digested with NotI and XbaI and inserted into the NotI and XbaI sites of an expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA. At 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml of Alexa 594-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probe) for 15 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed, and permeabilized in 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. The primary antibody was a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or a mouse anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The secondary antibody was an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (Molecular Probe). Cells were examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Liposome binding was performed as described previously (15Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh B.-H. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Liposomes were prepared by mixing phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and PtdIns(3)P at the proportions indicated, drying the mixture under nitrogen, and resuspending to a final concentration of 1 mg of total phospholipid/ml in 200 μl of a suspension buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Resuspended lipids were sonicated in a bath sonicator until a homogenous suspension was formed (5 min). Liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. Near confluent HeLa cells in a 100-mm dish were homogenized by a Teflon glass homogenizer in 1 ml of PBS containing protease inhibitors, Complete™ EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and then centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. A 400-μl volume of the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of liposome at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 10 min, and 20 μl of each supernatant was collected and mixed with 20 μl of 2 × sample buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). The pellets were washed with 1 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were suspended with 50 μl of PBS and mixed with 50 μl of 2× sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 20 μl of each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (1Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 5 μg of anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. For immunoblotting, 200-fold diluted anti-Hrs antiserum (1Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), 1 μg/ml of anti-EEA1 antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, or anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. Bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-Hrs1–289 protein containing the FYVE finger binds specifically to PtdIns(3)P in vitro, but a zinc binding-defective mutant glutathioneS-transferase-Hrs1–289 in which Cys-215 in the FYVE finger is replaced with a serine (C215S) does not (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Further, the EEA1 protein in which the FYVE finger is replaced with the mutant FYVE finger (C215S) of Hrs lacks the ability to associate with endosomes (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To examine whether the FYVE finger of Hrs is involved in early endosomal targeting, the FLAG-tagged full-length of wild-type or mutant (C215S) Hrs was expressed in HeLa cells, and their intracellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using an anti-FLAG antibody. Internalized transferrin was used as a marker of early endosomes. Both the wild-type and mutant Hrs were co-localized with the internalized transferrin (Fig.1 A), indicating that the exogenously expressed Hrs mutant with the zinc binding-defective FYVE finger was localized to early endosomes containing the internalized transferrin-receptor complexes. These results, together with our previous result that the deletion mutant of Hrs lacking the entire FYVE finger was localized to early endosomes (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggest that the FYVE finger in Hrs is not required for early endosomal targeting of Hrs. HeLa cells contain endogenous Hrs that is localized to early endosomes (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a possibility that the exogenously expressed zinc binding-defective Hrs associates with endogenous Hrs and is detected on early endosomes. To examine this possibility, the FLAG-tagged Hrs and HA-tagged Hrs were co-expressed in HeLa cells, and the association of these proteins was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-FLAG antibody. As a positive control, the FLAG-tagged Hrs was co-expressed with the HA-tagged Hbp, a Hrs-binding protein, in HeLa cells, and a similar analysis was performed. The HA-tagged Hrs was detected in the lysate from HeLa cells expressing both the FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged Hrs (Fig.2, A and B,lane 1). But it was not detected in the fraction containing the FLAG-tagged Hrs that was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2), indicating that the FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged Hrs did not associate with each other. The HA-tagged Hbp was co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged Hrs by an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2 A,lane 4), indicating a tight association of the FLAG-tagged Hrs and HA-tagged Hbp. These results suggest that Hrs does not dimerize or oligomerize and that the exogenously expressed Hrs does not associate with endogenous Hrs. The bacterially expressed truncated form of Hrs (Hrs1–289) has been shown to bind specifically to liposomes containing PtdIns(3)P (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The full-length Hrs with the zinc binding-defective FYVE finger was still localized to early endosomes. Thus, the full-length Hrs may not bind to PtdIns(3)P, even though it contains the wild-type FYVE finger. To determine whether the full-length Hrs binds to PtdIns(3)P, endogenous Hrs in HeLa cells was assayed for binding to liposomes containing PtdIns(3)P. Endogenous EEA1 in HeLa cells was also assayed as a positive control, because it has been shown to bind to liposomes containing PtdIns(3)P (13Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Neither protein bound to the liposome matrix, which was composed of 50% phosphatidylserine and 50% phosphatidylinositol (Fig. 3). Endogenous EEA1 bound to the liposomes containing 1% PtdIns(3)P, whereas endogenous Hrs did not (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the FYVE finger in the full-length Hrs expressed in mammalian cells cannot function as a PtdIns(3)P binding domain. PtdIns(3)P is produced through the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol by phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) (16Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). If PtdIns(3)P is involved in early endosomal localization of Hrs through the FYVE finger, treatment of cells with PI(3)K inhibitors would result in change of the localization. Thus, the FLAG-tagged Hrs was expressed in HeLa cells, and the cells were treated with wortmannin, a PI(3)K inhibitor. As a positive control, the Myc-tagged EEA1 was expressed in HeLa cells, and the cells were treated with wortmannin. Then their intracellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody. Treatment with wortmannin changed early endosomal localization of EEA1 to be cytosolic (Fig. 4, c andd), whereas it did not affect the localization of Hrs (Fig.4, a and b). These results suggest that PtdIns(3)P is not involved in endosomal membrane association of Hrs. Because bacterially expressed Hrs1–289 binds specifically to liposomes containing PtdIns(3)P, it is possible that this truncated form of Hrs is localized to early endosomes when expressed in mammalian cells. Thus, the FLAG-tagged Hrs1–289 was expressed in HeLa cells, and its intracellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-FLAG antibody. The localization of the expressed proteins was cytosolic and punctate staining was not observed in the cells (Fig.5 A, a–c), indicating that the FYVE domain is not sufficient for early endosomal targeting of Hrs in mammalian cells. Instead, the remaining C-terminal region may contribute to the targeting. Thus, the FLAG-tagged truncated form of Hrs (Hrs391–775) was expressed in HeLa cells, and its intracellular localization was analyzed. The expressed protein was co-localized with the internalized transferrin (Fig. 5 A,d–f), suggesting that the sequence responsible for early endosomal localization of Hrs is located within the region 391–775. It should be noted that early endosomes were of normal size in cells expressing Hrs391–775 (Fig. 5 A,d–f), whereas larger early endosomes were observed in cells expressing the full-length of Hrs (Fig. 1 A). The C-terminal half of Hrs (Hrs391–775) contains a coiled-coil motif that mediates the binding of Hrs to the interacting proteins, STAM and Hbp (4Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that these proteins associate with early endosomal membrane, and Hrs is localized to the same compartment by binding to STAM or Hbp through the coiled-coil motif. To examine this possibility, the FLAG-tagged deletion mutant of Hrs lacking the coiled-coil motif (HrsΔCC) was expressed in HeLa cells, and its intracellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. The expressed mutant Hrs was co-localized with the internalized transferrin (Fig.6 A, a–c), indicating that the binding of Hrs to STAM or Hbp is not necessary for early endosomal localization of Hrs. Because STAM and Hbp tightly associate with Hrs in mammalian cells (4Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), they may modulate the intracellular localization of Hrs, and removal of these proteins from Hrs may result in appearance of the function of the FYVE finger as a membrane association domain. Thus, the FLAG-tagged double mutant of Hrs with the zinc binding-defective FYVE finger and the coiled-coil deletion (HrsC215SΔCC) was expressed in HeLa cells, and its intracellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. The expressed mutant Hrs was co-localized with the internalized transferrin (Fig. 6 A,d–f). The result suggests that the association of Hrs with STAM or Hbp does not modulate the function of the FYVE finger with respect to endosomal membrane association. To identify the sequence required for early endosomal localization of Hrs, various FLAG-tagged deletion mutants were expressed in HeLa cells, and their intracellular localization was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. The deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 172 amino acid residues (Hrs1–603) showed punctate staining (Fig.7 A, a) and was co-localized with the internalized transferrin (data not shown). However, further deletion mutations (Hrs1–502 and Hrs1–465) caused a cytosolic distribution of the expressed proteins (Fig. 7 A, b and c). Reciprocally, the deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal 502 amino acid residues (Hrs503–775) showed punctate staining (Fig.7 A, d) and was co-localized with the internalized transferrin (data not shown). The mutant of Hrs with a further 101-amino acid deletion (Hrs604–775) did not show punctate staining (Fig. 7 A, e) and was not co-localized with the internalized transferrin (data not shown), although it did not show a cytosolic distribution. Furthermore, the deletion mutant of Hrs lacking the N-terminal 104 amino acids in the proline- and glutamine-rich region (ΔPQ) showed a cytosolic distribution (Fig.7 A, f). These results indicate that an N-terminal sequence of about 100 amino acids within the proline- and glutamine-rich region is required for Hrs to be localized to early endosomes. Larger early endosomes were observed in cells expressing Hrs containing the N-terminal region (Hrs1–603), whereas the size of early endosomes was normal in cells expressing the C-terminal region of Hrs (Hrs503–775). These results, together with the results in Figs. 1 A, 5 A, and6 A, suggest that overexpression of Hrs that contains the N-terminal region results in larger early endosomes. In this study, we found that Hrs with the zinc binding-defective FYVE finger is still localized to early endosomes and also that the N-terminal FYVE finger-containing fragment of Hrs shows a cytosolic distribution in mammalian cells. These findings led us to conclude that the FYVE finger is not required for the localization of Hrs to early endosomes. Furthermore, the deletion mutant of Hrs that lacked about 100 amino acid residues within the proline- and glutamine-rich region showed a cytosolic distribution. Thus, the sequence essential for the early endosomal targeting of Hrs was identified outside the FYVE finger. The bacterially expressed truncated form of Hrs containing the FYVE finger has been shown to bind specifically to liposomes containing PtdIns(3)P (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the FYVE finger of Hrs can replace that of EEA1 with respect to the early endosomal targeting of EEA1 (11Gaullier J.-M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, we found that the full-length Hrs expressed in mammalian cells does not bind to liposomes containing PtdIns(3)P. We also found that treatment with a PI(3)K inhibitor wortmannin does not change the early endosomal localization of Hrs. These findings suggest that unlike EEA1, the FYVE finger of Hrs does not interact with PtdIns(3)P in mammalian cells. The conformation of the full-length Hrs may interfere with the interaction of the FYVE finger with PtdIns(3)P. Alternatively, a protein associated with Hrs may prevent the FYVE finger from interacting with PtdIns(3)P. The function of FYVE fingers of several proteins has been investigated. The FYVE finger of EEA1 is required for both PtdIns(3)P and Rab5 binding, and this dual interaction is critical for endosomal localization of EEA1 and for regulation of endocytic membrane fusion (17Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 18Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because an excess of Rab5 increases the endosomal association of EEA1 and decreases its dependence on PtdIns(3)P, the levels of Rab5 seem to be rate-limiting for the recruitment of EEA1 to endosomal membranes, and PtdIns(3)P may modulate the interaction of EEA1 with Rab5 through the FYVE finger (17Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 18Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mutations in the FYVE finger of yeast Vps27p do not affect its membrane association, but these mutant proteins do not complement the phenotype of the VPS27mutation, indicating that the FYVE finger is essential for the function but not for the membrane association of Vps27p (3Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Yeast Vac1 proteins with mutant FYVE fingers still associate with membranes but show vacuolar protein sorting defects and reduced interactions with Vps45p, the Sec1p homologue, and activated Vps21p, a yeast Rab protein (19Tall G.G. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Horazdovsky B.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1873-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,20Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, like Vps27p, the FYVE finger of Vac1p is required for its function but not for its membrane association. Vac1p membrane association is not dependent on PtdIns(3)P or PI(3)K (Vps34p), and Vac1p FYVE finger mutant missorting phenotypes are suppressed by a defective allele of VPS34, indicating that PtdIns(3)P may play a regulatory role, possibly involved in mediating Vac1p protein-protein interactions through the FYVE finger (19Tall G.G. Hama H. DeWald D.B. Horazdovsky B.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1873-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that the FYVE finger of Hrs is not required for early endosomal localization of Hrs. We also showed that Hrs membrane association is not dependent on PtdIns(3)P. Like EEA1 and Vac1p, the FYVE finger of Hrs may be required for its interaction with other protein(s). Rab5 would be a candidate molecule that interacts with the FYVE finger of Hrs. However, no interaction between Hrs and the wild-type Rab5b or constitutively activated Rab5b (Rab5bQ79L) was detected by yeast two-hybrid analysis (data not shown). Thus, protein(s) other than Rab5 may interact with Hrs through the FYVE finger and may modulate the function of Hrs. A domain required for early endosomal targeting of Hrs was identified within the proline- and glutamine-rich region. The sequence of the domain did not show any similarity with those of other proteins. Proline-rich regions and glutamine-rich regions of several proteins have been shown to be involved in multiple protein interactions (21Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 22Colgan J. Wampler S. Manley J.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Kim T.K. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the newly identified domain may mediate interaction of Hrs with a protein that is localized on early endosomes. Rab5 is one of the early endosomal proteins, but, as described above, Hrs does not seem to bind to Rab5. Two Hrs-binding proteins, STAM and Hbp, were identified (4Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Takata H. Kato M. Denda K. Kitamura N. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but Hrs binds to them through the coiled-coil motif outside the proline- and glutamine-rich region. Thus, it is not known at present whether the domain involved in endosomal targeting of Hrs mediates interaction of Hrs with an endosomal protein. Alternatively, it is possible that Hrs associates directly with endosomal membranes through the domain. Further characterization is required to understand the mechanism by which the domain mediates interaction of Hrs with endosomal membranes. Overexpression of Hrs causes the aggregation of early endosomes, which is observed by immunoelectron microscopy (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The aggregation is observed as large sized early endosomes when analyzed by immunofluorescence staining (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study, we also observed large early endosomes in cells expressing some Hrs mutants. Expansion of early endosomes is observed in Hrs knockout cells (24Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Hrs regulates docking and/or fusion of endosomal membranes. Overexpression of the truncated form of Hrs that consists of only the C-terminal half (Hrs391–775) did not affect the size of early endosomes. Thus, the remaining N-terminal half appears to be involved in the aggregation of early endosomes. This region contains the N-terminal VHS domain, the FYVE finger, and the C-terminal proline-rich region. Overexpression of Hrs lacking the entire FYVE finger still results in large early endosomes (2Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), indicating that the FYVE finger does not mediate the aggregation of early endosomes. VHS domains are present in proteins involved in endocytosis and vesicular trafficking (25Lohi O. Poussu A. Meriläen J. Kellokumpu S. Wasenius V.-M. Lehto V.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21408-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Lohi O. Lehto V.-P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, the VHS domain of Hrs may be involved in the aggregation of early endosomes. Although the three-dimensional structure of the VHS domain has been revealed (27Mao Y. Nickitenko A. Duan X. Lloyd T.E. Wu M.N. Bellen H. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), its role in the function of Hrs is not known. Identification of the domain involved in the aggregation of early endosomes may reveal the regulatory role of Hrs in docking and/or fusion of endosomal membranes. We thank Dr. H. Stenmark for providing pGEM-EEA1."

In platelets and in fibroblasts, elevation of intracellular calcium levels induce Ral activation independently of Ras activation (13Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H.

This suggests that, in addition to RalGDS, Rgl, and Rlf, other Ral regulatory proteins exist. Indeed, Rsc, a fusion protein isolated from a rabbit squamous cell carcinoma, has RalGEF activity and appears to lack an RBD (19D'Adamo D.R. Novick S. Kahn J.M. Leonardi P. Pellicer A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RalGTP levels are also regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), including a high molecular mass RalGAP purified from brain and testis and a 43-kDa RalGAP in human platelets (20Bhullar R.P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9703-9706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, RalA interacts with calmodulin (22Wang K.L. Khan M.T. Roufogalis B.D. J. Biol.

In addition to proteins that regulate its activity, Ral interacts with several other proteins which may function as effectors. The active, GTP-bound form of Ral associates with RalBP (24Park S.H.

RalBP is a GAP for Cdc42, a small GTPase involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and filopodia formation in fibroblasts (27Hall A. Science. 1998; 280: 2074-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, RalBP associates with Reps1 and POB1, two proteins implicated in endocytosis (12Nakashima S. Morinaka K.

RalGTP also binds to ABP280/filamin1, a cross-linker of actin filaments and a scaffold for several other proteins. This complex may mediate Cdc42-induced filopodia formation (11Ohta Y. Suzuki N.

Finally, Ral associates with the small GTPase Arf and phospholipase D in a nucleotide-independent manner (30Jiang H. Luo J.Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A.

Both phospholipase D and Arf have been implicated in many processes, including vesicular transport (34Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

All these interactions point to a function of Ral in the control of the actin cytoskeleton and processes related to this, such as establishing cell polarity, migration, and vesicular transport (see Ref. 38Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the identification of a novel Ral-specific GEF, RalGEF2. This GEF has a characteristic Cdc25-like catalytic domain at the N terminus and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the C terminus. This PH domain functions as a membrane anchor necessary for optimal activity of RalGEF2 in vivo. The KIAA0351 cDNA containing the complete coding sequence was kindly provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. This cDNA was isolated in a random cloning strategy (39Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction fragment containing RalGEF2 flanked by a SalI site at the 5′ (primer A: 5′-GTCGACTATGTACAAGAGGAATGGTCTG-3′) and a HpaI site at the 3′ (primerB: 3′-CGTTTGGAATACAGTAAACTCCAATTGATC-5′) end, was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). This clone was subsequently used to generate HA-RalGEF2, by introducing a SalI fragment containing RalGEF2 into SalI-digested pMT2-SM-HA. Cat-RalGEF2 (amino acids 1–289), flanked by a SalI site at the 5′ end (primer A) and a HpaI site at the 3′ end (primer C: 3′-CGAGTCTTAGCTTGGTCCTTTACAATTG), and ΔPH-RalGEF2 (amino acids 1–431), flanked by a SalI site at the 5′ end (primer A) and a HpaI site at the 3′ end (primer D: 3′-CTTGAGGCGTCGACACGGTCAATTG-5′), were also subcloned in pGEM-T. These SalI-HpaI fragments were also cloned into SalI-HpaI-digested pBluescript in which SalI-NotI Rlf-ΔRBD-CAAXhad been cloned previously to obtain RalGEF2 proteins with the C-terminal polybasic sequence and CAAX box of Ki-Ras (5Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SalI-NotI fragments from these clones were isolated and ligated intoSalI-NotI-digested pMT2-SM-HA to generate HA-cat-RalGEF2-CAAX (HA-cat-CAAX) and HA-ΔPH-RalGEF2-CAAX (HA-ΔPH-CAAX). In addition, cat-RalGEF2 and ΔPH-RalGEF2 were also isolated asSalI-NotI fragments from the pGEM-T constructs and cloned into SalI-NotI-digested pMT2-SM-HA vector, generating HA-cat-RalGEF2 (HA-cat) and HA-ΔPH-RalGEF2 (HA-ΔPH). From HA-cat-RalGEF2, the mutants HA-catRalGEF2 L148A and HA-catRalGEF2 ΔSALQS were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. GST fusion constructs were made by isolatingSalI-NotI fragments from the HA-RalGEF2, HA-cat-RalGEF2-CAAX, and HA-ΔPH-RalGEF2-CAAXconstructs and cloning these fragments intoXhoI-NotI-digested pGEX-4T3 bacterial expression vector, generating, respectively, GST-RalGEF2, GST-cat, and GST-ΔPH. RalGEF2 was found by searching data bases for proteins containing Cdc25 catalytic domain homology. RalGEF2 was analyzed for protein domains using the ISREC ProfileScan server. The structurally conserved region (scr) sequence was defined from a comparison of various Ras and RalGEFs using the clustalX (40Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Bacteria were collected and lysed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. The lysates were sonicated three times for 20 s and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. GST fusion proteins were purified from the cleared lysate by batchwise incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), and after washing the protein was eluted from the beads in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm glutathione. The eluted protein was dialyzed for 20 h in the same buffer without glutathione. The purification procedure of the small GTPases used in the in vitro experiments is described elsewhere (42Herrmann C.

The antiserum used for detecting endogenous RalGEF2 was raised against a synthetic peptide that consists of the amino acids 543–557 (KSNRPQVPANLMSFE) of RalGEF2. Other antibodies used are anti-HA (12CA5) (45Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar), anti-Ral, anti-Ras, and anti-Rap (all three from Transduction Laboratories). Anti-RalGEF2 and 12CA5 were also used to perform immunoprecipitations. Cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged versions of the small GTPases either alone or in combination with RalGEF2, and serum-starved for 20 h prior to lysis. GTP-bound forms of the different GTPases were isolated using activation-specific probes and subsequently quantified, as described (13Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H.

For RalGTP the Ral-binding domain of RLIP was used, for Ras the RBD of Raf1, and for Rap the RBD of RalGDS. In vitroGEF activity was measured as described (48van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 nm purified GTPase, loaded with fluorescently labeled 2′,3′-bis(O)-N-methylantharanoloyl guanosine diphosphate (mantGDP), was incubated, in the presence of excess unlabeled GDP (5 mm), with 50 nm of purified GST-cat in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmMg2+, and 5 mm dithioerythritol at 20 °C. Release of mantGDP was measured in real time as a decrease in fluorescence using a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer LS50B (excitation wavelength 366 nm, emission wavelength 450 nm). This decrease in fluorescence is caused by quenching of released mantGDP by water. In the Ral assay, 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to stabilize the protein. Alternatively, we used a reverse assay (49Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in which 150 nm RalGDP was added to a cuvette containing 100 nm mantGDP either alone or in the presence of 50 nm purified GEF protein. Uptake of mantGDP results in an increase in fluorescence. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm aprotinin) and subsequently homogenized through a 23-gauge 1.25 Microlance syringe. Intact cells and nuclear components were removed by a sequential two-step centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 1 min (Eppendorf table centrifuge). Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min. The supernatant was collected as the soluble fraction, and the particulate fraction was dissolved in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm vanadate, 1 μmleupeptin, and 0.1 μm aprotinin. Soluble and particulate fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In our ongoing search for regulators of Ras family members, we found a protein in the data base from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KIAA0351) with similarities to RasGEFs. A schematic representation of the non-coding and coding sequences of KIAA0351 is presented in Fig.1 A. As shown below, this protein is a GEF for the small GTPase Ral; hence, we named it RalGEF2, since this GEF forms a novel subclass, distinct from the RalGEF members, which are characterized by the presence of the RBD domain (Fig. 1 B). RalGEF2 has the characteristic GEF domain present in all RasGEFs and shows considerable homology to previously described RasGEFs, especially in the structurally conserved regions scr1, scr2, and scr3 (data not shown). In addition, RalGEF2 has a PH domain in its C terminus that shows highest homology to the PH domain in theDrosophila RhoGEF Still Life (Sif) (50Sone M. Hoshino M. Suzuki E. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Nakagoshi H. Saigo K. Nabeshima Y. Hama C. Science. 1997; 275: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal PH domains in the RacGEFs Tiam1 and Stef (51Habets G.G.

Surprisingly, no Ras exchange motif (REM) is present in RalGEF2, in contrast to all other Cdc25-like GEFs identified so far. A polyclonal antibody (α-RalGEF2) was raised against a C-terminal peptide of RalGEF2. This antibody recognized the 60-kDa HA-RalGEF2 protein immunoprecipitated from Cos7 cell lysate transiently transfected with HA-RalGEF2 using an α-HA-monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2). A similar-sized protein was identified in an α-RalGEF2 immunoprecipitate from 293 cells. Both protein bands disappeared when the antibody was preincubated with the immunizing peptide. From this result, we concluded that α-RalGEF2 recognizes RalGEF2 both in immunoprecipitation and blotting experiments. Next, a Western blot containing protein samples from various human tissues was probed with either α-RalGEF2 or α-RalGEF2 blocked with peptide. As shown in Fig. 2 B, RalGEF2 expression is rather ubiquitous. It is high in brain, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, and colon; low in pancreas, skeletal muscle, thymus, and liver; and intermediate in lung and spleen. Ubiquitous expression of RalGEF2 was also shown using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. To investigate which Ras-like GTPase is activated by RalGEF2, we incubated GST-cat (Fig. 3 A) with various Ras-like GTPases loaded with fluorescent mantGDP. Release of guanine nucleotide bound to Ral was measured in real time as decrease in fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3 B, incubation of Ral-mantGDP alone already resulted in a decrease in fluorescence, indicating that a fraction of the protein sample was unstable and degraded during the incubation. In the presence of GDP, intrinsic exchange activity is measured. We observed a clear increase in exchange when GST-cat was added as well, showing that GST-cat catalyzes Ral guanine nucleotide exchange. GST-cat did not affect the exchange rate of either Ras or Rap2 (Fig. 3 C). As an alternative assay, we used a reverse procedure in which binding of mantGDP to Ral results in an increase in fluorescence. mantGDP was incubated either alone, in the presence of GST-cat or in the presence of GST-Rlf and RalGDP was added. As shown in Fig. 3 D, both GST-cat and GST-Rlf catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange. Surprisingly, when a shorter version of Ral lacking an additional 28 residues at the C terminus was used in the assay, GST-cat failed to induce exchange, in contrast to GST-Rlf. This effect was also observed when corresponding Drosophila Ral proteins were used (data not shown). To investigate whether GST-cat may still bind to Ral, we pre-incubated Ral-mantGDP and GST-cat for prolonged period of time followed by the addition of GST-Rlf. GST-cat did not affect the ability of GST-Rlf to induce exchange (Fig.3 E), indicating that RalGEF2 fails to interact stably with the C-terminally truncated protein. From these results we conclude that RalGEF2 is indeed a GEF for Ral, and that, in contrast to Rlf, RalGEF2 requires the C-terminal 28 residues of Ral for proper interaction. Subsequently, we analyzed whether RalGEF2 also activates Ral in vivo. HA-RalGEF2 was cotransfected with HA-tagged RalA in Cos7 cells, and Ral activity was measured using activation-specific probes. As shown in Fig. 4 A, cotransfection with RalGEF2 resulted in a clear activation of Ral. In contrast, RalGEF2 displayed only marginal activity for HA-Ras and no exchange activity for HA-Rap1 in vivo (Fig. 4, Band C). From this result we conclude that RalGEF2 selectively activates Ral in vivo. Next, we addressed the question whether indeed the GEF activity is responsible for this effect. HA-cat-CAAX, which is described below, activates cotransfected HA-Ral. We made mutants of this protein in a region that is fully conserved in all human RalGEFs, located in the scr2, in order to abolish its catalytic activity. We found that both HA-cat L148A and HA-cat ΔSALQS (residues 146–150) failed to activate HA-Ral (Fig. 4 D). From these data we conclude that activation of Ral in vivo is directly mediated by the catalytic activity of RalGEF2. PH domains commonly interact with membrane lipids, in particular phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipids. As such, PH domains function either as membrane anchor or as a regulatory domain that responds to the products of PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. To determine whether RalGEF2 responds to PI3K signaling, we introduced RalGEF2 in A14 cells and stimulated the cells with insulin, a potent inducer of PI3K activity (45Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any increase in RalGEF2 activity by insulin treatment (data not shown). Additionally, other stimuli tested, including epidermal growth factor, endothelin, forskolin, ionomycin, lysophosphatidic acid, and serum, failed to activate RalGEF2. We therefore investigated whether the PH domain is involved in membrane localization of RalGEF2. Cells were transfected with HA-RalGEF2 or mutants lacking the PH domain (HA-ΔPH and HA-cat), and the presence of these proteins in the cytosol and the membrane-enriched particulate fraction was determined. Deletion of the PH domain resulted in a clear reduction of the level of RalGEF2 in the membrane fraction (Fig.5 A), indicating that the PH domain is involved in membrane localization of RalGEF2. This reduced association to membranes could be restored by adding the C-terminal polybasic domain and CAAX sequence of Ki-Ras to HA-ΔPH and HA-cat (HA-ΔPH-CAAX and HA-cat-CAAX). This region directs the addition of a C-terminal isoprenyl group and as a consequence membrane attachment (Fig. 5 A). Next, we investigated whether deletion of the PH domain also affects GEF activity in vivo. Cells were cotransfected with the various RalGEF2 constructs and HA-Ral, and the level of RalGTP was determined. Even at lower levels of expression (Fig. 5 B,upper panel), full-length RalGEF2 is much more efficient in activating Ral than the mutant lacking the PH domain (Fig.5 B), showing that the PH domain is required for efficient RalGEF2 activity. The reduced GEF activity of HA-ΔPH can be restored by the addition of a membrane anchor (HA-ΔPH-CAAX; Fig.5 C). Similarly, addition of the CAAX domain to HA-cat increased the efficiency of Ral guanine nucleotide exchange activity (Fig. 5 D). From these results we conclude that the PH domain of RalGEF2 is a membrane-targeting sequence responsible for efficient RalGEF activity. We have identified a novel GEF for the small GTPase Ral, RalGEF2. This is a ubiquitously expressed protein that is particularly abundant in brain, heart, kidney, adrenal gland, and colon. Previously, four other RalGEFs have been identified, including RalGDS, Rgl, and Rlf. These GEFs have in addition to the catalytic region a C-terminal Ras binding domain. The most striking characteristic of RalGEF2 is its PH domain. This domain is most similar to PH domains present in the Rho/RacGEFs Tiam1, SIF, and Drosophila Still life. PH domains may bind to phosphatidylinositol lipids, which are either constitutively present or which are induced by certain stimuli. For instance, the product of PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, recruits target proteins to the membrane by binding to their PH domains (53Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 54Fruman D.A. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1999; 97: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) Via this relocalization, a protein is for instance either brought into the vicinity of its target or of its activators. However, the fact that insulin, a very strong inducer of PI3K, fails to activate RalGEF2 suggests that RalGEF2 activity is not induced by these lipids. Thus, the PH domain may serve to constitutively anchor RalGEF2 to membranes. Indeed, deletion of the PH domain results in an increased cytoplasmic localization of the protein and a corresponding reduction in the efficiency of Ral activation in vivo. Both membrane localization and efficient GEF activity could be restored by the addition of the C-terminal polybasic region and CAAXmotif of Ki-Ras, which targets proteins to the membranes. From these results, we conclude that the PH domain is predominantly responsible for membrane localization of RalGEF2. Our failure to induce the activity of RalGEF2 by external stimuli may indicate that RalGEF2 is a constitutively active GEF, or that we have not yet identified the proper stimulus. Whereas Ral clearly serves as a downstream target of Ras signaling, through the direct binding of members of RalGDS, Rgl and/or Rlf to activated Ras, it is clear from several studies that other pathways are also mediating Ral activation. For instance, calcium can activate Ral independently of Ras (13Wolthuis R.M. Franke B. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Hofer F. Berdeaux R. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while in neutrophils as yet unidentified pathways exist (15M'Rabet L. Coffer P.J. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21847-21852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RalGEF2 may mediate one of these pathways. RalGEF2 is distinct from the other RalGEFs in that it does not have a REM domain. This REM domain is thought to play a role in stabilizing the catalytic domain of Ras-like GEFs. Perhaps the PH domain or another region serves a similar function. An additional striking difference between RalGEF2 and other RalGEFs, in particular Rlf, is that RalGEF2 does not exchange nucleotide in vitro from a truncated version of Ral. Apparently the C-terminal region of Ral contains amino acids essential for the proper binding of the catalytic domain of RalGEF2. Whether RalGEF2 directly interacts with this region, or if the absence of the REM domain is responsible for this difference awaits further investigation. However, this result clearly indicates that RalGEF2 uses a different molecular mechanism to release GDP from Ral than Rlf does. Ral has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes. Most notable is the role of Ral in coupling signals from Ras to the induction of transcription, such as transcription from serum response elements (5Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 55Fuller S.J. Finn S.G. Downward J. Sugden P.H. Biochem.

However, the mechanism by which Ral regulates transcription is unclear. Another function of Ral is the regulation of the cytoskeleton. This is indicated by the association of the active form of Ral with RalBP, a GAP for the small GTPase Cdc42, and to filamin/ABP280, a protein involved in the cross-linking of actin filaments. Indeed, Ral was found to mediate Cdc42-induce filopodia formation. Finally, Ral has been implicated in vesicular trafficking. Ral localizes in part in vesicular membranes, and, recently, it was shown that Ral, through RalBP and the RalBP-associated proteins Reps1 and Pob1, is involved in the regulation of receptor endocytosis. In addition, Ral mediates FcεRI-induced histamine secretion (15M'Rabet L. Coffer P.J. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F. Koenderman L. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21847-21852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It may be that all these effects are pleiotropic, resulting from the activation of a single pool of active Ral. As a consequence, RalGEF2 may be involved in each of these processes. Alternatively, the distinct regulatory mechanism of RalGEF2 exchange activity, PH domain-dependent membrane localization, suggests the possibility that compartmentalized activation of Ral may regulate distinct functions of Ral.

The lipoproteins of prokaryotes were synthesized and translocated across the inner membrane, and the N-terminal cysteine residue in the mature protein formed a thioether with diglyceride. This was followed by cleavage of the signal peptide by the lipoprotein signal peptidase and then aminoacylation of the cysteine residue (17Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting lipoprotein is localized to either the inner or the outer membrane depending on the amino acid residue next to the lipid-modified cysteine (18Yamaguchi K., Yu, F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 19Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most lipoproteins localizing in the outer membrane are transported by the lipoprotein-specific transporter (19Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and are anchored in the membrane via the fatty acid residue (17Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If P. aeruginosa had the lipoprotein transporter similar to the Lol system in Escherichia coli (19Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), OprM may be transported to and anchored in the outer membrane via the fatty acid moiety. On one hand the membrane-spanning outer membrane proteins fold the β-barrel structure without exception (20Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N.

This is the underlying ambiguity in the membrane topology and function of OprM of the MexAB-OprM pump. We investigated this problem and report that the polypeptide moiety of OprM protrudes to the periplasmic space and is anchored to the outer membrane via N-terminal cysteine linked to the fatty acid moiety and functions in situ.

Open table in a new tab The plasmid-encoded proteins were expressed in either one of the host strains described below. This was carried out by the procedure reported earlier (15Yoneyama H. Maseda H. Kamiguchi H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4628-4634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that OprM was immunoprecipitated with anti-OprM antibody. Preparation of the plasmid DNA, the restriction enzyme treatment, ligation, and transformation were carried out essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All the PCR products were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. Genetic constructions were carried out on E. coli hosts DH5α or XL10-Gold, and the constructed plasmids were transformed to P. aeruginosa. The chromosomal oprM was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers, AGCGAGCTCAGCAGGCGTCCGTCGAAAAGG and CAGAAGCTTGCATGGCGCGGAAG, respectively. The product was treated with SacI and HindIII, cloned on pMMB67EH, and treated with SacI and HindIII yielding pOprM. Next, the oprM fragment on pNOT322 (28Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers, ATCCTCGAGGCCGAGCAC and CGGAAGCTTGGCGCGGAAGGCGATCAGTGGTGATGGTGGTGATGAGCCTGGGGATCTTCCTTCTTCG, respectively. After the T4 polymerase treatment, the product was ligated to pHSG398 treated with SmaI. The XhoI-HindIII fragment derived from this newly constructed plasmid was ligated to pOprM1 (29Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Gotoh N. Nishino T. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) treated with XhoI and HindIII yielding pOprM-His. The histidine-tagged OprM was used to purify and determine amino acid sequence of the protein. We constructed the oprM gene by replacing the signal sequence including Cys-18 with the signal sequence of azurin, a periplasmic protein (15Yoneyama H. Maseda H. Kamiguchi H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4628-4634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We first amplified oprM by inserting XhoI and EcoRI sites using forward and reverse primers, AGGCTCGAGCCTGATCCCCGACTACCAG and GCAGAATTCTTGCATGGCGCGGAAGG, respectively. The PCR product was treated with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated to pHSG398 carrying the Azu signal sequence pretreated with SalI and EcoRI. The HindIII-EcoRI fragment of azu(signal)-oprM was subcloned to pMMB67HE and pretreated with HindIII and EcoRI. We constructed OprM containing an N-terminal transmembrane segment of MexF and a polyhistidine6 tag at the C-terminal end. Three different lengths of the mexFfragment were amplified by PCR using the forward primer, GCGGAGCTCCGCGGCGATAGGAAGAACCG, and one of three reverse primers, GTGCTGCAGCACTTCCGGGTATTCGCTGAT, CAGCTGCAGGTCGCCGAGGCCGAACAACTG, or CTGCTGCAGGACGATGGAGTAGTCCATGCC. These three fragments encode N-terminal 42, 186, or 331 amino acid residues of the MexF protein (30Kohler T. Michea-Hamzehpour M. Plesiat P. Kahr A.L. Pechere J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2540-2543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the oprM fragment lacking the signal sequence including Cys-18 was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers AGCCTGCAGTCGCTGATCCCCGACTAC and CAGAAGCTTGCATGGCGCGGAAGGCGATCA, respectively. The mexF fragments digested with SacI and PstI and the oprM fragment digested with PstI and HindIII were ligated to pHSG397 digested with SacI and HindIII. The resulting mexF-oprM on pHSG397 was treated with SacI and BamHI and ligated to pOprM or pOprM-His digested with SacI and BamHI to yield pMexF-OprM and pMexF-OprM-His, respectively. We replaced cysteine 18 with glycine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan by site-directed mutagenesis by the splicing-overlapping extension method (31Horton R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 15: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar) using the oprM gene cloned on pHSG398 as a template. The primers used were forward (A), TACGCAAGGCGACAAGGTGCTGATG (based on the sequence of pHSG398) and (B) CTTCAGCGTCAGGTAGGCG (based on oprM). The forward primers (C) used to insert C18G, C18F, and C18W were CTGTCCGGCGGCTCGCTGAT, GTCCGGCTTCTCGCTGAT, and GTCCGGCTGGTCGCTGAT, respectively. The reverse primers (D) for C18G, C18F, and C18W were CGGGGATCAGCGAGCCGCCG, CGGGGATCAGCGAGAAGCCG, and CGGGGATCAGCGACCAGCCG, respectively. The first PCR was carried out using primers A and D and the second PCR was carried out using primers C and B. The third PCR was carried out using the first and the second PCR products as the templates and A and B primers. The third PCR product was treated with SalI and SacI and ligated to pOprM or pOprM-His treated with SalI and SacI yielding, for example, pOprM(C18G) and pOprM(C18G)-His for C18G and C18G-His-tag, respectively. A preculture grown overnight in 40 ml of L-broth was diluted into 400 ml of fresh prewarmed L-broth and incubated at 37 °C until A600 units reached about 1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside up to 2 mm was added as needed. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 0.2 m MgCl2 in the cell to buffer ratio of 1:5 (w/w). The cell suspension was placed in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min and in an icy water bath for 15 min for two cycles. Cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 10 °C (32Lei Y. Satake S. Ishii J. Nakae T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 64: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 60 min at 10 °C. This centrifuged supernatant was saved as the periplasmic material. Cells were fractionated by the EDTA-lysozyme method as described previously (33Mizuno T. Kageyama M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was quantified by the method of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal signal sequence of OprM bears a lipid modification consensus sequence, LSGC (8Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether OprM contains fatty acid, we carried out a [3H]palmitic acid incorporation experiment. Fluorography of the materials collected by the anti-OprM antibody from cells expressing the wild-type OprM showed a radioactive 52-kDa protein corresponding to the size of the wild-type OprM (Fig.1, lane pOprM). In contrast, OprM was undetectable in the similarly treated materials from the OprM deletion mutant, TNP072 (lane TNP072). These results assured that OprM was a lipoprotein. We designed an experiment to replace the OprM signal sequence including Cys-18 with a signal sequence of azurin. We found that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of OprM encoded by the azu-oprM fusion gene was AESSLIPDYQ, which is identical to the sequence designed for Azu(signal)-OprM. The cellular fractionation experiment revealed that the majority of OprM was located in the periplasmic space (Fig.2, lane pAzu-OprM). The protein band below the mature OprM was probably proteolytically cleaved OprM. A considerable amount of OprM was found at the inner membrane fraction but not in the outer membrane (Fig.3). When this mutant was subjected to the [3H]palmitate uptake experiment, we found a trace of radioactive OprM, but the amount was far less than in the wild-type OprM (Fig. 1, lane pAzu-OprM). A trace of labeling was probably due to the uptake of degraded radioactive materials.Figure 3Membrane localization of the Azu-OprM hybrid protein. The outer and inner membrane fractions were prepared from the cells expressing plasmid-borne OprM by the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” and 15 μg of protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. OprM protein was expressed in TNP072 lacking chromosomal oprM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When this mutant protein was expressed in the host lacking OprM, the cell exhibited 16-fold higher MICs of erythromycin, ofloxacin, and aztreonam, and an 8-fold higher MIC of chloramphenicol than the MICs in the cell lacking OprM. These values were indistinguishable from that in the wild-type strain demonstrating that the mutant OprM was fully functional without anchoring the outer membrane (TableII). Note that the amount of the plasmid-borne OprM was severalfold higher than that encoded by chromosomal oprM (Fig. 2).Table IIMinimum inhibitory concentration of antibioticsStrainsPlasmidMICErythromycinAztreonamOfloxacinChloramphenicalmg/literPAO4290None4003.130.7850TNP072None250.20.053.13TNP072pMMB67EH250.20.053.13TNP072pOprM4003.130.7850TNP072pOprM(C18G)2003.130.7850TNP072pOprM(C18F)2003.130.7850TNP072pOprM(C18W)2003.130.7850TNP072pAzu-OprM4003.130.7825TNP072pMexF(42)-OprM500.390.13.13TNP072pMexF(186)-OprM2003.130.3925TNP072pMexF(331)-OprM2003.130.3925MIC of antibiotics was determined by the 2-fold dilution method. Open table in a new tab MIC of antibiotics was determined by the 2-fold dilution method. Next, we attached the transmembrane segment of MexF to the N-terminal end of OprM. MexF is the inner membrane subunit of the P. aeruginosa MexEF-OprN pump, which is not expressed under normal growth conditions (36Kohler T. Kok M. Michea-Hamzehpour M. Plesiat P. Gotoh N. Nishino T. Curty L.K. Pechere J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2288-2290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this protein shows high homology to MexB, it was assumed that the protein would span the membrane several times. We fused mexF encoding N-terminal consisting of a 42-, 186-, or 331-amino acid residue with oprM encoding signal sequence-less OprM tagged with polyhistidine. We first investigated localization of the hybrid proteins and found that protein bands with a molecular mass of about 56, 72, and 86 kDa corresponding to OprMs containing 42, 186, and 331 residues of MexF polypeptide, respectively, were located in the inner membrane (Fig.4). None of these hybrid proteins was detectable in the outer membrane (Fig. 4) or in the periplasmic fraction (data not shown). We confirmed that all these hybrid proteins contained an N-terminal sequence identical to MexF. The [3H]palmitate-labeling experiment showed that the proteins were delipidated (Fig. 5).Figure 5Fluorographic image of [3H]palmitate-labeled MexF-OprM hybrid protein. The experimental procedure was the same as described in the legend to Fig. 1. pMexF(42)-OprM-His, pMexF(186)-OprM-His, and pMexF(331)-OprM-His correspond to the hybrid protein containing 42, 186, and 331 amino acid residues from MexF, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MICs of aztreonam in cells expressing OprM with 42-, 186-, and 331-amino acid extensions were 0.39, 3.13 and 3.13 mg/liter, respectively (Table II). These results indicated that the MexF-OprM hybrid protein having 186 and 331 residues of MexF fully functioned as the MexAB-OprM efflux pump subunit whereas the hybrid protein with 42 residues was inactive (Table II). To identify the fatty acid modification site, we constructed a mutant bearing the OprM containing a glycine substitution for an 18-residue cysteine, a unique cysteine in OprM. Similarly, we also substituted Cys-18 with phenylalanine or tryptophan. To test whether these mutant OprMs retained the fatty acid, [3H]palmitate-labeling experiments were carried out. The results clearly demonstrated that radiolabeled OprM was undetectable in cells expressing Cys-18-modified OprM (Fig. 1). This result demonstrated that fatty acid modification in OprM occurred at the N-terminal cysteine residues. When the Cys-18-modified OprM was expressed in the strain lacking chromosomal oprM, MICs of antibiotics were fully restored to the level of the wild-type strain (Table II), demonstrating that fatty acid modification is not essential for pump function. A cellular fractionation experiment showed that the Cys-18-modified OprM was located in the periplasmic space (Fig. 2) but not in the outer membrane fraction (Fig. 6). A considerable amount of the OprM was seen in the inner membrane fraction (Fig. 6). The N-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed that two bands appearing in the membrane fraction (Fig. 6) were mature and premature OprMs. We tested whether inner membrane localization of OprM was a consequence of the interaction of OprM with MexA and MexB subunits by expressing the wild-type OprM in a host with or without the MexA and MexB subunits. We found only a small amount of the inner membrane-associated OprM in the host lacking MexA and MexB, whereas a significant quantity of OprM was seen in the wild-type strain (data not shown). We reported in this paper that the delipidated OprM is located in the periplasmic space and functions in situ. Furthermore, the inner membrane-anchored OprM via a transmembrane segment from MexF also had a full function despite the fact that the hybrid protein was exclusively located in the inner membrane. One may argue that a fraction of the mutant OprM is localized at the outer membrane. This is unlikely, however, because the lipoprotein transporter only recognizes and transports an acylated protein (19Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The results reported in this paper provide novel information for improved understanding of the transport mechanism by the RND family efflux pump in P. aeruginosa. The question now arises about whether the MexAB-OprM pump assembly alone can translocate the substrates across the outer membrane without the assistance of another auxiliary protein(s) such as TolC in the E. coli outer membrane. Although the classical view was that the outer membrane subunit forms a transmembrane channel across the outer membrane (1Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 2Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J.E. Nikaido H.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), in fact, all the transmembrane outer membrane proteins so far analyzed contain a β-barrel structure (20Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 21Weiss M.S. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Therefore, the OprM is distinct from a family of these membrane-spanning outer membrane proteins. Because membrane anchoring and topology of OprM is different from that of most other transmembrane outer membrane proteins, we propose designating the OprM protein as MexM and accordingly the oprM gene as mexM. A recent paper reported that MexM bears β-sheet-based 16-transmembrane segments across the outer membrane (37Wong K.K.Y. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This conclusion is unlikely for the following reasons. (i) Circular dichroism spectroscopy of homogeneously purified MexM revealed that MexM had 53, 0, and 47% contents of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coils, respectively. 2E. Yoshihara and T. Nakae, unpublished results. This result clearly ruled out the possibility that MexM forms β-strand-based 16-transmembrane segments because the outer membrane proteins with β-barrel structure had 60–70% contents of the β-sheet (38Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 8019-8029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nakamura K. Mizushima S. J. Biochem.

(ii) The lipoproteins of Gram-negative bacteria destined to reach the outer membrane are transported by the lipoprotein-specific Lol family transporter (19Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and are anchored in the outer membrane via fatty acids exposing most of the polypeptide moiety to the periplasmic space (17Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the present results, we propose a new model for the structure of RND multicomponent efflux pump assembly (Fig.7). The inner membrane pump subunit, MexB, crosses the membrane 12 times, having two large periplasmic domains at TMS-1 to TMS-2 and TMS-7 to TMS-8 (13Guan L. Ehrmann M. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10517-10522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion protein, MexA, is anchored in the inner membrane via fatty acid exposing most of the polypeptide to the periplasmic space (14Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Yoneyama H. Maseda H. Kamiguchi H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4628-4634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As we reported here, outer membrane lipoprotein, MexM, anchored the periplasmic side of the outer membrane and protruded the entire polypeptide portion into the periplasmic space. The MexA and MexM homologues of the pump assembly may interact with large periplasmic domains of the MexB homologues as illustrated in Fig. 7. It is possible that unidentified outer membrane protein(s) analogous to TolC of E. coli is involved in the xenobiotic export in P. aeruginosa. This newly proposed model prompted us to reconsider the role of membrane-associated periplasmic proteins, such as MexM and MexA, in the xenobiotic transport by the RND efflux pump assembly. During preparation of this manuscript, the authors learned that the three-dimensional structure of TolC, an E. coli outer membrane protein, was solved (16Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Huges C. Nature. 2000; 405: 714-919Crossref Scopus (849) Google Scholar). This protein spans the outer membrane by β-barrel structure formed with a trimeric aggregate. This protein is distinct from MexM because TolC is unacylated. The revised nucleotide sequence of MexM (OprM) has been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ nucleotide data bases with accession numberAB011381."

In agreement with experiment, we obtain exceptionally large metallic resistivities at large temperatures T. This illustrates that the apparent mean free path can be much shorter than the separation of the molecules. An interpretation of this result is given. The calculation also explains the linear behavior in T at small T."
https://openalex.org/W1985504400,"It has been assumed that cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide domain of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is required for enzyme function. We recently demonstrated that the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP is not cleaved and actually is required for function of the membrane-bound enzyme in transfected COS-1 cells (Cao, J., Drews, M., Lee, H. M., Conner, C., Bahou, W. F., and Zucker, S. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 34745–34752). In this report, we have inserted the cDNA encoding the signal and propeptide sequences of MT1-MMP (MT1–109) and the cDNA encoding propeptide-deleted mature MT1-MMP (MTΔpro) in expression vectors that were then transfected into matrix metalloproteinase-deficient COS-1 cells. Co-expression of both the mature sequence and the prosequence of MT1-MMP as independent polypeptides (intrans) in COS-1 cells resulted in reconstitution of MT1-MMP function in terms of facilitating 125I-labeled tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 binding to transfected cells and subsequent activation of progelatinase A. Transfection of cells with either cDNA alone resulted in non-functional cells. These results are consistent with the propeptide sequence of MT1-MMP functioning as an intramolecular chaperone involved in protein folding and trafficking to the cell surface. It has been assumed that cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide domain of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is required for enzyme function.

In this report, we have inserted the cDNA encoding the signal and propeptide sequences of MT1-MMP (MT1–109) and the cDNA encoding propeptide-deleted mature MT1-MMP (MTΔpro) in expression vectors that were then transfected into matrix metalloproteinase-deficient COS-1 cells.

Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) that are distinguished by their localization to the plasma membranes of cells by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (transmembrane domain) (2Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). MT-MMPs have been the subject of intense interest because of their role in activating a secreted MMP, progelatinase A, at the cell surface (1Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) and in directly cleaving collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins (3d'Ortho M.-P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G. Messent A. Gavrilovic J. Smith B. Timpl R. Zardi L. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Because activation of all soluble latent MMPs described to date is accompanied by cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide, thereby exposing the active site zinc by dissociation from the conserved cysteine in the prodomain, the assumption has been made that an analogous mechanism is responsible for the activation of MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Utilizing recombinant wild-type (wt) MT1-MMP cDNA and mutant MT1-MMP cDNAs transfected into cells lacking endogenous MT1-MMP, we have recently examined the function of the N-terminal propeptide domain of membrane-bound MT1-MMP. Contrary to expectation, we demonstrated that the N-terminal prodomain of wtMT1-MMP is required for function of the intact membrane-bound enzyme in COS-1 cells. Transfected COS-1 cells containing a deletion of the N-terminal propeptide domain of MT1-MMP or a chimeric construction in which the prodomain of MT1-MMP is substituted by the N-terminal propeptide domain of collagenase-3 were functionally inactive in terms of binding125I-labeled TIMP-2 to the cell surface and in initiating the activation of progelatinase A (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data led us to hypothesize that in its native plasma membrane-inserted form, the prodomain of MT1-MMP serves to facilitate the function of MT1-MMP as a receptor for TIMP-2 that subsequently immobilizes progelatinase A, thereby forming a trimolecular complex on the cell surface. A second free MT1-MMP molecule is then required to cleave the prodomain leading to activation of membrane-bound progelatinase A. The presence of excess TIMP-2 saturates all available MT1-MMP molecules, thereby interfering with progelatinase A activation. We proposed that conformational effects induced by the plasma membrane provide functional activity to latent cell surface-bound MT1-MMP without cleavage of the molecule (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M.

It needs to be emphasized that our understanding of the importance of the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP was possible only because COS-1 cells are defective in proteolytic processing of certain newly synthesized proteins (6Wuthrich M. Sterchi E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Even following co-transfection of furin cDNA and MT1-MMP cDNA, COS-1 cells do not process latent MT1-MMP (63 kDa) to mature MT1-MMP (58 kDa) (7Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the latent and mature forms of MT1-MMP are prominently displayed in several types of non-transfected cells capable of inducing progelatinase A activation (5Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.J.P. Cao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1216-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8Lehti K.

The goal of this report is to further clarify the role of the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP in maintaining the function of the plasma membrane-inserted enzyme. To this end, we have independently transfected or co-transfected COS-1 cells (in trans form) with the N-terminal prodomain cDNA for MT1-MMP and MT1-MMP cDNA lacking the propeptide domain (mature sequence). The results demonstrate that synthesis of the prosequence is required to obtain functional MT1-MMP and that a covalent link of the prosequence with the mature sequence of MT1-MMP in COS-1 cells is not required. Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pcDNA3 expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). The monoclonal antibody to hemagglutinin (HA) tag was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (clone 12 CA5). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to a synthetic peptide (CDGNFDTVAMLRGEM) within the catalytic domain (10Zucker S. Conner C. DiMassimo B.I. Ende H. Drews M. Seiki M. Bahou W.F. J. Biol.

Recombinant progelatinase A, produced by COS-1 cells transfected with gelatinase A cDNA, was purified as described previously (2Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol.

Interstitial collagenase-1 cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Chitra Biswas (Tufts University School of Medicine) (11Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mm glutamine under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmids were transfected into cells using calcium phosphate as described previously (2Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol.

MT1-MMP cDNA encoding an open reading frame from amino acid residues Metl–Va1582 and mutant MT1-MMP were cloned in a pcDNA3 expression vector employing a cytomegalovirus promoter (4Cao J. Drews M.

MTΔpro lacking the entire N-terminal propeptide domain was utilized in this study as we have previously described (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A chimera between collagenase-3 and MT1-MMP (Col-3/MT) was constructed by a two-step polymerase chain reaction using the introduced collagenase-3 fragment encoding the N-terminal signal and propeptide domain (from Met1 to Arg95) in an MT1-MMP plasmid that lacked the N-terminal signal and propeptide domains (from Met1 to Arg92) as we previously described (4Cao J.

To generate a mutation expressing the N-terminal propeptide of MT1-MMP (MT1–109), a polymerase chain reaction fragment encoding for the entire signal and propeptide domains of MT1-MMP (Metl-Arg109) (12Takino T. Sato H. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Gene. 1995; 155: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was amplified using the MT1-MMP cDNA template with the forward primer 1094 (5′ to 3′, CACGAATTCCGGACCATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGA) and the reverse primer 1095 (5′ to 3′, AAGGATCCCCTTCGAACATTGGCCTTGA). The polymerase chain reaction product was inserted in pcDNA3 expression vector withEcoRI and BamHI sites. Employing the same strategy, a truncated interstitial collagenase-1 (MMP-1) expressing N-terminal signal and propeptide domains (MMP-11–99) was constructed with the forward primer 1096 (5′ to 3′, AATACGACTCACTATAG) and the reverse primer 1097 (5′ to 3′, AAGGATCCCTGAGCCACATCAGGCACTC) and inserted in pcDNA3 vector. A sequence encoding the influenza HA, YPYDVPDYA (13Wilson I.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) at the 5′ end was inserted in frame with the coding sequence of mutations of MT1-MMP1–109 or MMP-11–99 to generate MT1–109/HA and MMP-11–99/HA. All of the mutants were confirmed by sequencing as described previously (7Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recombinant TIMP-2 (rTIMP-2) was iodinated as we recently described (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Binding of125I-labeled TIMP-2 to COS-1 cells propagated in 24-well dishes was performed in duplicate. For equilibrium binding experiments, dilutions of 125I-labeled TIMP-2 (0.1–2.5 nm) in bovine serum albumin/PBS buffer were added to cells in 200 μl of serum-free medium in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled recombinant TIMP-2. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, supernatant fluid and washes were collected as the unbound125I-TIMP-2 fraction. Cell monolayers were then lysed in 0.1% SDS in 0.1M NaOH and collected as the bound fraction. Bound and unbound 125I-labeled TIMP-2 was measured by gamma counting. The residual radioactivity associated with cells in the nonspecific binding experiment (20-fold excess TIMP-2) was subtracted from the total bound fraction (no unlabeled TIMP-2) to give specific binding. Scatchard plot analysis of binding data employed best-fit curves (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with MTΔpro, MT1-MMP, or pcDNA3 vector and seeded on glass coverslips precoated with 50 μg/ml type I collagen (Vitrogen 100; Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA). After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C followed by permeabilization of cells with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then blocked with 1% rabbit serum/PBS for 30 min and subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-MT1-MMP hinge antibody for 2 h at 22 °C. The coverslips were then washed four times, followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Chemicon) for 2 h at 22 °C. After extensive washes, the coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides with anti-fading medium (Vectashield-Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The cells were viewed and photographed with a Nikon confocal fluorescent microscope. Basic protocols for these techniques have been described in our recent papers (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C.

Western blotting for proteins <15 kDa was done using a modification of the tricine-SDS method involving 0.1 mtricine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.25, in a cathode buffer and 0.2m Tris, pH 8.9, in the anode buffer (14Schagger, H., and von Gagow, G. (1987) Anal. Biochem.368–379.Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins in the gel were transferred onto 0.5% gelatin-coated nitrocellulose paper at 55 V for 2 h. The blotting membrane was blocked, followed by addition of the primary antibody (antibody to the propeptide of MT1-MMP or antibody to HA tag) and then the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) as we previously described (4Cao J.

The expression plasmid encoding the cDNA for deletion mutants of MT1-MMP lacking all but the signal peptide and the entire propeptide domain was constructed and transfected into COS-1 cells as depicted in Fig. 1. Western blotting of conditioned media from the transfected COS-1 mutant MT1–109, using an antibody to the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP, resulted in staining of a single protein band migrating predictably at ∼9 kDa based on its truncated length (Fig.2 A).Figure 2A, expression of mutant MT1-MMP (N-terminal propeptide domain) in COS-1 cells. A plasmid encoding the N-terminal prodomain of MT1-MMP (MT1–109) was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. The secreted protein in serum-free conditioned medium was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody to the prodomain of MT1-MMP. The molecular mass of wild type MT1-MMP prodomain was detected at ∼9 kDa. Molecular mass markers are listed on the left. B, reconstitution of function (activation of progelatinase A) of N-terminal prodomain-deleted MT1-MMP by the prodomain of MT1-MMP (MT1–109) is dose-dependent, as demonstrated by co-transfection of plasmids in COS-1 cells (cDNA for the N-terminal prodomain-deleted MT1-MMP (MTΔpro) and the prodomain of MT1-MMP (MT1–109)). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA for progelatinase A, as well as cDNA, for vector (pcDNA3), MT1-MMP, MTΔpro, or MT1–109 using various combinations of plasmids. Serum-free conditioned medium was collected after an 18-h incubation of cells at 37 °C, and gelatin zymography was performed. Co-expression of MTΔpro and the prodomain of MT1-MMP (MT1–109) intrans resulted in activation of progelatinase A indicating that the independently synthesized prodomain of MT1-MMP has associated (non-covalent) with prodomain-deleted MT1-MMP and resulted in proteolytic activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 2 × 105COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with progelatinase A cDNA, as well as pcDNA3 vector, MT1-MMP cDNA, MT1–109, MTΔpro cDNA, or MTΔpro cDNA along with MT1–109cDNA. 24 h post-transfection, the enriched media was switched to serum-free media, and conditioned media was collected over the subsequent 18 h. As shown by gelatin zymography (Fig.2 B), expression of progelatinase A and MT1-MMP in COS-1 cells resulted in activation of the latent enzyme as depicted by the appearance of a 62-kDa gelatinolytic band. Co-expression of MT1–109 and MTΔpro in COS-1 cells in transform, i.e. as independent polypeptides, along with progelatinase A cDNA, resulted in activation of progelatinase A in a dose-dependent fashion; neither cDNA construct transfected alone into COS-1 cells resulted in progelatinase A activation. These data are consistent with the concept that the independently synthesized soluble prodomain of MT1-MMP is associated with prodomain-deleted MT1-MMP and is expressed at the cell surface leading to functional activity (activation of progelatinase A), thereby recapitulating the function of the intact MT1-MMP molecule. The combined effect of MT1–109 and MTΔpro was inhibited by transfecting these cells with excess TIMP-2 cDNA (Fig.3). We previously reported the same inhibitory effect of TIMP-2 on wtMT1-MMP activation of progelatinase A (5Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.J.P. Cao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1216-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A similar profile of MT1–109 cDNA and MTΔpro cDNA reconstituting gelatinase A activation function in transfected cells encoding the cDNA was also documented with Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). To examine the specificity of these observations, we determined whether the prodomain of MT1-MMP is able to provide function to an inactive chimeric mutation of MT1-MMP in which the propeptide domain of MT1-MMP is replaced by the propeptide domain of collagenase-3 (Col-3/MT). COS-1 cells, transiently transfected with both MT1–109 cDNA and Col-3/MT cDNA (Fig. 3, lane 5), did not activate progelatinase A. In this construct, the isolated prodomain of MT1-MMP presumably is unable to displace the prodomain of the inactive chimeric molecule; hence, activation of progelatinase A does not occur. We further determined whether the prodomain of a secreted MMP (MMP-1) was able to reconstitute the function of MTΔpro (Fig.4). To this end, MMP-11–99cDNA was co-transfected into COS-1 cells in trans along with MTΔpro cDNA; 24 h later recombinant progelatinase A was added, and cells were incubated as described above. Gelatin substrate zymography demonstrated that co-transfection with MMP-11–99 did not alter the lack of function of MTΔpro. Synthesis of MMP-11–99 by transfected COS-1 cells was documented by the introduction of an influenza HA epitope in the C terminus of MMP-11–99. Western blotting of conditioned medium using an anti-HA antibody demonstrated a peptide of approximately 11 kDa, consistent with the anticipated molecular mass of MMP-11–99. To determine whether the HA epitope might alter function of an MMP prodomain, the HA epitope was added to the cDNA for MT1–109. The HA tag did not impair the reconstitution of MT1–109 with MTΔpro as shown by functional assay in terms of progelatinase A activation. This result is consistent with the specific requirement for the prodomain of MT1-MMP for function of the molecule in cells. We next examined the effect of adding the recombinant N-terminal propeptide domain of MT1-MMP to COS-1 cells transfected with MTΔpro cDNA. Recombinant MT1–109 protein isolated from conditioned medium of COS-1 cells transfected with MT1–109cDNA did not reconstitute the activation of progelatinase A by COS-1 cells transfected with MTΔpro (Fig.5). This result suggests that the association between MTΔpro and MT1–109 protein takes place intracellularly during synthesis, folding, and transport of these proteins to the plasma membrane and cannot be replicated after insertion of MTΔpro in the plasma membrane (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In previous experiments we demonstrated that 125I-labeled TIMP-2 did not bind to COS-1 cells transfected with N-terminal propeptide domain-deleted MT1-MMP (MTΔpro) cDNA but readily bound to the surface of cells transfected with wtMT1-MMP cDNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TIMP-2 binds to the catalytic domain of intact membrane-inserted MT1-MMP (5Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.J.P.

To further examine the role of the N-terminal propeptide of MT1-MMP in TIMP-2 binding, we have examined COS-1 cells transfected with N-terminal propeptide (MT1–109) cDNA aloneversus dual transfection with MTΔpro and MT1–109 cDNA. Whereas 125I-labeled TIMP-2 did not bind to cells individually transfected with either MTΔpro or MT1–109 cDNA alone (data not shown; nonspecific binding exceeded specific binding. See Ref. 4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), specific binding was noted with cells transfected in trans with MT1–109 cDNA and MTΔpro cDNA (Kd = 0.48 nm; 7,000 receptors per cell) and wtMT1-MMP cDNA-transfected cells (Kd = 0.81 nm; 48,000 receptors per cell) (Fig. 6). These results were reproduced in two other experiments with the Kdbeing ∼1.6-fold higher and the receptor number being ∼7-fold higher in the wtMT1-MMP-transfected cells as compared with the dual-transfected cells. To examine the localization of MTΔpro, immunostaining and confocal fluorescent microscopy were performed. Both wtMT1-MMP and MTΔpro were identified on the cell surface (Fig. 7). Perinuclear staining (consistent with Golgi apparatus) was more prominent with MTΔpro than wtMT1-MMP-transfected cells. No fluorescence was noted in vector-transfected cells (negative control). These data are consistent with delayed trafficking of MTΔpro to the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal propeptide of MT1-MMP functions as a chaperone involved in protein folding and trafficking to the plasma membrane. The unique feature of MT-MMPs is their insertion into the plasma membrane of cells by a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids followed by a short cytoplasmic sequence. Because purified MT-MMPs cannot readily be evaluated in their membrane-bound state, most experiments designed to study the function of MT-MMPs have employed secreted (soluble) mutant MT1-MMP recombinants lacking the transmembrane domain (15Imai K.

Based on these studies, it has been concluded that cleavage of the N-terminal domain of membrane-bound MT-MMPs by furin, presumably in the trans-Golgi network, is required for function of the enzyme in activating progelatinase A and degrading other substrates (15Imai K.

Stoichiometric concentrations of TIMP-2, which forms an essential bridge between plasma membrane MT1-MMP and progelatinase A at the cell surface, are not required for activation of progelatinase A by soluble MT1-MMP (20Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Mestrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clemens J. d'Ortho M.-P. Murphy G. J. Biol.

As with naturally secreted MMPs, TIMP-2 function is limited to binding and inhibition of enzymatic activity of soluble prodomain-deleted MT1-MMP (16Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar, 18Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol.

We further demonstrated that cleavage of the N-terminal prodomain of MT1-MMP on the surface of transfected COS-1 cells was not required for function of the enzyme in terms of binding TIMP-2 and activating progelatinase A. In other cell types (i.e. endothelial cells, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma (9Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannicov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.Z. Goldberg G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar)), however, furin-induced cleavage of the N terminus is required for function of MT-MMP. To further examine the function of the prodomain of membrane-bound MT1-MMP, we herein have studied the effect of transfecting COS-1 cells with cDNA encoding the propeptide sequence of MT1-MMP (MT1–109) in trans with MT1-MMP cDNA lacking the propeptide domain (MTΔpro). This co-transfection, leading to independent synthesis of MT1–109 and MTΔpro proteins, resulted in reconstitution of MT1-MMP function in terms of binding TIMP-2 and activating progelatinase A at the cell surface. These results are consistent with the concept that the isolated propeptide domain of MT1-MMP is able to associate (presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum) with the remainder of the MT1-MMP molecule (catalytic/hinge/hemopexin domain) prior to trafficking to the plasma membrane and provide function to the reconstituted protein. However, the number of functioning MT-MMP units on the cell surface is diminished, presumably because of decreased efficiency of the binding process in the endoplasmic reticulum. For unexplained reasons, the dissociation constant (Kd) for TIMP-2 binding to non-covalent linked, reconstituted MT1-MMP was reproducibly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Co-transfection of COS-1 cells with the chimeric Col-3/MT cDNA and MT1–109 cDNA or MTΔpro cDNA and MMP-11–99 cDNA did not reconstitute progelatinase A activation function. These experiments strengthen our proposition that the isolated prodomain of MT1-MMP is capable of non-covalent bonding with MTΔpro, presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus prior to trafficking to the plasma membrane. Additional studies will be required to determine which amino acids in the prodomain are essential for enzyme function. As depicted in Fig.1 B, the sequence YGYLP is highly conserved in the propeptide of all MT-MMP subfamily members described to date, which leads us to suspect an important function for this sequence. Our previous study of membrane-inserted mutants of MT1-MMP suggested an important role of the Ser34–Arg51 region of the prodomain (4Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but it should be pointed out that a large deletion of this type may exert a deleterious effect on protein structure and stability. In contrast, substitution of the furin consensus sequence of MT1-MMP (Arg108–Arg109–Lys110–Arg111with Ala108–Arg109–Ala110–Ala111) in COS-1 cells resulted in no loss of function of this membrane-inserted mutant MT1-MMP (7Cao J. Rehemtulla A. Bahou W. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30174-30180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) indicating that this conserved sequence is not required for progelatinase A activation at the COS-1 cell surface. The N terminus of all secreted MMPs maintains the latency of the proteinase, while permitting controlled activation by cleavage of the propeptide (21Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 42: 197-250Crossref Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). In contrast, the propeptide regions of other types of enzymes serve different functions. An intact prosequence of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, an intestinal brush border enzyme, is necessary for enzyme trafficking to the plasma membrane (22Oberholzer T. Mantei N. Semenza G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some proregions act as potent inhibitors of the mature enzyme following cleavage (23Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Mach L. Mort J.S. Glossl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13036-13040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas longer proregions may act as intramolecular chaperones (25Shinde U. Inouye M. Bott R. Betzel C. Subtilisin Enzymes: Practical Protein Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1996: 147-154Google Scholar). Relevant to our reconstitution experiments with MTΔpro cDNA and MT1–109 cDNA dual-transfected cells (see above), covalent linkage of the prosequence to the protease domain of a protein is not essential for proper folding of subtilisin (25Shinde U.

In these instances, the prosequence can mediate the folding of the protease when added as a separate polypeptide chain (25Shinde U. Inouye M. Bott R. Betzel C.

Relevant to this discussion, a mutation lacking a single domain (designated MATH) of meprin α has been reported to be folded sufficiently for secretion of the protein but not sufficiently to generate an active protease from the proform of the enzyme (30Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP has a proregion with 77 amino acids at the N terminus, which is quite similar to other MT-MMP members. Our data suggest that proregion-deleted MT1-MMP progressed through the trafficking pathway in COS-1 cells more slowly than wild-type MT1-MMP and accumulated in the perinuclear region presumably as a result of delayed trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the plasma membrane. Although MTΔpro is expressed on the cell surface eventually, it has lost the striking features of MT-MMP function (binding TIMP-2 and activation of progelatinase A). Thus, we conclude that the proregion of MT1-MMP differs from the proregion of secretory MMPs by functioning as an intramolecular chaperone in trafficking the molecule to the cell surface and in maintaining the molecule in proper conformation for full enzymatic activity.

Langley for providing recombinant TIMP-2 antigen, Dr. Carlos Lopez-Otin for providing collagenase-3 cDNA, and Dr. Jolyon Jesty for advice in preparation of this manuscript."

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) has led to the hypothesis that nucleocytoplasmic transport is driven by a Ran gradient. In this model, RanGDP levels would be high in the cytoplasm because of the activity of the RanGAP, conversely, RanGTP levels would be high in the nucleus because of the activity of the RanGEF (16Bischoff F.R.

Consistent with the Ran compartmentalization model is the fact that RanGDP is required for protein translocation through the pore into the nucleus (22Moore M.S. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and RanGTP appears to be involved in the final release of the cargo complex into the nucleus (5Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In addition, RanGTP is required for re-export of importin-β to the cytoplasm and thus recycling of the soluble import factors (23Izaurralde E. Kutay U. Kobbe C.V. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 25Hieda M. Tachibana T. Yokoya F. Kose S. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. J.

NTF2 was originally identified as an activity that stimulates import of proteins into nuclei of permeabilized mammalian cells (26Moore M.S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays demonstrate that NTF2 binds to RanGDP, importin-β, and nuclear pore proteins containing phenylalanine-glycine (XFXFG) repeats (17Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,27Percipalle P. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Rhodes D. Stewart M. J. Mol.

Although NTF2 is highly conserved and deletion of the S. cerevisiae homologue is lethal (29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Nehrbass U. Blobel G. Science. 1996; 272: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), in some mammalianin vitro permeabilized import assays NTF2 is not required. This observation has been used to suggest that NTF2 may not be essential in higher eukaryotes. However, recent studies demonstrate that NTF2 acts as a mediator of RanGDP import into the nucleus to replenish the nuclear stores of RanGTP (18Ribbeck K. Lippowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 19Smith A. Brownwell A. Macara I.G. Curr.

These data suggest a critical role for NTF2 in establishing and maintaining the Ran gradient in vivo. Two possible pathways for Ran import into the nucleus by NTF2 can be derived from previous studies (Fig. 1). In model A, Ran is imported into the nucleus as an import complex containing import cargo/importin-α/β/RanGDP/NTF2. Once inside the nucleus this complex is disassociated by the exchange of RanGDP to RanGTP by the nuclear RanGEF. In this model RanGDP and NTF2 would form a complex that includes importin-β. This model is consistent within vitro binding assays demonstrating that NTF2 interacts directly with importin-β (27Percipalle P. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Rhodes D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in vitro binding assays have shown that importin-β has a low affinity for RanGDP unless the Ran-binding protein RanBP1 (Yrb1p in S. cerevisiae) is present (32Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In model B, import of Ran by NTF2 is independent of the importin-α/β/cargo complex. Once RanGDP reaches the nuclear face of the NPC, the exchange factor binds and exchanges GDP for GTP, and RanGTP, for which NTF2 has no detectable affinity, is released into the nucleus. This model predicts that two separate and distinct complexes are formed, the RanGDP/NTF2 complex and the importin-α/β/cargo complex, and that these complexes need never interact. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of Ran import into the nucleus to distinguish between the two models presented in Fig. 1. First, we show that NTF2 is required for Ran import into the nucleus in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We then demonstrate that Ran import is maintained in the absence of importin-β-mediated import of NLS cargo. Next, we show that NTF2 forms a complex containing Ran and nucleoporins but does not form a stable complex with importin-β. These results provide experimental evidence that the Ran/NTF2 import complex is separate from the importin-β import complex and show that Ran compartmentalization in the nucleus is primarily controlled through NTF2-mediated import. Consistent with the critical role of NTF2 in establishing and maintaining a Ran gradient, we also show that NTF2 is essential in the multicellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating for the first time that NTF2 is required for viability in higher eukaryotes.

Transformants were maintained in galactose media to induce continuous expression of the myc-NTF2 protein then shifted to glucose to shut off expression. The localization of scRan-GFP was monitored by directly viewing the GFP signal in living cells through a GFP optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. The plasmid pAC46 (CEN, LEU, rsl1-1) was transformed into the importin-β deletion strain ACY208. Transformants were streaked onto 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates and incubated at 25 °C to select for cells that had lost theURA3 plasmid containing the wild-type RSL1(importin-β) gene. These cells were then transformed with either pAC697 (GFP-LacZ-NLS) (35Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), pAC410 (scRan-GFP), or pAC709 (NTF2-GFP). Transformants were grown to log phase at 25 °C and split, half was shifted to 37 °C for 2.5 h, and GFP signals were detected as described above. All NTF2 proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously for rat NTF2 (28Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids were transformed intoE. coli BL21 (DE3). Transformants were inoculated into 2× tryptone-yeast extract medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml and grown overnight at 30 °C. It was not necessary to induce expression as the basal level of expression of the T7 polymerase yielded a large amount of Ntf2p. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until required. Ntf2p was isolated by thawing the cell pellet and resuspending in 25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell and treated with DNase I for 30 min at room temperature. The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm PMSF (NTF2 buffer A). The lysate was clarified at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and applied to DE52 ion exchange column (10 × 3 cm) and washed with NTF2 buffer A. Ntf2p was eluted from the column with a gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Ntf2p, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), were pooled, concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon) concentrator and applied to a column of Sephacryl SR100 pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm PMSF (NTF2 buffer B). Fractions containing Ntf2p were collected and pooled. Purified Ntf2p was cross-linked to CNBr-Sepharose beads as described previously (28Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, CNBr-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were swollen and washed in 1 mm HCl. Beads were transferred to coupling buffer (100 mmNaHCO3, pH 8.3, and 500 mm NaCl) and added to 2–5 mg of Ntf2p in coupling buffer. Coupling was carried out at 4 °C overnight. Residual active groups were blocked with 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were then washed successively and extensively four times in coupling buffer and acid wash buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and 500 mm NaCl). Yeast cell extracts were prepared from cultures grown overnight at 30 °C or at room temperature (for temperature-sensitive strains) in yeast extract-peptone dextrose (YEPD) medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with water. Cells were then resuspended in one volume of PBSMT (phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm PMSF and 3 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin/ml). One volume of glass beads was added, and cells were lysed with 10–15 60-s pulses in a bead beater (lysis was monitored by light microscopy to >70% lysis). The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation and assayed for protein concentration with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Two mg of yeast lysate was incubated with 50 μl of either Ntf2p-Sepharose beads or bovine serum albumin (BSA)-Sepharose beads. Binding was carried out in PBSM (phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5 mm MgCl2) (total volume, 500 μl) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were then washed two times for 10 min in PBSM and one time for 10 min in PBSMT. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of sample buffer, and 5 μl was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described (36Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Importin-β was detected by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against yeast importin-β95 (the generous gift of Dr. D. M. Koepp and Dr. P. Silver). Nsp1p was detected by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against theXFXFG repeats of Nsp1p (the generous gift of Dr. M. Stewart). scRan was detected by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against scRan (the generous gift of Dr. D. H. Wong and Dr. P. Silver). Yrb1p was detected by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Yrb1p (the generous gift of Dr. G. Schlenstedt and Dr. P. Silver). Importin-α was detected by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant yeast importin-α. For quantitation, films were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI scanning laser densitometer. The importin-β95GFP/myc-GSP1/GAL1-10-myc-NTF2 yeast strain BQY104 was constructed by integrating importin-β95GFP as described (37Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) into the genome of the GSP1Δ/GSP2Δ yeast (PSY962) maintained with a plasmid containing myc-scRan (pPS966) and transformed with pGAL1-10-myc-NTF2 (pAC611). BQY104 (importin-β95GFP/myc-GSP1/GAL1-10-myc-NTF2) cells were grown in galactose to induce expression of myc-NTF2. Lysates were made as described above, and 10 mg of BQY104 yeast extract was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 column, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Equal amounts of each fraction were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with anti-myc to detect Ntf2p and scRan, anti-GFP to detect importin-β95GFP, and anti-importin-α to detect importin-α. C. elegansstrains were cultured at 20 °C as described previously (38Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The single strain used in this study was ceh-22::GFP, which contains the ceh-22 promoter fused to the GFP coding sequence and integrated onto linkage group V (39Okkema P.G. Ha E. Haun C. Chen W. Fire A. Development. 1997; 124: 3965-3973PubMed Google Scholar). TheC. elegans NTF2 homologue was identified on cosmid R05D11.3. RNA corresponding to exons 2, 3, and 4 of the C. elegans NTF2 gene (see Fig. 8) was transcribed from pAC619 (ceNTF2) using the RiboMAX large scale RNA production system (Promega). Twenty ceh-22::GFP adult hermaphrodites were injected with dsRNA (40Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). As a negative control, 10 ceh-22::GFP adult hermaphrodites were injected with dsRNA corresponding to the clonedspe-9 gene (41Singson A. Mercer K.B. L'Hernault S.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which exhibits no detectable RNA interference phenotype. Injected adults were allowed to recover and lay eggs for 12 h post-injection on individual agar growth plates. Each animal was then transferred to a fresh growth plate and allowed to lay eggs for 8 h. Adults were removed, and these eggs were allowed to incubate for 24 h. At the end of this period, unhatched eggs were transferred to an agarose-coated slide and examined under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics. Eggs were assayed for pharyngeal organogenesis by scoring for GFP expression. To test whether Ntf2p is required to concentrate Ran in the nucleus in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the localization of Ran was analyzed as Ntf2p was depleted from yeast cells. Myc-tagged Ntf2p (myc-Ntf2p) under the control of the inducibleGAL1-10 promoter and scRan fused to the green fluorescent protein (scRan-GFP) were introduced into NTF2Δ yeast cells (ACY114). These cells were maintained in galactose to induce continuous expression of the myc-NTF2 gene and maintain viability. At time 0, cells were shifted to glucose to repress myc-Ntf2p expression and the localization of scRan-GFP was monitored by microscopy (Fig. 2 A). At 0 h in glucose scRan was localized throughout the cell with a clear concentration in the nucleus. After 4 h in glucose-containing media, scRan localization was shifted toward the cytoplasm. By 6 h scRan appeared evenly distributed throughout the cell with no clear concentration in the nucleus (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the expression of myc-Ntf2p was concomitantly reduced at 4 and 6 h as scRan was redistributed. Thus, Ntf2p is required to concentrate Ran in the nucleus in S. cerevisiae. If NTF2-mediated Ran import occurs in concert with importin-α/β/cargo, then Ran should not concentrate in the nucleus in either importin-α or importin-β mutants that are unable to support NLS cargo import. Because both Ran and NTF2 have been shown to interact with importin-β, we analyzed Ran localization in the importin-β temperature-sensitive mutant, rsl1-1 (42Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thersl1-1 allele of importin-β contains a nonsense mutation at amino acid 851 resulting in the loss of 10 amino acids from the C terminus. The Rsl1-1 protein is unable to support NLS-mediated protein import. In addition, the Rsl1-1 protein does not efficiently interact with nucleoporins and mislocalizes to the cytoplasm. 2D. M. Koepp and P. A. Silver, unpublished data. We analyzed the localization of both scRan-GFP and Ntf2p-GFP in thersl1-1 mutant. In addition, to monitor NLS-mediated protein import in rsl1-1 cells, the localization of GFP-LacZ-NLS was analyzed. Consistent with previous reports, NLS-mediated import is reduced at 37 °C in rsl1-1 mutant cells (42Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). However, as previously shown with myc-Ntf2p (29Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18477-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Ntf2p-GFP is localized throughout the cell with a clear concentration at the nuclear rim at both 25 and 37 °C. Furthermore, scRan-GFP remains concentrated in the nucleus inrsl1-1 mutant cells at 37 °C. These results show that import of Ran into the nucleus is maintained in the absence of importin-β-mediated NLS cargo import and suggest that import of the NTF2/Ran complex is independent of the importin-α/β/NLS cargo complex as diagrammed in Fig. 1 (model B). To determine whether the NTF2/Ran complex interacts with importin-β biochemically, we performed bead binding assays using bacterially expressed yeast Ntf2p covalently coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads. Purified recombinant importin-β bound to Ntf2p-CNBr beads as well as to myoglobin-CNBr beads and BSA-CNBr beads in the presence or absence of Ran (data not shown). This nonspecific binding was observed even in the presence of 1m NaCl. Because recombinant importin-β bound nonspecifically to Ntf2p beads, we analyzed Ntf2p beads incubated with yeast cell lysates. Components of the lysate that bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots of these gels show that yeast Ntf2p forms complexes containing scRan, theXFXFG-containing nucleoporin Nsp1p, and importin-β (Fig. 4, A,lane 2; B, lane 2; and C,lane 2). However, Yrb1p, a protein previously shown to form a macromolecular complex with importin-β and RanGDP (32Chi N.C. Adam E.J.H. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), was not present in any of our Ntf2p affinity purified complexes (Fig.4 D, lane 2). The lower bands observed in yeast cell lysate with the importin-β polyclonal antibody (Fig.4 A, lane 1) are due to nonspecific antibody interactions. BSA coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads did not bind scRan, Nsp1p, or importin-β (Fig. 4, A, lane 3;B, lane 3; and C, lane 3), demonstrating that these interactions are specific in the presence of yeast lysate. Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels of Ntf2p affinity purified complexes reveals approximately 20 distinct proteins that interact specifically with Ntf2p as compared with BSA (data not shown). Given the number of proteins that interact with Ntf2p in these bead binding experiments, it is important to note that these experiments do not distinguish between direct or indirect interactions between Ntf2p and any of the proteins identified in the complexes isolated. In vitro studies have shown that importin-β interacts with several different nucleoporins (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

https://openalex.org/W1972537129,"Intracellular iron homeostasis is regulated, in part, by interactions between iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) and iron-responsive elements (IREs) in ferritin and transferrin receptor mRNAs. In addition to iron, cellular oxidative stress induced by H2O2, nitric oxide, and hypoxia, and hormonal activation by thyroid hormone and erythropoeitin have each been shown to regulate IRP binding to IREs. Hormonal signals, in particular mediated through protein kinase C (PKC), play a central role in the modulation of IRP/IRE interactions since phorbol esters were shown to activate IRP binding (Eisenstein, R. S., Tuazon, P. T., Schalinske, K. L., Anderson, S. A., and Traugh, J. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 27363–27370). In pituitary thyrotrophs (TtT97), we found that thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased IRP binding to a ferritin IRE, dependent on PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. In contrast, TRH and EGF decreased IRP binding in pituitary lactotrophs (GH3), despite activation of PKC and MAPK. IRP1 and IRP2 levels remained constant and IRP2 binding was predominant throughout. TRH and EGF markedly decreased IRP binding in MAPK kinase inhibitor-treated GH3 cells, whereas, they increased IRP binding in phosphatase inhibitor-treated GH3 cells. IRE-dependent CAT reporter translational expression closely reflected IRP binding to the ferritin IRE in both GH3 and TtT97 cells. Interestingly, ferritin protein levels were regulated similarly by TRH in both cell lines. These data link two different cell receptor systems to common signaling pathways that regulate IRP binding and ferritin expression. Remarkably, for TRH and EGF, these effects may be PKC-dependent or -independent determined by the cell type."

In a recent report from this laboratory, we demonstrated that select forms of phosphorylated as well as hypophosphorylated pRB can be found complexed with the α-isotype of PP1 (PP1α). This complex can also be observed when PP1 is rendered catalytically dead by toxin inhibition. These data suggested to us that pRB may bind to PP1 at one or more sites other than the catalytically active one on the enzyme and that such binding may play a role other than bringing the substrate into contact with the enzyme to facilitate catalysis. To address this possibility we utilized a series of pRB deletion mutants and coprecipitation studies to map the pRB domain involved in binding to PP1. Together with competition assays using in vivoexpression of SV40 T-antigen, we show here that the carboxyl-terminal region of pRB is both necessary and sufficient for physical interaction with PP1. Subsequent biochemical analyses demonstrated inhibition of PP1 catalytic activity toward the standard substrate phosphorylasea when this enzyme is bound to pRB containing this region.K m and V max calculations revealed that pRB binds to PP1 in a non-competitive manner. These data support the notion that pRB, in addition to being a substrate for PP1, also functions as a PP1 inhibitor.

Indeed, hypophosphorylated pRB found in early- to mid-G1 is capable of sequestering and thereby functionally inactivating transcription factors necessary for cell growth. Sequential serine/threonine phosphorylation of pRB by cyclin-dependent kinases has been shown to release these factors, after which cell proliferation commences. Beginning at anaphase, pRB becomes progressively dephosphorylated (10Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A.

The activity of PP1, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, appears to be involved in M-phase progression, a time during which PP1 and pRB can be found complexed together. With such an apparent change during mitosis in the pRB phosphorylation state together with the critical timing of PP1 activity for M-phase progression, defining the biochemical and structural relationship between these two cellular proteins affords a unique opportunity for understanding the role of PP1 and pRB in cell cycle regulation.Toward this goal, we have recently demonstrated that select forms of phosphorylated as well as hypophosphorylated pRB can be found complexed with the α-isotype of PP1 (PP1α) (18Tamrakar S.

These data suggested to us that pRB may bind to PP1 at one or more sites other than the catalytically active one on the enzyme and that such binding may play a role other than bringing the substrate into contact with the enzyme to facilitate catalysis. To address this possibility, we have undertaken a series of experiments in which we mapped the region of pRB involved in binding to PP1, tested the catalytic activity of PP1 when complexed with pRB, and analyzed the kinetics of the reaction. As presented in this report, these data support the notion that pRB, in addition to being a substrate for PP1, binds non-competitively to this enzyme. In so doing, the catalytic activity of PP1 is inhibited.DISCUSSIONThe motive behind this study comes from the observation that hypophosphorylated pRB, a presumably poor substrate for dephosphorylation by PP1, can be readily found in a complex with this enzyme. We decided to first investigate the functional significance of this interaction by utilizing a series of pRB deletion mutants and coprecipitation studies to map the pRB domain involved in PP1 binding. Previous work by others shows that the A-B pocket of pRB, which is conserved among members of the pRB family of proteins, is required for binding with LXCXE/LXSXE motif bearing proteins such as SV40 T-antigen (36Hu Q. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Huang H.-J.S. Wang N-P Tseng B.Y. Lee W.-H. Lee E.Y.-H.P.

The A-B pocket along with C-pocket in the carboxyl terminus is essential for complex formation between pRB and E2F or cyclin D (1Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The C-pocket has also been shown to bind the c-Abl tyrosine kinase (47Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 48Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As we report here, the carboxyl-terminal region of pRB, containing amino acids 792–928, is both necessary and sufficient for physical interaction with PP1. In support of these data, a similarly sized region of pRB (aa 773–928) appears to be required for PP1 binding when assaying by a yeast two-hybrid system (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Previous studies by others have suggested that a motif comprised of the amino acids (R/K)(I/V)XF are involved in the binding of PP1-associated proteins (49Egloff M. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). pRB sequence analysis has revealed close matches to this motif: residues 46–49 (RLEF) and residues 874–877 (KLRF). In both cases, there is a conservative substitution in the second position of I/V to L. Interestingly, the fragment of pRB (residues 1–380) that contains the amino-terminal occurrence of this motif does not complex with PP1. The significance of this observation must await further mutagenesis studies.Competition assays using in vivo expression of SV40 T-antigen indirectly supports the aforementioned fusion protein binding data while providing further insight into the intrinsic properties of PP1 needed for binding to pRB. Both T-antigen and PP1 contain LXCXE/LXSXE motifs, which are found in several, but not all, pRB-binding proteins. Proteins that use this motif generally bind to the A-B pocket region of pRB, whereas our evidence indicates that PP1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of pRB. The concurrent binding of PP1 and T-antigen to pRB supports the idea that these two proteins use different, non-overlapping regions on pRB to form a ternary complex. Although not directly addressed here, these data also support the notion that PP1 does not utilize this LXSXE motif in binding to pRB. Indeed, a recent report by Dick et al. (50Dick F.A. Sailhamer E. Dyson N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) supports the notion that this motif and the corresponding binding region on pRB is more important for viral oncoprotein binding than for cellular protein binding. In contrast, the aforementioned yeast two-hybrid analysis reported by others (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) includes mutagenesis data, suggesting that the A-B region of pRB may also be involved in binding both PP1 and SV40 T-antigen. However, these data contain exceptions in which deletion mutagenesis of the B-region results in obliteration of T-antigen binding, whereas PP1 binding is reduced, and deletion of the carboxyl terminus obliterates PP1 binding, whereas T-antigen binding is unaffected. Perhaps reconciliation of these apparent discrepancies lies in the difference in the type and sensitivity of the experimental assays and also their use of truncated (aa 1–273), instead of full-length, T-antigen.What is the biochemical significance of pRB binding to PP1? Taking a cue from Siegert and Robbins (42Siegert J.L. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in which they reported inhibition of kinase activity when pRB is bound to the amino-terminal kinase domain of TAFII250, we tested whether PP1 catalytic activity can be altered upon pRB binding. Enzymatic analyses of pRB/PP1α complexes reveals an inhibition of catalytic activity toward the standard substrate phosphorylase a. This inhibition appears to be dependent upon an intact carboxyl-terminal region of pRB, the same region required for pRB binding to PP1. K m andV max calculations revealed that pRB binds to PP1 in a non-competitive manner. This argues against the suggestion that the observed inhibition of PP1 activity is due to pRB occupying the active site, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of other substrates. In light of these data, we would suggest that, in addition to being a substrate for PP1, pRB also functions as an inhibitor of PP1. As additional support for this suggestion, the possibility of pRB binding to PP1 and serving as a regulator was first discussed by Durfeeet al. (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). This discussion followed their observation that hypophosphorylated pRB is readily detectable in a complex with PP1, whereas hyperphosphorylated pRB is not. Building upon these observations, we recently reported that the interaction between pRB and PP1 is not dependent upon PP1 being catalytically active (18Tamrakar S. Mittnacht S. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7803-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fact, inhibitory toxin binding to the PP1 active site does not alter the ability of hypo- or hyperphosphorylated pRB to bind this enzyme (18Tamrakar S. Mittnacht S. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7803-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The non-competitive inhibition data presented here validates this observation.What could be the biological significance of a potential substrate also serving as a negative regulatory protein upon association with an enzyme ? As shown previously (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 21Nelson D.A. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2407-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), interaction between PP1 and pRB occurs during early to mid G1. Perhaps accumulation of the hypophosphorylated pRB facilitates complex formation with PP1 during this period of the cell cycle and signals a decrease in the need for PP1 activity directed toward pRB. Such an inhibitory effect on PP1 could be part of a negative feedback mechanism, pRB itself playing an important role in the regulation of pRB dephosphorylation. Although speculative at this point, binding of pRB to PP1 may also affect catalytic activity toward other substrates involved in cell cycle regulation. Owing to the presence of multiple phosphorylated residues on pRB, it is also likely that several modes of PP1 regulation toward pRB take place. As reported by Liu et al. (51Liu C.W. Y Wang R-H. Dohadwala M. Schonthal A.H. Villa-Moruzzi E. Berndt N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29470-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), inactivating phosphorylation of the PP1 catalytic subunit itself occurs in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner, which no doubt also affects the phosphorylation state of pRB. With this newly reported function of pRB, we now have another avenue of pursuit in defining the function of this protein in cell cycle regulation. The nuclear phosphoprotein product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, pRB,1has occupied a central position for investigations surrounding the mechanism of cell cycle progression. Numerous studies show that the growth-suppressive property of this protein is dependent upon its cell cycle stage-dependent phosphorylation state, which affects the ability of pRB to complex with other cellular and viral proteins (Refs. 1Chellappan S.P.

Indeed, hypophosphorylated pRB found in early- to mid-G1 is capable of sequestering and thereby functionally inactivating transcription factors necessary for cell growth. Sequential serine/threonine phosphorylation of pRB by cyclin-dependent kinases has been shown to release these factors, after which cell proliferation commences. Beginning at anaphase, pRB becomes progressively dephosphorylated (10Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 11Ludlow J.W. Glendening C.L. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and is returned to its growth-suppressive, hypophosphorylated state by the next G1 phase. Our laboratory (11Ludlow J.W. Glendening C.L. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as well as others (12Alberts A.S. Thornburn A.M. Shenolikar S. Mumby M.C. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reports that this mitotic-phase hypophosphorylation of pRB results, at least in part, by the activity of one or more members of the type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP1). The role of PP1 in cell cycle regulation has been revealed by its requirement for successful exit from mitosis (13Axton J.M. Dombradi V. Cohen P.T. Glover D.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 33-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Doonan J.H. Morris N.R.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Considered together, pRB is a cell cycle regulatory protein whose function is modulated by cell cycle-dependent serine/threonine phosphorylation. pRB enters mitosis hyperphosphorylated, yet hypophosphorylated pRB is maintained through mitosis and the subsequent G1 phase. The activity of PP1, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, appears to be involved in M-phase progression, a time during which PP1 and pRB can be found complexed together. With such an apparent change during mitosis in the pRB phosphorylation state together with the critical timing of PP1 activity for M-phase progression, defining the biochemical and structural relationship between these two cellular proteins affords a unique opportunity for understanding the role of PP1 and pRB in cell cycle regulation. Toward this goal, we have recently demonstrated that select forms of phosphorylated as well as hypophosphorylated pRB can be found complexed with the α-isotype of PP1 (PP1α) (18Tamrakar S. Mittnacht S. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7803-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This complex can also be observed when PP1 catalytic ability is toxin-inhibited. These data suggested to us that pRB may bind to PP1 at one or more sites other than the catalytically active one on the enzyme and that such binding may play a role other than bringing the substrate into contact with the enzyme to facilitate catalysis. To address this possibility, we have undertaken a series of experiments in which we mapped the region of pRB involved in binding to PP1, tested the catalytic activity of PP1 when complexed with pRB, and analyzed the kinetics of the reaction.

Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 48Welch P.J. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As we report here, the carboxyl-terminal region of pRB, containing amino acids 792–928, is both necessary and sufficient for physical interaction with PP1. In support of these data, a similarly sized region of pRB (aa 773–928) appears to be required for PP1 binding when assaying by a yeast two-hybrid system (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Previous studies by others have suggested that a motif comprised of the amino acids (R/K)(I/V)XF are involved in the binding of PP1-associated proteins (49Egloff M. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). pRB sequence analysis has revealed close matches to this motif: residues 46–49 (RLEF) and residues 874–877 (KLRF). In both cases, there is a conservative substitution in the second position of I/V to L. Interestingly, the fragment of pRB (residues 1–380) that contains the amino-terminal occurrence of this motif does not complex with PP1. The significance of this observation must await further mutagenesis studies. Competition assays using in vivo expression of SV40 T-antigen indirectly supports the aforementioned fusion protein binding data while providing further insight into the intrinsic properties of PP1 needed for binding to pRB. Both T-antigen and PP1 contain LXCXE/LXSXE motifs, which are found in several, but not all, pRB-binding proteins. Proteins that use this motif generally bind to the A-B pocket region of pRB, whereas our evidence indicates that PP1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of pRB. The concurrent binding of PP1 and T-antigen to pRB supports the idea that these two proteins use different, non-overlapping regions on pRB to form a ternary complex. Although not directly addressed here, these data also support the notion that PP1 does not utilize this LXSXE motif in binding to pRB. Indeed, a recent report by Dick et al. (50Dick F.A. Sailhamer E. Dyson N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) supports the notion that this motif and the corresponding binding region on pRB is more important for viral oncoprotein binding than for cellular protein binding. In contrast, the aforementioned yeast two-hybrid analysis reported by others (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) includes mutagenesis data, suggesting that the A-B region of pRB may also be involved in binding both PP1 and SV40 T-antigen. However, these data contain exceptions in which deletion mutagenesis of the B-region results in obliteration of T-antigen binding, whereas PP1 binding is reduced, and deletion of the carboxyl terminus obliterates PP1 binding, whereas T-antigen binding is unaffected. Perhaps reconciliation of these apparent discrepancies lies in the difference in the type and sensitivity of the experimental assays and also their use of truncated (aa 1–273), instead of full-length, T-antigen. What is the biochemical significance of pRB binding to PP1? Taking a cue from Siegert and Robbins (42Siegert J.L. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in which they reported inhibition of kinase activity when pRB is bound to the amino-terminal kinase domain of TAFII250, we tested whether PP1 catalytic activity can be altered upon pRB binding. Enzymatic analyses of pRB/PP1α complexes reveals an inhibition of catalytic activity toward the standard substrate phosphorylase a. This inhibition appears to be dependent upon an intact carboxyl-terminal region of pRB, the same region required for pRB binding to PP1. K m andV max calculations revealed that pRB binds to PP1 in a non-competitive manner. This argues against the suggestion that the observed inhibition of PP1 activity is due to pRB occupying the active site, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of other substrates. In light of these data, we would suggest that, in addition to being a substrate for PP1, pRB also functions as an inhibitor of PP1. As additional support for this suggestion, the possibility of pRB binding to PP1 and serving as a regulator was first discussed by Durfeeet al. (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). This discussion followed their observation that hypophosphorylated pRB is readily detectable in a complex with PP1, whereas hyperphosphorylated pRB is not. Building upon these observations, we recently reported that the interaction between pRB and PP1 is not dependent upon PP1 being catalytically active (18Tamrakar S. Mittnacht S. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7803-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fact, inhibitory toxin binding to the PP1 active site does not alter the ability of hypo- or hyperphosphorylated pRB to bind this enzyme (18Tamrakar S. Mittnacht S. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7803-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The non-competitive inhibition data presented here validates this observation. What could be the biological significance of a potential substrate also serving as a negative regulatory protein upon association with an enzyme ? As shown previously (33Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 21Nelson D.A. Ludlow J.W. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2407-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), interaction between PP1 and pRB occurs during early to mid G1. Perhaps accumulation of the hypophosphorylated pRB facilitates complex formation with PP1 during this period of the cell cycle and signals a decrease in the need for PP1 activity directed toward pRB. Such an inhibitory effect on PP1 could be part of a negative feedback mechanism, pRB itself playing an important role in the regulation of pRB dephosphorylation. Although speculative at this point, binding of pRB to PP1 may also affect catalytic activity toward other substrates involved in cell cycle regulation. Owing to the presence of multiple phosphorylated residues on pRB, it is also likely that several modes of PP1 regulation toward pRB take place. As reported by Liu et al. (51Liu C.W. Y Wang R-H. Dohadwala M. Schonthal A.H. Villa-Moruzzi E. Berndt N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29470-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), inactivating phosphorylation of the PP1 catalytic subunit itself occurs in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner, which no doubt also affects the phosphorylation state of pRB. With this newly reported function of pRB, we now have another avenue of pursuit in defining the function of this protein in cell cycle regulation."

However, the role of GRKs in modulation of signaling properties of native receptors has not been clearly defined. Here we addressed this question by generating Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing a dominant-negative mutant of GRK2 (DN-GRK2), K220R, using retrovirally mediated gene transfer, and we assessed function of the endogenously expressed calcitonin (CT) receptors. We found that CT-mediated responses were prominently enhanced in CHO cells expressing DN-GRK2 compared with mock-infected control CHO cells with ∼3-fold increases in CT-promoted cAMP production in whole cells and adenylyl cyclase activity in membrane fractions. CT-promoted phosphoinositide hydrolysis was also enhanced in DN-GRK2 cells. The number of CT receptors was increased ∼3-fold in DN-GRK2 cells, as assessed by125I-salmon CT-specific binding, and this was associated with increased CT receptor mRNA levels. These results indicate that DN-GRK2 has multiple consequences for CT receptor signaling, but a primary effect is an increase in CT receptor mRNA and receptor number and, in turn, enhanced CT receptor signaling. As such, our findings provide a mechanistic basis for previous observations regarding agonist-promoted down-regulation of CT receptors and for resistance and escape from response to CT in vitroand in vivo. Moreover, the data suggest that blunting of receptor desensitization by DN-GRK2 blocks a GRK-mediated tonic inhibition of CT receptor expression and response.

One component of this desensitization, in particular homologous, receptor-specific desensitization, is agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor by specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This phosphorylation event leads to the recruitment of cytosolic proteins, β-arrestins, to the receptor-signaling complex, the uncoupling of receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins, and loss of receptor responsiveness. Recent evidence indicates that GRKs and β-arrestins not only promote receptor uncoupling but also may directly participate in GPCR sequestration and the initiation of events leading to clathrin-coated pit-mediated internalization of receptors (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Pitcher J.A.

GRK2, formerly termed βARK1, is a widely expressed member of this family and has been shown to phosphorylate various GPCRs (1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar,2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar).

Thus, most studies of GRKs have involved the use of transfected cells expressing relatively nonphysiological levels of GPCRs. In the current studies, we utilized a model cell, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which endogenously expresses calcitonin (CT) receptors, and we evaluated the role of endogenously expressed GRKs on signaling. We stably expressed DN-GRK2 in CHO cells using retrovirally mediated gene transfer and found that CT receptor expression and signaling were markedly enhanced by the DN-GRK2. The results suggest a key role for GRKs in establishing the steady-state level of GPCR expression.DISCUSSIONCalcitonin is an important hormone in the regulation of serum calcium levels and bone mineral density through its effects on bone resorption and renal calcium excretion. Previous studies have not clearly defined the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CT receptor expression, in particular, agonist-mediated desensitization and down-regulation of these receptors (24Wada S. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wada S. Udagawa N. Nagata N. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, we used CHO 10001 cells as a model to examine CT receptor expression by GRKs. We found that retrovirally mediated gene transfer is a useful means to establish stable expression of DN-GRK2. Stable expression of DN-GRK2 inhibited GRK2-mediated substrate phosphorylation by approximately 40% and impaired CT-mediated desensitization of cAMP formation. Potentiation of cAMP generation in DN-GRK2-expressing cells, however, appeared to be much greater than what would have been expected from the loss in GRK2 phosphorylating activity and appeared to relate to the increase in CT receptor number. Enhancement of CT receptor signaling by DN-GRK2 expression was also observed in the phosphoinositide pathway. The up-regulation of CT receptor number in DN-GRK2-expressing cells was associated with an increase in mRNA for CT receptor C1a. These data suggest that the CT receptor, one of the Class II family of GPCRs, can be regulated by GRKs and that CT receptor mRNA and protein expression are negatively influenced by GRK activity.The GRK isoforms that regulate CT receptor signaling were not precisely defined in our studies, but the data suggest that GRK2 may play an important role for desensitization of the receptor. Recent studies reveal that various GPCRs can be regulated by multiple GRKs in vitro (e.g. Refs. 9Iacovelli L. Franchetti R. Grisolia D. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Lazari M.F. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The secretin receptor, another of the class II GPCRs, can be desensitized by expression of GRK5 as well as that of GRK2 or GRK3 (27Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the CHO cells that we used, in addition to GRK2, GRK6 and GRK5 are also expressed. Although we found that the K220R DN-GRK2 construct inhibited GRK2-mediated activity (Fig. 3), we cannot rule out an effect of the DN construct on activity of GRK5 or GRK6 as well. Indeed, based on structural similarities, to be described below, we believe this is quite likely.Previous workers have employed several different techniques to modulate GRK expression (e.g. Refs. 1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Many previous studies have involved overexpression of GRK isoforms. The more limited efforts designed to inhibit GRK expression have included use of a carboxyl-terminal fragment from GRK2 (termed βARKct), antisense oligonucleotides, and studies in cells or tissues from mice with a knockout of a GRK isoform. We believe that use of a retrovirally expressed DN construct offers advantages relative to those other methods. Thus, for example, βARKct is an inhibitor of Gβγ and some of its actions in cells may be attributable to Gβγ-dependent, but GRK-independent, events (3Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 4Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, because Gβγ is not involved in the action of all GRK isoforms, studies with βRKct will not assess the role of Gβγ-independent isoforms. Antisense oligonucleotides, which are generally isoform-selective, are primarily useful in acute experiments and not for generation of stably inhibited cells. Material from knockout animals is limited thus far to murine tissues and generally only from heterozygotic animals that have loss of expression of a single type of GRK. We believe that the retrovirally engineered DN-GRK2 construct provides a useful complementary approach to those other methods because of its theoretical ability to block function of multiple GRK isoforms (the K220R in GRK2 represents a conserved region in the catalytic domain ATP-binding site of all GRK isoforms), its potential utility to generate stably expressing cells, such as those we have used here, and the rather widespread tropism of the retroviral vector. Since CHO cells are often used for the heterologous expression of GPCRs, the stable cell line that we have developed may prove useful to examine GRK-mediated regulation of transfected GPCRs.Our findings in the DN-GRK CHO cells strongly suggest that GRKs not only regulate receptor desensitization but also play a role in the steady-state level of receptor expression. Activity of GRK to regulate CT receptor desensitization presumably reflects phosphorylation of one or more of the 8 serine/threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal portion of C1a receptors. Mutagenesis and related approaches will be necessary to define the precise sites that are regulated by the GRKs. Although such sites likely are involved in GRK-mediated desensitization of the receptors, it is not clear how receptor phosphorylation by GRK would regulate receptor expression. Presumably, GRKs impact on the CT receptor life cycle through events subsequent to receptor phosphorylation and internalization. The evidence that DN-GRK2 cells have an increase in CT receptor mRNA suggests that GRKs regulate the transcription and/or turnover of CT receptor mRNA. In this regard, it is of further interest that although the focus of the current studies is on CT receptor, ATP-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, presumably via one or more P2Y receptors, was also enhanced in the DN cells (Fig. 8). Perhaps GRKs are able to influence expression of multiple types of GPCRs.In summary, the current studies with CHO cells show that these cells express CT receptor C1a and GRK2, GRK5 and GRK6, but not GRK3 and GRK4. We found that stable expression of DN-GRK2 by retrovirally mediated gene transfer inhibited GRK2-promoted substrate phosphorylation, potentiated CT receptor signaling (both cAMP generation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis) in CHO cells, and blunted desensitization of CT receptors. Moreover, DN-GRK2-expressing CHO cells had an up-regulation in expression of CT receptors and receptor mRNA. The findings thus provide a mechanistic explanation for previous observations regarding agonist-mediated down-regulation of CT receptors, a phenomenon that has been implicated in resistance and escape from response to CT (25Wada S. Udagawa N. Nagata N. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Inoue D. Shih C. Galson D.L. Goldring S.R. Horne W.C. Baron R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the data indicate that GRKs are involved not only in desensitization of the CT receptor but also in the regulation of CT receptor expression. We speculate that through their effects on receptor phosphorylation, GRKs are able to inhibit expression of CT receptor mRNA and protein in CHO cells and perhaps more generally of GPCRs in other cell types as well. Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 in the plasma membrane triggers two events, activation of G protein-mediated signal transduction pathways and, in parallel, a deactivation or desensitization of signaling. One component of this desensitization, in particular homologous, receptor-specific desensitization, is agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor by specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This phosphorylation event leads to the recruitment of cytosolic proteins, β-arrestins, to the receptor-signaling complex, the uncoupling of receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins, and loss of receptor responsiveness. Recent evidence indicates that GRKs and β-arrestins not only promote receptor uncoupling but also may directly participate in GPCR sequestration and the initiation of events leading to clathrin-coated pit-mediated internalization of receptors (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Pitcher J.A.

To date, however, relatively little is known about the role of GRKs in desensitization to peptide hormones, in particular, in the regulation and expression of endogenously expressed GPCRs. Thus, most studies of GRKs have involved the use of transfected cells expressing relatively nonphysiological levels of GPCRs. In the current studies, we utilized a model cell, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which endogenously expresses calcitonin (CT) receptors, and we evaluated the role of endogenously expressed GRKs on signaling. We stably expressed DN-GRK2 in CHO cells using retrovirally mediated gene transfer and found that CT receptor expression and signaling were markedly enhanced by the DN-GRK2. The results suggest a key role for GRKs in establishing the steady-state level of GPCR expression. DISCUSSIONCalcitonin is an important hormone in the regulation of serum calcium levels and bone mineral density through its effects on bone resorption and renal calcium excretion. Previous studies have not clearly defined the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CT receptor expression, in particular, agonist-mediated desensitization and down-regulation of these receptors (24Wada S. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wada S. Udagawa N. Nagata N. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, we used CHO 10001 cells as a model to examine CT receptor expression by GRKs. We found that retrovirally mediated gene transfer is a useful means to establish stable expression of DN-GRK2. Stable expression of DN-GRK2 inhibited GRK2-mediated substrate phosphorylation by approximately 40% and impaired CT-mediated desensitization of cAMP formation. Potentiation of cAMP generation in DN-GRK2-expressing cells, however, appeared to be much greater than what would have been expected from the loss in GRK2 phosphorylating activity and appeared to relate to the increase in CT receptor number. Enhancement of CT receptor signaling by DN-GRK2 expression was also observed in the phosphoinositide pathway. The up-regulation of CT receptor number in DN-GRK2-expressing cells was associated with an increase in mRNA for CT receptor C1a. These data suggest that the CT receptor, one of the Class II family of GPCRs, can be regulated by GRKs and that CT receptor mRNA and protein expression are negatively influenced by GRK activity.The GRK isoforms that regulate CT receptor signaling were not precisely defined in our studies, but the data suggest that GRK2 may play an important role for desensitization of the receptor. Recent studies reveal that various GPCRs can be regulated by multiple GRKs in vitro (e.g. Refs. 9Iacovelli L. Franchetti R. Grisolia D. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Lazari M.F. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The secretin receptor, another of the class II GPCRs, can be desensitized by expression of GRK5 as well as that of GRK2 or GRK3 (27Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the CHO cells that we used, in addition to GRK2, GRK6 and GRK5 are also expressed. Although we found that the K220R DN-GRK2 construct inhibited GRK2-mediated activity (Fig. 3), we cannot rule out an effect of the DN construct on activity of GRK5 or GRK6 as well. Indeed, based on structural similarities, to be described below, we believe this is quite likely.Previous workers have employed several different techniques to modulate GRK expression (e.g. Refs. 1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Many previous studies have involved overexpression of GRK isoforms. The more limited efforts designed to inhibit GRK expression have included use of a carboxyl-terminal fragment from GRK2 (termed βARKct), antisense oligonucleotides, and studies in cells or tissues from mice with a knockout of a GRK isoform. We believe that use of a retrovirally expressed DN construct offers advantages relative to those other methods. Thus, for example, βARKct is an inhibitor of Gβγ and some of its actions in cells may be attributable to Gβγ-dependent, but GRK-independent, events (3Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 4Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, because Gβγ is not involved in the action of all GRK isoforms, studies with βRKct will not assess the role of Gβγ-independent isoforms. Antisense oligonucleotides, which are generally isoform-selective, are primarily useful in acute experiments and not for generation of stably inhibited cells. Material from knockout animals is limited thus far to murine tissues and generally only from heterozygotic animals that have loss of expression of a single type of GRK. We believe that the retrovirally engineered DN-GRK2 construct provides a useful complementary approach to those other methods because of its theoretical ability to block function of multiple GRK isoforms (the K220R in GRK2 represents a conserved region in the catalytic domain ATP-binding site of all GRK isoforms), its potential utility to generate stably expressing cells, such as those we have used here, and the rather widespread tropism of the retroviral vector. Since CHO cells are often used for the heterologous expression of GPCRs, the stable cell line that we have developed may prove useful to examine GRK-mediated regulation of transfected GPCRs.Our findings in the DN-GRK CHO cells strongly suggest that GRKs not only regulate receptor desensitization but also play a role in the steady-state level of receptor expression. Activity of GRK to regulate CT receptor desensitization presumably reflects phosphorylation of one or more of the 8 serine/threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal portion of C1a receptors. Mutagenesis and related approaches will be necessary to define the precise sites that are regulated by the GRKs. Although such sites likely are involved in GRK-mediated desensitization of the receptors, it is not clear how receptor phosphorylation by GRK would regulate receptor expression. Presumably, GRKs impact on the CT receptor life cycle through events subsequent to receptor phosphorylation and internalization. The evidence that DN-GRK2 cells have an increase in CT receptor mRNA suggests that GRKs regulate the transcription and/or turnover of CT receptor mRNA. In this regard, it is of further interest that although the focus of the current studies is on CT receptor, ATP-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, presumably via one or more P2Y receptors, was also enhanced in the DN cells (Fig. 8). Perhaps GRKs are able to influence expression of multiple types of GPCRs.In summary, the current studies with CHO cells show that these cells express CT receptor C1a and GRK2, GRK5 and GRK6, but not GRK3 and GRK4. We found that stable expression of DN-GRK2 by retrovirally mediated gene transfer inhibited GRK2-promoted substrate phosphorylation, potentiated CT receptor signaling (both cAMP generation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis) in CHO cells, and blunted desensitization of CT receptors. Moreover, DN-GRK2-expressing CHO cells had an up-regulation in expression of CT receptors and receptor mRNA. The findings thus provide a mechanistic explanation for previous observations regarding agonist-mediated down-regulation of CT receptors, a phenomenon that has been implicated in resistance and escape from response to CT (25Wada S. Udagawa N. Nagata N. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Inoue D. Shih C. Galson D.L. Goldring S.R. Horne W.C. Baron R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the data indicate that GRKs are involved not only in desensitization of the CT receptor but also in the regulation of CT receptor expression. We speculate that through their effects on receptor phosphorylation, GRKs are able to inhibit expression of CT receptor mRNA and protein in CHO cells and perhaps more generally of GPCRs in other cell types as well. Calcitonin is an important hormone in the regulation of serum calcium levels and bone mineral density through its effects on bone resorption and renal calcium excretion.

As a first step toward providing a structural description of the intact LDL receptor, the receptor has been purified from bovine adrenal cortices, reconstituted into unilamellar egg yolk phosphatidylcholine vesicles, and imaged using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM). CryoEM has the advantage of providing images of the reconstituted LDL receptor in its frozen, fully hydrated state.

Since an elevated level of blood cholesterol is a major risk factor in developing atherosclerosis, the LDL receptor, which is responsible for the uptake of LDL into cells, has been studied extensively, notably by Brown and Goldstein (2Goldstein J.L. Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1981-2030Google Scholar). The LDL receptor is located in coated pit regions on the cell surface; it binds cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (LDL and β-VLDL) via receptor binding sub-domains of their apoB and apoE proteins, and the receptor-ligand complex is internalized by endocytosis. Acidification of the internal compartment of the endocytic vesicle leads to dissociation of the LDL receptor-LDL complex; the LDL receptor is recycled to the cell surface, and LDL is delivered to the lysosome. Release of cholesterol triggers a variety of intracellular metabolic and regulatory events, notably the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and expression of the LDL receptor and other genes (1Brown M.S.

The ligand binding domain consists of the N-terminal 292 residues and includes 7 homologous repeats of a cysteine-rich 40-residue sequence (5Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J.

The EGF precursor homology domain has three cysteine-rich growth factor-like repeats at the N and C termini and a spacer sequence containing the YWTD sequence repeated approximately every 40–60 amino acid residues (13Hobbs H.H.

In addition, some of these sequences are also found in proteins such as complement factors and developmental proteins (13Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 17Stanley K.K. Kocher H.-P. Luzio J.P. Jackson P. Tschopp T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Marazziti D. Eggertsen G. Fey G.H. Stanley K.K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6529-6534Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, establishing the relationship between structure and function of the LDL receptor domains could also be helpful in predicting the functions of the shared modules for the other related proteins. Studies of the full-length LDL receptor using prediction algorithm and circular dichroism methods have provided information on its secondary structure (19De Loof H. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Saxena K. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15940-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on CD spectroscopy studies (20Saxena K. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15940-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the detergent-solubilized bovine LDL receptor is particularly rich in β-structure (∼40%) and coil (∼40%), with lesser amounts of α-helix (∼20%). Lacking the complete sequence of the bovine LDL receptor, we analyzed using predictive algorithms the secondary structure of both the whole human LDL receptor and its five domains (20Saxena K. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15940-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For the complete receptor, again a high β-structure probability (∼65%; ∼40% β-turn, ∼25% β-sheet)) was predicted with lesser amounts of α-helix (∼20%); similar results were obtained by De Loof et al. (19De Loof H. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Ruysschaert J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, we have analyzed the secondary structure of the five individual domains of the human LDL receptor (20Saxena K. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15940-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ligand binding domain is predicted to be rich in β-turns (∼50%) and β-sheet (∼20%), with less (∼15%) α-helix; this agrees quite well with the experimentally determined structures of cysteine-rich repeats, which all contain an N-terminal β-hairpin followed by several β-turns (Refs. 21Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, see below). Similarly, the EGF precursor homology domain is predicted to be >60% β-structure, in good agreement with recent modeling studies by Springer (25Springer T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggesting that this YWTD-rich domain of the LDL receptor (and other endocytic receptors) forms a compact β-propeller structure built from six β-sheets. Recent studies using NMR and x-ray crystallography focus on the structures of the first, second, and fifth cysteine-rich 40-residue repeats of the ligand binding domain (21Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Similar conformations consisting of a β-hairpin followed by β-turns motif are reported. Interestingly, the x-ray crystallographic study of repeat-5 shows a calcium binding loop that utilizes several of the conserved acidic residues (previously thought to contribute to interactions with basic residues of the apoB or apoE ligand), thus sequestering these acidic residues away from the surface (24Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recently, structural studies of two concatamers, repeat-1/repeat-2 (26Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.T. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10994-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and repeat-5/repeat-6 (27North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3926-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), conclude that there is little or no inter-module interaction,i.e. the two modules are essentially structurally independent. Our approach has been somewhat different in that we have focused on structural studies, albeit at lower resolution, of the full-length, intact functional LDL receptor. Thus, we have (i) purified the LDL receptor from bovine adrenal cortex, (ii) reconstituted the LDL receptor into lipid vesicles, and (iii) studied the reconstituted LDL receptor in the frozen, hydrated state by cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) and gold-labeling methods. The purification protocol for the LDL receptor is based on the original method reported by Schneider et al. (28Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and subsequent modifications (20Saxena K. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15940-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices from ∼50 adrenal glands were homogenized, and a membrane pellet was isolated. After detergent solubilization with Triton X-100, ion exchange column chromatography was performed with a HiLoad 16/10 Q-Sepharose column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was washed with 75 mm NaCl in buffer (50 mm Tris-maleate, 2 mm CaCl2, 40 mm β-octylglucoside (β−OG), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mm Leupeptin, pH 6.0), then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 75 to 375 mm in buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Five-milliliter fractions were collected, and the Pierce protein assay based on the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 22: 248-254Crossref Scopus (211925) Google Scholar) was performed for all aliquots to generate a protein profile (Fig.1 A). The dot-blot assay using the monoclonal IgG-C7 antibody against the N terminus of the receptor was also performed (Fig. 1 B). Fractions containing the LDL receptor were applied to an IgG-C7-Sepharose affinity column, and the eluted fractions were analyzed by silver stain SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis using both IgG-C7 and the C-terminal antibody IgG-4A4. Aliquots of affinity column chromatography fractions were assayed for protein amount, and the A(III) fraction was used for further study. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) in chloroform was transferred into a 25-ml round-bottom flask, and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator. Dried EYPC (∼2 mg) was redissolved in 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1) solution and rotary-evaporated twice to make a thin, even lipid film on the bottom of the flask. The EYPC film was lyophilized overnight at 10 microtorr and protected from light with aluminum foil. The lyophilized EYPC film was hydrated with 1 ml of hydration buffer (10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0). The EYPC dispersion was rapidly frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath for 30 s then thawed immediately in a water bath at ∼50 °C and this freeze/thaw step repeated 4 times. The EYPC dispersion was passed through 0.1-μm pore membrane 10 times using an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc.) to make large unilamellar lipid vesicles (30Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). The extruded EYPC vesicle solution was used for LDL receptor reconstitution. The purified LDL receptor was concentrated to 1.0–1.6 mg/ml using Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon), and the final concentration of the receptor was determined (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin solution as a standard. The β-OG-solubilized LDL receptor, EYPC vesicles, detergent (β-OG, 500 mm), and dialysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 6.15) were mixed for a final concentration of the LDL receptor of 0.10 mg/ml, 1.0 mg/ml EYPC, and 19.7 mm β-OG. The solution was placed into the wells of a microdialyzer and dialyzed against 1 liter of gradient detergent concentration 20 to 0 mm β-OG in dialysis buffer. Finally, the sample was dialyzed against an additional 1 liter of dialysis buffer. Specimens for cryoEM were prepared by rapid freezing the blotted sample on holey grids (32Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.-J. Homo J.-C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Qt. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Typically, 6 μl of sample containing 0.1 mg/ml reconstituted LDL receptor and 1 mg/ml lipid vesicle was used on each grid. Excess liquid was blotted from the back side of the grid, and the grid was immediately plunged into liquid ethane, cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath. The plunging process was carried out at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Samples were transferred to a Gatan cryo holder (Gatan, Inc., Pittsburgh) using a Gatan cryo transfer station and maintained at a temperature less than −160 °C. Samples were viewed using a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope under low electron dose conditions to minimize irradiation and sample damage. Electron micrographs were recorded on Kodak Electron Image Film SO-163 at 75,000× magnification. Micrographs were recorded at 1.7 μm under-focus for the best visualization of protein and lipid vesicles. For the Nanogold-labeled proteins, electron micrographs were recorded at both −1.7 μm and −0.5 μm defocus to optimize visualizing protein and gold, respectively. Films were developed in concentrated D19 for 12 min. Electron micrographs recorded on films were digitized and scanned. For the individual particle selection and image manipulation, the SPIDER/WEB software package was used (33Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar) after the conversion of file format from the scanned images. The purified bovine LDL receptor was labeled using the biotin-BMCC (1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido]butane) reagent (Pierce) to confirm that the bovine LDL receptor has free, accessible cysteine residues. Biotin-BMCC was suspended in Me2SO to a concentration of 50 mm. Five micrograms of LDL receptor dialysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 6.15) and 1 μl of 50 mm biotin-BMCC were mixed to give a final concentration of 0.05 μg/μl LDL receptor and 0.5 mm biotin-BMCC. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, then run on a 7.5% homogeneous polyacrylamide gel using the Laemmli buffer system (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). The gel was transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% milk in wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4 °C. The membrane was washed, then incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature. The signal was detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system and exposing the membrane to film after washing. The peroxidase enzyme was inactivated by incubating the membrane with 15% hydrogen peroxide in phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 30 min. After the same washing steps, the membrane was incubated with IgG-C7 and IgG-4A4 for an hour, and the Western blot method was followed. Monomaleimido-Nanogold (Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY) containing a 1.4-nm-diameter gold particle was used to label free cysteine residues of the LDL receptor. Immediately after solubilization (20 μl Me2SO or isopropanol, then 180 μl of deionized water), five molar equivalents of monomaleimido-Nanogold solution were added to the reconstituted LDL receptor solution and incubated at 4 °C for approximately 18 h. Unbound gold particles were removed by dialysis against 2 liters of the same dialysis buffer used in the reconstitution of the LDL receptor for 48 h with a flow rate of 20–25 ml/hr. After SDS-PAGE, an LI silver stain, specifically reactive to gold particles, was used to detect gold-labeled protein bands and to confirm Nanogold-labeling of the LDL receptor. LI silver stain is a light-insensitive silver enhancement system for visualizing Nanogold particles. The deposition of dense silver particles on Nanogold is enhanced during the initial reaction period. The detergent-solubilized proteins from the membrane pellet were purified by ion exchange column chromatography with a change of the detergent Triton X-100 to β-octylglucoside (β-OG). The eluted fractions from the affinity column were analyzed by silver stain and Western blot following gel electrophoresis. As expected for the LDL receptor (Ref.35Tolleshaug H. Goldstein J.L. Schneider W.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1982; 30: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 20Saxena K. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15940-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), molecular weight differences were observed for fraction A(III) samples examined by SDS-PAGE under reducing (∼160 kDa) and non-reducing (∼130 kDa) conditions (Fig.2 A). Results from the Western blot of the A(III) fraction under reducing conditions (Fig.2 A, right; lane 3) demonstrated that β-mercaptoethanol prevented antibody binding to the LDL receptor. The A(III) fraction contained most of the highly purified LDL receptor and was used for further studies. The activity of the purified LDL receptor was confirmed by Western blots under non-reducing conditions using IgG-C7 (36Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IgG-4A4 (11Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Yamamoto T. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1984; 37: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) monoclonal antibodies against the N- and C terminus of the receptor, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Western blots using both antibodies showed the LDL receptor band at the same location as in the silver-stained gel. IgG-4A4 showed a weaker band against the same amount of the receptors compared with IgG-C7. The yield of purified intact LDL receptor was ∼600 μg/50 adrenal glands. The purified LDL receptor was reconstituted by adding the detergent-solubilized LDL receptor to the pre-formed vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The use of pre-formed 100-nm-diameter EYPC vesicles gave the most efficient reconstitution, and the reconstitution protocol was optimized by varying the lipid to protein ratio and the lipid and protein concentrations. The rate and period of the detergent dialysis step were also adjusted to obtain slow reconstitution conditions. A gradient detergent dialysis (20 to 0 mm β-OG) step was developed that gave the most efficient, reproducible reconstitution of the LDL receptor. This method yielded uniform diameter (60–100 nm) unilamellar vesicles containing the LDL receptor. CryoEM images of reconstituted vesicles containing the LDL receptor are shown at low magnification in Fig. 3. Most of the vesicles are unilamellar, and the vesicle diameter ranges from 60 to 100 nm. LDL receptors visualized by cryoelectron microscopy (examples are circled in Fig. 3) appear as elongated stem-like projections from the vesicle surface with a more electron-dense domain distal to the bilayer surface. The receptors appear to adopt an orientation primarily, but not exclusively, on the outward-facing membrane surface (for examples, see Fig. 3, open circles). An example of an inward-facing LDL receptor is also shown (Fig. 3, asterisked circle). In some cases, two (or more) receptors are viewed side-by-side (Fig. 3, circles labeled 2). Electron micrographs recorded on film were digitized and scanned. For the individual particle selection and image manipulation, the SPIDER/WEB software package was used (33Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). A montage showing examples of the frozen, hydrated LDL receptor at the vesicle surface is shown in Fig. 4. Reconstituted LDL receptors visualized by cryoEM can be observed in three basic shapes; (i) stick-like receptors in which the whole extracellular length is the stem length (e.g. Fig. 4; A3, C1,C2, D3; image C1 is also shown at higher magnification in the upper right panel); (ii) bent stick-like receptors, which have one arm extending distally from the stem (e.g. Fig. 4; B1, B2,B3, C3, D1; image C3 is also shown at higher magnification in the lower right panel); and (iii) Y-shaped receptors, which have two arms branching from the stem (e.g. Fig. 4; A1,A2, D2). All three receptor shapes were observed for both outward- and inward-facing receptors. The three observed receptor images may result from different orientations of a unique conformation of the receptor with respect to the viewing plane. It is also possible that some conformational flexibility of the LDL receptor contributes to the variability of the observed images. Histogram measurements of the length and width of the receptor images (data not shown) indicate maximum dimensions of 120 Å and 45 Å, respectively; for bent-stick and Y-shaped receptors the arm length was ∼70 Å. Assuming that the visualized images represent the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor, calculations of the volume based on these dimensions are in reasonably good agreement with the volume calculated from the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of the human LDL receptor. The human LDL receptor has only three free cysteine residues out of a total of 63 cysteine residues, the rest being involved in the numerous disulfide bonds of the cysteine-rich repeats of the ligand binding domain and the EGF precursor homology domain (5Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). A comparison of the human receptor sequence and the partial bovine receptor sequence revealed that a free cysteine in the transmembrane domain of the human receptor is an alanine in the bovine receptor (37Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Due to the high homology of the human LDL receptor with the bovine receptor, we examined whether free cysteine residues of the bovine LDL receptor could be identified. The presence of free, accessible cysteine residues on the bovine LDL receptor was experimentally demonstrated using a maleimide-biotin·streptavidin conjugate. The detergent-solubilized bovine LDL receptor was incubated with the maleimide-biotin conjugate, and the biotin conjugate bound to the LDL receptor was detected by streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (Fig.5). The LDL receptor band appeared at the same location as in Western blots visualized using the C-terminal (strong binding) and N-terminal (weaker binding) antibodies after deactivating the peroxidase. In addition, under these labeling conditions upper bands, possibly due to LDL receptor dimers, were observed in the Western blots. Cysteine sulfhydryl groups are also reactive with the maleimide group of monomaleimido-Nanogold. LDL receptors reconstituted into EYPC vesicles by detergent dialysis were incubated with excess monomaleimido-Nanogold, and further dialysis was performed to remove unbound Nanogold particles. The Nanogold-labeling of the reconstituted receptor was investigated by SDS-PAGE and LI silver stain (Fig.6). LI silver stain, specifically reactive with the gold particles, detected the labeled LDL receptor band at the same location as in the silver-stained gel (Fig.6 A). The silver-stained gel showed a stronger band for the Nanogold-labeled receptors compared with the band for the same amount of unlabeled receptor. The Western blots using both N- and C-terminal antibodies detected weaker bands after the Nanogold-labeling (Fig.6 B), presumably due to interference in antibody binding by the maleimide-bound gold particles. CryoEM images of the Nanogold-labeled reconstituted LDL receptors were recorded at two different defocus values. The −1.7-μm and −0.5-μm defocus values were used for optimal visualization of proteins and gold particles, respectively, and a montage of paired images of the gold-labeled LDL receptor is shown in Fig.7. At −1.7-μm defocus, similar images were observed for the Nanogold-labeled LDL receptor (Fig. 7) to those described above for the unlabeled LDL receptor (Fig. 4). The paired images optimized for visualization of gold (−0.5 μm defocus) showed electron-dense, circular Nanogold particles bound primarily to the stem of the LDL receptor. Either one or two gold particles were observed bound to the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor. In general, the Nanogold particles were located at the middle of the extracellular domain, but sometimes adjacent to the membrane vesicle surface. The observed images confirmed the successful Nanogold-labeling of the reconstituted LDL receptor and showed the location of free cysteine residues. The purified LDL receptor was successfully reconstituted into pre-formed large unilamellar EYPC vesicles by detergent dialysis (Fig.3). Apparently, using pre-formed vesicles (38Eytan G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and a slow gradient detergent dialysis method favors, to some degree at least, unidirectional (right-side out) reconstitution of membrane proteins. However, the reconstitution we have used, although highly efficient in terms of receptor incorporation, uniformity of vesicle size, retention of unilamellar vesicle structure, etc., does produce some inward-facing receptor orientations (see Figs. 3 and 4). The optimized lipid to protein ratio 10:1 (w/w) gives an average of 41 receptors per 100-nm diameter EYPC vesicle assuming that the average surface area per EYPC molecule is 0.7 nm2 and the bilayer thickness is 4 nm (39Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Although a smaller number of receptors in the vesicles was observed by cryoEM even under the best reconstitution conditions, it should be realized that only the LDL receptor molecules oriented at the edge of the vesicle images can be seen. Other vesicle-reconstituted receptors were probably obscured by the dense projection of the phospholipid bilayer. Images of the LDL receptor presented on the vesicle surfaces were selected by two criteria, the continuity of the receptor density from the membrane and the clearly distinguished protein density compared with the background density. Reconstituted receptors were visualized as stick-like density originating at the membrane bilayer surface and presumably representing the LDL receptor extracellular domain. Calculations of the volume of the extracellular domain based on its experimentally determined length and width parameters (and assuming a cylindrical geometry) of all three observed shapes (stick-like, bent-stick, and Y-shaped) agree well with the volume calculated from the amino acid sequence of the human LDL receptor. This implies that all three observed shapes represent images of the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor. Although the stick-like and bent-stick images would represent logical projections of this single-chain receptor, the observation, albeit less frequently, of Y-shaped images is somewhat puzzling. At this stage, it is sensible to include this as an additional view of the extracellular domain with perhaps the stick-like and bent-stick-like projections being rotational side views of a Y-shaped receptor. The volume calculations described above indicate that the Y-shaped images represent monomeric structures of the LDL receptor. However, the LDL receptor has been reported to be able to dimerize on the cell surface (16van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the possibility remains that the Y-shaped images represent a dimeric form of the LDL receptor. Our structural studies of the covalent disulfide-linked α2β2 heterodimeric insulin receptor do indeed reveal a Y-shaped receptor (Ref. 40Woldin C.N. Hing F.S. Lee J. Pilch P.F. Shipley G.G. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 549-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to identify potentially free cysteine residues. The partial sequence (C-terminal 25%) of the bovine LDL receptor has been determined (11Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Yamamoto T. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1984; 37: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); this includes the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, the O-linked sugar domain, and part of the EGF precursor homology domain. Over these regions, the sequences of the bovine and human LDL receptors show a very high homology, and we considered that it was likely that the free cysteine at residue 431 of the human LDL receptor was likely to be present in the bovine receptor. Our biotin-BMCC and maleimido-Nanogold labeling studies (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7) do confirm that a free cysteine (or cysteines) is accessible in the bovine LDL receptor. Since gold labeling was performed after receptor reconstitution, this will favor labeling of extravesicular cysteine residues. Although labeling of an outward-facing C-terminal cysteine (corresponding to Cys-818 in the human LDL receptor sequence) could occur, based on the gold-labeled images shown in Fig. 7 it is clear that an additional site (or possibly two sites) is available on the extracellular domain (presumably corresponding to Cys-431 in the middle of the EGF precursor homology domain of the human LDL receptor). Labeling by monomaleimido-Nanogold confirmed that the low contrast extravesicular density assigned to the extracellular domain of the LDL receptor was indeed correct. In summary, we have provided a low resolution structural picture of the bovine LDL receptor based on cryoEM images of unlabeled and Nanogold-labeled vesicle-reconstituted receptor. The orientation of receptors at the edge of the vesicle facilitates the otherwise difficult identification of this low molecular weight receptor using the low contrast cryoEM method. In Fig. 8we present an interpretation of the three views of the receptor. Presumably the distal arm (or arms) contains the ligand binding domain with the seven cysteine-rich repeats (and possibly the similar A and B cysteine-rich repeats of the EGF precursor homology domain). Logically, the membrane-connecting stem would comprise the rest of the EGF precursor homology domain and the O-linked sugar domain. In the accompanying paper (42Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol.

Shortly after entry into the cells, VZV genes are expressed in a temporal cascade. The immediate-early genes are expressed first; these stimulate early gene expression, providing most of the proteins necessary for viral DNA replication. After DNA synthesis has occurred, genes of the late class, which mainly encode structural proteins, are expressed. This orderly pattern of expression has been proposed mainly by comparison with herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) (1Honess R.W. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 8-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another α-herpesvirus that has been intensively studied. The use of transient transfection assays has clearly shown that several VZV proteins,i.e. those encoded by open reading frames 4, 10, 29, 61, 62, and 63, possess regulatory properties (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1989; 173: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5289-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Perera L.P.

Virol. 1994; 5: 241-248Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Three of these polypeptides, encoded by open reading frames 4, 62, and 63, are expressed during the immediate-early phase of lytic infection (9Forghani B. Mahalingham R. Vafai A. Hurst J.W.

Therefore, VZV immediate-early proteins contribute to the control of the viral cycle progression as in other α-herpesviruses. The IE4 protein is a transactivator of gene expression whose regulatory properties are not yet fully understood (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M.

IE4 stimulates VZV gene expression regardless of the cell type envisaged,i.e. monkey fibroblasts or human T lymphocytes (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M. Virology. 1989; 173: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Defechereux P.

Virol. 1993; 67: 4379-4385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also appears that IE4 is capable of heterologous transactivation (11Defechereux P. Debrus S. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7073-7079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Defechereux P. Melen L. Baudoux L. Merville-Louis M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J.

The available data suggest that IE4 could exert its functions through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (11Defechereux P. Debrus S. Baudoux L. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7073-7079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Defechereux P. Melen L. Baudoux L. Merville-Louis M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J.

VZV IE4 is a 452-amino acid long protein that shares considerable amino acid sequence homology with HSV-1 IE protein ICP27, especially in the carboxyl terminus and in the central part of the protein (13Perera L.P. Kaushal S. Kinchington P.R. Mosca J.D. Hayward G.S. Straus S.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Davison A.J. Scott J.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1759-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of ICP27 that is rich in cysteine and histidine residues has been shown to bind zinc (16Connaway R.C. Connaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and be required for multimerization (17Zhi Y. Sciabica K.S. Sandri-Goldin R.M. Virology. 1999; 257: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whereas the carboxyl-terminal region of IE4 also contains cysteine and histidine residues, it is not known whether this region also binds zinc nor whether it forms a potential zinc finger domain. A rather large part of ICP-27 spanning amino acids 260–434 was shown to be critical for gene activation (18Smith I.L. Sekulovich R.E. Hardwicke M.A. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3656-3666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hardwicke M.A. Vaughan P.J. Sekulovich R.E. O'Conner R. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4590-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in this activation domain exhibited a transdominant negative phenotype (18Smith I.L. Sekulovich R.E. Hardwicke M.A. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3656-3666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal regions of these two proteins have a more limited amino acid homology; however, both are highly acidic (14Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Debrus S. Piette J. Cohen J.I. Virology. 1995; 208: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sixteen of the first 66 amino acids of the amino-terminal region of VZV IE4 are either aspartic or glutamic acid, and seven residues are serine which, if phosphorylated, may be negatively charged. Net acidity is characteristic of several transcriptional activators; however, other critical structural features are also required for transactivating activity (for review, see Ref.20Courey A.J. Tijan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Close to the amino-terminal region, ICP27 possesses a sequence that resembles an RGG box, an RNA-binding motif found in a number of cellular proteins involved in mRNA and rRNA metabolism. The RGG box sequence is composed of 15 consecutive arginine and glycine residues and is required for ICP27 nucleolar localization, possibly reflecting an in vivo RNA binding activity (19Hardwicke M.A. Vaughan P.J. Sekulovich R.E. O'Conner R. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4590-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Courey A.J. Tijan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 21Mears W.E. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7445-7453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mears W.E. Lam V. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 935-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VZV IE4 does not bear an RGG box but instead has three arginine-rich regions (Ra, Rb, and Rc) and three potential bZIP sequences that are fused to the amino-terminal side of the Rb region. The function of these repeats is still unknown. ICP27 contains multiple nuclear localization signals (NLS) that function with differing efficiencies. A strong NLS maps to residues 110–137; it bears similarity to the bipartite NLS found inXenopus laevis nucleoplasmin. Weak NLS(s) map to the central and/or carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein (22Mears W.E. Lam V. Rice S.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 935-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No equivalent to this strong NLS has been yet found in VZV IE4. However, area encompassing the putative bZIP domain shares some homology with the NLS of the HIV-1 Tat protein. Recently, ICP27 has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm through a leucine-rich nuclear export signal in the amino terminus (23Sandri-Goldin R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Soliman T.M. Sandri-Goldin R.M. Silverstein S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9188-9197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since it has been demonstrated that ICP27 can bind seven intronless HSV-1 transcripts and that the export of these transcripts to the cytoplasm is substantially reduced during infection with 27-LacZ virus, where ICP27 is not expressed, it may be suggested that export of intronless mRNAs by ICP27 comprises at least part of its function as an essential regulator of viral gene expression. Whereas VZV IE4 exhibits a main cytoplasmic localization, no potential NES site can be located within its amino-terminal portion. The purpose of this report was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of IE4-mediated gene activation. Our results indicate that IE4 homodimerization mainly occurred through the central and the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. Amino acid substitution within the carboxyl-terminal domain showed that a GKYFKC peptide was crucial for dimerization. Regions of IE4 important for dimerization were also shown to be necessary for transactivation. In addition, the arginine-rich domains Rb and Rc of the amino-terminal region of IE4 were also demonstrated to be important for transactivation, whereas the first Ra domain as well as an acidic and bZIP-containing regions were shown to be dispensable for gene transactivation. A nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of IE4 has also been characterized. It likely involved a nuclear localization signal identified within the Rb domain. In addition, we demonstrated that IE4 shuttled between the nucleus and the cytoplasm partly via a Crm1-dependent mechanism. Both the central and carboxyl-terminal regions are involved in the nuclear export of IE4. The HeLa human cervical epithelioid carcinoma cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out on cells seeded into 35-mm diameter six-well cluster dishes using the FUGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To determine CAT activities, whole-cell extracts were prepared by the freeze-thaw method as described previously (12Defechereux P. Melen L. Baudoux L. Merville-Louis M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4379-4385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LUC assays were performed using the “Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay, high sensitivity” kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Data from CAT and LUC assays were collected from at least four independent transfection experiments. Plasmids pHIV-1-CAT and pTK-CAT were described previously (12Defechereux P. Melen L. Baudoux L. Merville-Louis M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4379-4385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gendelman H.E. Phelps W. Feigenbaum L. Ostrove J.M. Adachi A. Howley P.M. Koury J. Ginsberg H.S. Martin M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In these constructs, the wild-type LTR of HIV-1 or the VZV thymidine kinase gene promoter, respectively, is cloned upstream of the CAT gene. The reporter construct p(gal4)5SV40-LUC was a gift from Dr. M. Müller (University of Liege, Belgium) and contained the LUC reporter gene under the control of five copies of the Gal4 DNA-binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter. Plasmids pM and pVP16 (CLONTECH) harbored the SV40 promoter driving the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or the HSV-1 VP16 activation domain, respectively. The constructs pM4 and pVP16-IE4 were made by insertion of the IE4 gene into theEcoRI site of pM or pVP16 in frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or the HSV-1 VP16 activation domain coding sequence, respectively. The IE4 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides carrying an EcoRI site at 5′. Base substitutions or deletion into the IE4 gene were generated by PCR using mismatching primers that created a new restriction site in the vector. The PCR mixture consisted of 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.8 mm dNTP mix, 2.5 units of Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 μm each primer, and 200 ng of pM4 in a total volume of 100 μl. The amplification procedure started with a 2-min preheating step at 94 °C followed by 35 cycles, each consisting of a 94 °C denaturation segment for 15 s, a 50–60 °C annealing segment for 30 s (depending on the set of primers used), and a 72 °C extension segment for 4 min; the whole set was followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. After amplification, the PCR products were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the fragment corresponding to the size of the linearized vector was recovered using the Bio-Rad gel extraction kit (Bio-Rad). After phosphorylation of the 5′-end of the fragment with the T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the plasmid was recircularized by the T4 DNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α, and then analyzed for the presence of the new restriction sites introduced during the PCR. By this procedure, plasmids harboring mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of IE4 were obtained as follows: pM4-G442, -K443, -Y444, -FK445, -C447, -ST448, -FN450, and -C452 (the numbers refer to the position of the mutation in relation to the first methionine residue of the IE4 protein). Substitutions within the amino-terminal region of IE4 were also created by PCR. These plasmids were named pM4-Rb, pM4-Rc, pM4-Rb + Rc, pM4-bZIP, pM4-bZIP + Rb + Rc. The corresponding mutations are detailed in Fig. 4. Deletion mutants in the IE4 gene were obtained by a similar procedure: pM4-D-(1–65), pM4-D-(66–110), pM4-D-(111–181), pM4-D-(111–150), pM4-D-(150–182), pM4-D-(183–390), pM4-D-(182–231), pM4-D-(266–302), pM4-D-(314–385), pM4-D-(403–452), pM4-D-(427–452), and pM4-D-(444–452); the positions of the deleted amino acids are indicated in parentheses. To create pC4 wt and mutated, the wild-type IE4 sequence as well as both mutated sequences were excised from pM4 wt or mutated by digestion with EcoRI. The 1359-base pair fragments were then cloned into the polycloning site of pCDNA3.1.− (Invitrogen, Inc., Leek, The Netherlands) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer or the T7 promoter. The nomenclature used for the description of these mutated pC4 plasmids was the same as detailed above. HeLa cells seeded into 10-mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of pC4 or its derivatives using the FUGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To perform immunofluorescence studies, transfected cells grown on coverslips were treated as described previously (27Defechereux P. Debrus S. Baudoux L. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In order to detect wild-type IE4 or mutated forms, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum that was raised against a GST-IE4 fusion protein was prepared and used as described (10Debrus S. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Nikkels A. Piette J. Rentier B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3240-3245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, leptomycin B (LMB, provided by B. Wolff, Novartis, Vienna, Austria) was added to the culture medium 48 h post-transfection at a concentration of 10 nm. Six hours later, cells were fixed and treated for indirect immunofluorescence. The various constructs (GST, GST-TK, GST-p50, and GST-TFIIB (29Defechereux-Thibaut de Maisière P. Baudoux-Tebache L. Merville M.-P. Rentier B. Bours V. Piette J. J. Biol.

Lysates were prepared as described (29Defechereux-Thibaut de Maisière P. Baudoux-Tebache L. Merville M.-P. Rentier B. Bours V. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13636-13644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and proteins were then purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-buffered saline/Triton 1% (v/v), following extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline. IE4 proteins were expressed from pC4 and its derivatives and labeled with [35S]methionine (ICN, Brussels, Belgium) using thein vitro TNT-T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Inc., Madison, WI). 5 μl of 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with 30 μl of protein-coupled Sepharose beads in 400 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Binding reactions were allowed to take place for 3 h at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed six times in NETN. Bound proteins were eluated by boiling for 2 min in 1× SDS sample buffer, followed by loading on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Since we previously showed that IE4-activated gene expression under the control of the HIV-1 LTR through interactions with members of the NF-κB family and factors of the basal transcription machinery (29Defechereux-Thibaut de Maisière P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13636-13644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether gene activation by IE4 requires its homodimerization. Therefore, to study IE4 dimerization, we used a mammalian two-hybrid system (30Dang C.V. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Resar L.M. Kato G.J. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) based on the construction of two chimeric proteins between IE4 and either the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or the VP16 activation domain. The unmodified vectors or each of the individual fusion genes displayed low background LUC activity when co-transfected with reporter plasmid p(gal4)5SV40-LUC into HeLa cells, whereas transfection with a combination of plasmids encoding IE4-Gal4 DNA-binding and IE4-VP16 fusion proteins (pM4 and pVP16-IE4) resulted in a 32-fold increase in LUC gene expression (Fig.1). These data indicate that IE4 homodimerization is readily detectable in mammalian cells and is required for gene transactivation of an artificial construct.Figure 4Role of the arginine-rich regions Rb and Rc in IE4 homodimerization. The schematic representation of IE4 protein is described in the legend to Fig. 2. The sequences of the mutated Rb and Rc arginine-rich regions are represented with theletters in boldface corresponding to the substituted amino acids, as well as the three bZIP-like sequences that are underlined.

LUC assays were carried out 48 h post-transfection. Fold stimulation of LUC activity was calculated relative to the basal level of the reporter plasmid in the presence of pM and pVP16, arbitrarily set to 1.

Deletion of either the acidic domain (Fig. 2, pM4-D-(1–65)) or the first arginine-rich region (Ra) (Fig. 2, pM4-D-(66–110)) within the amino-terminal region did not affect homodimerization. Individual deletion of the arginine-rich regions b (Rb) and c (Rc) only partially affected homodimerization (Fig. 2, pM4-D-(111–150) andpM4-D-(150–182)), whereas the removal of both Rb and Rc decreased homodimerization by about 75% (Fig. 2,pM4-D-(111–181)). It should be noted that this deletion was rather large and removed 70 amino acids. On the other hand, deletion of the central region of IE4 comprised between amino acids 182 and 385 yielded an important reduction of homodimerization (about 90% reduction) (Fig. 2, pM4-D-(183–390)). Smaller deletions (between 49 and 71 amino acids into pM4-D-(182–231), -D-(266–302), and -D-(314–385)) were introduced within the central domain, and all led to a complete loss of homodimerization. Reintroduction of a irrelevant VZV sequence within the deleted IE4 gene (pM4-D- ()) did not allow recovery of efficient homodimerization (data not shown), demonstrating that the central region of IE4 itself is involved in the homodimerization process. Deletions within the cysteine-rich domain of IE4 demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region is important for homodimerization (Fig. 2,pM4-D-(403–452)). Indeed, deletion of either the complete cysteine-rich region (amino acids 393–452) or part of it (amino acids 444–452) drastically reduced homodimerization, demonstrating that the carboxyl-terminal regions of IE4 is also important for homodimerization. Since the carboxyl-terminal region of IE4 is rather conserved among α-herpesviruses (Fig.3 A), we decided to substitute several amino acids comprised between residues 442 and 452 (Fig.3 B). As mentioned above, deletion of the last 10 amino acids led to a 90% drop in LUC activity (Fig. 3 B,pM4-D-(444–452)). Mutation of the Gly-442 reduced homodimerization to about 30% of the initial value, and either single or double substitution within the KYFKC sequence completely abolished its activity. On the other hand, substitution of the last five amino acids (from 448 to 452) did not affect reporter gene stimulation (Fig.3 B), showing that the hexapeptide GKYFKC within the carboxyl-terminal region played an essential role in IE4 homodimerization. Since deletion of both arginine-rich regions Rb and Rc decreased IE4 homodimerization, amino acid substitutions were introduced within either the bZIP domain situated at the amino-terminal part of Rb, in Rb, in Rc, or in both Rb and Rc, or in the bZIP, Rb, and Rc (Fig. 4). Substitution of arginine residues with the bZIP sequence (amino acids 112–122) did not affect dimerization (Fig. 4, pM4-bZIP). Substitution of individual arginine residues by glycines within Rb or Rc did not modify either the level of IE4 homodimerization (Fig. 4, pM4-Rb andpM4-Rc). Finally, substitutions of all arginine residues in Rb and Rc (Fig. 4, pM4-Rb + Rc) or within the bZIP sequence, Rb and Rc (pM4-bZIP + Rb + Rc), only slightly affected LUC activity, showing that IE4 homodimerization, in this system, depends only on the integrity of both the central and carboxyl-terminal regions. IE4 was shown to activate expression of VZV genes as well as those of other viruses such as HIV-1 (2Inchauspe G. Nagpal S. Ostrove J.M.

In order to clarify the mechanism of gene activation by IE4 on VZV promoters and on heterologous promoters, we used transient transfection assays of HeLa cells with an IE4 expression plasmid (pC4) and a reporter gene construct under the control of either the HIV-1 LTR (pHIV-1-CAT) or the VZV TK promoter (pTK-CAT) (12Defechereux P.

IE4 expression led to a dose-dependent increase in CAT activity under the control of both promoters (data not shown) (12Defechereux P. Melen L. Baudoux L. Merville-Louis M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4379-4385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of 2 μg of pC4 gave rise to 15- and 7-fold increases in CAT expression under the control of the HIV-1 LTR and VZV TK promoter, respectively (Fig.5). In order to delineate regions of IE4 important for activation of either the VZV TK or HIV-1 promoter, base deletion and base substitutions were introduced into theIE4 gene. Deletion of amino acids 1–65 of the amino-terminal region of IE4 (pC4-D-(1–65)) did not modify transactivation of either reporter construct, demonstrating that this acidic stretch was not required for gene activation. Removal of the first arginine-rich region Ra (pC4-D-(66–110)) did not modify reporter gene activation under the control of the HIV-1 LTR, whereas a slightly decreased activation was observed with the VZV TK promoter (Fig. 5). On the other hand, tandem deletion of arginine-rich regions Rb and Rc (pC4-D-(111–181)) significantly reduced transactivation of the two promoters. Interestingly, Rb turned out to be more important t"

These domains, beginning at the N terminus are (i) ligand binding domain, (ii) epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor homology domain, (iii) O-linked sugar domain, (iv) transmembrane domain, and (v) cytoplasmic domain. The ligand binding domain has the characteristic 7 cysteine-rich repeats consisting of a highly homologous 40-residue amino acid sequence. A study using mutated receptors found that different combinations of the cysteine-rich repeats was responsible for binding to LDL or β-migrating very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL), both ligands for the LDL receptor (8Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations deleting one of the third to the seventh repeats in the ligand binding domain of the LDL receptor resulted in a marked reduction in LDL binding. β-VLDL binding to the LDL receptor was decreased only by deletion of the fifth cysteine-rich repeat in the ligand binding domain. LDL contains a single high molecular mass (550 kDa) protein, apoB100 (9Knott T.J. Pease R.J. Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Rall Jr S.C. Innerarity T.L. Blackhart B. Taylor W.H. Marcel Y. Milne R. Johnson D. Fuller M. Lusis A.J. McCarthy B.J. Mahley R.W. Levy-Wilson B. Scott J. Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), whereas β-VLDL has multiple copies of the smaller (33 kDa) apoE plus one molecule of apoB100 or apoB48 (10Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1277-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the receptor binding domain of apoB100 of LDL may require several of the cysteine-rich repeat modules for efficient binding, whereas the presence of multiple small apoE copies in β-VLDL may allow it to contact with other cysteine-rich repeats of the LDL receptor even when a repeat is deleted.The EGF precursor homology domain has three cysteine-rich “growth factor-like” repeats, two at its N terminus (adjacent to the ligand binding domain) and one at its C terminus (next to the O-glycosylation domain). Deletion analysis in this region of the LDL receptor suggested that the EGF precursor homology domain is required for both efficient binding of LDL and for the acid-dependent conformational change that allows the LDL receptor to release its bound ligand after acidification of the endocytic vesicle (11Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, the LDL receptor with these deletions was able to bind β-VLDL and to internalize it at a normal rate even though the receptor-recycling rate was slowed. Similar growth factor-like repeats have been identified in many proteins; cell surface receptors, viral proteins, factor IX and X of the blood clotting system, growth factors, and developmental proteins of lower eukaryotes (12Doolittle R.F.

Structural studies of the growth factor-like repeats in different proteins have provided convincing evidence that these cysteine-rich repeat modules are engaged in protein-protein interactions (19Rao Z.

Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Recently, the atomic resolution structures of the 40-residue cysteine-rich repeats of both the ligand binding and EGF precursor homology domains of the LDL receptor have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. These include the structures of cysteine-rich repeats 1, 2, and 5 in the ligand binding domain (20Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the fifth cysteine-rich repeat in the ligand binding domain revealed a hydrophobic ligand binding surface with a well coordinated calcium-binding site (22Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The disulfide bond linkages were between Cys(I)-Cys(III), Cys(II)-Cys(V), and Cys(IV)-Cys(VI), an identical pattern to that reported for the first and the second repeats (20Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The structure of repeat 5 explained why calcium ion is essential for a proper folding and disulfide bond formation of this repeat; furthermore, a sensible rationale for the calcium requirement in ligand binding (25van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was proposed (26Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The structure of a concatamer of repeats 1 and 2 suggests that little or no intermolecular interactions occur between the two modules (27Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.T. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10994-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a recent study of the concatamer of repeats 5 and 6 again indicated that each module is structurally independent of the other (28North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3926-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).The human EGF is a 53-residue peptide hormone that has a sequence similarity with an EGF-like cysteine-rich repeat in the EGF precursor homology domain of the LDL receptor. The human EGF contains three disulfide-bond cross-links between Cys(I)-Cys(III), Cys(II)-Cys(IV), and Cys(V)-Cys(VI) in conserved order for disulfide-bonds in the EGF-like modules (29Cooke R.M. Wilkinson A.J. Baron M. Pastore A. Tappin M.J. Campbell I.D. Gregory H. Sheard B. Nature. 1987; 327: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The structure of the EGF-like module in blood clotting factor X in the presence and the absence of calcium showed localized structural changes around the calcium-binding site (30Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is suggested that the calcium-binding site maintains the conformation of the N-terminal region and mediates protein-protein interactions (19Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).In the accompanying paper (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), stick-like, bent stick-like, and Y-shaped images of frozen, hydrated reconstituted LDL receptors have been observed using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM). In this paper, we use reduction of the disulfide linkages, maleimide-Nanogold labeling of the now available cysteine residues, and cryoEM to locate the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain.DISCUSSIONThe functionality of the LDL receptor was confirmed by binding studies to its major ligand, LDL. It has been shown that human LDL binds to the bovine LDL receptor as well as the human LDL receptor (35Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and for the region that can be compared (the C-terminal ∼25%), their amino acid sequences exhibit very high homology (36Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). This similarity of the human and bovine LDL receptors validates our use of the human LDL for binding studies with the bovine LDL receptor. The detergent-solubilized receptor and the reconstituted receptor showed LDL binding using native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and cryoEM (Fig.2). The existence of some dimer form seen in the native gels supports the earlier report of receptor dimerization (37van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimer band of the LDL receptor shown by Western blot analysis using the N-terminal antibody seemed to be affected more than the monomer band by increasing the LDL concentration, suggesting that a dimer form could provide higher affinity LDL binding. Whether the dimer form of the LDL receptor exists and functions in vivo remains to be established.Images obtained by cryoEM showed bound LDL particles at the surface of LDL receptor-containing vesicles. Many individual LDL particles were bound to the outside surface of the receptor-containing vesicles, and in some images, the stick-like extracellular domain of the LDL receptor was visible, extending from the membrane surface to the bound LDL particle. Further studies using detergent-solubilized LDL receptor (or expressed LDL receptor domains) may eventually be used to map the location on LDL where the receptor binds; a similar approach has been used to detect antibody binding sites on the surface of LDL (38Spin J. Cryoelectron Microscopy Studies of Low Density Lipoprotein in Vitreous Ice. Ph.D. thesis. Boston University, 1997Google Scholar).The successful application of monomaleimido-Nanogold labeling methods in our structural studies of the LDL receptor (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) encouraged us to use additional cysteine residues for further labeling, particularly those of the cysteine-rich N-terminal region. The reduction of these disulfide bonds was performed carefully so as not to perturb the whole structure of the LDL receptor. The LDL receptor bands that were detected in LI silver stain, silver stain, and Western blot analyses after MEA disulfide reduction were normal in appearance. Images of the reduced LDL receptor obtained by cryoEM showed more diffuse density at the end of the extracellular domain. Some images of the reduced LDL receptor still had visible stick-like or Y-shaped density as the previously reported images of the reconstituted receptor (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The distal end of both the stick-like receptor and the Y-shaped receptor images showed additional diffuse density.CryoEM of reduced, Nanogold-labeled LDL receptor localized the N-terminal cysteine-rich repeats to the distal end of the observed receptor images. There were significant differences in the number of Nanogold particles bound in this distal region, presumably reflecting differences in the number of accessible free cysteine residues and their Nanogold labeling. It seems reasonable to conclude that this distal domain of the imaged LDL receptor contains the seven cysteine-rich repeats of the ligand binding domain plus the two N-terminal cysteine-rich repeats of the EGF precursor homology domain.Studies of repeat motifs common to the human LDL receptor, human EGF, and other proteins have provided structural information relevant to our studies of the bovine LDL receptor. The seven cysteine-rich repeats in the ligand binding domain of the human LDL receptor sequence are connected to each other with 4-residue linker sequences, with the exception of a 12-residue sequence connecting the fourth and the fifth repeats. Two EGF-like cysteine-rich repeats of the EGF precursor homology domain closely follow the seventh repeat of the ligand binding domain. This proximity in the sequence and the proposed function of the EGF-like module in protein-protein interactions suggests that both EGF-like repeats are located near the ligand binding domain at the N terminus of the LDL receptor. The spacer sequence of the EGF precursor homology domain occupies about 70% of this 400-amino acid domain and connects the second and the third cysteine-rich EGF-like repeats. The relatively short (58 amino acids) O-linked sugar domain has been suggested to function as a strut, extending from the membrane surface (36Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), and it seems reasonable that the major part of the EGF precursor homology domain essentially extends this strut to the cysteine-rich domain.In Fig. 6 we suggest possible arrangements, particularly for the cysteine-rich repeat modules of both the ligand binding domain and the EGF precursor homology domain, consistent with the observed cryoEM images of both unlabeled and gold-labeled LDL receptor. Two issues led us to the proposed (2 + 5)-type and (4 + 3)-type arrangements of the 7 cysteine-rich repeat modules of the ligand binding domain. First, for the (2 + 5) type, binding of LDL was severely affected by mutations in repeats 3 to 7, which might imply that the first and the second repeats were located away from the binding site for the LDL (see Fig. 6 A). Second, for the (4 + 3) type, the presence of a longer linker sequence between repeats 4 and 5 suggests that a turn may occur after the fourth repeat in the ligand binding domain (see Fig. 6 B). Since the biological function of the repeated EGF-like modules in protein-protein interaction is significantly calcium-dependent, it has been suggested that an adjacent pair of this module could act as a functional unit (39Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two EGF-like repeats were positioned as a pair in the model (see Fig. 6, A and B). Finally, we have suggested possible arrangements for dimeric assemblies of the LDL receptor based on these (2 + 5) and (4 + 3) structural motifs (Fig. 6, right).In summary, the LDL receptor is a single chain membrane receptor that requires detergents or lipids for solubilization. This characteristic of the LDL receptor has made it difficult to investigate its detailed structure by x-ray crystallography. Our cryoEM approach has provided low resolution images of the full-length bovine LDL receptor (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and in this study we have used the gold labeling approach to determine the location of the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain. However, more detailed structural information must await improvements in specimen preparation for cryoEM and the crystallization of progressively larger extracellular domains of the LDL receptor (40Dirlam K.A.

The low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 receptor binds cholesterol-rich lipoproteins for receptor-mediated endocytosis and plays a key role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. This 115-kDa receptor has a mosaic structure containing five distinguishable domains based originally on the sequence of the human LDL receptor (1Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J.

These domains, beginning at the N terminus are (i) ligand binding domain, (ii) epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor homology domain, (iii) O-linked sugar domain, (iv) transmembrane domain, and (v) cytoplasmic domain. The ligand binding domain has the characteristic 7 cysteine-rich repeats consisting of a highly homologous 40-residue amino acid sequence. A study using mutated receptors found that different combinations of the cysteine-rich repeats was responsible for binding to LDL or β-migrating very low density lipoprotein (β-VLDL), both ligands for the LDL receptor (8Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations deleting one of the third to the seventh repeats in the ligand binding domain of the LDL receptor resulted in a marked reduction in LDL binding. β-VLDL binding to the LDL receptor was decreased only by deletion of the fifth cysteine-rich repeat in the ligand binding domain. LDL contains a single high molecular mass (550 kDa) protein, apoB100 (9Knott T.J. Pease R.J. Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Rall Jr S.C. Innerarity T.L. Blackhart B. Taylor W.H. Marcel Y. Milne R. Johnson D. Fuller M. Lusis A.J. McCarthy B.J. Mahley R.W. Levy-Wilson B. Scott J. Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), whereas β-VLDL has multiple copies of the smaller (33 kDa) apoE plus one molecule of apoB100 or apoB48 (10Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1277-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the receptor binding domain of apoB100 of LDL may require several of the cysteine-rich repeat modules for efficient binding, whereas the presence of multiple small apoE copies in β-VLDL may allow it to contact with other cysteine-rich repeats of the LDL receptor even when a repeat is deleted. The EGF precursor homology domain has three cysteine-rich “growth factor-like” repeats, two at its N terminus (adjacent to the ligand binding domain) and one at its C terminus (next to the O-glycosylation domain). Deletion analysis in this region of the LDL receptor suggested that the EGF precursor homology domain is required for both efficient binding of LDL and for the acid-dependent conformational change that allows the LDL receptor to release its bound ligand after acidification of the endocytic vesicle (11Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, the LDL receptor with these deletions was able to bind β-VLDL and to internalize it at a normal rate even though the receptor-recycling rate was slowed. Similar growth factor-like repeats have been identified in many proteins; cell surface receptors, viral proteins, factor IX and X of the blood clotting system, growth factors, and developmental proteins of lower eukaryotes (12Doolittle R.F.

Structural studies of the growth factor-like repeats in different proteins have provided convincing evidence that these cysteine-rich repeat modules are engaged in protein-protein interactions (19Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Recently, the atomic resolution structures of the 40-residue cysteine-rich repeats of both the ligand binding and EGF precursor homology domains of the LDL receptor have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. These include the structures of cysteine-rich repeats 1, 2, and 5 in the ligand binding domain (20Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the fifth cysteine-rich repeat in the ligand binding domain revealed a hydrophobic ligand binding surface with a well coordinated calcium-binding site (22Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The disulfide bond linkages were between Cys(I)-Cys(III), Cys(II)-Cys(V), and Cys(IV)-Cys(VI), an identical pattern to that reported for the first and the second repeats (20Daly N.L. Scanlon M.J. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14474-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The structure of repeat 5 explained why calcium ion is essential for a proper folding and disulfide bond formation of this repeat; furthermore, a sensible rationale for the calcium requirement in ligand binding (25van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was proposed (26Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The structure of a concatamer of repeats 1 and 2 suggests that little or no intermolecular interactions occur between the two modules (27Bieri S. Atkins A.R. Lee H.T. Winzor D.J. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10994-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a recent study of the concatamer of repeats 5 and 6 again indicated that each module is structurally independent of the other (28North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3926-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The human EGF is a 53-residue peptide hormone that has a sequence similarity with an EGF-like cysteine-rich repeat in the EGF precursor homology domain of the LDL receptor. The human EGF contains three disulfide-bond cross-links between Cys(I)-Cys(III), Cys(II)-Cys(IV), and Cys(V)-Cys(VI) in conserved order for disulfide-bonds in the EGF-like modules (29Cooke R.M. Wilkinson A.J. Baron M. Pastore A. Tappin M.J. Campbell I.D. Gregory H. Sheard B. Nature. 1987; 327: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The structure of the EGF-like module in blood clotting factor X in the presence and the absence of calcium showed localized structural changes around the calcium-binding site (30Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is suggested that the calcium-binding site maintains the conformation of the N-terminal region and mediates protein-protein interactions (19Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In the accompanying paper (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), stick-like, bent stick-like, and Y-shaped images of frozen, hydrated reconstituted LDL receptors have been observed using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM). In this paper, we use reduction of the disulfide linkages, maleimide-Nanogold labeling of the now available cysteine residues, and cryoEM to locate the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain. DISCUSSIONThe functionality of the LDL receptor was confirmed by binding studies to its major ligand, LDL. It has been shown that human LDL binds to the bovine LDL receptor as well as the human LDL receptor (35Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and for the region that can be compared (the C-terminal ∼25%), their amino acid sequences exhibit very high homology (36Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). This similarity of the human and bovine LDL receptors validates our use of the human LDL for binding studies with the bovine LDL receptor. The detergent-solubilized receptor and the reconstituted receptor showed LDL binding using native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and cryoEM (Fig.2). The existence of some dimer form seen in the native gels supports the earlier report of receptor dimerization (37van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimer band of the LDL receptor shown by Western blot analysis using the N-terminal antibody seemed to be affected more than the monomer band by increasing the LDL concentration, suggesting that a dimer form could provide higher affinity LDL binding. Whether the dimer form of the LDL receptor exists and functions in vivo remains to be established.Images obtained by cryoEM showed bound LDL particles at the surface of LDL receptor-containing vesicles. Many individual LDL particles were bound to the outside surface of the receptor-containing vesicles, and in some images, the stick-like extracellular domain of the LDL receptor was visible, extending from the membrane surface to the bound LDL particle. Further studies using detergent-solubilized LDL receptor (or expressed LDL receptor domains) may eventually be used to map the location on LDL where the receptor binds; a similar approach has been used to detect antibody binding sites on the surface of LDL (38Spin J. Cryoelectron Microscopy Studies of Low Density Lipoprotein in Vitreous Ice. Ph.D. thesis. Boston University, 1997Google Scholar).The successful application of monomaleimido-Nanogold labeling methods in our structural studies of the LDL receptor (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) encouraged us to use additional cysteine residues for further labeling, particularly those of the cysteine-rich N-terminal region. The reduction of these disulfide bonds was performed carefully so as not to perturb the whole structure of the LDL receptor. The LDL receptor bands that were detected in LI silver stain, silver stain, and Western blot analyses after MEA disulfide reduction were normal in appearance. Images of the reduced LDL receptor obtained by cryoEM showed more diffuse density at the end of the extracellular domain. Some images of the reduced LDL receptor still had visible stick-like or Y-shaped density as the previously reported images of the reconstituted receptor (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The distal end of both the stick-like receptor and the Y-shaped receptor images showed additional diffuse density.CryoEM of reduced, Nanogold-labeled LDL receptor localized the N-terminal cysteine-rich repeats to the distal end of the observed receptor images. There were significant differences in the number of Nanogold particles bound in this distal region, presumably reflecting differences in the number of accessible free cysteine residues and their Nanogold labeling. It seems reasonable to conclude that this distal domain of the imaged LDL receptor contains the seven cysteine-rich repeats of the ligand binding domain plus the two N-terminal cysteine-rich repeats of the EGF precursor homology domain.Studies of repeat motifs common to the human LDL receptor, human EGF, and other proteins have provided structural information relevant to our studies of the bovine LDL receptor. The seven cysteine-rich repeats in the ligand binding domain of the human LDL receptor sequence are connected to each other with 4-residue linker sequences, with the exception of a 12-residue sequence connecting the fourth and the fifth repeats. Two EGF-like cysteine-rich repeats of the EGF precursor homology domain closely follow the seventh repeat of the ligand binding domain. This proximity in the sequence and the proposed function of the EGF-like module in protein-protein interactions suggests that both EGF-like repeats are located near the ligand binding domain at the N terminus of the LDL receptor. The spacer sequence of the EGF precursor homology domain occupies about 70% of this 400-amino acid domain and connects the second and the third cysteine-rich EGF-like repeats. The relatively short (58 amino acids) O-linked sugar domain has been suggested to function as a strut, extending from the membrane surface (36Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), and it seems reasonable that the major part of the EGF precursor homology domain essentially extends this strut to the cysteine-rich domain.In Fig. 6 we suggest possible arrangements, particularly for the cysteine-rich repeat modules of both the ligand binding domain and the EGF precursor homology domain, consistent with the observed cryoEM images of both unlabeled and gold-labeled LDL receptor. Two issues led us to the proposed (2 + 5)-type and (4 + 3)-type arrangements of the 7 cysteine-rich repeat modules of the ligand binding domain. First, for the (2 + 5) type, binding of LDL was severely affected by mutations in repeats 3 to 7, which might imply that the first and the second repeats were located away from the binding site for the LDL (see Fig. 6 A). Second, for the (4 + 3) type, the presence of a longer linker sequence between repeats 4 and 5 suggests that a turn may occur after the fourth repeat in the ligand binding domain (see Fig. 6 B). Since the biological function of the repeated EGF-like modules in protein-protein interaction is significantly calcium-dependent, it has been suggested that an adjacent pair of this module could act as a functional unit (39Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two EGF-like repeats were positioned as a pair in the model (see Fig. 6, A and B). Finally, we have suggested possible arrangements for dimeric assemblies of the LDL receptor based on these (2 + 5) and (4 + 3) structural motifs (Fig. 6, right).In summary, the LDL receptor is a single chain membrane receptor that requires detergents or lipids for solubilization. This characteristic of the LDL receptor has made it difficult to investigate its detailed structure by x-ray crystallography. Our cryoEM approach has provided low resolution images of the full-length bovine LDL receptor (31Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30458-30464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and in this study we have used the gold labeling approach to determine the location of the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain. However, more detailed structural information must await improvements in specimen preparation for cryoEM and the crystallization of progressively larger extracellular domains of the LDL receptor (40Dirlam K.A.
