Alloying platinum with other metals can create shells of platinum on cores of less expensive metals, which increases its surface exposure, and compressive strain in the layer can also boost its activity (see the Perspective by Stephens et al. ). Bu et al. produced nanoplates—platinum-lead cores covered with platinum shells—that were in tensile strain. These nanoplates had high and stable ORR activity, which theory suggests arises from the strain optimizing the platinum-oxygen bond strength. Li et al. optimized both the amount of surface-exposed platinum and the specific activity. They made nanowires with a nickel oxide core and a platinum shell, annealed them to the metal alloy, and then leached out the nickel to form a rough surface. The mass activity was about double the best reported values from previous studies. Science , this issue p. 1410 , p. 1414 ; see also p. 1378"
https://openalex.org/W2553168182,"Hydraulic fracturing has been inferred to trigger the majority of injection-induced earthquakes in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A template-based earthquake catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that earthquakes are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (MW) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months."

Ravi et al. discovered a FRB that is exceptionally bright (see the Perspective by Kaspi). This allowed them to measure how the polarization of the signal varies with wavelength (Faraday rotation). Combining this with the time delay of the flash at different wavelengths revealed the mean magnetic field along the line of sight. Assuming that the FRB originates from a colocated galaxy, the results constrain the intergalactic magnetic field and will inform models of galaxy formation and cosmology.

https://openalex.org/W2553434692,"Incomplete reporting of study methods and results has become a focal point for failures in the reproducibility and translation of findings from preclinical research. Here we demonstrate that incomplete reporting of preclinical research is not limited to a few elements of research design, but rather is a broader problem that extends to the reporting of the methods and results. We evaluated 47 preclinical research studies from a systematic review of acute lung injury that use mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a treatment. We operationalized the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) reporting guidelines for pre-clinical studies into 109 discrete reporting sub-items and extracted 5,123 data elements. Overall, studies reported less than half (47%) of all sub-items (median 51 items; range 37–64). Across all studies, the Methods Section reported less than half (45%) and the Results Section reported less than a third (29%). There was no association between journal impact factor and completeness of reporting, which suggests that incomplete reporting of preclinical research occurs across all journals regardless of their perceived prestige. Incomplete reporting of methods and results will impede attempts to replicate research findings and maximize the value of preclinical studies."

We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties."

The molecular mechanisms underlying OP remain enigmatic partly due to a lack of animal models mirroring OP in patients. Using apolipoprotein E knock-out (apoE−/−) mice on a high fat (HF) diet as an atherosclerotic obesity model, we demonstrated 1) microRNA-155 (miRNA-155, miR-155) is significantly up-regulated in the aortas of apoE−/− mice, and miR-155 deficiency in apoE−/− mice inhibits atherosclerosis; 2) apoE−/−/miR-155−/− (double knock-out (DKO)) mice show HF diet-induced obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, and present with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; 3) DKO mice demonstrate HF diet-induced elevations of plasma leptin, resistin, fed-state and fasting insulin and increased expression of adipogenic transcription factors but lack glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Our results are the first to present an OP model using DKO mice with features of decreased atherosclerosis, increased obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Our findings suggest the mechanistic role of reduced miR-155 expression in OP and present a new OP working model based on a single miRNA deficiency in diet-induced obese atherogenic mice. Furthermore, our results serve as a breakthrough in understanding the potential mechanism underlying OP and provide a new biomarker and novel therapeutic target for OP-related metabolic diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2555162421,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO2 ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO2 ice-rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO2 ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO2 ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO2 ice and the depth of the eroded surface layer. We interpret the presence of CO2 ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet."
https://openalex.org/W2553782111,"Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is widely used in orthopaedic surgery for both prevention and treatment of infection. Little is known about the effect of different brand combinations of antibiotic and bone cement on the elution profile and mechanical strength of ALBC. Standardized specimens that consisted of one of the 4 brands of bone cement and one of the 3 brands of vancomycin were fashioned, producing 12 combinations of ALBC. Two dosages of vancomycin in 40g bone cement were used to represent the high (4g vancomycin) and low (1g vancomycin) dose groups. Concentrations of vancomycin elution from ALBC was measured for up to 336 hours. The ultimate compression strength was tested at axial compression using a material testing machine before and after elution. In both high-dose and low-dose groups, Lyo-Vancin in PALACOS bone cement resulted in the highest cumulative elution and Vanco in Simplex P bone cement resulted in the lowest elution (458% and 65% higher in high- and low-dose groups, respectively). The mechanical strength was not significantly compromised in all groups with low dose vancomycin (range: 70.31 ± 2.74 MPa to 87.28 ± 8.26MPa after elution). However, with the addition of high dose vancomycin, there was a mixed amount of reduction in the ultimate compression strength after cement aging, ranging from 5% (Vanco in Simplex P, 81.10 ± 0.48 MPa after elution) to 38% (Sterile vancomycin in CMW, 60.94 ± 5.74 MPa after elution). We concluded that the selection of brands of vancomycin and bone cement has a great impact on the release efficacy and mechanical strength of ALBC."
https://openalex.org/W2549757281,"Agonistic antibodies directed against immunostimulatory receptors belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily are emerging as promising cancer immunotherapies. Several Fc engineering approaches discovered recently can augment the anti-tumor activities of TNFR antibodies by enhancing their agonistic activities and/or effector functions. In this study, we compared these approaches for their effects on an anti-OX40 antibody. Both S267E/L328F and V12 mutations facilitated enhanced binding to FcγRIIB and thus increased FcγRIIB cross-linking mediated agonist activity. However, both mutations abrogated the binding to FcγRIIIA and thereby decreasing the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activities. In contrast, the E345R mutation, which can promote antibody multimerization upon receptor binding, facilitated anti-OX40 antibody to have increased agonism by promoting the clustering of OX40 receptors without the dependence on FcγRIIB cross-linking. Nonetheless, cross-linking to FcγRIIB can lead to a further boost of the agonism of the anti-OX40 antibody with IgG1 Fc but not with the silent IgG2σ Fc. The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity activities of the anti-OX40 antibody with the E345R mutation were affected by the choice of IgG subtypes. However, there was little change in the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis activity.

Monoclonal antibodies that stimulate antitumor immunity are emerging as an important class of cancer therapeutics (1.Mellman I. Coukos G. Dranoff G. Cancer immunotherapy comes of age.Nature. 2011; 480: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar, 2.Chen L. Flies D.B. Molecular mechanisms of T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar). The antibodies (Abs) targeting the immune checkpoint receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have been approved as monotherapies for advanced melanoma, lung cancer, and evaluated for the treatment of other types of human cancer. Besides targeting the inhibitory pathways, agonist antibodies directed against the immunostimulatory receptors on T cells and antigen presenting cells can also stimulate antitumor immunity and are emerging as a promising area of clinical development for cancer immunotherapies (3.Schaer D.A. Hirschhorn-Cymerman D. Wolchok J.D. Targeting tumor-necrosis factor receptor pathways for tumor immunotherapy.J. Immunother. Cancer. 2014; 2: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Many immunostimulatory receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). 3The abbreviations used are: TNFRSF, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily; ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; ADCP, antibodydependent cellular phagocytosis; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; CDC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; GITR, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein; HVEM, Herpesvirus entry mediator; PPI, protein-protein interaction; SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; SEAP, secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase; HC, heavy chain; LC, light chain. TNFRSF include OX40, CD27, 4-1BB, HVEM, and GITR, which are expressed on effector T cells. The respective ligands and agonist antibodies can activate these receptors to stimulate the proliferation and activation of T cells (4.Kanamaru F. Youngnak P. Hashiguchi M. Nishioka T. Takahashi T.

The activation of CD40 that is expressed on antigen presenting cells facilitates more efficacious presentation of tumor antigens to activated T cells (8.Khalil M. Vonderheide R.H.

On the other hand, several TNFRSFs, such as OX40 and GITR, have elevated expression on regulatory T cells (Treg), which negatively modulate tumor immunity (12.Bulliard Y. Jolicoeur R. Windman M.

OX40 engagement depletes intratumoral Tregs via activating FcgammaRs, leading to antitumor efficacy.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several studies have revealed that the anti-OX40 and anti-GITR antibodies may facilitate the selective elimination of regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment by the effector functions of the antibody (12.Bulliard Y. Jolicoeur R. Windman M. Rue S.M. Ettenberg S. Knee D.A. Wilson N.S. Dranoff G. Brogdon J.L.

OX40 engagement depletes intratumoral Tregs via activating FcgammaRs, leading to antitumor efficacy.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Such antibody-mediated killing of regulatory T cells may be more important than the antibody-mediated activation of effector T cells for the anti-tumor activities of therapeutic anti-OX40 and anti-GITR antibodies. Accumulating evidence indicates that immunomodulatory antibodies engage different types of Fc receptors for their agonistic activities and effector functions. To activate downstream signaling pathways, receptor oligomerization is a prerequisite for TNFRSFs. Despite having bivalency, one antibody molecule may not be enough to cluster enough TNFRs. Instead, antibody cross-linking via attachment on beads or surface of assay plate can be necessary for receptor activation in in vitro assays (14.Morris N.P. Peters C. Montler R. Hu H.M. Curti B.D.

Immunol. 2007; 44: 3112-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice indicated that the engagement to the inhibitory FcγRIIB receptor is critical for the agonistic activity of antibodies to a number of TNFR targets, including CD40 (15.Li F.

FcγRs modulate cytotoxicity of anti-Fas antibodies: implications for agonistic antibody-based therapeutics.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of IgG Fc to FcγRIIB receptors can multimerize more than one antibody molecule, which in turn can facilitate the clustering of enough TNFRs for signaling pathway activation. On the other hand, the antibody effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), depend on the interactions with various activating Fcγ receptors. Studies in mice revealed that activating Fcγ receptors contribute to the antitumor activities of immunomodulatory anti-OX40 and anti-GITR antibodies by selectively eliminating intratumoral regulatory T cells (12.Bulliard Y. Jolicoeur R. Windman M. Rue S.M. Ettenberg S. Knee D.A. Wilson N.S. Dranoff G. Brogdon J.L.

OX40 engagement depletes intratumoral Tregs via activating FcgammaRs, leading to antitumor efficacy.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, human IgG antibodies have poor binding affinities to the majority of human Fc receptors except FcγRI (19.Guilliams M. Bruhns P. Saeys Y. Hammad H. Lambrecht B.N. The function of Fcγ receptors in dendritic cells and macrophages.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To optimize the antitumor activity of agonist antibodies for immunostimulatory TNFRSFs, one approach is to engineer the Fc region of the IgG antibody to improve its Fcγ receptor engagement, particularly through the engagement with FcγRIIB receptor, which mediates the agonism of TNFR antibodies. In this regard, Chu et al. (20.Chu S.Y. Vostiar I. Karki S. Moore G.L. Lazar G.A. Pong E. Joyce P.F. Szymkowski D.E. Desjarlais J.R. Inhibition of B cell receptor-mediated activation of primary human B cells by coengagement of CD19 and FcγRIIb with Fc-engineered antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3926-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) described S267E/L328F (serine at position 267 replaced with glutamic acid and leucine at position 328 replaced with phenylalanine) mutations in human IgG1 Fc domain with enhanced FcγRIIB binding affinity. Anti-CD19 antibody engineered with such mutations showed improved inhibition of B cell receptor-mediated activation of primary human B cells. However, further study revealed that such Fc variant also has enhanced binding to Arg131 allotype of the activating FcγRIIA receptor (21.Mimoto F. Katada H. Kadono S. Igawa T. Kuramochi T. Muraoka M. Wada Y. Haraya K. Miyazaki T. Hattori K. Engineered antibody Fc variant with selectively enhanced FcγRIIb binding over both FcγRIIa(R131) and FcγRIIa(H131).Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2013; 26: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, Mimoto et al. (21.Mimoto F. Katada H. Kadono S. Igawa T. Kuramochi T. Muraoka M. Wada Y. Haraya K. Miyazaki T. Hattori K. Engineered antibody Fc variant with selectively enhanced FcγRIIb binding over both FcγRIIa(R131) and FcγRIIa(H131).Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2013; 26: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported a set of six mutations in IgG1 Fc, collectively named as the V12 mutations, with selectively enhanced FcγRIIB engagement without associated increased binding to either His131 or Arg131 allotype of FcγRIIA receptor. The anti-CD137 antibody with the engineered V12 mutations showed much enhanced agonistic activity dependent on FcγRIIB engagement. Although optimizing FcγRIIB engagement is a viable approach, the agonistic activity of such engineered antibodies depend heavily on the Fcγ receptor expression in the local microenvironment and the efficacy of such antibody may be limited to the anatomical site of action. In an effort to augment the agonism of immunostimulatory antibodies independent of Fcγ receptor engagement, White et al. (22.White A.L. Chan H.T. French R.R. Willoughby J. Mockridge C.I. Roghanian A. Penfold C.A. Booth S.G. Dodhy A. Polak M.E. Potter E.A. Ardern-Jones M.R. Verbeek J.S. Johnson P.W. Al-Shamkhani A. et al.Conformation of the human immunoglobulin γ2 hinge imparts superagonistic properties to immunostimulatory anticancer antibodies.Cancer Cell. 2015; 27: 138-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) recently reported that human IgG2 hinge framework can impart superagonistic activity to immunostimulatory antibodies that target CD40, 4-1BB, and CD28 receptors. This activity is conferred by a unique configuration of disulfide bonds in the hinge region of the IgG2 subtype and is not dependent on FcγRIIB engagement. On the other hand, if the purpose of cross-linking to FcγRIIB is solely to increase the clustering of agonistic antibodies for receptor activation, then we hypothesized that Fc mutations that can promote antibody multimerization may enhance the agonism of antibodies to TNFRSFs without the need for FcγRIIB cross-linking. Diebolder et al. (23.Diebolder C.A. Beurskens F.J. de Jong R.N. Koning R.I. Strumane K. Lindorfer M.A. Voorhorst M. Ugurlar D. Rosati S. Heck A.J. van de Winkel J.G. Wilson I.A. Koster A.J. Taylor R.P. Saphire E.O. et al.Complement is activated by IgG hexamers assembled at the cell surface.Science. 2014; 343: 1260-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) reported that selective Fc mutations can facilitate IgG antibody hexamer formation upon binding target proteins on a cell surface. Although it was reported that such IgG hexamer can greatly activate ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and induce apoptosis (24.de Jong R.N. Beurskens F.J. Verploegen S. Strumane K. van Kampen M.D. Voorhorst M. Horstman W. Engelberts P.J. Oostindie S.C. Wang G. Heck A.J. Schuurman J. Parren P.W. A novel platform for the potentiation of therapeutic antibodies based on antigen-dependent formation of IgG hexamers at the cell surface.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14: e1002344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that another application can be that oligomerized antibodies to TNFRSFs can activate the receptors by promoting receptor clustering. Although many of the Fc mutations for Abs have been published in disparate reports, we present in this study a systematic evaluation of different Fc engineering approaches on the enhancement of the agonism of an anti-OX40 antibody. Besides, the effects of Fc mutations on the ADCC, ADCP, and CDC effector functions of the engineered antibodies were also evaluated. Such study can guide the design of engineered antibodies to OX40 and other TNFRSFs for improved anti-tumor activity. OX40, a member 4 of TNFRSF (also known as CD134) activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway by binding to TNF receptor-associated factors (25.Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. 4–1BB and Ox40 are members of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-nerve growth factor receptor subfamily that bind TNF receptor-associated factors and activate nuclear factor κB.Mol. Cell.

To study the contributions of Fc engineering on the agonistic activity of OX40 antibodies, we established a HEK-Blue reporter cell line with stably expressing human OX40 that was used to set up a NF-κB reporter assay to assess OX40 functional activity. The reporter assay showed that OX40 ligand could activate the transfected OX40 receptor to elicit secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The OX40SF2IgG1, a humanized anti-OX40 antibody SF2 (27Simons, P. J., Boon, L., Luo, J., Brezski, R. J., and Goldberg, M., (December 25, 2014) Humanized anti-CD134 (OX40) antibodies and uses thereof. U. S. Patent 2014/0377284,Google Scholar) with native IgG1 Fc, was then evaluated for its agonistic activity by this reporter assay. Although the monomeric antibody in solution showed little agonistic activity, OX40SF2IgG1 antibody immobilized on protein G beads could stimulate reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent manner and to a level better than OX40 ligand at 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 1A). This result demonstrated that antibody cross-linking was needed for the agonistic activity. Recent studies revealed that FcγRIIB can provide the cross-linking activity and facilitate the agonistic activity of TNFR antibodies (28.Li F. Ravetch J.V. A general requirement for FcγRIIB co-engagement of agonistic anti-TNFR antibodies.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 3343-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The FcγRIIB cross-linking effect was assessed in the reporter assay by co-culturing HEK-Blue:OX40 cells with human B lymphoblastoid Raji cells that had FcγRIIB expression (29.Rankin C.T. Veri M.C. Gorlatov S. Tuaillon N. Burke S. Huang L. Inzunza H.D. Li H. Thomas S. Johnson S. Stavenhagen J. Koenig S. Bonvini E. CD32B, the human inhibitory Fc-γ receptor IIB, as a target for monoclonal antibody therapy of B-cell lymphoma.Blood. 2006; 108: 2384-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, co-culturing with Raji cells failed to significantly enhance the agonistic activity of SF2 antibody with native human IgG1 Fc domain (Fig. 1B). S267E/L328F and V12 mutations are Fc mutations that facilitate enhanced binding of human Ab to FcγRIIB receptor (20.Chu S.Y. Vostiar I. Karki S. Moore G.L. Lazar G.A. Pong E. Joyce P.F. Szymkowski D.E. Desjarlais J.R. Inhibition of B cell receptor-mediated activation of primary human B cells by coengagement of CD19 and FcγRIIb with Fc-engineered antibodies.Mol.

To evaluate the effects of such mutations on anti-OX40 antibody, we engineered OX40SF2IgG1 antibody to have the S267E/L328F double mutations (OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F) and the V12 mutations (OX40SF2IgG1V12). Their binding to Fcγ receptors expressed on transiently transfected Expi293F cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Although OX40SF2 antibody with native IgG1 had poor binding to FcγRIIB, the engineered Fc mutations potently increased EC50 values for OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F (459 ng/ml, 3.1 nm) and OX40SF2IgG1V12 (502 ng/ml, 3.4 nm) binding to FcγRIIB. These EC50 values were comparable with those for 2B6 (431 ng/ml, 2.9 nm), a monoclonal antibody with specific binding to FcγRIIB (30.Veri M.C. Gorlatov S. Li H. Burke S. Johnson S. Stavenhagen J. Stein K.E. Bonvini E. Koenig S. Monoclonal antibodies capable of discriminating the human inhibitory Fcγ-receptor IIB (CD32B) from the activating Fcγ-receptor IIA (CD32A): biochemical, biological and functional characterization.Immunology. 2007; 121: 392-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)(Fig. 2A). Similar flow cytometry assays were performed to assess the binding of engineered anti-OX40 antibodies to the Arg131 allotype of FcγRIIA expressed on transiently transfected Expi293F cells. Although OX40SF2IgG1V12 and OX40SF2IgG1 similarly had poor binding to FcγRIIA, the S267E/L328F mutations had a 20-fold more potent EC50 value (216 ng/ml, 1.5 nm) for binding to FcγRIIAArg131 (Fig. 2B). This data corroborated previous findings that both S267E/L328F and V12 mutations could enhance FcγRIIB binding (21.Mimoto F. Katada H. Kadono S. Igawa T. Kuramochi T. Muraoka M. Wada Y. Haraya K. Miyazaki T. Hattori K. Engineered antibody Fc variant with selectively enhanced FcγRIIb binding over both FcγRIIa(R131) and FcγRIIa(H131).Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2013; 26: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For FcγRI, OX40SF2IgG1 showed high affinity with an EC50 value of 326 ng/ml, 2.2 nm (Fig. 2C). The OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F antibody showed a similar binding property as OX40SF2IgG1. However, the V12 mutations significantly abrogated the binding to FcγRI. The binding of the engineered anti-OX40 antibodies to FcγRIIIA receptor were also evaluated by flow cytometry assay. Although OX40SF2IgG1 antibody had binding to FcγRIIIA (EC50 ∼ 744 ng/ml, 5.0 nm), the OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F and OX40SF2IgG1V12 Abs had no binding to FcγRIIIA (Fig. 2D). Because S267E/L328F and V12 mutations facilitate OX40SF2IgG1 antibody with increased binding affinity to FcγRIIB, we assessed whether these enhanced binding may lead to increased agonism of anti-OX40 antibody by the HEK-Blue NF-κB reporter assay. First, the binding of engineered anti-OX40 antibodies to Raji cells were assessed by a flow cytometry assay. OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F and OX40SF2IgG1V12, but not OX40SF2IgG1, showed a dose-dependent binding to Raji cells (Fig. 3A), albeit with less potency compared with Expi293F cells transfected with FcγRIIB receptor (Fig. 2A). To confirm the binding to Raji cells were mediated by FcγRIIB, we pre-treated Raji cells with 5 μg/ml of FcγRIIB-specific 2B6 antibody before assessing the binding of engineered anti-OX40 antibody to Raji cells. It was observed that 2B6 antibody significantly abrogated the binding of OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F and OX40SF2IgG1V12 to Raji cells (Fig. 3B). In HEK-Blue NF-κB reporter assay, neither OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F nor OX40SF2IgG1V12 showed significant agonistic activity in the absence of Raji cells. However, with co-culturing Raji cells and HEK-Blue:OX40 cells, these engineered anti-OX40 antibodies showed dramatically increased agonism, with over 2-fold better efficacy compared with OX40 ligand at 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 3, C and D). When 2B6 antibody was added to pre-block FcγRIIB receptor on Raji cells, the Raji cell-dependent enhancement of agonism for OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F and OX40SF2IgG1V12 antibodies were significantly decreased (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that the agonistic activities of the engineered antibody were mediated by FcγRIIB cross-linking. A bioluminescent reporter gene expression in effector cells served as a model of FcγRIIIA-mediated ADCC activation. When HEK-Blue:OX40 target cells were co-cultured with effector cells expressing FcγRIIIA, OX40SF2IgG1 activated reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. Neither OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F nor OX40SF2IgG1V12 induced reporter gene expression (Fig. 4A), indicating that the S267E/L328F and V12 mutations abrogated the ADCC activity of OX40SF2IgG1 antibody. These results were consistent with the loss of binding activities for the engineered antibodies to FcγRIIIA (Fig. 2D). The ADCP activities of the anti-OX40 antibodies with S267E/L328F and V12 mutations were evaluated via phagocytosis of GFP-expressed HEK-Blue:OX40 cells by macrophages differentiated from isolated monocytes. Both the OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F and the OX40SF2IgG1V12 had similar ADCP activities on HEK-Blue:OX40 target cells as OX40SF2IgG1 (Fig. 4B). The binding of engineered anti-OX40 antibodies to differentiated macrophages were assessed by a flow cytometry assay. The OX40SF2IgG1S267E/L328F antibody had binding affinity to macrophages similar to that of the OX40SF2IgG1 antibody. Although active in ADCP assay, the OX40SF2IgG1V12 antibody had a significantly reduced binding to macrophages (Fig. 4C). The CDC activity was determined by a rabbit complement-mediated cell killing assay. The OX40SF2IgG1 antibody did not lead to significant CDC activity toward HEK-Blue:OX40 target cells up to 10,000 ng/ml. Likewise, neither the V12 nor S267E/L328F mutations facilitated higher CDC activities relative to the antibody with the native human IgG1 Fc domain (Fig. 4D). Diebolder et al. (23.Diebolder C.A. Beurskens F.J. de Jong R.N. Koning R.I. Strumane K. Lindorfer M.A. Voorhorst M. Ugurlar D. Rosati S. Heck A.J. van de Winkel J.G. Wilson I.A. Koster A.J. Taylor R.P. Saphire E.O. et al.Complement is activated by IgG hexamers assembled at the cell surface.Science. 2014; 343: 1260-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) identified a set of Fc mutations (E345R, E430G, S440Y) that can facilitate hexamerization of IgG1 Abs when bound to cell surface antigens. We hypothesized that antibody multimerization could enhance the agonism of therapeutic TNFR antibodies by facilitating the aggregation of TNFRs, which could result in receptor activation. To test this hypothesis, we engineered OX40SF2IgG1 antibody to have the E345R mutation (OX40SF2IgG1E345R), E430G mutation (OX40SF2IgG1E430G), E345R/E430G double mutations (OX40SF2IgG1E345R/E430G), and E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutations (OX40SF2IgG1E345R/E430G/S440Y). SEC analyses revealed that OX40SF2IgG1E345R, OX40SF2IgG1E430G, and OX40SF2IgG1E345R/E430G antibodies were monomers in solution just as OX40SF2IgG1 (Fig. 5A). However, OX40SF2IgG1 antibody with E345R/E430G/S440Y triple mutations had a monomeric peak and a ∼900 kDa peak determined by SEC with multi-angle light scattering analysis (SEC-MALS), which was indicative of a hexamer state. This observation was consistent with the reported finding that E345R/E430G/S440Y mutations could promote hexamer formation readily in the solution phase (23.Diebolder C.A. Beurskens F.J. de Jong R.N.

https://openalex.org/W2567371399,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate PI3K/v-AKT thymoma viral oncoprotein (AKT) to regulate many cellular functions that promote cell survival, proliferation, and growth. However, the mechanism by which GPCRs activate PI3K/AKT remains poorly understood. We used ovarian preantral granulosa cells (GCs) to elucidate the mechanism by which the GPCR agonist FSH via PKA activates the PI3K/AKT cascade. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is secreted in an autocrine/paracrine manner by GCs and activates the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) but, in the absence of FSH, fails to stimulate YXXM phosphorylation of IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) required for PI3K/AKT activation. We show that PKA directly phosphorylates the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) to activate PP1 associated with the IGF1R-IRS1 complex. Activated PP1 is sufficient to dephosphorylate at least four IRS1 Ser residues, Ser318, Ser346, Ser612, and Ser789, and promotes IRS1 YXXM phosphorylation by the IGF1R to activate the PI3K/AKT cascade. Additional experiments indicate that this mechanism also occurs in breast cancer, thyroid, and preovulatory granulosa cells, suggesting that the PKA-dependent dephosphorylation of IRS1 Ser/Thr residues is a conserved mechanism by which GPCRs signal to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway downstream of the IGF1R."
https://openalex.org/W2553549812,"Many microfluidic systems-including chemical reaction, sample analysis, separation, chemotaxis, and drug development and injection-require control and precision of solute transport. Although concentration levels are easily specified at injection, pressure-driven transport through channels is known to spread the initial distribution, resulting in reduced concentrations downstream. Here we document an unexpected phenomenon: The channel's cross-sectional aspect ratio alone can control the shape of the concentration profile along the channel length. Thin channels (aspect ratio << 1) deliver solutes arriving with sharp fronts and tapering tails, whereas thick channels (aspect ratio ~ 1) produce the opposite effect. This occurs for rectangular and elliptical pipes, independent of initial distributions. Thus, it is possible to deliver solute with prescribed distributions, ranging from gradual buildup to sudden delivery, based only on the channel dimensions."

In the current study, we have discovered that PDK4 is a short lived protein (t½ ∼ 1 h) and is specifically degraded by the mitochondrial protease Lon. Lon does not rapidly degrade PDK1 and -2, indicating specificity toward the PDK isoform that is a potent modulator of metabolic flexibility. Moreover, PDK4 degradation appears regulated by dissociation from the PDH complex dependent on the respiratory state and energetic substrate availability of mouse heart mitochondria. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of PDK4 promotes PDK4 degradation in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a novel strategy to manipulate PDH activity by selectively targeting PDK4 content through dissociation and proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2557077874,"Background Patients with schizophrenia have significantly shorter life expectancy than the general population, and a problem they commonly face is an unhealthy lifestyle, which can lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome. There is a very clear need to determine the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus which are components of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia, but there has been a paucity of large-scale studies examining this situation in Japan. The aim of our study was to address this need. Setting & Participants We conducted a large-scale investigation of the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus using a questionnaire in 520 outpatient facilities and 247 inpatient facilities of the Japan Psychiatric Hospitals Association between January 2012 and July 2013. There were 7,655 outpatients and 15,461 inpatients with schizophrenia. Results The outpatients had significantly higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyper-LDL cholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus than the inpatients. The prevalence of hypo-HDL cholesterolemia was higher in inpatients than outpatients. Age-specific analysis showed the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyper-LDL cholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus among outpatients to be 2- to 3-fold higher than among inpatients. In individuals aged ≥60 years, the prevalence of obesity and DM among outpatients was about 3-fold higher than among inpatients. Conclusion Japanese outpatients with schizophrenia were more likely to have physical risk such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus than inpatients. The physical risk to patients with schizophrenia may be affected by environmental parameters, such as type of care. The physical risk to Japanese patients with schizophrenia demands greater attention."

However, these products have not been linked to the respective biosynthetic genes, and therefore, their biosynthesis has not yet been analyzed on a molecular level. Feeding experiments with isotopically labeled precursors clearly supported a polyketide origin for the formal monoterpenoid gibepyrone A, whereas the terpenoid pathway could be excluded. Targeted gene deletion verified that the F. fujikuroi polyketide synthase PKS13, designated Gpy1, is responsible for gibepyrone A biosynthesis. Next to Gpy1, the ATP-binding cassette transporter Gpy2 is encoded by the gibepyrone gene cluster. Gpy2 was shown to have only a minor impact on the actual efflux of gibepyrone A out of the cell. Instead, we obtained evidence that Gpy2 is involved in gene regulation as it represses GPY1 gene expression. Thus, GPY1 was up-regulated and gibepyrone A production was enhanced both extra- and intracellularly in Δgpy2 mutants. Furthermore, expression of GPY genes is strictly repressed by members of the fungus-specific velvet complex, Vel1, Vel2, and Lae1, whereas Sge1, a major regulator of secondary metabolism in F. fujikuroi, affects gibepyrone biosynthesis in a positive manner. The gibepyrone A derivatives gibepyrones B and D were shown to be produced by cluster-independent P450 monooxygenases, probably to protect the fungus from the toxic product.

https://openalex.org/W2555952628,"Background An important objective of rehabilitation care is to regain adequate balance function to safely ambulate in community. However, in rehabilitation practice, it remains unclear if a stroke survivor functionally recovers by restitution or by learning to compensate for the lack of restoration of body function. Aim of this study is to propose and evaluate methods for the objective evaluation of balance during functional walking in stroke survivors. Methods Stroke survivors performed twice a Timed “Up & Go” (TUG) test. Ground reaction forces and position changes of both feet were measured using instrumented shoes and used to estimate the position of the center of mass (CoM). Balance control and efficiency metrics were defined to evaluate functional walking under variable conditions. Metrics were corrected based on the instantaneous velocity direction of CoM. Intra- and inter-participant variations for different phases of the TUG test were examined. Metrics were related to the Berg balance scale (BBS). Results Participants with higher BBS scores show a more efficient walking pattern. Their walking velocity and walking direction is less variable and they are more frequently unstable when walking in a straight line or when turning. Furthermore, the less affected participants are able to move their CoM more towards their affected side. Discussion We developed and demonstrated a method to assess walking balance of stroke survivors. System design and evaluation methods allow balance evaluation during functional walking in daily life. Some presented metrics show correlations with BBS scores. Clear inter- and intra-patient variations in metric values are present that cannot be explained by BBS scores, which supports the additional value of the presented system. Presented methods may be used for objective evaluation of restitution and compensation of walking balance and have a potential application in individual evidence-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2549229677,"Background IL-17 has been shown to be involved in liver inflammatory disorders in both mice and humans. Baicalin (BA), a major compound extracted from traditional herb medicine (Scutellariae radix), has potent hepatoprotective properties. Previous study showed that BA inhibits IL-17-mediated lymphocyte adhesion and downregulates joint inflammation. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of IL-17 in the hepatoprotective effects of BA in an acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury mouse model. Methods Eight weeks male C57BL/6 (B6) mice were used for this study. Mice received intraperitoneal hepatotoxic injection of APAP (300 mg/kg) and after 30 min of injection, the mice were treated with BA at a concentration of 30 mg/kg. After 16 h of treatment, mice were killed. Blood samples and liver tissues were harvested for analysis of liver injury parameters. Results APAP overdose significantly increased the serum alanine transferase (ALT) levels, hepatic activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO), expression of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17), and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity when compared with the control animals. BA treatment after APAP administration significantly attenuated the elevation of these parameters in APAP-induced liver injury mice. Furthermore, BA treatment could also decrease hepatic IL-17-producing γδT cells recruitment, which was induced after APAP overdose. Conclusion Our data suggested that baicalin treatment could effectively decrease APAP-induced liver injury in part through attenuation of hepatic IL-17 expression. These results indicate that baicalin is a potential hepatoprotective agent."
https://openalex.org/W2551203005,"Previously, we showed that levels of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) are increased in a panel of cultured human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and that S1PR3-mediated signaling pathways regulate proliferation, soft agar growth, and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro.

Previously, we showed that levels of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) are significantly increased in cultured human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (16.Hsu A. Zhang W. Lee J.F. An J.

Moreover, we demonstrated that the S1PR3-activated signaling pathways play an important role in promoting the progression and invasiveness of human lung adenocarcinoma cells (11.Zhang W. Zhao J.

For example, TGF-β regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is a critical process in cancer initiation and progression (17.Papageorgis P.

Also, TGF-β stimulates the production of inflammatory cytokines in tumor microenvironments (21.Fuxe J. Karlsson M.C.

Upon TGF-β ligation, TGF-β receptors phosphorylate SMAD (homolog of mothers against decapentaplegic) signaling molecules, leading to the nuclear translocation of SMADs. The nucleus-localized SMADs interact with specific transcriptional activators and repressors and regulate the expression of tumorigenic genes (24.Nagaraj N.S. Datta P.K. Targeting the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway in human cancer.Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2010; 19: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β activates SMAD-independent pathways such as MAPK, JNK, NFκB, Ras/Raf/ERK, and Rho kinase pathways in a cell type-dependent manner (24.Nagaraj N.S. Datta P.K. Targeting the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway in human cancer.Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2010; 19: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25.Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. TGF-β signaling in tumor suppression and cancer progression.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Although both SMAD and non-SMAD pathways were reported to be involved in tumorigenic process, the mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Previous studies have suggested the cross-talk between TGF-β and S1P signaling pathways. TGF-β was shown to activate SphK1 and stimulate the production of S1P (26.Yamanaka M. Shegogue D. Pei H. Bu S. Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Pettus B. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L. Trojanowska M. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is induced by transforming growth factor-β and mediates TIMP-1 up-regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53994-54001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which may be involved in extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis. On the other hand, S1P transactivates the TGF-β pathway and regulates several TGF-β-mediated physiological and pathological functions (27.Xin C. Ren S. Kleuser B. Shabahang S. Eberhardt W. Radeke H. Schäfer-Korting M. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. Sphingosine 1-phosphate cross-activates the Smad signaling cascade and mimics transforming growth factor-β-induced cell responses.J. Biol.

Thus, a better understanding of the cross-talk between the S1P- and TGF-β mediated signaling pathways is expected to open new perspectives for the treatment of TGF-β-triggered pathologies such as inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. In the present study, we show that levels of S1PR3 are significantly increased in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Mechanistically, our data suggest that the TGF-β/SMAD 3 signaling pathway contributes to S1PR3 up-regulation in lung adenocarcinomas. Moreover, our study suggests that S1PR3 represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human lung cancers. Previously, we showed that levels of S1PR3 are significantly increased in a panel of cultured human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines when compared with normal lung epithelial cells (16.Hsu A. Zhang W. Lee J.F. An J. Ekambaram P. Liu J. Honn K.V. Klinge C.M. Lee M.J.

J. Oncol. 2012; 40: 1619-1626PubMed Google Scholar). The pathological relevance of this in vitro observation was investigated by measuring mRNA levels of S1PR3 in cDNA microarrays of human lung adenocarcinoma specimens (OriGene, HLRT). Quantitative PCR analysis showed that mRNA levels of S1PR3 are significantly increased in human lung adenocarcinoma specimens when compared with normal lung tissues (Fig. 1A). We previously showed that S1PR2 levels are increased in endothelial senescence and inflammation (10.Estrada R. Zeng Q. Lu H. Sarojini H. Lee J.F. Mathis S.P. Sanchez T. Wang E. Kontos C.D. Lin C.Y.

However, we observed that levels of S1PR2 are decreased in human lung cancers (Fig. 1B). Next, we utilized immunohistochemical staining to examine protein levels of S1PR3 in a paraffin-embedded tumor microarray of human lung adenocarcinoma specimens (Accumax). Anit-S1PR3 (Cayman) immunoreacted with plasma membrane-localized S1PR3 in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with S1PR3 vector. No immunoreactivity was observed in HEK293 transfected with pcDNA control vector (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical staining analysis showed that the intensity of anti-S1PR3 immunostaining is significantly increased in human lung adenocarcinomas when compared with their respective adjacent normal lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1, D–F). Moreover, levels of S1PR3 are increased in human lung squamous carcinoma specimens (Fig. 1, G and H). Oncogenic K-Ras mutation is found in more than 25% of non-small cell lung carcinomas and represents one of the most prevalent oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung carcinomas (30.Sholl L.M.

We utilized a conditionally inducible knock-in K-RasG12D (Lox-Stop-Lox-K-RasG12D, LSL-K-RasG12D) mouse model (32.Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T.

As shown in Fig. 2A, lung tumors were readily observed in heterozygous LSL-K-RasG12D mice following intratracheal injection of adenoviral particles carrying Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre). S1PR3 levels were increased ∼20-fold in lungs of K-RasG12D-expressing mice when compared with that in mice treated with empty adenoviral particles (Ad-Ctrl) (Fig. 2B). A minimal increase of S1PR4 was observed in lungs of K-RasG12D-expressing mice. There were no significant changes of S1PR1 and S1PR2, and S1PR5 was not detected in lungs of Ad-Cre-injected mice (Fig. 2B). In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that protein levels of S1PR3 were markedly increased in lung carcinoma specimens of K-RasG12D transgenic mice (Fig. 2C) when compared with normal lung tissues of wild-type mice. In a control, no staining was detected in lung adenocarcinoma specimens of K-RasG12D transgenic mice when immunohistochemical staining was performed without S1PR3 antibody (data not shown). These data suggest that S1PR3 levels are increased in lung adenocarcinomas. Promoter analysis suggested that the promoter region of S1PR3 contains 16 potential binding elements for the SMAD3 molecule (Fig. 3A, Table 1), a critical signal transducer downstream of TGF-β/TGF-β receptor signaling. Also, it was shown that K-Ras mutant up-regulated TGF-β, which is required for tumor angiogenesis (34.Rak J. Filmus J. Finkenzeller G. Grugel S. Marmé D. Kerbel R.S. Oncogenes as inducers of tumor angiogenesis.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling contributes to oncogenic K-Ras mutant-stimulated S1PR3 up-regulation. Ectopic expression of oncogenic K-RasG12V mutant significantly increased S1PR3 (Fig. 3, B and C). Expression of K-RasG12V did not alter levels of other S1P receptor subtypes. In agreement with a previous study (34.Rak J. Filmus J. Finkenzeller G. Grugel S. Marmé D. Kerbel R.S. Oncogenes as inducers of tumor angiogenesis.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), levels of TGF-β were increased in K-RasG12V-expressing cells (Fig. 3D). Treatments with TGF-β antibody (Fig. 3E) and inhibition of TGF-β receptor I and SMAD3 using compound SB-431542 and SIS3 (Fig. 3F), respectively, abrogated the S1PR3 up-regulation in K-RasG12V-expressing cells.TABLE 1Candidate SMAD3 binding elements (SBEs) on the promoter region of S1PR3 geneSBESequencePositionPrimer namePrimer sequence1GCCAGA(−2344) to (−2399)SBE1 FCCAGGTTGAGCCAGTATTAGSBE1 RCAGGCGAACGGGTGCTAAT2TACAGA(−2200) to (−2195)SBE2 FGACACCCACTAGTGCACACSBE2 RGAATGCCAGCTCATAAACG3TGCAGA(−2113) to (−2108)SBE3/4 FCGTTTATGAGCTGGCATTCSBE3/4 RCCATCTTCTCTCACCACTCC4AACAGA(−2092) to (−2087)SBE3/4 FCGTTTATGAGCTGGCATTCSBE3/4 RCCATCTTCTCTCACCACTCC5GTCAGA(−2011) to (−2006)SBE5/6 FGGAGTGGTGAGAGAAGATGSBE5/6 RTCCCCACACACGGGCCTCT6AGCAGA(−1969) to (−1964)SBE5/6 FGGAGTGGTGAGAGAAGATGSBE5/6 RTCCCCACACACGGGCCTCT7TCAGA(−1849) to (−1845)SBE7 FCCCACTGAGGACAGGGATCSBE7 RGCCCAGAAGCCCTGAGGAG8CAGACT(−1765) to (−1760)SBE8 FGCCATAAAGCATGAGAGCCSBE8 RGAGAAAGTCAGTTACCCTG9ACAGA(−1610) to (−1606)SBE9 FCAACCCTCAGCCAGTATCCSBE9 RGCATACTGTGGCCACTGTGTC10ACAGA(−1433) to (−1429)SBE10/11 FGTAGGAGTCCAACAAAGGGSBE10/11 RCACTTCGCCTGTGCTACTGTG11CAGA(−1418) to (−1415)SBE10/11 FGTAGGAGTCCAACAAAGGGSBE10/11 RCACTTCGCCTGTGCTACTGTG12CCAGA(−1299) to (−1295)SBE12/13 FCACAGTAGCACAGGCGAAGSBE12/13 RGCCCTCAGCAATTGAGCTG13CAGA(−1267) to (−1264)SBE12/13 FCACAGTAGCACAGGCGAAGSBE12/13 RGCCCTCAGCAATTGAGCTG14AGACAGA(−1084) to (−1078)SBE14 FGCACCCTGCTCCAAGAGAAGSBE14 RGGCCGGCAGGATTGGGCCGC15CAGA(−644) to (−641)SBE15 FCTGGCTGCCGGTCTAGGAGGSBE15 RCCAGGCACGCAGAGACTTGG16CCAGAC(−350) to (−345)SBE16 FGAATCGGCCCAAACAAACCCSBE16 RGAGCTCCAGGTGCAGAAAC Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated whether TGF-β treatment stimulates S1PR3 expression in lung epithelial cells. HBEC2-KT cells, an immortalized normal human lung epithelial cell line (16.Hsu A. Zhang W. Lee J.F. An J. Ekambaram P. Liu J. Honn K.V. Klinge C.M. Lee M.J. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-3 signaling up-regulates epidermal growth factor receptor and enhances epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated carcinogenic activities in cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells.Int. J. Oncol. 2012; 40: 1619-1626PubMed Google Scholar), were treated with TGF-β for various times. Quantitative analysis of the expression of S1P receptor subtypes by qPCR analysis showed that TGF-β treatment increased mRNA levels of S1PR3 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). TGF-β treatment did not affect levels of other subtypes of S1PRs such as S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR4. S1PR5 was not detected in HBEC2-KT cells. Also, TGF-β treatment increased protein levels of S1PR3 in HBEC2-KT cells (Fig. 4B). Validation of the specificity of anti-S1PR3 for Western blotting analysis showed that anti-S1PR3 specifically immunoreacts with S1PR3 (Fig. 4C). Moreover, transduction with adenoviral particles carrying an active form of the TGF-β vector (35.Gauldie J. Kolb M. Animal models of pulmonary fibrosis: how far from effective reality?.Am. J.

Furthermore, TGF-β treatment time-dependently increased levels of SphK1 (Fig. 4E) and S1P production (Fig. 4F) in HBEC2-KT normal lung epithelial cells. TGF-β treatment did not alter levels of SphK2 in HBEC2-KT cells. Next, we used selective pharmacological inhibitor to investigate the role of SMAD3 in TGF-β-stimulated S1PR3 up-regulation. Inhibition of TGF-β receptor I and SMAD3 using compound SB-431542 and SIS3, respectively, abrogated the TGF-β-stimulated S1PR3 up-regulation (Fig. 4G). In contrast, inhibition of other signaling molecules downstream of TGF-β signaling (e.g. NFκB, JNK, and p38 kinase) did not significantly diminish the TGF-β-stimulated S1PR3 up-regulation. In a parallel control experiment, treatment with inhibitor effectively diminished the activation of their respective target following TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 4H). These data suggest that the TGF-β receptor I/Samd3 signaling pathway contributes to the TGF-β-stimulated S1PR3 expression in lung epithelial cells. Treatment of HBEC2-KT cells with TGF-β markedly stimulated the nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated SMAD3 (Fig. 5A, arrows), indicating that TGF-β treatment activates SMAD3 in HBEC2-KT lung epithelial cells. Subsequently, we designed 16 pairs of primers (Table 1) that amplify these candidate SMAD3 binding elements in the promoter region of S1PR3. ChIP assay showed that TGF-β treatment significantly increased the binding of phospho-SMAD3 to P13, P14, and P15 sites in the promoter region of S1PR3 (Fig. 5B). No specific binding was observed when ChIP assays were performed using irrelevant normal IgG as a control, suggesting that bindings of phospho-SMAD3 are specific. Next, we used a luciferase reporter assay to examine whether SMAD3 transactivates those candidate SMAD3 binding sites present in the S1PR3 promoter region. As shown in Fig. 5C, SMAD3 activates PGL3-promoter luciferase vector carrying P14, whereas SMAD3 did not activate PGL3-promoter luciferase vector carrying P13 and P15. The luciferase reporter assay is specific, because SMAD3 was unable to activate scrambled P14 (Fig. 5D). We previously showed that S1PR3 activation promotes proliferation, soft agar growth, and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro (11.Zhang W. Zhao J. Lee J.F. Gartung A. Jawadi H.

Expression of sh-S1PR3 effectively knocked down ∼67% of S1PR3 in H1793 cells (Fig. 6A). Moreover, S1PR3 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model (Fig. 6, B and C). Similarly, S1PR3 knockdown diminished lung colonization of H1793 cells, which were injected via the tail vein route (Fig. 6, D and E).

https://openalex.org/W2553931639,"Activating transcription factor (ATF)3 regulates the expression of inflammation-related genes in several tissues under pathological contexts. In skeletal muscle, atf3 expression increases after exercise, but its target genes remain unknown. We aimed to identify those genes and to determine the influence of ATF3 on muscle adaptation to training. Skeletal muscles of ATF3-knockout (ATF3-KO) and control mice were analyzed at rest, after exercise, and after training. In resting muscles, there was no difference between genotypes in enzymatic activities or fiber type. After exercise, a microarray analysis in quadriceps revealed ATF3 affects genes modulating chemotaxis and chemokine/cytokine activity. Quantitative PCR showed that the mRNA levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand (ccl) 8 and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand (cxcl) 13 were higher in quadriceps of ATF3-KO mice than in control mice. The same was observed for ccl9 and cxcl13 in soleus. Also in soleus, ccl2, interleukin (il)6, il1b, and clusterofdifferentiation (cd) 68 mRNA levels increased after exercise only in ATF3-KO mice. Endurance training increased the basal mRNA level of hexokinase-2, hormone sensitive lipase, glutathione peroxidase-1, and myosin heavy chain IIa in quadriceps of control mice but not in ATF3-KO mice. In summary, ATF3 attenuates the expression of inflammation-related genes after exercise and thus facilitates molecular adaptation to training.—Fernàndez-Verdejo, R., Vanwynsberghe, A.

https://openalex.org/W2550610191,"Central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDDs) are a group of disorders with different aetiologies, characterized by inflammatory lesions. These disorders include multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and idiopathic transverse myelitis (ITM). Differential diagnosis of the CNS IDDs still remains challenging due to frequent overlap of clinical and radiological manifestation, leading to increased demands for new biomarker discovery. Since cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites may reflect the status of CNS tissues and provide an interfacial linkage between blood and CNS tissues, we explored multi-component biomarker for different IDDs from CSF samples using gas chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling coupled to multiplex bioinformatics approach. We successfully constructed the single model with multiple metabolite variables in coordinated regression with clinical characteristics, expanded disability status scale, oligoclonal bands, and protein levels. The multi-composite biomarker simultaneously discriminated four different immune statuses (a total of 145 samples; 54 MS, 49 NMOSD, 30 ITM, and 12 normal controls). Furthermore, systematic characterization of transitional metabolic modulation identified relapse-associated metabolites and proposed insights into the disease network underlying type-specific metabolic dysfunctionality. The comparative analysis revealed the lipids, 1-monopalmitin and 1-monostearin were common indicative for MS, NMOSD, and ITM whereas fatty acids were specific for the relapse identified in all types of IDDs."
https://openalex.org/W2557027943,"The severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging, highly pathogenic bunyavirus against which neither antivirals nor vaccines are available. The SFTSV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, facilitate viral entry into host cells. Gn and Gc are generated from a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, but it is currently unknown how the precursor is converted into the single proteins and whether this process is required for viral infectivity. Employing a rhabdoviral pseudotyping system, we demonstrate that a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc is required for Gn/Gc processing and viral infectivity while potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites in Gc are dispensable. Moreover, we show that expression of Gn or Gc alone is not sufficient for host cell entry while particles bearing both proteins are infectious, and we provide evidence that Gn facilitates Golgi transport and virion incorporation of Gc. Collectively, these results suggest that signal peptidase liberates mature Gc from the Gn/Gc precursor and that this process is essential for viral infectivity and thus constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention."

The objective of this study was to identify differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing ipt compared to non-transgenic plants. The ipt transgene was controlled by a senescence-activated promoter (SAG12). Both a null transformed line (NT) and SAG12-ipt plants were exposed to drought stress in an environmentally-controlled growth chamber until the soil water content declined to approximately 5% and leaf relative water content declined to 47%, which were both significantly below the well-watered controls. RNA was extracted from leaf samples of both well-watered and drought-stressed plants. Eight sets of subtractive hybridizations were performed for detection of up-regulated and down-regulated genes due to the presence of the transgene and due to drought stress in both NT and transgenic plants. Sequencing analysis revealed the identity of 252 DEGs due to either the transgene and drought stress. Sequencing analysis of 170 DEGs identified genes encoding for proteins that were related to energy production, metabolism, stress defense, signaling, protein synthesis and transport, and membrane transport could play major roles in the improved drought tolerance by overexpressing ipt in creeping bentgrass."
https://openalex.org/W2555994068,"Bottom trawling is one of the most efficient fishing activities, but serious and persistent ecological issues have been observed by fishers, scientists and fishery managers. Although China has applied the Beidou fishing vessel position monitoring system (VMS) to manage trawlers since 2006, little is known regarding the impacts of trawling on the sea bottom environments. In this study, continuous VMS data of the 1403 single-rig otter trawlers registered in the Xiangshan Port, 3.9% of the total trawlers in China, were used to map the trawling effort in 2013. We used the accumulated distance (AD), accumulated power distance (APD), and trawling intensity as indexes to express the trawling efforts in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS). Our results show that all three indexes had similar patterns in the YS and ECS, and indicated a higher fishing effort of fishing grounds that were near the port. On average, the seabed was trawled 0.73 times in 2013 over the entire fishing region, and 51.38% of the total fishing grounds were with no fishing activities. Because of VMS data from only a small proportion of Chinese trawlers was calculated fishing intensity, more VMS data is required to illustrate the overall trawling effort in China seas. Our results enable fishery managers to identify the distribution of bottom trawling activities in the YS and ECS, and hence to make effective fishery policy."
https://openalex.org/W2554715290,"Few studies have examined particulate matter (PM) exposure from self-reported use of wood stoves and other indoor combustion sources in urban settings in developed countries. We measured concentrations of indoor PM < 2.5 microns (PM2.5) for one week with the MicroPEM™ nephelometer in 36 households in the greater Oslo, Norway metropolitan area. We examined indoor PM2.5 levels in relation to use of wood stoves and other combustion sources during a 7 day monitoring period using mixed effects linear models with adjustment for ambient PM2.5 levels. Mean hourly indoor PM2.5 concentrations were higher (p = 0.04) for the 14 homes with wood stove use (15.6 μg/m3) than for the 22 homes without (12.6 μg/m3). Moreover, mean hourly PM2.5 was higher (p = 0.001) for use of wood stoves made before 1997 (6 homes, 20.2 μg/m3), when wood stove emission limits were instituted in Norway, compared to newer wood stoves (8 homes, 11.9 μg/m3) which had mean hourly values similar to control homes. Increased PM2.5 levels during diary-reported burning of candles was detected independently of concomitant wood stove use. These results suggest that self-reported use of wood stoves, particularly older stoves, and other combustion sources, such as candles, are associated with indoor PM2.5 measurements in an urban population from a high income country."
https://openalex.org/W2550066059,"Despite the central role of soil microbial communities in global carbon (C) cycling, little is known about soil microbial community structure and even less about their metabolic pathways. Efforts to characterize soil communities often focus on identifying differences in gene content across environmental gradients, but an alternative question is what genes are similar in soils. These genes may indicate critical species or potential functions that are required in all soils. Here we identified the “core” set of C cycling sequences widely present in multiple soil metagenomes from a fertilized prairie (FP). Of 226,887 sequences associated with known enzymes involved in the synthesis, metabolism, and transport of carbohydrates, 843 were identified to be consistently prevalent across four replicate soil metagenomes. This core metagenome was functionally and taxonomically diverse, representing five enzyme classes and 99 enzyme families within the CAZy database. Though it only comprised 0.4% of all CAZy-associated genes identified in FP metagenomes, the core was found to be comprised of functions similar to those within cumulative soils. The FP CAZy-associated core sequences were present in multiple publicly available soil metagenomes and most similar to soils sharing geographic proximity. In soil ecosystems, where high diversity remains a key challenge for metagenomic investigations, these core genes represent a subset of critical functions necessary for carbohydrate metabolism, which can be targeted to evaluate important C fluxes in these and other similar soils."
https://openalex.org/W2553096677,"Tobacco smoking is a public health problem, with ∼5 million deaths per year, representing a heavy burden for many countries. No effective therapeutic strategies are currently available for nicotine addiction, and it is therefore crucial to understand the etiological and pathophysiological factors contributing to this addiction. The neuronal α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit is critically involved in nicotine dependence. In particular, the human polymorphism α5D398N corresponds to the strongest correlation with nicotine dependence risk found to date in occidental populations, according to meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. To understand the specific contribution of this subunit in the context of nicotine addiction, an efficient screening system for native human nAChRs is needed. We have differentiated human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells into midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons and obtained a comprehensive characterization of these neurons by quantitative RT-PCR. The functional properties of nAChRs expressed in these human DA neurons, with or without the polymorphism in the α5 subunit, were studied with the patch-clamp electrophysiological technique. Our results in human DA neurons carrying the polymorphism in the α5 subunit showed an increase in EC50, indicating that, in the presence of the polymorphism, more nicotine or acetylcholine chloride is necessary to obtain the same effect. This human cell culturing system can now be used in drug discovery approaches to screen for compounds that interact specifically with human native and polymorphic nAChRs.-Deflorio, C., Blanchard, S., Carisì, M.

Based on our AF radiofrequency ablation clinical practice and previous miRNA study, we proposed a hypothesis that the coronary circulating miRNA might much better reflect the regulating state and metabolic level of myocardial miRNA in AF patient. To investigate the regulating values of coronary circulation miRNA, 90 AF patients were selected and compared with 90 healthy subjects, the changes of coronary circulating miRNA differential expression profile in the whole genome were observed in this study. We found out that compared with autologous peripheral blood (PB), 6 miRNAs were upregulated and 8 miRNA downregulated in AF patients’ coronary sinus blood (CSB) significantly, especially, the expression of miR-1266, miR-4279 and miR-4666a-3p were obviously increased. Compared with normal donors’ peripheral blood, 16 miRNAs were upregulated and 24 miRNAs downregulated dramatically in patients’ peripheral blood, among them, the miR-3171 decreased, but miR-892a and miR-3149 increased significantly from the early to end stages of AF. Our results indicated that the coronary circulating miRNA can really reflect the regulating values of miRNA in AF patient; the level of miRNA change in 3 types of AF may reflect the severity of AF clinical and pathophysiological advance; The miR-892a, miR-3171 and miR-3149 may be used as biomarkers for earlier diagnosis, while miR-1266, miR-4279 and miR-4666a-3p may serve as potential intervening targets for AF patient in future."
https://openalex.org/W2557025912,"Osteoprotegerin, a potent osteoclast activation inhibitor, decreases bone resorption and positively affects bone mineral density. This study examined the association between serum osteoprotegerin levels and bone loss in patients with chronic kidney disease, a condition associated with increased risk of mineral and bone disorders. The bone mineral densities of the lumbar spine, total hip, and femur neck were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; serum osteoprotegerin levels were measured at baseline for 1,423 patients enrolled in the prospective KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD). Patients aged ≥50 years and with a T-score ≤ –2.5 were diagnosed as having osteoporosis. Multivariable linear regression analysis indicated independent association between serum osteoprotegerin levels and decreased bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (B: –0.489, 95% confidence interval [CI]: –0.883 to –0.095, P = 0.015), and total hip (B: –0.349, 95% CI: –0.672 to –0.027, P = 0.027). However, bone mineral density of the femur neck was not associated with serum osteoprotegerin levels in women. After adjustments, no independent association was found between serum osteoprotegerin levels and bone mineral density in men. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, serum osteoprotegerin levels were associated with increased risk of osteoporosis in women (odds ratio [OR]: 4.72, 95% CI: 1.35 to 16.52, P = 0.015), but not in men (OR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.04 to 1.31, P = 0.095). To summarize, in female patients with chronic kidney disease, increased serum osteoprotegerin levels were independently associated with decreased bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and total hip, and with increased risk of osteoporosis. Therefore, the measurement of serum osteoprotegerin concentration might be useful as a surrogate marker for determining bone loss in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially for women, although not so much for men."
https://openalex.org/W2557037579,"This study aimed to investigate the incidence, predictors, and clinical outcomes of cardiac tamponade after heart valve surgery. A total of 556 patients who underwent heart valve surgery in a single tertiary center between January 2010 and March 2012 were studied. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) about 5 days after surgery and TTE was repeated regularly. Patients with suspected acute pericardial hemorrhage were excluded. Cardiac tamponade occurred in twenty-four (4.3%) patients and all underwent surgical or percutaneous pericardial drainage. The median time of pericardial drainage after surgery was 17 (interquartile range, IQR, 13–30) days. Infective endocarditis, mechanical valve replacement of aortic or mitral valve, and any amount of pericardial effusion (PE) on the first postoperative TTE were related to the occurrence of cardiac tamponade (all p<0.05). After multivariate adjustment, occurrence of cardiac tamponade was associated with any amount of PE on the first postoperative TTE (hazard ratio, HR, 14.00, p<0.001) and mechanical valve replacement (HR 2.69, p = 0.025). The mean hospital days in patients with cardiac tamponade was higher than those without (34.9 vs. 13.5, p = 0.031). After pericardial drainage, there was no echocardiographic recurrence of significant PE during a median of 34.8 (IQR 14.9–43.7) months after surgery. Cardiac tamponade after heart valve surgery is not uncommon. Patients with any amount of PE at the first postoperative TTE or mechanical valve replacement should receive higher attention with regard to the occurrence of cardiac tamponade. Although it prolongs hospital stay, cardiac tamponade exhibits a benign clinical course without recurrence after timely intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2555170283,"Epithelia separate apical and basal compartments, and movement of substances via the paracellular pathway is regulated by tight junctions. Claudins are major constituents of tight junctions and involved in the regulation of tight junction permeability. On the other hand, the osmolality in the extracellular environment fluctuates in association with life activity. However, effects of osmotic changes on the permeaibility of claudins are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effects of osmotic changes on the paracellular transport in MDCK II cells. Interestingly, apical hyposmolality decreased cation selectivity in the paracellular pathway gradually with time, and the elimination of the osmotic gradient promptly restored the cation selectivity. Apical hyposmolality also induced bleb formation at cell-cell contacts and changed the shape of cell-cell contacts from a jagged pattern to a slightly linear pattern. In claudin-2 knockout MDCK II cells, the decrease of cation selectivity, the bleb formation, nor the changes in the shape of cell-cell contacts was observed under the apical hyposmolality. Our findings in this study indicate that osmotic gradient between apical and basal sides is involved in the acute regulation of the cation selective property of claudin-2 channels."

Although NAEs have signaling and physiological roles in animals, little is known about their metabolic fate in plants. Our previous microarray analyses showed that inhibition of Arabidopsis thaliana seedling growth by exogenous N-lauroylethanolamine (NAE 12:0) was accompanied by the differential expression of multiple genes encoding small molecule-modifying enzymes. We focused on the gene At5g39050, which encodes a phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase 1 (PMAT1), to better understand the biological significance of NAE 12:0-induced gene expression changes. PMAT1 expression was induced 3–5-fold by exogenous NAE 12:0.

Their basic structure consists of an ethanolamine head linked to a fatty acid tail via an amide bond (1.Schmid H.H. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V.

In vertebrates, NAEs are best known for their role in the endocannabinoid signaling pathway where they function as endogenous ligands to G protein-coupled cannabinoid (CB) receptors. Binding of NAEs to CB receptors triggers a series of signaling cascades that modulate a plethora of behavioral and physiological processes such as appetite, mood, cardiovascular function, pain sensation, sleep, and reproduction (3.Pagotto U.

NAEs in organisms where they have been detected consist of several molecular species, which are classified based on the number of carbons and double bonds in their fatty acid chain. For example, one of the most studied NAE species in animal systems with CB receptor-dependent functions is N-arachidonoylethanolamine or anandamide. Anandamide is also known as NAE 20:4 because it has 20 carbons and 4 double bonds in its fatty acyl chain (6.Kim S.C. Chapman K.D. Blancaflor E.B.

Although the presence of NAEs in plants has been recognized for many years, their role in plant physiological processes is limited (2.Chapman K.D.

The first evidence that NAEs might have biological functions in plants came from studies of endogenous NAE levels in desiccated cotton seeds. The endogenous levels of NAEs were shown to be highest in seeds, but they were rapidly depleted during seed imbibition. This observation led to the hypothesis that NAEs might be involved in germination and early seedling establishment possibly as negative growth regulators (6.Kim S.C. Chapman K.D. Blancaflor E.B. Fatty acid amide lipid mediators in plants.Plant Sci. 2010; 178: 411-419Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8.Kilaru A. Blancaflor E.B. Venables B.J. Tripathy S. Mysore K.S. Chapman K.D. The N-acylethanolamine-mediated regulatory pathway in plants.Chem. Biodivers. 2007; 4: 1933-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In support of this notion was the observation that Arabidopsis seeds germinated on exogenous N-lauroylethanolamine (NAE 12:0) led to stunted seedling development due in part to an altered cytoskeleton and endomembrane system (9.Blancaflor E.B.

Furthermore, young Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to N-linoleoylethanolamide (NAE 18:2) and N-linolenoylethanolamine (NAE 18:3) had disrupted root and chloroplast development, respectively, suggesting that NAEs collectively blocked crucial processes that are part of the transition from germinative to post-germinative seedling growth (11.Keereetaweep J.

One mechanism by which the signaling and/or biological activities of NAE are modulated is through the action of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme. FAAH hydrolyzes NAE at its amide linkage to yield an ethanolamine group and its corresponding free fatty acid (15.Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B.

Structure and function of fatty acid amide hydrolase.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The critical role of FAAH in regulating NAE signaling in mammals was demonstrated through a series of studies with mouse FAAH knock-out mutants. Mouse mutants with the FAAH gene inactivated resulted in the accumulation of endogenous NAEs in the central nervous system, which subsequently led to a decrease in sensitivity to pain and increased sensitivity to anandamide (17.Cravatt B.F.

The response of plants to NAE has also been shown to change when the expression level of a plant's FAAH orthologue is modified. For example, knockouts to Arabidopsis FAAH (faah) were more sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of NAE 12:0, whereas FAAH overexpressors were less sensitive to NAE 12:0-induced growth arrest (19.Wang Y.S.

The observation that FAAH-altered plants had modified endogenous NAEs (i.e. faah had higher NAEs whereas FAAH overexpressors had lower NAEs) is consistent with FAAH's function as an important enzyme involved in plant NAE hydrolysis in vivo (19.Wang Y.S.

Recently, the formation of bioactive NAE oxylipin metabolites from NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 in plants that disrupt root and chloroplast development was shown to be catalyzed by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes (11.Keereetaweep J.

Lipoxygenase derived 9-hydro(pero)xides of linoleoylethanolamide interact with ABA signaling to arrest root development during Arabidopsis seedling establishment.Plant J. 2015; 82: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The LOX-mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated NAEs in plants is reminiscent of the eicosanoids, a class of mammalian hormones that are oxidation products of cyclooxygenase and LOX enzymes (21.Dennis E.A. Norris P.C. Eicosanoid storm in infection and inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Information on other enzymes that regulate NAE levels in plants has remained elusive. To discover new players involved in regulating the metabolic fate of NAE in plants, we revisited our previous transcriptomic data of seedlings treated with NAE 12:0. In addition to ABA-related transcripts, genes encoding enzymes that modify low molecular mass compounds were up-regulated in seedlings exposed to NAE 12:0 (13.Teaster N.D. Motes C.M. Tang Y. Wiant W.C. Cotter M.Q. Wang Y.S. Kilaru A. Venables B.J. Hasenstein K.H. Gonzalez G. Blancaflor E.B. Chapman K.D.

Modification of bioactive small molecules is a typical way of removing or inactivating potentially damaging compounds so the plant can protect itself (22.Sandermann Jr., H. Schmitt R. Eckey H.

Malonylation is a key reaction in the metabolism of xenobiotic phenolic glucosides in Arabidopsis and tobacco.Plant J. 2010; 63: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Alternatively, small molecule modification could be a mechanism by which its signaling activity is regulated. Evidence for the latter comes from studies of the hormones, auxin and jasmonic acid. Both auxin and jasmonic acid are conjugated into biologically inactive forms by specific enzymes to dampen their activity within the cell (26.Ludwig-Müller J. Auxin conjugates: their role for plant development and in the evolution of land plants.J. Exp. Bot. 2011; 62: 1757-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 27.Santino A. Taurino M.

Jasmonates signaling in plant development and defense response to multiple (a)biotic stresses.Plant Cell Rep. 2013; 32: 1085-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Conjugation of bioactive small molecules not only leads to their inactivation but also to their preferential transport to cellular compartments or to the extracellular matrix where they are spatially separated from their biological targets (28.Staswick P. Plant hormone conjugation.Plant Signal. Behav. 2009; 4: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is possible that some of the genes encoding small molecule-modifying enzymes up-regulated by NAE 12:0 could function as NAE-modifying enzymes. Here, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase 1 (PMAT1), which was previously shown to have malonyltransferase activity to a range of phenolic glucosides (25.Taguchi G. Ubukata T. Nozue H. Kobayashi Y. Takahi M. Yamamoto H. Hayashida N. Malonylation is a key reaction in the metabolism of xenobiotic phenolic glucosides in Arabidopsis and tobacco.Plant J. 2010; 63: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), has a similar effect on NAE 12:0 glucosides. PMAT1 catalyzes the reaction converting glucosylated NAE 12:0 to NAE 12:0 malonylglucosides. We propose that the formation of an NAE glucoside and its subsequent malonylation by PMAT1 likely represents a pathway for the storage and/or metabolic inactivation of NAE in plants. A previously conducted microarray-based gene expression analysis on wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings treated with NAE 12:0 revealed the up-regulation of a number of genes encoding small molecule-modifying enzymes. Here, we focused on characterizing a gene (At5g39050) encoding PMAT1, which was shown by microarray data to be up-regulated 3-fold by NAE 12:0 treatment (13.Teaster N.D. Motes C.M. Tang Y. Wiant W.C.

N-Acylethanolamine metabolism interacts with abscisic acid signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2454-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that PMAT1 gene expression was enhanced by about 5-fold in seedlings treated with NAE 12:0 validating the results obtained with microarrays (Fig. 1A). Exogenous NAE 12:0 inhibits the growth of Arabidopsis seedlings (9.Blancaflor E.B. Hou G. Chapman K.D.

As such, NAE 12:0-induced seedling growth inhibition has served as a convenient biological readout for evaluating pathways involved in NAE metabolism in plants using gene knockouts and overexpressors (13.Teaster N.D.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12197-12202Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Following similar genetic strategies, we tested whether altered PMAT1 expression had any effect on seedling growth when exposed to exogenous NAE 12:0. We obtained mutants to PMAT1 from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center. The Arabidopsis PMAT1 gene consists of a single exon, and we identified two mutant alleles (SALK_110268 and SALK_007564) with transfer (T)-DNA insertions within the exon. We refer to these mutants as pmat1-1 and pmat1-2 following the nomenclature of Taguchi et al. (25.Taguchi G. Ubukata T. Nozue H. Kobayashi Y. Takahi M. Yamamoto H. Hayashida N. Malonylation is a key reaction in the metabolism of xenobiotic phenolic glucosides in Arabidopsis and tobacco.Plant J. 2010; 63: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B; supplemental Fig. S1). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that pmat1-1 and pmat1-2 were null mutants as no transcripts were detected using PMAT1 gene-specific primers (Fig. 1C). Wild-type, pmat1-1, and pmat1-2 seedlings on liquid medium under a 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle exhibited robust growth after 10 days (Fig. 2A). When 40 μm NAE 12:0 was included in the medium, growth of all three genotypes was strongly inhibited. We observed, however, that the extent of NAE 12:0-induced growth inhibition was less in the two pmat1 mutant alleles when compared with wild type. Whereas pmat1 mutants had green cotyledons on 40 μm NAE 12:0, those of wild-type seedlings were smaller and produced no or very little chlorophyll (Fig. 2, B and C). Growth of wild-type and pmat1 seedlings was quantified by measuring primary root length and cotyledon area in semi-solid medium with or without 40 μm NAE 12:0. In solid medium without NAE 12:0, primary root length and cotyledon area of wild-type and pmat1 seedlings were not different from each other. By contrast, values for primary root length and cotyledon area of pmat1 seedlings on 40 μm NAE 12:0 were significantly higher compared with wild-type seedlings (Fig. 2, D and E). The ability of pmat1 to tolerate growth on exogenous NAE 12:0 could not be overcome by simply increasing the concentration of NAE 12:0 in the media. Cotyledons of light-grown pmat1 seedlings exposed to NAE 12:0 concentrations as high as 250 μm remained larger and greener compared with wild type (supplemental Fig. S2). The extent of growth inhibition triggered by NAE 12:0 was more pronounced when seedlings were kept in total darkness. Compared with seedlings subjected to a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle, hypocotyls of seedlings kept in the dark elongate rapidly and produce no chlorophyll in their cotyledons (Fig. 2F). In the presence of exogenous NAE 12:0 and at concentrations much lower than those needed to inhibit seedling growth in the light, hypocotyl elongation of dark-grown wild-type seedlings was severely stunted. By contrast, dark-grown pmat1 seedlings on NAE 12:0 had significantly longer hypocotyls and cotyledons that expanded more compared with wild-type seedlings (Fig. 2, F and E). Taken together, our results indicate that loss of PMAT1 function rendered seedlings less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of NAE 12:0. To confirm that loss of PMAT1 function is the cause for the increased tolerance of pmat1 seedlings to the growth-inhibitory effects of NAE 12:0, we expressed a 35S:PMAT1 construct in the pmat1-1 and pmat1-2 background. Expression of 35S:PMAT1 was verified by qRT-PCR analysis. Consistent with our semi-quantitative RT-PCR results (Fig. 1C), both pmat1 mutant alleles had no detectable PMAT1 transcripts. By contrast, PMAT1 transcripts were detected in two independent lines for each pmat1 mutant allele transformed with the 35S:PMAT1 construct (Fig. 3A). When pmat1-complemented seedlings were grown on exogenous NAE 12:0 in light or in darkness, they exhibited similar growth responses as wild-type seedlings (Fig. 3, B and C) indicating that loss of PMAT1 function is indeed responsible for the reduced growth sensitivity of seedlings to exogenous NAE 12:0. We also transformed wild type with the 35S:PMAT1 construct to determine whether PMAT1 overexpression had any effect on seedling growth with or without NAE 12:0. We selected two independent overexpressing lines that were determined by qRT-PCR to have PMAT1 expression at levels 10–15-fold more than wild type (Fig. 3A). The response of the PMAT1 overexpressors on NAE 12:0-supplemented media and their growth on media without NAE 12:0 were similar to wild type (Fig. 3, B and D). To better understand the biochemical basis for the enhanced tolerance of pmat1 to exogenous NAE 12:0, global metabolite profiles were obtained from NAE 12:0-treated and non-treated (DMSO control) wild-type seedlings using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS. We focused our analyses on three major metabolites that were strongly induced in NAE 12:0-treated seedlings but absent in non-treated seedlings (Fig. 4A). The first metabolite (P1) had a retention time of 17.25 min and three major ions, m/z 428.265 [M + Na]+, m/z 406.280 [M + H]+, and m/z 244.225 [M + H − 162]+, corresponding to the loss of a hexose. The second metabolite (P2) had a retention time of 17.87 min and three major ions, m/z 514.259 [M + Na]+, 492.277 [M + H]+, and m/z 244.223 [M + H − 248]+, which corresponds to the loss of a malonyl hexose moiety. The third metabolite (P3) had a retention time of 18.56 min and three major ions, m/z 600.260 [M + Na]+, m/z of 578.279 [M + H]+, and m/z 244.223 [M + H −334]+, which corresponds to a loss of a dimalonyl hexose moiety. UHPLC-PDA-MS analyses indicated that these three unknown metabolites could represent glucose and malonyl conjugation products of NAE 12:0 (Fig. 4B; supplemental Table S1). The three unknown metabolites that accumulated in NAE 12:0-treated samples were purified using a Waters UHPLC coupled to a Bruker QTOF-MS and automated solid phase extraction (SPE). The purified analytes were then used for structural determination by NMR. NMR spectra indicated that the P1 metabolite was glucose-conjugated to NAE 12:0 at the hydroxyl position of the ethanolamine head through a glycosidic linkage. For the P2 metabolite, malonic acid was determined to be conjugated at the carbon 6 (C6) position of the glucose-NAE 12:0 molecule. The P3 metabolite had malonic acid conjugated to C6 and C3 of the glucose-NAE 12:0 molecule (Fig. 4C). Taken together, NMR spectra confirm that the exogenous NAE 12:0 is converted by seedlings into an NAE 12:0 glucoside and then malonylated at two separate positions on the glucose molecule (supplemental Figs. S3–S9). As noted, PMAT1 was previously shown to exhibit malonyltransferase activity to a range of phenolic glucosides (25.Taguchi G. Ubukata T. Nozue H. Kobayashi Y. Takahi M. Yamamoto H. Hayashida N. Malonylation is a key reaction in the metabolism of xenobiotic phenolic glucosides in Arabidopsis and tobacco.Plant J. 2010; 63: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on our UHPLC-MS-SPE-NMR analyses of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with NAE 12:0, we hypothesized that PMAT1 might also function as a malonyltransferase for NAE 12:0 glucosides. To test this hypothesis, we compared metabolite profiles of pmat1 and wild-type seedlings treated with NAE 12:0. We found that the NAE 12:0 malonylglucosides corresponding to the P2 and P3 metabolites in NAE 12:0-treated wild-type seedlings were not detected in pmat1. Furthermore, the peak area of P1, NAE 12:0 glucoside, increased in pmat1, whereas the NAE 12:0 malonyl glucoside peaks were restored in pmat1 transformed with 35S:PMAT1 (Fig. 5). The absence of NAE 12:0 malonylglucosides in pmat1 strongly suggested that PMAT1 is responsible for the malonylation of NAE 12:0 glucoside. To obtain direct evidence that PMAT1 has NAE 12:0 glucoside malonyltransferase activity, we expressed PMAT1 in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant protein for in vitro enzymatic studies (Fig. 6A). NAE 12:0 glucoside P1 was purified from extracts of wild-type seedlings treated with NAE 12:0 by UHPLC-QTOF-MS-SPE and used as a substrate for our enzymatic assays. Reaction with PMAT1 recombinant enzyme was initiated by the addition of the NAE 12:0 glucoside substrate. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and terminated by the addition of HCl.

In this study, we have isolated novel hYVH1-associating proteins from human U2OS osteosarcoma cells using affinity chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry employing ion mobility separation. Numerous ribosomal proteins were identified, confirming the work done in yeast. Furthermore, proteins known to be present on additional RNP particles were identified, including Y box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) and fragile X mental retardation protein, proteins that function in translational repression and stress granule regulation. Follow-up studies demonstrated that hYVH1 co-localizes with YB-1 and fragile X mental retardation protein on stress granules in response to arsenic treatment. Interestingly, hYVH1-positive stress granules were significantly smaller, whereas knocking down hYVH1 expression attenuated stress granule breakdown during recovery from arsenite stress, indicating a possible role for hYVH1 in stress granule disassembly. These results propagate a role for dual specificity phosphatases at RNP particles and suggest that hYVH1 may affect a variety of fundamental cellular processes by regulating messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) dynamics.

The PTP superfamily can be subdivided into subgroups that include receptor PTPs, intracellular PTPs, phosphoinositol lipid phosphatases, and dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) (1Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T.

The DSPs represent the most diverse group of PTPs. Their name denotes the extended substrate specificity of the group for serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphoresidues (2Patterson K.I. Brummer T.

Analogous to tyrosine phosphatases, DSPs contain the invariant catalytic sequence C(X)5R and use a thiol phosphate intermediate as a catalytic mechanism (3Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. A catalytic mechanism for the dual-specific phosphatases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The broader, more shallow active site pocket of DSPs compared with tyrosine-specific phosphatases results in stabilization of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues in addition to phosphotyrosine (4Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Crystal structure of the dual specificity protein phosphatase VHR.Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Members of the DSP family can be further subdivided into unique subgroups. The best characterized, known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases, are characterized by their specificity for the pTXpY signature sequence of MAPKs (5Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. Mechanism of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3 activation by ERK2.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another well characterized group of DSPs are the cell division cycle phosphatases (Cdc14 and Cdc25), which participate in regulation of the cell cycle by dephosphorylating cell cycle regulators, including cell cycle-dependent kinases (6Alonso A. Rojas A. Godzik A. Mustelin T. Arino J. Alexander D.R. Protein Phosphatases. Springer, Berlin2003: 333-358Google Scholar). Meanwhile, a subgroup known as the atypical DSPs is the least characterized subgroup of PTPs. These phosphatases lack the MAPK recognition motifs and the characteristic Cdc25 rhodanese fold and, hence, are predicted to dephosphorylate substrates other than the MAPKs and cell cycle-dependent kinases (7Sadatomi D.

In addition to the N-terminal phosphatase domain, YVH1 family members contain a highly conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain that is more highly conserved than the phosphatase domain. The C-terminal domain of hYVH1 has been shown to coordinate 2 mol of zinc per 1 mol of protein, defining it as a novel zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and the only phosphatase known to contain such a domain. However, the lack of known hYVH1 targets has hindered our understanding of the biological significance of this unique enzyme. In this study, we employed affinity chromatography methods coupled with mass spectrometry to identify novel hYVH1-containing macromolecular structures. Members of various ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were identified, and follow-up microscopy studies demonstrated for the first time that hYVH1 is a stress granule-associating protein. Moreover, we provide evidence that, through its unique ZBD, hYVH1 represents a novel factor regulating stress granule disassembly. Recently, YVH1 in yeast has been identified as a novel trans-acting factor important for 60S ribosomal biogenesis (14Kozarova A. Hudson J.W. Vacratsis P.O.

Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Kemmler S. Occhipinti L. Veisu M. Panse V. Yvh1 is required for a late maturation step in the 60S biogenesis pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 863-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because hYVH1 shares ∼30% sequence identity with YVH1, we were interested in determining whether the human ortholog also localizes to the 60S ribosomal subunit. To examine the relationship between hYVH1 and ribosomal complexes, HEK 293 cells expressing endogenous hYVH1 were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer. Ribosomal subunits were sedimented on a 10–50% sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. Following ultracentrifugation, gradients containing sedimented particles were displaced by injection of a 60% sucrose chase solution through an 80% sucrose cushion (Fig. 1A). RNA absorbance at 254 nm was monitored, revealing peaks corresponding to small RNA species; 40S, 60S, and 80S ribosomal subunits; and polysomes (80S + mRNA) and half-mers (40S + mRNA). Immunoblot analysis was then performed on the fractions to determine the presence of hYVH1 and the 60S ribosomal subunit protein RPL26 as a fractionation control for the 60S and 80S subunits. As shown in Fig. 1B, endogenous hYVH1 (37 kDa) co-elutes within the 60S and 80S peak fractions (Fig. 1A, right panel, top blot). These fractions were confirmed by the presence of the large ribosomal subunit protein RPL26 (17 kDa) in Fig. 1A, right panel, fourth blot, fifth and sixth lanes, corresponding to the 60S and 80S ribosomal complexes, respectively. To characterize the structural features mediating the interaction between hYVH1 and ribosomal subunits, it was important to determine whether ectopically expressed hYVH1 can also associate with the 60S ribosomal subunit. As shown in Fig. 1A (right panel), no appreciable change occurs in the ribosome profiles in the presence of overexpressed FLAG-hYVH1. Furthermore, FLAG-hYVH1 displays a similar pattern of co-fractionation as endogenous hYVH1. The presence of hYVH1 in the 80S fractions was unexpected and could be due to an association with the 80S complex or due to low resolution between the 60S and 80S peaks, as these two complexes elute very close to one another. Thus, to increase resolution, smaller-volume fractions were collected for FLAG-hYVH1 samples and subjected to immunoblotting. This analysis revealed that although the ribosomal core protein RPL26 co-eluted with both the 60S and 80S fractions as expected (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), FLAG-hYVH1 elution was observed predominantly in the 60S fraction, with only trace levels of hYVH1 detected in the later fractions (Fig. 1B, top panel). To complement the fractionation data, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed between hYVH1 and RPL26 (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis shows FLAG-hYVH1 in the lysates of transfected cells but not in the negative control lysates (Fig. 1C, top row). Furthermore, although equal levels of RPL26 are observed in the lysates of both the negative control and FLAG-hYVH1 samples, only FLAG-hYVH1 was able to pull down RPL26 from cellular lysates (Fig. 1C, bottom row). Collectively, these results support the notion that hYVH1 associates with the 60S ribosomal complex in human cells, suggesting an analogous role as its yeast ortholog of functioning as a 60S ribosome biogenesis factor. To elucidate specific regions of hYVH1 required for ribosome co-fractionation, the N-terminal phosphatase domain (ΔZBD) and C-terminal zinc binding domain (ΔDSP) (Fig. 1D) were expressed separately in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Cells overexpressing domain deletion mutants were lysed, and ribosome profiling was performed. Immunoblot analysis of lysates and fractions reveals that both domains appear to play a role in 60S ribosomal association (Fig. 1, A and E). We observed little detectable co-fractionation of hYVH1 ΔZBD with the ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1, A and E). Surprisingly, we also observed significant loss of co-fractionation when expressing hYVH1 ΔDSP. These results reveal that although the ZBD is indispensable for 60S co-fractionation, the N-terminal DSP domain of hYVH1 is also a contributing factor for optimal ribosome association. Many ribosomal trans-acting factors exhibit extra ribosomal functions and localize to multiple RNPs (20Warner J.R. McIntosh K.B. How common are extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins?.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Therefore, to explore whether hYVH1 is also present on additional RNP complexes, we conducted an interactome analysis in U2OS cells using FLAG affinity chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. We sought a cell line that was responsive to hYVH1 expression for our interactome analysis. U2OS cells were selected because of our previously finding that hYVH1 expression in U2OS cells affects cell cycle progression (14Kozarova A. Hudson J.W. Vacratsis P.O. The dual-specificity phosphatase hYVH1 (DUSP12) is a novel modulator of cellular DNA content.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following isolation using FLAG-hYVH1 affinity chromatography, isolated proteins were eluted from the resin using a “soft elution” SDS buffer adapted from Antrobus and Borner (21Antrobus R. Borner G.H. Improved elution conditions for native co-immunoprecipitation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e18218 Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins from control cells or FLAG-hYVH1-expressing cells were then acetone-precipitated and processed for trypsin digestion. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC/MS-MS) in a SYNAPT G2Si Q-TOF mass spectrometer (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) for protein identification. To increase the number of proteins identified, we employed the ion mobility chamber positioned between the quadrupole and time of flight tube within the SYNAPT instrument. The ion mobility step adds an additional separation feature to the experiment, as peptides that co-elute off the reverse phase column will often have different mobility (drift time) through the ion mobility chamber. This additional chromatography step significantly increased the number of proteins identified (Fig. 2A). Proteins of interest were those that were confidently identified in the FLAG-hYVH1 sample but not in the FLAG-control sample (Fig. 2B, supplemental Fig. S1). Identified proteins consisted of numerous 60S ribosomal unit proteins, including the ribosome stalk proteins P0 and P2 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). The high number of core 60S ribosomal proteins identified was expected given the fact that YVH1 in yeast has been shown to associate with the 60S RNP particle (11Liu Y. Chang A. A mutant plasma membrane protein is stabilized upon loss of Yvh1, a novel ribosome assembly factor.Genetics. 2009; 181: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Lo K.Y. Li Z. Wang F.

Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 863-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), validating our affinity chromatography approach. Surprisingly, however, large numbers of 40S subunit proteins were also identified. This was unexpected because, in yeast, YVH1 has been characterized exclusively as a 60S biogenesis factor (12Lo K.Y. Li Z. Wang F. Marcotte E.M. Johnson A.W. Ribosome stalk assembly requires the dual-specificity phosphatase Yvh1 for the exchange of Mrt4 with P0.J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 863-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, our interactome data provide suggestive evidence that, in human cells, hYVH1 may be present on additional RNPs that possess 40S subunits. Along these lines, proteins characterized for their role in translational repression via storage mRNPs containing 40S ribosomal subunits were also present in the interactome analysis, along with proteins that function in pre-mRNA splicing (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). Collectively, this dataset implies that, in addition to 60S ribosome biogenesis, hYVH1 may localize to multiple RNP particles important in regulating mRNA processing. Our hYVH1 interactome findings showed a large number of proteins known to function in RNP dynamics. We therefore were interested in testing whether hYVH1 indeed localizes to RNPs other than the 60S ribosome. Of notable interest was the presence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Y box-containing protein 1 (YB-1), both regulators of translation repression on mRNP granules (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). FMRP-containing mRNP granules have been shown to mediate transport of specific mRNAs for localized protein expression (20Warner J.R. McIntosh K.B. How common are extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins?.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 22Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J. Zhang C.

FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.Cell. 2011; 146: 247-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FMRP and YB-1 are necessary factors for repressing translation during transport (20Warner J.R. McIntosh K.B. How common are extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins?.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 23Fritzsche R. Karra D. Bennett K.L. Ang F.Y. Heraud-Farlow J.E. Tolino M. Doyle M. Bauer K.E. Thomas S.

Palfi Z. et al.Interactome of two diverse RNA granules links mRNA localization to translational repression in neurons.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 1749-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To confirm that hYVH1 associates with FMRP/YB-1-containing foci, we analyzed their co-localization using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). To better visualize FLAG-hYVH1 on RNP particles, we treated the cells with a low concentration of the detergent saponin (Fig. 3A). Gentle treatment of cells with saponin prior to fixation and immunostaining has been shown to permeabilize plasma membranes, liberating soluble cytoplasmic proteins while retaining the localization of proteins found on suborganellar structures (24Lin A. Krockmalnic G. Penman S. Imaging cytoskeleton-mitochondrial membrane attachments by embedment-free electron microscopy of saponin-extracted cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 8565-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the absence of saponin, the hYVH1 localization pattern is quite diffuse, making it difficult to resolve hYVH1 association with subcellular structures (Fig. 3A, and Refs. 10Muda M. Manning E.R. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Identification of the human YVH1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase orthologue reveals a novel binding domain essential for in vivo function.J. Biol.

The dual-specificity phosphatase hYVH1 interacts with Hsp70 and prevents heat-shock-induced cell death.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With saponin treatment, we found that hYVH1 is readily detectable on punctate structures in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Thus, when we conducted immunofluorescence studies using saponin treatment, we observed co-localization between hYVH1- and YB-1-positive granules in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). There were also YB-1 containing particles in the cytoplasm that were devoid of hYVH1, and no co-localization was detected with nuclear YB-1. As YB-1 is a multifunctional protein, including a well characterized transcriptional regulator (25Matsumoto K. Tanaka K.J. Tsujimoto M. An acidic protein, YBAP1, mediates the release of YB-1 from mRNA and relieves the translational repression activity of YB-1.Mol. Cell.

YB-1 promotes transcription of cyclin D1 in human non-small-cell lung cancers.Genes Cells. 2014; 19: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these results suggest that hYVH1 associates with selective YB-1-containing particles. Co-localization was also observed between FMRP and hYVH1 (Fig. 3C). Similar to YB-1, co-localization between hYVH1 and FMRP was also observed on punctate structures in the cytoplasm, with no detectable co-localization of hYVH1 with the nuclear pool of FMRP. It has been proposed that FMRP associates with its mRNA target in the nucleus and assists in the transport of mRNA into the cytoplasm for targeted mRNP transport (28Kim M. Bellini M. Ceman S. Fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP binds mRNAs in the nucleus.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 214-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, our co-localization pattern suggests that hYVH1 association with FMRP-containing granules may occur after the particles are shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to complement the immunofluorescence studies. U2OS cells expressing FLAG-hYVH1 variants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose resin and probed for endogenous YB-1 and FMRP (Fig. 4). We observed that both wild-type hYVH1 and hYVH1 C115S (a phosphatase-inactive mutant) co-immunoprecipitated YB-1 and FMRP to a similar extent, suggesting that phosphatase activity is likely not required to associate with YB-1 and FMRP particles. Regarding the modular domains of hYVH1, the ZBD of hYVH1 has been shown to be required, and in some instances sufficient, for the observed hYVH1-mediated cellular functions, such as ribosome biogenesis (11Liu Y. Chang A. A mutant plasma membrane protein is stabilized upon loss of Yvh1, a novel ribosome assembly factor.Genetics. 2009; 181: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Lo K.Y. Li Z.

The dual-specificity phosphatase hYVH1 (DUSP12) is a novel modulator of cellular DNA content.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and cell survival (15Sharda P.R. Bonham C.A. Mucaki E.J. Butt Z. Vacratsis P.O. The dual-specificity phosphatase hYVH1 interacts with Hsp70 and prevents heat-shock-induced cell death.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, deletion of the ZBD (hYVH1 ΔZBD) reduced co-immunoprecipitation with both FMRP and YB-1 by ∼2-fold (Fig. 4B), although association was not completely abrogated. Although immunoprecipitating equal levels of hYVH1 ΔDSP compared with the other hYVH1 variants was problematic, densitometry analysis of data normalized to FLAG-hYVH1 levels suggests that the ZBD associates with FMRP/YB-1 granules to a similar extent as wild-type hYVH1. It is important to note that, in our hands and reported by others (10Muda M. Manning E.R. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Identification of the human YVH1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase orthologue reveals a novel binding domain essential for in vivo function.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23991-23995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the catalytic domain alone (ΔZBD) is substantially more stable in vitro and expresses at much higher levels during transient transfection of mammalian cell lines compared with the ZBD (ΔDSP) and full-length hYVH1. Thus, the N-terminal DSP domain may help stabilize the ZBD. Although it remains inconclusive whether the ZBD is sufficient, we can conclude that the DSP domain alone maintains some ability to associate with the FMRP/YB-1 granules. However, the ZBD appears to be necessary for optimal hYVH1 association with FMRP/YB-1 complexes. We also examined whether hYVH1 binds directly to FMRP or YB-1 in vitro using purified recombinant proteins and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Although a variety of conditions were tested, there was no detectable evidence that hYVH1 could directly associate with FMRP or YB-1 (data not shown). As mRNP granules are multiprotein complexes, these results suggest that hYVH1 likely associates with YB-1- and FMRP-containing granules through a linking protein rather than directly through YB-1 or FMRP. Future work utilizing cross-linking tools and proximity-based mass spectrometry techniques will be needed to delineate the direct binding partner linking hYVH1 to FMRP/YB-1 containing granules. FMRP and YB-1 have been shown to play multiple roles"
https://openalex.org/W2556591964,"Species’ geographic ranges could primarily be physiological tolerances drawn in space. Alternatively, geographic ranges could be only broadly constrained by physiological climatic tolerances: there could generally be much more proximate constraints on species’ ranges (dispersal limitation, biotic interactions, etc.) such that species often occupy a small and unpredictable subset of tolerable climates. In the literature, species’ climatic tolerances are typically estimated from the set of conditions observed within their geographic range. Using this method, studies have concluded that broader climatic niches permit larger ranges. Similarly, other studies have investigated the biological causes of incomplete range filling. But, when climatic constraints are measured directly from species’ ranges, are correlations between species’ range size and climate necessarily consistent with a causal link? We evaluated the extent to which variation in range size among 3277 bird and 1659 mammal species occurring in the Americas is statistically related to characteristics of species’ realized climatic niches. We then compared how these relationships differed from the ones expected in the absence of a causal link. We used a null model that randomizes the predictor variables (climate), while retaining their broad spatial autocorrelation structure, thereby removing any causal relationship between range size and climate. We found that, although range size is strongly positively related to climatic niche breadth, range filling and, to a lesser extent, niche position in nature, the observed relationships are not always stronger than expected from spatial autocorrelation alone. Thus, we conclude that equally strong relationships between range size and climate would result from any processes causing ranges to be highly spatially autocorrelated."

The PTP1BΔE6 mutant expressed in these two tumor types and another PTP1BΔE5 mutant expressed in colon tumor were studied in more detail. Although PTP1BΔE6 revealed no phosphatase activity compared with wild-type PTP1B and the PTP1BΔE5 mutant, its expression induced oncogenic transformation of rat fibroblasts without Src activation, indicating that it involved signaling pathways independent of Src. The transformed cells were tumourigenic in nude mice, suggesting that the PTP1BΔE6 affected other molecule(s) in the human tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2549289035,"Worldwide savannas and arid grasslands are mainly used for livestock grazing, providing livelihood to over a billion people. While normally dominated by perennial C4 grasses, these rangelands are increasingly affected by the massive spread of native, mainly woody legumes. The consequences are often a repression of grass cover and productivity, leading to a reduced carrying capacity. While such encroachment by woody plants has been extensively researched, studies on similar processes involving herbaceous species are rare. We studied the impact of a sustained and massive spread of the native herbaceous legume Crotalaria podocarpa in Namibia's escarpment region on the locally dominant fodder grasses Stipagrostis ciliata and Stipagrostis uniplumis. We measured tussock densities, biomass production of individual tussocks and tussock dormancy state of Stipagrostis on ten 10 m x 10 m plots affected and ten similarly-sized plots unaffected by C. podocarpa over eight consecutive years and under different seasonal rainfalls and estimated the potential relative productivity of the land. We found the percentage of active Stipagrostis tussocks and the biomass production of individual tussocks to increase asymptotically with higher seasonal rainfall reaching a maximum around 300 mm while the land's relative productivity under average local rainfall conditions reached only 40% of its potential. Crotalaria podocarpa encroachment had no effect on the proportion of productive grass tussocks, but reduced he productivity of individual Stipagrostis tussocks by a third. This effect of C. podocarpa on grass productivity was immediate and direct and was not compensated for by above-average rainfall. Besides this immediate effect, over time, the density of grass tussocks declined by more than 50% in areas encroached by C. podocarpa further and lastingly reducing the lands carrying capacity. The effects of C. podocarpa on grass productivity hereby resemble those of woody encroachers. Therefore, against the background of global change, the spread of herbaceous legumes and the underlying patterns needs to be further investigated to develop adequate counter measures for a sustainable land use."

To elucidate the role of Opalin in mammalian myelin, we disrupted the Opalin gene in mice and analyzed the impacts on myelination and behavior. Opalin-knockout (Opalin-/-) mice were born at a Mendelian ratio and had a normal body shape and weight. Interestingly, Opalin-/- mice had no obvious abnormalities in major myelin protein compositions, expression of oligodendrocyte lineage markers, or domain organization of myelinated axons compared with WT mice (Opalin+/+) mice. Electron microscopic observation of the optic nerves did not reveal obvious differences between Opalin+/+ and Opalin-/- mice in terms of fine structures of paranodal loops, transverse bands, and multi-lamellae of myelinated axons. Moreover, sensory reflex, circadian rhythm, and locomotor activity in the home cage, as well as depression-like behavior, in the Opalin-/- mice were indistinguishable from the Opalin+/+ mice. Nevertheless, a subtle but significant impact on exploratory activity became apparent in Opalin-/- mice exposed to a novel environment. These results suggest that Opalin is not critical for central nervous system myelination or basic sensory and motor activities under conventional breeding conditions, although it might be required for fine-tuning of exploratory behavior."

In this scheme, ISPA loss due to PSD overlapping of both OFDM-based LTE-Advanced and FM broadcasting service is computed. The proposed model can estimate power attenuation loss more precisely than the Advanced Minimum Coupling Loss (A-MCL) and approximate-ISPA methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the interference power is less than that obtained using the A-MCL and approximate ISPA methods by 2.8 and 1.5 dB at the co-channel and by 5.2 and 2.2 dB at the adjacent channel with null guard band, respectively. The outperformance of this scheme over the other methods leads to more diminishing in the required physical distance between the two systems which ultimately supports efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum."

They have managed this evolutionary feat not just once, but at least a dozen times, new research shows. There are other classic examples of parallel evolution, but those species had a recent common ancestor, whereas the rove beetles have been diverging for more than a hundred million years. And just as ant colonies are jackpots for ant look-alike rove beetles, so, too, are termite nests. Based on a morphologically based family tree, other researchers propose that an adaptation of some beetles for living and hunting in sand helped protect the first beetle parasites from the termite attack. Now, some of these rove beetles have come to look and act just like the termites."

And although many researchers were shocked by his public statements and professed policies, they are now scrambling to make the case that research contributes to the prosperity and security of the nation. One worry is that Trump could undo Obama-era executive orders easing controls on human embryonic stem cell research and undermine high-profile regulations aimed at reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and protecting small waterways and wetlands. A second concern is that President Barack Obama won't be around to veto bills from a Republican-led Congress that scientists also oppose. History has shown, however, that having the same party control both the White House and Congress is no guarantee of legislative harmony. And science advocates are even hoping that one of Trump's priorities, a $1 trillion pledge to repair the nation's roads and bridges, harbors, airports, and rail systems, will be broadened to include cyber and scientific infrastructure."

The academy plans to recruit 16 new women this way; meanwhile, regular elections will also continue, meaning that the plan does not come at the expense of male candidates, says KNAW President Jose van Dijck. It's about as bold a step as any science academy has taken to address the underrepresentation of women. But some worry that women elected this way may be seen as less worthy members."
https://openalex.org/W2556129061,"The breakup and abandonment of Japan's ASTRO-H x-ray satellite just 5 weeks after its launch this past spring prompted soul-searching at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS). The small, scrappy space science institute has seen its reputation for building ground-breaking missions on modest budgets tarnished by a lengthening list of failures. The institute has convinced funding agencies and international partners that changes to the way it manages missions will ensure greater reliability in all of its future spacecraft. It is now on track to gain approval to build a replacement for ASTRO-H, which was also known as Hitomi, that will be simpler and cheaper but carry a copy of the Soft X-Ray Spectrometer that was the primary focus of interest for astrophysicists. ISAS hopes to launch the new satellite by 2021."
