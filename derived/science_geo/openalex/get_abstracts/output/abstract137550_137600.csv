https://openalex.org/W1872501262,"Folic acid is essential for the synthesis and repair of DNA. We report the effects of folate depletion on DNA stability in normal human lymphocytes in vitro. DNA strand breakage, uracil misincorporation, oxidative DNA base damage, and DNA repair capability were determined using variants of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). Lymphocyte proliferation was measured as an indicator of normal replication. Lymphocytes isolated from human venous blood were stimulated to grow in either complete medium containing folic acid (1 ng/ml-2 microgram/ml) or medium deficient in folic acid for up to 10 days. Cells prepared for comet analysis were treated either with the bacterial DNA repair enzyme endonuclease III to determine the level of oxidized pyrimidines in lymphocyte DNA or with uracil DNA glycosylase, which detects misincorporated uracil. Cell number and viability were measured. Normal human lymphocyte DNA contained detectable amounts of misincorporated uracil (estimated as approximately 1000 per cell). DNA strand breakage and uracil misincorporation increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after lymphocytes were cultured with decreasing amounts of folic acid. DNA damage was induced at folic acid concentrations routinely observed in plasma from the human population (1-10 ng/ml). Lymphocytes cultured under folate-deficient conditions failed to grow normally compared with control cells. However, all lymphocytes remained viable as measured by Trypan blue exclusion. Cells deprived of folate were unable to efficiently repair oxidative DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition of repair was maximal after 8 days in culture. Folate supply had no effect on the level of oxidized pyrimidines in lymphocyte DNA, even after 10 days in culture, suggesting that folate deficiency increases uracil misincorporation relatively specifically. These in vitro results help to determine the mechanism(s) through which folic acid maintains DNA stability."

https://openalex.org/W1829528853,"Controlling receptor-mediated interactions between cells and template surfaces is a central principle in many tissue engineering procedures (1-3). Biomaterial surfaces engineered to present cell adhesion ligands undergo integrin-mediated molecular interactions with cells (1, 4, 5), stimulating cell spreading, and differentiation (6-8). This provides a mechanism for mimicking natural cell-to-matrix interactions. Further sophistication in the control of cell interactions can be achieved by fabricating surfaces on which the spatial distribution of ligands is restricted to micron-scale pattern features (9-14). Patterning technology promises to facilitate spatially controlled tissue engineering with applications in the regeneration of highly organized tissues. These new applications require the formation of ligand patterns on biocompatible and biodegradable templates, which control tissue regeneration processes, before removal by metabolism. We have developed a method of generating micron-scale patterns of any biotinylated ligand on the surface of a biodegradable block copolymer, polylactide-poly(ethylene glycol). The technique achieves control of biomolecule deposition with nanometer precision. Spatial control over cell development has been observed when using these templates to culture bovine aortic endothelial cells and PC12 nerve cells. Furthermore, neurite extension on the biodegradable polymer surface is directed by pattern features composed of peptides containing the IKVAV sequence (15, 16), suggesting that directional control over nerve regeneration on biodegradable biomaterials can be achieved."

Several studies have associated deregulated Cdc2 activity with apoptosis. Herein, we report that the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, undergoes cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation during mitosis when there is elevated Cdc2 activity. We found that paclitaxel (Taxol®) treatment of epithelial tumor cells induced a prolonged mitotic arrest, elevated levels of mitotic kinase activity, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2, and subsequent cell death. The Taxol-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation was dose-dependent. Furthermore, phosphorylated Bcl-2 remained complexed with Bax in Taxol-treated cells undergoing apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a Bcl-2-associated kinase capable of phosphorylating histone H1 in vitro. However, the kinase was likely not cyclin B1/Cdc2, since cyclin B1/Cdc2 was not detectable in Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates, nor was recombinant Bcl-2 phosphorylatedin vitro by cyclin B1/Cdc2. The results of this study further define a link between mitotic kinase activation and the apoptotic machinery in the cell. However, the role, if any, of prolonged Bcl-2 phosphorylation in Taxol-mediated apoptosis awaits further definition of Bcl-2 mechanism of action. Taxol may increase cellular susceptibility to apoptosis by amplifying the normal downstream events associated with mitotic kinase activation.

Microtubule inhibitors such as Taxol have proven to be effective in the treatment of many cancers including metastatic breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer (1Rowinsky E.K. Cazenave L.A. Donehower R.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The effects of Taxol are correlated with increased tubulin polymerization, tubulin bundling, and cell cycle arrest (2Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Nature. 1979; 22: 665-667Crossref Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 3Schiff P.B. Horwitz S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 4De Brabander M. Geuens G. Nuydens R. Willebrodes R. DeMey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 9552-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Although Taxol binding to tubulin is well characterized and the ability of the drug to induce a mitotic arrest recognized, the biochemical mechanisms by which altered microtubule dynamics leads to cytotoxicity are not well defined. Several studies suggest that Taxol alters certain intracellular signal transduction events; however; few studies have focused on Taxol-mediated signaling during mitosis, the phase of the cell cycle in which Taxol-treated cells arrest. In eukaryotic cells, progression from G2 into mitosis is dependent upon the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2 (6Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Cdc2 is tightly regulated by a series of phosphorylations and protein-protein interactions. Mitotic events, including chromosome condensation, nuclear membrane breakdown, and altered spindle dynamics, are stimulated by an active cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex (6Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). The activation of Cdc2 requires association with cyclin partners and phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (7Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 8Draetta G.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R50-R52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During S or G2 phase, cells accumulate cyclin B1/Cdc2 in an inactive form in which the Cdc2 component is hyperphosphorylated (7Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar,9Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Inhibitory phosphorylations on Cdc2 are thought to be due to the activities of Wee1 and Myt1 kinases (10Parker L.L. Sylvestre P.J. Byrnes III, M.J. Liu F. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9638-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 12Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy A. Science. 1995; 270: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The conversion of Cdc2 from an inactive to active form is accomplished by the phosphatase, Cdc25C (13Strausfeld U. Labbe J.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Picard A. Sadhu K. Russell P. Doree M. Nature. 1991; 351: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 14Millar J.B.A. Blevitt J. Gerace L. Sadhu K. Featherstone C. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During mitosis, Wee1 is hyperphosphorylated (16Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and inactive (17McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) while Cdc25C is present in a hyperphosphorylated, active form (18Hoffman I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In metaphase, once the chromosomes align properly on the mitotic spindle, a series of biochemical reactions involved in spindle checkpoint function activate a proteolytic pathway that allows transition into anaphase (19Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Sorger P.K. Dobles M. Tournebize R. Hyman A.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). If a single chromosome fails to attach properly to the spindle or microtubule dynamics are disrupted, the mitotic spindle checkpoint is engaged and cells arrest at metaphase (21Gorbsky G.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that prolonged mitotic arrest stimulates apoptosis (22King K.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), but the biochemical pathway linking these two events remains unclear. The Bcl-2 family plays a central role in the control of apoptosis. The family includes a number of proteins which have amino acid sequence homology, including anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, as well as pro-apoptotic members including Bax and Bad (reviewed in Refs. 23Reed J.C. Cur. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar and 24Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The family members form both homodimers and heterodimers (23Reed J.C. Cur. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 24Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). While the functional significance of these protein-protein interactions is unclear, it is believed that the heterodimerization of Bcl-2 and Bax is critical in preventing Bax-mediated apoptosis (25Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar, 26Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family members reside primarily in the membranes of the mitochondria, but Bcl-2 has also been localized to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus (27Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL has been shown to prevent chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis associated with altered mitochondria transmembrane potential (28Decaudin D. Geley S. Hirsch T. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kofler R. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 has been shown to prevent the release of cytochrome c (29Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Naekyung Kim C. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar) from the mitochondria while Bax promotes its release (30Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Cytochromec release stimulates an apoptotic protease cascade involving caspases (31Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar), which are cysteine proteases active during the effector phase of apoptosis (32Harvey K.J. Blomquist J.F. Ucker D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2912-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The role of post-translational modifications of Bcl-2 family members in promoting or inhibiting apoptosis remains controversial (33Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 34Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nesterova M. Cho-Chung Y.S. Longo D.L. Mol. Cell.

In cells treated with microtubule inhibitors, Bcl-2 has been shown to be phosphorylated on serine residues (35Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol.

Several kinases, including c-Raf-1 (37Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Mimnaugh E.G. Trepel J. Neckers L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4623-4626PubMed Google Scholar, 38Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), have been implicated in this phosphorylation event, and it has been proposed that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 reduces heterodimer formation with Bax (34Srivastava R.K.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we determined that Bcl-2 is normally phosphorylated during mitosis and that Taxol-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation is a consequence of drug-induced cell cycle arrest in mitosis. Furthermore, the Taxol-induced cell cycle arrest led to elevated mitotic kinase activity, prolonged phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and subsequent onset of apoptosis in tumor-derived epithelial cells. The results of this study begin to temporally link mitotic events with modulation of proteins, such as Bcl-2, that regulate apoptosis. H460 and BT-474 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The H460 cells were maintained in RPMI (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, RKO cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A (HyClone) supplemented with 10% calf serum, and BT-474 cells were maintained in IMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RKO-pCEP4 and RKO-Bcl-2 cells were generated by LipofectAMINE transfection (Life Technologies, Inc.) of previously described expression vectors (42Pietenpol J.A. Papadopoulos N. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar) into RKO cells followed by hygromycin B selection. Clones were expanded and the cell lines maintained in McCoy's 5A, 10% calf serum, and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). All cell lines were grown in the presence of penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Where indicated, cells were treated with paclitaxel (Taxol; Sigma) suspended in Me2SO. Me2SO alone was used as a vehicle control. Two days prior to elutriation, RKO cells were transferred to 850-cm2 roller bottles and grown in L15 (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to elutriation, cells were treated with Taxol (100 nm) for 3.5 h. Centrifugal elutriation was performed using a Beckman JE-5.0 preparative scale rotor and model J6-MC centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Media flow rate was controlled with a Masterflex pump and model 7518–12 pump head (Cole-Parmer). The elutriation medium consisted of equal parts phosphate-buffered saline (PBS1; HyClone) and McCoy's 5A supplemented with 2% calf serum. Approximately 1.5 × 109 control or Taxol-treated cells were entered into the elutriation chamber at 33 ml/min for 20 min. The rotor speed was 2000 rpm, and the temperature was 30 °C during the elutriation procedure. The cell gradient was allowed to form for 10 min at a pump setting of 75 ml/min. The initial 1-liter fraction was collected at a flow rate of 110 ml/min with an increase of 10 ml/min for each successive fraction. After fraction collection, cells were pelleted at 1500 rpm using a JS-4.2 rotor in a J6-HC centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in PBS and 1.0 × 106cells aliquoted for flow cytometry (see below). The remaining cells were washed in PBS and frozen at −80 °C for protein analysis (see below). RKO and H460 cells were seeded in 100-mm mm dishes and treated when 50% confluent withl-mimosine (Sigma). RKO cells were treated with 300 μml-mimosine for 24 h, and H460 cells were treated with 350 μml-mimosine for 24 h. To release the cell lines from the G1/S block, the l-mimosine containing growth medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and medium containing Taxol or vehicle was placed on the cells. Cells were harvested for flow cytometry and protein analysis as described below. Approximately 1.0 × 106control or Taxol-treated cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), and DNA content was measured using a FACSCaliber (Becton-Dickson). Data were plotted using Modfit software (Verity Software House). Fifteen thousand events were analyzed for each sample. Cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (KLB: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaV, 1 mm DTT, and the protease inhibitors antipain (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml) (Sigma), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (200 μg/ml) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp)). Protein concentration of the extract was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and either 25 or 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with antibodies against Bcl-2 (clone 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin B1 (GNS1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdc2 (clone 17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MPM-2 (mitotic protein monoclonal 2, Upstate Biotechnology), Wee1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdc25C (M2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bax (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Bcl-xL. Primary antibodies were detected using either a goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. H460 protein lysates (25 μg) were incubated in 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 1 mm DTT (final volume 100 μl) for 10 min at 30 °C, followed by addition of 0.75 unit of potato acid phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). The incubation was continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphatase reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer. The control and phosphatase-treated lysates were analyzed by Western blot. For cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity assays, 150 μg of total cell protein extract were pre-cleared for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 5 μg mouse IgG pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pre-cleared lysates were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with α-cyclin B1 (GNS1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with KLB and twice with kinase buffer (KB: 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT) prior to incubation with either 5 μg of histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 μg of GST-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 1 μg of GST protein prepared as described (43Flatt P.M. Price J.O. Shaw A. Pietenpol J.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 535-543PubMed Google Scholar) and 15 nm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were incubated with 2 or 5 μCi of [γ -32P]ATP for 10 or 30 min at 30 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity assays using recombinant Sf9 GST-cyclin B1/Cdc2, Sf9 cells were co-infected with cyclin B1 and Cdc2 baculoviruses, protein extracts prepared and 300 μg incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitated GST-cyclin B1/Cdc2 was washed twice with KLB and twice with KB prior to incubation with 2 μg of GST-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1 μg of GST protein and 15 nm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were incubated with 10 μCi of [γ -32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For Bcl-2-associated kinase activity assays, 200 μg of total cell protein extract were pre-cleared for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of mouse IgG pre-bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pre-cleared lysates were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with α-Bcl-2 (clone 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with KLB and twice with KB prior to incubation with 5 μg of histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) and 15 nm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ -32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Kinase assays were quantified using an Instant Imager (Packard Instruments) prior to autoradiography. For immunoprecipitations, 150 μg of total cell protein extract was immunoprecipitated with either α-Bax (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or α-Bcl-2 (clone 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in KLB and separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western analysis performed. To determine the relationship between Taxol-induced mitotic arrest, Cdc2 activation, and Bcl-2 phosphorylation, we initially examined the status of G2/M regulatory proteins in several epithelial cell lines after Taxol treatment. Human lung (H460), colon (RKO), and breast (BT-474) carcinoma cell lines were treated with Taxol (100 nm) and protein extracts analyzed by Western (Fig. 1 A). After 24 h of Taxol treatment, slower migrating forms of Bcl-2, Cdc25C, and Wee1 proteins were present in cells, indicative of changes in the phosphorylation state of these proteins. In addition, there was a shift to a faster migrating form of Cdc2 consistent with the hypophosphorylated, active form of the protein. To determine if the slower migrating forms of Bcl-2, Cdc25C, and Wee1 represented phosphorylated forms of the proteins, we exposed Taxol-treated H460 lysates to potato acid phosphatase. This treatment resulted in loss of the slower migrating forms of the proteins and a parallel increase in the faster migrating protein species (Fig. 1 B). The Taxol-induced hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 coincided with the phosphorylation changes of Wee1, Cdc25C, and Cdc2 that typically accompany mitotic entry. Similar changes in protein phosphorylation were also observed in PC-3 prostate, MDA-MB468 breast, and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines (data not shown). The observed Taxol-induced phosphorylation changes in Wee1, Cdc25C, Cdc2 and Bcl-2 were dose-dependent. H460 and RKO cells were treated with Taxol (0.1–100 nm) for 24 h and protein lysates analyzed by Western (Fig. 2 A). Changes in G2/M regulatory protein phosphorylation and Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation were evident after treatment of cells with 10 nm Taxol. As the dose of Taxol increased from 10 nm to 100 nm, there was a parallel increase in phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Cdc25C, and Wee1 and dephosphorylation of Cdc2 in both cell types. However, the protein mobility of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, remained unchanged (Fig. 2 B). Recently, Poruchynsky et al. (44Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar) and Fang et al.(45Fang G.F. Chang B.S. Kim C.N. Perkins C. Thompson C.B. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3202-3208PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that Bcl-xL is phosphorylated in Taxol-treated cells. We also detected a subtle mobility shift in Bcl-xL after Taxol treatment (30 and 100 nm). This change in Bcl-xL migration may be due to increased phosphorylation of the protein. The Taxol-induced phosphorylation changes of Cdc25C, Wee1, and Cdc2 were consistent with cells accumulating in mitosis with an active cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex. Since Taxol-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation coincided with these protein phosphorylation changes, we hypothesized that the observed phosphorylation of Bcl-2 was M phase-specific. To test this hypothesis, we isolated control and Taxol-treated cells from various phases of the cell cycle and compared Bcl-2 phosphorylation state to cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity. RKO cells were grown in the presence or absence of Taxol (100 nm) for 3.5 h and size-fractionated by centrifugal elutriation. Relatively pure populations of G1 and G2/M cells were purified as assessed by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3 A). Matched cell fractions from control and Taxol-treated cells gave almost identical flow cytometric profiles (Fig. 3 A, compare fractions 1–8 from control and Taxol-treated cultures). Protein lysates were prepared from each fraction and cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 protein levels were determined as well as cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity using histone H1 as a substrate. Fraction 1 from control and Taxol-treated cells contained a relatively pure population of G1 cells with little, if any, detectable cyclin B1 protein, phosphorylated Bcl-2, or cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity (Fig. 3,B–D). Even though Fraction 2 was comprised of predominantly G1 cells (Fig. 3 A), cyclin B1 immunoprecipitable kinase activity was readily apparent (Fig. 3 D). The level of cyclin B1-associated kinase activity appears inconsistent with the low levels of cyclin B1 protein in this fraction (Fig. 3 B). However, 6 times more protein lysate was used in the kinase assay as compared with that analyzed by Western. Fractions 5–7 were comprised of cells with predominantly a 4n DNA content that had significantly increased levels of cyclin B1 protein (Fig. 3 B) and cyclin B1-immunoprecipitable kinase activity (Fig. 3 D). The presence of cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity was consistent with cells that had entered mitosis. Phosphorylated Bcl-2 was readily detectable in control cells (fractions 4–7) and Taxol-treated cells (fractions 4–8); these fractions contained predominantly mitotic cells with elevated levels of cyclin B1-immunoprecipitable kinase activity. The increased ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated Bcl-2 in the Taxol-treated cells (fractions 4–8) correlated with significantly higher levels of cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity in these cells. These results indicate that phosphorylated Bcl-2 is present normally in mitosis during times of peak cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity. Thus, in asynchronously growing, Taxol-treated cell cultures, the observed Bcl-2 phosphorylation is a consequence of mitotic arrest. To further examine and confirm the relationship between entry of cells into mitosis and Bcl-2 phosphorylation, H460 cells were synchronized in G1/S using mimosine and then released in the presence or absence of Taxol (100 nm). Cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 4 A), and protein analyses performed (Fig. 4, B–E). Analysis of cyclin B1/Cdc2 immunoprecipitable kinase activity as well as the presence of mitotic phosphoproteins using the MPM-2 antibody allowed biochemical detection of 4n DNA-containing cells that had entered M phase. A previous study by Davis et al. (46Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) showed that the MPM-2 antibody recognizes phosphorylated polypeptides found only in mitotic cells; thus, this antibody is a useful reagent for distinguishing 4n DNA-containing mitotic cells from those in G2 phase. By 9 h after mimosine release, a percentage of the control H460 cells began to enter mitosis, as evidenced by the elevated levels of cyclin B1 protein and a 3-fold increase in cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity (Fig. 4, B and E). The Taxol-treated H460 cells had slower kinetics of mitotic entry with a 3-fold increase in cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity and significant detectable MPM-2 positivity beginning 14 h after mimosine release. There was very low level Bcl-2 phosphorylation in the control cells (Fig. 4 C, 18–24-h time points). However, significant levels of phosphorylated Bcl-2 were readily detectable at 14 h after Taxol treatment and coincided with the elevated cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity and the appearance of MPM-2 phosphoepitopes. At 18 h after mimosine release, flow cytometric profiles of the control and Taxol-treated cell populations were almost identical (Fig. 4 A). However, there were significant elevations in the levels of phosphorylated Bcl-2 (Fig. 4 C), cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity (Fig. 4 E), and MPM-2 phosphoepitopes (Fig. 4 D) in the Taxol-treated cells as compared with control cultures. By 22 h after mimosine release, the control cultures had returned to G1 phase, as evidenced by the increase in 2n DNA-containing cells (Fig. 4 A); however, the Taxol-treated cultures remained arrested in mitosis with elevated levels of cyclin B1-associated kinase activity and hyperphosphorylated Bcl-2. The highest levels of phosphorylated Bcl-2 protein were found in samples containing 7–12-fold increases in cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity and significant elevations in the level of MPM-2 phosphoepitopes. Between 39 and 45 h after Taxol treatment of the H460 cells, the elevated levels of mitotic kinase activity were followed by the appearance of sub-diploid cells in the cultures (Fig. 4 A). This sub-diploid DNA content was accompanied by the appearance of nuclear blebbing and chromatin condensation in the Taxol-treated H460 cells (data not shown). To determine if Taxol-induced apoptosis was preceded by elevated levels of mitotic kinase activity and prolonged phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in another cell type, the RKO cells were mimosine-synchronized and released in the presence or absence of Taxol (100 nm). Cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 5 A) and protein analyses performed (Fig. 5, B–F). Elevations in cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity were apparent at 16 h in the control cultures and at 14–16 h in the Taxol-treated cultures. Similar to the results with the H460 cells, the kinetics of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in the Taxol-treated RKO cells coincided with the appearance of MPM-2 phosphoepitopes and significant increases in cyclin B1/Cdc2 activity. By 16 h, a percentage of control cells had re-entered G1 phase as evidenced by the appearance of cells with a 2n DNA content; however, the Taxol-"

Thesetemperature-sensitive csg2Δ suppressors (tsc) fall into 15 complementation groups. TheTSC10/YBR265w gene was found to encode 3-ketosphinganine reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in the synthesis of phytosphingosine, the long chain base found in yeast sphingolipids. 3-Ketosphinganine reductase (Tsc10p) is essential for growth in the absence of exogenous dihydrosphingosine or phytosphingosine.

Sphingolipids are essential components of eukaryotic membranes. They are composed of a polar head attached to a hydrophobic ceramide base. Ceramide contains a fatty acid attached in amide linkage to a long chain base (LCB).1Sphingolipid synthesis begins with the formation of the long chain base dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 1), which requires two enzymes. The first enzyme, serine palmitoyltransferase, catalyzes the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine. This enzyme contains at least two subunits (Lcb1p and Lcb2p) (1Zhao C.

The second enzyme reduces 3-ketosphinganine to dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) which is subsequently hydroxylated on C4 by Sur2p forming phytosphingosine (4Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J.

Aur1p catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoinositol head of phosphatidylinositol to OH-phytoceramide to form inositol- phosphorylceramide (IPC-C) in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Nagiec M.M.

Therefore, the csg1 and csg2 mutants provide a positive selection for sphingolipid synthesis mutants since they are suppressors of the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype. Many of the genes that can mutate to cause suppression are expected to be essential since sphingolipids are required for viability. Thus, a screen for temperature-sensitive suppressors of Ca2+sensitivity was conducted. Suppressing mutations that confer temperature sensitivity are experimentally powerful for several reasons. 1) They provide a restrictive condition that allows the wild-type gene to be cloned by complementation; 2) analysis of sphingolipid synthesis in the mutants after shifting to the restrictive condition may uncover defects that are not apparent at the permissive temperature; 3) suppressors of the temperature sensitivity are expected to identify new genes involved in sphingolipid synthesis; and 4) finally, the suppressor mutant collection is more likely to identify genes in sphingolipid synthesis that are essential. In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of temperature-sensitive mutants that suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg2 mutants and the use of tsc10 mutants to identify the gene that encodes 3-ketosphinganine reductase. The yeast strains used in this study were TDY2037 (Matα lys2 ura3–52 trp1Δ leu2Δ), TDY2038 (Matα lys2 ura3–52 trp1Δ leu2Δ csg2::LEU2), TDY2039 (Mata ade2–101 ura3–52 trp1Δ leu2Δ), TDY2040 (Mataade2–101 ura3–52 trp1Δ leu2Δ csg2::LEU2), and DBY947 (Matα ade2–101 ura3–52). Media were prepared and cells were grown using standard procedures (12Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine were purchased from Sigma and added from a 50 mg/ml stock solution (in ethanol) to autoclaved media containing 0.2% tergitol. Strain LHYa56 (Mataade2–101 ura3–52 trp1Δ leu2Δ csg2::LEU2 tsc10–1) was transformed with a YCp50-based yeast genomic plasmid library (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) selecting for uracil prototrophs. The transformants were replica-plated to YPD and placed at 37 °C, and one transformant had acquired a plasmid that complemented temperature sensitivity. Hybridization studies showed that the complementing genomic fragment resides on ATTC contiguous clone 70147. Subcloning experiments demonstrated that the YBR265W open reading frame was responsible for complementation. Linkage studies confirmed that YBR265W is the ORF that is mutated in the tsc10 mutants. A 3150-base pairSalI fragment extending from a site within YBR263W to a site within YBR266C was cloned into pRS306 (13Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was linearized at the MscI site in YBR265W and integratively transformed into LHYa56 (tsc10–1). The temperature-sensitive phenotype was complemented. Diploids constructed by mating this haploid transformant to a wild-type haploid (DBY 947) were sporulated and dissected. All products of meiosis were temperature-resistant, demonstrating that the YBR265W-carrying plasmid integrated at a site linked to the tsc10–1 locus. The 3150-base pair SalI fragment carrying the YBR265W ORF was cloned into pUC19 and a blunt-ended PCR fragment carrying the TRP1 gene was ligated into the MscI site in codon 252 of YBR265w/TSC10. The disrupting allele, liberated with SalI, was transformed into a diploid (formed by crossing TDY2038 with TDY2040), and tryptophan prototrophs were selected (15Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Sporulation and dissection of the diploid demonstrated that the TSC10 gene is essential for viability. FiftyA 600 units of cells (A 600of 0.5–1.0) were pelleted, washed in water, and resuspended by vortexing in 0.2 ml of 0.5 m NH4OH. LCBs were extracted by a modification of the method of Williams et al. (16Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two ml of CHCl3:MeOH (1:2) and glass beads (0.5 volume) were added, and the cells were vortexed for 1 min and sonicated for 15 min in a Bransonic 42 bath sonicator. The supernatant was removed to a fresh tube, and 1 ml of CHCl3, 2 ml of 0.5m NH4OH, and 0.02 ml of 3 m KCl were added with vortexing after each addition. The bottom layer was washed twice with 2 ml of 30 mm KCl and dried under N2. Extract corresponding to 10 A 600units of cells was spotted on a silica gel TLC plate, which was developed using CHCl3:MeOH:2 mNH4OH (40:10:1) as solvent (17Hung C.-Y. Ko Y.-G. Thompson G.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine and sphingosine standards were purchased from Sigma. The 3-ketosphingosine standard was custom-synthesized by Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). LCBs were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol and heating at 180 °C for 10 min. The long chain base extract (from 10 A 600 units of cells) or the 3-ketosphinganine standard (50 μg) was dried and resuspended in 200 μl of 95% ethanol. NaBH4 (0.2 g) was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Hydrochloric acid (100 μl of 0.1 n) was added followed after 5 min by NH4OH (100 μl of 2 m), and LCBs were re-extracted as described above. Exponentially growing cells (750A 600 units) were harvested and washed in water. The cells were resuspended at 2 g/ml by vortexing in 50 mmTris (7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (TEPM buffer). Glass beads were added to the meniscus, and the cell walls were disrupted by vortexing eight times for 30 s with cooling on ice between vortexing. The homogenate was transferred to a centrifuge tube, and the glass beads were washed with TEPM buffer until the wash was clear. The washes were pooled and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet was resuspended in the TEPM buffer using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 40,000g X for 40 min. This final pellet was resuspended in TEPM + 33% glycerol at a protein concentration of about 12 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mg of protein and 60 μmol of palmitoyl CoA to a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 0.1 m Hepes (8.3), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm serine (10 μCi/ml [3H]serine), 50 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (16Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In some samples, an NADPH-regenerating system was added (2.4 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2–8 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 mm NADPH) to allow reduction of the 3-ketosphinganine intermediate. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of NH4OH to 0.25 m. The LCB was extracted by successively adding 1.5 ml of CHCl3:MeOH (1:2), 30 μg of carrier dihydrosphingosine, 1 ml of CHCl3, 2 ml of 0.5m NH4OH with vortexing after each addition. The sample was centrifuged, and the upper aqueous layer was removed. The lower phase was washed two times with 2 ml of 30 mm KCl. The extracted LCBs were dried and run on a silica gel TLC plate developed with CHCl3:MeOH:2 m NH4OH (40:10:1). TheTSC10 ORF was subcloned into the pBAD/Myc-His B plasmid (Invitrogen) resulting in arabinose-inducible expression of Tsc10p with a Myc and polyhistidine tag at the COOH terminus. A construct having the full-length Tsc10p, as well as one that lacks the COOH-terminal 38 amino acids, was made. The PCR primers used to amplify the Tsc10-containing fragments were 5′-GGCCCCATGGAGTTTACGTTAGAAGACCAAGTTGTG-3′ (the NH2-terminal primer for both fragments), 5′-GGCCTCTAGATTGTTGGCCTTCTTGCCGTCATTTTCAC-3′ (the COOH-terminal primer for the full-length Tsc10p construct), and 5′-GGCCTCTAGATTCGGAACAAAGCGGCTTTTCTTTGCGG-3′ (the COOH-terminal primer for the construct lacking the COOH-terminal 38 amino acids). The PCR-generated fragments were digested withNcoI and XbaI (sites shown in bold on the PCR primers) and ligated into pBAD-Myc-His-B. The underlined ATG in theNcoI site is the start codon, and codon 2 is changed from lysine to glutamate in the recombinant protein. The plasmids were transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The transformed cells were grown in LB + ampicillin to an A 600 of 0.8. Cells were pelleted and resuspended (A 600 of 4) in M10 medium with 0.5% arabinose for 2 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in 4 ml (100A 600/ml) of 50 mm Tris (pH 7), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I. After several cycles of freeze/thaw, the lysed cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm imidazole, and 2 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) was added for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the polyhistidine-tagged protein to bind. The resin was washed with 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), and eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mmsodium phosphate. The purification was followed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were either Coomassie-stained or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. Anti-Myc horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen), which recognize the Myc epitope on the recombinant proteins, were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activity of the recombinant Tsc10 proteins was measured in 50 mm Hepes (6.9), 133 μm NADPH, 0.2% tergitol, 80 μm3-ketosphinganine at 25 °C either by thin layer chromatography analysis to follow the conversion of 3-ketosphinganine to dihydrosphingosine, or by monitoring the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm. Suppressors of the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg2 mutants were isolated by streakingcsg2Δ (null) mutant cells (TDY 2038 and TDY 2040) onto YPD plates containing 20 mm CaCl2 with (the CJY mutant strains) or without (the LHY mutant strains) 80 μmbathocuproine disulfonate at 26 °C. Bathocuproine disulfonate is a copper chelator; it inhibits hydroxylation of IPC-C thereby increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of csg2Δ mutant cells (9Beeler T.J. Fu D. Rivera J. Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Suppressors were tested for ability to grow on YPD plates at 37 °C, a permissive condition for the starting csg2Δstrains. The goal was to obtain mutants in which the same mutation that causes suppression of Ca2+ sensitivity simultaneously confers temperature sensitivity. In a screen of 946 suppressors, 59 were found to have a recessive temperature-sensitive phenotype. Complementation of the mutations was determined by testing the temperature sensitivity of diploids constructed by pair-wise mating of the tsc haploid mutant strains of opposite mating types. As shown in Table I, the 59 mutants fall into 15 complementation groups. These groups are named TSC fortemperature-sensitive suppressors ofcsg2 mutants. With one exception (TSC6), tetrad analysis of members from each complementation group confirmed that the temperature-sensitive and suppressing mutations are genetically linked, indicating that suppression and temperature sensitivity arose from a single mutation (data not shown). In the case of the TSC6 complementation group (which consists of a single representative), the suppressing mutation is in the SCS7 gene (1Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol.

TheTSC10 gene was cloned by complementation of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the LHYa56 (tsc10–1) mutant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complementing gene was found to reside on chromosome II between ORF YBR261c and YBR270c. Subcloning identified the complementing ORF as YBR265w. An integrating plasmid carrying the YBR265w ORF was integratively transformed into the tsc10–1 mutant, which resulted in complementation of the temperature-sensitive phenotype. When this transformant was crossed to a wild-type (TSC10) haploid and the diploids were sporulated and dissected, all products of meiosis were temperature-resistant, indicating that YBR265w is the wild-type TSC10 gene. Comparison of the sequence of Tsc10p with proteins in GenBank identifies Tsc10p as a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase protein family (Fig. 2). This family includes over 60 enzymes found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Although these enzymes display only 15–30% sequence identity, the family is characterized by a YXXXK sequence (X = any amino acid) found in the catalytic site (18Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte J.J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In many cases, a serine lies 13 residues amino-terminal to the conserved tyrosine. These three amino acids are believed to participate in catalysis by facilitating transfer of a proton from tyrosine to the substrate (19Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Tsc10p, the serine is at position 167, and the tyrosine and lysine residues are amino acids 180 and 184. The short chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes also contain a conserved sequence, GXXXGXG (amino acids 14–20 of Tsc10p), which forms a turn between a β-strand and an α-helix that borders the NADPH-binding domain known as the Rossman fold (19Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,20Ghosh D. Wawrzak Z. Weeks C.M. Duax W.L. Erman M. Structure. 1994; 2: 629-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). There is a stretch of 28 non-charged, mostly hydrophobic amino acid residues (280–307) close to the COOH terminus (320), which is not predicted to be part of the catalytic domain (1 to about 250) based on homology to other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (Fig. 2). Perhaps the hydrophobic domain functions to anchor 3-ketosphingosine reductase to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The dilysine motif at position −3 and −4 from the COOH terminus may function to localize Tsc10p to the endoplasmic retention (21Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Since serine palmitoyltransferase deficiency suppresses the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg2Δ mutants, it was believed that a deficiency in the next enzyme in the pathway, 3-ketosphinganine reductase, might also suppress. Tsc10p, a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family of enzymes that reduce ketones to hydroxyl groups, was considered a good candidate for 3-ketosphinganine reductase. Mutants in 3-ketosphinganine reductase are predicted to be rescued by the addition of either dihydrosphingosine or phytosphingosine to the growth medium. Indeed, the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the tsc10 mutants is reversed by exogenous phytosphingosine (Fig. 3) and dihydrosphingosine (data not shown). In contrast, 3-ketosphinganine, which bypasses the requirement for serine palmitoyltransferase (22Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), does not rescue thetsc10 mutants. This is consistent with tsc10mutants having a 3-ketosphinganine reductase deficiency. The genomic TSC10 gene was disrupted and the locus marked with a TRP1 gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The tsc10Δ mutants are inviable in the absence of the plasmid-borne TSC10 gene unless the growth medium contains phytosphingosine or dihydrosphingosine (data not shown and Fig. 3). Normally 3-ketosphinganine does not accumulate to levels that are detectable by ninhydrin staining of lipid extracts analyzed by thin layer chromatography. However, the tsc10 mutant strains accumulate a ninhydrin-reactive lipid that has the same mobility as 3-ketosphinganine (Fig. 4 A). The sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine standards react with ninhydrin to form a purple-colored product typical of the adduct formed with primary amines. In contrast, the 3-ketosphinganine standard and the lipid that accumulates in the tsc10 mutants forms a brown-colored product. 3-Ketosphinganine reacts with sodium borohydride to produce dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 4 A). The ninhydrin-reactive lipid that accumulates in the tsc10mutants is also reduced to a lipid with the same mobility as dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 4 B). 3-Ketosphinganine synthesis is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. Introduction of a temperature-sensitive allele of the TSC1/LCB2 gene into a tsc10 mutant to generate a tsc1tsc10 double mutant blocks accumulation of the ninhydrin-reactive lipid (data not shown). Based upon its mobility on thin layer chromatography, its color after reaction with ninhydrin, its reduction by NaBH4, and its dependence on serine palmitoyltransferase for accumulation, it is concluded that this lipid is 3-ketosphinganine, consistent with Tsc10p encoding 3-ketosphinganine reductase. The activity of 3-ketosphinganine reductase in microsomal membranes isolated from wild-type and tsc10 mutants was compared. Wild-type microsomes contain both serine palmitoyltransferase and 3-ketosphinganine reductase activities (16Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Stoffel W. Sticht G. LeKim D. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1968; 349: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serine palmitoyltransferase catalyzes the formation of [3H]3-ketosphinganine from palmitoyl-CoA and [3H]serine (Fig. 5 A). Microsomes from wild-type and tsc10–1 mutant cells have similar serine palmitoyltransferase activity. In the presence of NADPH and wild-type microsomes, [3H]3-ketosphinganine is reduced to [3H]dihydrosphingosine, which is subsequently hydroxylated to [3H]phytosphingosine (Fig. 5,B and D). In contrast, microsomes prepared from the tsc10–1 mutant cells after a 3-h shift to 37 °C display no 3-ketosphinganine reductase activity (Fig. 5 D). Even microsomes prepared from the tsc10–1 mutant cells maintained at 26 °C display reduced 3-ketosphinganine reductase activity (Fig. 5 B). This experiment demonstrates that Tsc10p is required for 3-ketosphinganine reductase activity. To confirm that Tsc10p catalyzes 3-ketosphinganine reduction, Tsc10p containing a Myc epitope and a His6 domain fused at its COOH terminus was expressed in E. coli under control of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter, isolated using Ni-NTA chromatography, and assayed for reductase activity. Two constructs were made; in one, the Myc and polyhistidine tags followed the last amino acid of the full-length protein. In the other, the carboxyl-terminal 38 amino acids (containing the potential membrane anchoring domain) of Tsc10p were omitted. As shown in Fig. 6, both tagged proteins were partially purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The full-length and the carboxy-truncated purified proteins catalyze a 3-ketosphinganine-dependent oxidation of NADPH to NADP (Fig. 7). NADH does not substitute for NADPH in the reduction. The long chain bases extracted from aliquots of the reaction were analyzed by thin layer chromatography. 3-Ketosphinganine is converted to dihydrosphingosine (Fig. 8 B) in a reaction that depends on the addition of NADPH confirming that the recombinant protein is 3-ketosphinganine reductase. The reaction is stimulated 10-fold by 0.2% tergitol, but in this reaction (Fig. 8) detergents were omitted since they interfere with the long chain base extraction and the separation on thin layer chromatography. These experiments also demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal 38 amino acids are not required for enzymatic activity.Figure 8Recombinant Tsc10p catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-ketosphinganine to dihydrosphingosine. The reaction conditions are similar to those described for Fig. 7 except tergitol was omitted. The reaction was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm (A). At the indicated times (0, 15 min, etc.), 0.5-ml aliquots were removed and long chain base was extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”) along with 3-ketosphinganine (3KS) and dihydrosphingosine (DHS) standards (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutations that decrease the rate of IPC-C synthesis or alter its structure suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg2Δ mutants (1Zhao C.

Since IPC is essential for growth, it was expected that a temperature-sensitive suppressor collection would identify essential genes required for IPC synthesis. This expectation is confirmed by the finding that temperature-sensitive alleles of the serine palmitoyltransferase genes (TSC1 and TSC2) are among the most represented members of the collection. The TSC10 gene was cloned, and its sequence identified it as a member of the short chain reductase/dehydrogenase enzyme family. The results presented in this report demonstrate that Tsc10p is the enzyme that converts 3-ketosphinganine to dihydrosphinganine. Although the enzymes in this family show low sequence identity and varied substrates, their well conserved secondary structures show they possess a single domain comprising the cofactor-binding and active sites. Tsc10p has a stretch of 28 hydrophobic amino acids (residues 280–307) at its carboxyl terminus, which could anchor the protein to the membrane. There are 13 additional amino acids including a KK motif located at position −3 and −4 from the end of the protein. In some cases, dilysine motifs at the carboxyl terminus specify retention of the protein within the endoplasmic reticulum (21Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Tsc10p, which fractionates with the microsomes, is expected to be an endoplasmic reticulum protein since that is the location of IPC synthesis. These amino acids are not required for enzymatic activity. Based on our analysis of the TSC genes, it is expected that several other genes required for sphingolipid synthesis will be identified from the continued study of the temperature-sensitive suppressors. Many of the complementation groups are represented by a single mutant isolate, making it clear that the collection is far from saturated. This work promises to provide new information about the enzymes required for sphingolipid synthesis, regulation of the biosynthetic pathway, and functions of sphingolipids. We thank Michael Seidel (Matreya Lipids and Biochemicals, Pleasant Gap, PA) for the synthesis of the 3-ketosphinganine."

After determining that theArabidopsis alternative oxidase possesses the redox-sensitive sulfhydryl/disulfide system, site-directed mutagenesis of an Arabidopsis cDNA clone was used to individually change the two conserved Cys residues, Cys-128 and Cys-78, to Ala. Using diamide oxidation and chemical cross-linking of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, Cys-78 was shown to be: 1) the Cys residue involved in the sulfhydryl/disulfide system; and 2) not required for subunit dimerization. The C128A mutant was stimulated by pyruvate, while the C78A mutant protein had little activity and displayed no stimulation by pyruvate. Mutating Cys-78 to Glu produced an active enzyme which was insensitive to pyruvate, consistent with α-keto acid activation occurring through a thiohemiacetal. These results indicate that Cys-78 serves as both the regulatory sulfhydryl/disulfide and the site of activation by α-keto acids. In light of these results, the previously observed effects of sulfhydryl reagents on the alternative oxidase of isolated soybean mitochondria were re-examined and were found to be in agreement with a single sulfhydryl residue being the site both of α-keto acid activation and of the regulatory sulfhydryl/disulfide system.

In all plants and many fungi, a cyanide-resistant, alternative respiratory pathway branches from the cytochrome pathway at the ubiquinone pool in mitochondria (1Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Electron flow through this alternative pathway is not coupled to ATP synthesis at two of the three proton translocation sites. In specific thermogenic floral tissues of some plants, a high rate of electron flow through the alternative pathway generates heat and volatilizes compounds that attract insect pollinators (2Meeuse B.J.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 117-126Crossref Google Scholar). In non-thermogenic plant tissues, the alternative pathway may allow continued turnover of carbon skeletons through glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle when the ATP concentration is high and inhibits ATP synthase activity (3Palmer J.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1976; 27: 133-157Crossref Google Scholar) so that the pathway can function as an energy overflow mechanism (4Lambers H. Physiol. Plant. 1982; 55: 478-485Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, because the alternative pathway can be active even when the cytochrome pathway is not saturated (5Wilson S.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Hoefnagel M.H.N. Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Arch. Biochem.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it is likely that the two pathways are regulated in concert to balance ubiquinone pool oxidation/reduction and carbon skeleton turnover in response to cytosolic ATP levels (8Day D.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Siedow J.N. Wiskich J.T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In recent years, a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the post-translational regulation of the alternative oxidase, the terminal oxidase that comprises the alternative respiratory pathway. The alternative oxidase is a homodimeric protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the oxidation/reduction state of an intersubunit disulfide bond has been demonstrated to regulate its activity (10Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Umbach A.L. Wiskich J.T. Siedow J.N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A second mechanism of activation of the alternative oxidase involves α-keto acids, notably pyruvate (12Millar A.H. Wiskich J.T. Whelan J. Day D.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which significantly activate the enzyme when the regulatory sulfhydryl/disulfide is in the reduced state, but have less effect on the oxidized form of the enzyme (11Umbach A.L. Wiskich J.T. Siedow J.N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Vanlerberghe G.C. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Vanlerberghe A.E. McIntosh L.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, use of sulfhydryl reagents showed that the site of α-keto acid action also involves a sulfhydryl residue, probably through the formation of a thiohemiacetal by reaction between the cysteine sulfhydryl and the α-keto acid (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The same study indicated that this sulfhydryl is different from the one involved in disulfide bond formation. Based on homology alignment of amino acid sequences deduced from cDNA sequences, the alternative oxidases of higher plants contain only two conserved Cys residues (9Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 703-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Both occur in the NH2-terminal domain of the protein, which is believed to be located within the mitochondrial matrix before the first putative membrane-spanning helix. These conserved Cys residues are the likely candidates for formation of the intersubunit disulfide bond and the site of α-keto acid activation, and correspond to Cys-78 and Cys-128 in the deduced sequence of the Arabidopsis thalianaalternative oxidase used in this study. Based on assumptions about the enzyme's structure, it was predicted that the more NH2-terminal Cys-78, which may be exposed to the mitochondrial matrix, was involved in the sulfhydryl/disulfide system, and Cys-128, which may lie closer to the postulated catalytic site near the membrane, was the site of α-keto acid action (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli cells, and subsequent cross-linking and activity assays to determine that the cysteine residues involved in regulatory disulfide bond formation and α-keto acid stimulation are identical. Restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase were from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and all other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. AnArabidopsis alternative oxidase cDNA clone in the vector pcDNAII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), designated pAOX (16Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was used to make changes in specific codons of the alternative oxidase gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of this clone corresponds to that of AOX1a, a member of the alternative oxidase gene family described by Saishoet al. (17Saisho D. Nambara E. Naito S. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Nakazono M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The Sculptor Mutagenesis Kit (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) was used to create two mutations. Sequences of the primers used to change the codons for Cys-78 or Cys-128 to codons for Ala were 5′-CCCATGGCCTAAAAGCGTTCCACTTCCATTCAGAACC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCATCATAGCTCGAGCTCCATATCTCCTCTGG-3′, respectively. The plasmids containing these changes were designated pAtAO-C78A and pAtAO-C128A, and the proteins expressed from these plasmids were designated AO-C78A and AO-C128A, respectively. DNA sequence analysis was performed using fluorescent dye-labeled nucleotides (PRISMTM Ready Reaction Dye DeoxyTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit; Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA) and an automated sequencer (ABI Model 373A DNA Sequencer; ABI, Columbia, MD) as described by the manufacturer. An additional mutation was created in the ArabidopsiscDNA clone to change the codon for Cys-78 to the codon for Glu using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The following primers were used: 5′-GGTTCTGAATGGAAGTGGAACGAATTCAGGCCATGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCATGGCCTGAATTCGTTCCACTTCCATTCAGAACC-3′ (forward and reverse primers, respectively). The mutated plasmid was designated pAtAO-C78E, and the expressed protein, AO-C78E. DNA sequencing to confirm the presence of the mutation and absence of nonspecific mutations was done by the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility using the PRISMTM/ABI system. Wild-type and mutated forms of the alternative oxidase were expressed from the pcDNAII constructs described above in either DH5α E. coli cells for cross-linking experiments, or in SASX41B cells for alternative oxidase activity measurements. Protein expression by DH5α cells was induced following a procedure based on that of Kumar and Söll (16Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A colony from a freshly streaked plate was used to inoculate 3 ml of M9 medium (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and the culture was grown overnight in a 37 °C shaker. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of M9 medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and this was also grown overnight in a 37 °C shaker. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in about 1 ml of the supernatant. This suspension was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB medium in a 250-ml flask containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2 mm cyanide. Alternatively, 2 mm azide, instead of cyanide, was added to the cultures, including the empty vector controls. These cultures were grown for 16 h in a 37 °C shaker. Spheroplasts were prepared as described previously (19Rhoads D.M. Kaspi C.I. Levings III, C.S. Siedow J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta Bioenerg. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cell membranes were prepared for alternative oxidase activity assays using a French Press. Cells were pelleted from the medium in which they had grown and were resuspended and washed in PBS1 (137 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4). The cells were washed a second time in PBS to which 5 mm DTT and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride had been freshly added. DTT was included to keep the alternative oxidase protein in the reduced state throughout membrane isolation. The pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of PBS/DTT/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. This suspension was passed once through a French pressure cell at 18,000 psi. The lysed cell mixture was spun at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to pellet intact cells. Cell membranes were isolated from the supernatant by spinning at 100,000 ×g for 1.5 h. The final pellet was resuspended in PBS with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. All operations took place at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined as described in Larsonet al. (22Larson E. Howlett B. Jagendorf A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated and purified using a Percoll gradient according to Umbach and Siedow (10Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For Arabidopsis (A. thaliana (L.) Heyn., ecotype Columbia) mitochondria, rosette leaves were harvested from 4-week-old plants grown at 22 °C, 16 h light. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv FFR 583) mitochondria were isolated from 11- or 12-day-old expanding cotyledons of seedlings grown in a greenhouse. Oxygen consumption by isolated E. coli membranes was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode in 2 ml of a buffer consisting of 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm KPi, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. Respiratory chain activity was initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADH. For α-keto acid stimulation of the expressed plant alternative oxidase, 5 mm pyruvate was used. The enzyme was inhibited with 1.5 mm SHAM added from a fresh 1.0 m stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. No KCN-sensitive bacterial oxidase activity was detectable in the SASX41B cell membranes. Alternative oxidase activity of isolated soybean mitochondria was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode in 2 ml of a buffer consisting of 10 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3m mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Additions made during the assays were (final concentration): 0.5 mm duroquinol, 6 μmmyxothiazol, 5 mm pyruvate, iodoacetate, or NEM, and 2 mm SHAM. Sulfhydryl reagents were added from concentrated stocks prepared fresh on the day of the experiment. Disulfide bond formation was induced by adding diamide at a final concentration of 5 mm to 0.5 ml of sonicated DH5α E. colispheroplasts at a protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in PBS, then mixing at room temperature for 30 min on a nutator mixer (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA). The reaction was quenched by the addition of excess cysteine. Cross-linking with EGS (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was the same except that the final EGS concentration was 1 mm and quenching was with excess glycine. For cross-linked E. colisamples, spheroplasts at 1.0 mg of protein/ml were solubilized by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) without (diamide-treated samples only) or with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. ForArabidopsis and soybean mitochondrial samples, 10–17% gradient gels were used and samples were prepared with or without 100 mm DTT as reductant in the sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed using a monoclonal antibody, AOA, raised against the alternative oxidase of Sauromatum guttatum Schott (24Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and alternative oxidase protein bands were detected using a chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Wild-type and mutant alternative oxidase protein expression by the SASX41B cells varied both within and between experiments. To normalize enzyme activity data to account for this variability, densitometry (10Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was performed on immunoblots from gels run using cell membrane samples of equal total protein amounts in sample buffer containing DTT. The presence of reductant in the sample buffer promoted uniform reactivity of the antibody with the protein (see below). The highest density sample was given the arbitrary density unit of 1.0 alternative oxidase density unit/mg of membrane protein, with other densities assigned fractional units. These density units, averaging 0.64/mg of protein, were used to adjust the original data (nanomole of O2/min/mg of protein) to nanomole of O2/min/AO density unit. The alternative oxidase of Arabidopsis was present in isolated leaf mitochondria predominantly in the oxidized state (i.e. as disulfide-linked dimers; Fig. 1,lane 1) with no significant increase in disulfide-linked dimers seen after treatment of isolated mitochondria with the oxidant, diamide (Fig. 1, lane 2). Treatment of isolated mitochondria with the reductant DTT resulted in a nearly complete loss of disulfide-linked dimer, concomitant with an increase in the amount of protein in the reduced state (i.e. seen as monomers on SDS-PAGE gels; Fig. 1, lane 3). (Note that the reduced form is less visible in gel samples lacking sample buffer reductant, but is readily visible when sample buffer reductant is present.) The resulting reduced alternative oxidase protein could be reoxidized by subsequent treatment with diamide (Fig. 1, lane 4). Preparation of any of these samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing reductant resulted in only the reduced form of the alternative oxidase protein being present (Fig. 1, lanes 5–8). Thus, the Arabidopsis alternative oxidase protein displayed the reversible intersubunit disulfide bond observed for the alternative oxidase in mitochondria isolated from other plant species (10Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Vanlerberghe G.C. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Vanlerberghe A.E. McIntosh L.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), making the Arabidopsis gene a good candidate for site-directed mutagenesis to determine the cysteine residue involved. Although there are at least four copies of the alternative oxidase gene in Arabidopsis (17Saisho D. Nambara E. Naito S. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Nakazono M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the protein isozyme produced in leaf mitochondria probably corresponds to the product of the cDNA clone of Kumar and Söll (16Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) used in these mutagenesis studies. The mRNA of AOX1a, identified by Saisho et al. (17Saisho D. Nambara E. Naito S. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Nakazono M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) through sequence comparison as corresponding to the clone isolated by Kumar and Söll, is abundant in leaf tissue, whereas mRNAs of the other alternative oxidase genes are present only at very low levels in leaf tissue (17Saisho D. Nambara E. Naito S. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Nakazono M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The yield of mitochondria from the leaves was insufficient for convincing activity assays, so α-keto acid stimulation of theArabidopsis alternative oxidase activity in organello could not be unambiguously confirmed. However, α-keto acid stimulation of the bacterial expressed enzyme was observed, as reported below. Growth of DH5αE. coli cells containing the wild-type alternative oxidase in the presence of KCN or azide resulted in the expression of functional alternative oxidase protein, as shown previously by Kumar and Söll (16Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used this heterologous system to study mutated forms of the alternative oxidase expressed from theArabidopsis cDNA clone. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to individually change the codons for Cys-78 and Cys-128 to Ala codons. Sequencing verified that the desired mutations were the only mutations in the Arabidopsis alternative oxidase cDNA clones (data not shown). When membranes from E. coli cells expressing the wild-type alternative oxidase, the alternative oxidase with Cys-78 changed to Ala (AO-C78A), or the alternative oxidase with Cys-128 changed to Ala (AO-C128A) were treated with diamide, both the wild-type and AO-C128A proteins formed disulfide-linked dimers (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2), which could be reduced if the samples were prepared in gel sample buffer containing reductant (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). However, no intersubunit disulfide bond was formed by AO-C78A (Fig. 2, lane 3), suggesting Cys-78 is the cysteine involved in forming the disulfide bond. Cross-linking with the Lys-Lys-specific cross-linker EGS showed that AO-C78A formed dimers (Fig. 2, lane 6), as did AO-C128A (Fig. 2, lane 5) and the wild-type protein (Fig. 2,lane 4). These results indicate that dimerization of the alternative oxidase is not dependent on the presence of the disulfide bond-forming Cys-78. Alternative oxidase activity assays of SASX41B E. coli membranes were used to assess the effect of the Cys mutations on the ability of the expressed alternative oxidase to be stimulated by α-keto acids. SASX41B cells were used for these experiments because alternative oxidase expression was found to occur at reliably higher levels in these cells under inductive conditions than in the DH5α cells. Alternative oxidase protein expression levels were quantified from immunoblots by densitometry (10Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and were used to normalize the measured activities to the amount of immunoreactive protein present as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expressed wild-type alternative oxidase from Arabidopsisdisplayed typical α-keto acid stimulation with pyruvate such that activity was very low unless pyruvate was present (Fig. 3). This observation has also been made recently by Berthold (21Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the SASX41B expression system. Mutation of Cys-128, predicted to be the site of α-keto acid action (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), to Ala had no effect on the ability of the enzyme to be stimulated by pyruvate (Fig. 3). This mutation, however, caused a pronounced overall increase in activity, relative to wild-type, whether or not pyruvate was present (Fig. 3). Conversely, the alternative oxidase in which Cys-78 was mutated to Ala was only minimally active and showed no response to added pyruvate (Fig. 3), suggesting that the site of action of α-keto acids is likely at this Cys. Similar results have recently been obtained with tobacco alternative oxidase (27Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Yip J.Y.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The possibility existed that the lack of pyruvate stimulation in the mutant AO-C78A was symptomatic of a general decrease in enzyme activity, rather than loss of the α-keto acid-binding site. To test this, an additional mutant was constructed in which Cys-78 was changed to a Glu residue, positioning a Glu carboxylate within one methylene of the carboxylate moiety formed by the proposed thiohemiacetal (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as diagrammed below (R = CH3 for pyruvate): Thiohemiacetal:H­∣C∣­CH2­S­R∣C∣OH­CO2− Glutamate:H­∣C∣­CH2­CH2­CO2−(Eq. 1) If the carboxyl group of the thiohemiacetal is the activating moiety, the Glu mutation might display significant activity. The resulting mutant protein, AO-C78E, had substantial activity, relative to AO-C78A, equaling 58% of wild-type activity in the presence of pyruvate. Furthermore, AO-C78E displayed no pyruvate sensitivity (Fig. 3), suggesting that the Glu side chain was able to substitute for the thiohemiacetal. As with AO-C78A, the AO-C78E dimer was cross-linked by EGS, but was not oxidized by diamide (data not shown). Because the modifications to Cys-78 affected both disulfide bond formation and the activation by an α-keto acid, the most parsimonious interpretation is that both regulatory features are located at this Cys residue. The results of experiments using isolated soybean mitochondria and iodoacetate, a sulfhydryl reagent that mimics the action of pyruvate, originally indicated that the site of α-keto acid action was a sulfhydryl group distinct from the residue involved in intersubunit disulfide bond formation (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached largely on the apparent ability of iodoacetate to bind to the alternative oxidase site of α-keto acid activation even when the enzyme was in the oxidized state and the constituent bond sulfhydryls were not available to react with iodoacetate. Clearly, the results of the site-directed mutagenesis studies reported above are at odds with these experimental results. To reconcile these data, additional experiments with soybean mitochondria were done. A major assumption in the earlier experiments (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was that iodoacetate would be washed from the mitochondria between experimental treatments, and that any residual iodoacetate remaining would be inactivated by the subsequent addition of DTT. To test this assumption, soybean mitochondria were first treated with 3 mm diamide to oxidize the alternative oxidase disulfide bond and then treated with either 5 mm pyruvate or iodoacetate under assay conditions, replicating the previous study (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the mitochondria were washed twice, then treated on ice with 20 mm DTT for 1 h to reduce the alternative oxidase disulfide bond, and washed again. Finally, the mitochondria were re-treated with 3 mmdiamide for 30 min. Samples for SDS-PAGE were taken at each of these steps (Fig. 4 A). The alternative oxidase was nearly completely oxidized at the beginning of the experiments (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 4), making Cys-78 inaccessible to iodoacetate. After pyruvate or iodoacetate addition, DTT treatment reduced the alternative oxidase disulfide bond (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Subsequent addition of diamide caused a reoxidation of the alternative oxidase that had been exposed to pyruvate (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). This reoxidation was possible both because pyruvate had probably been washed from the mitochondria and because, if pyruvate were associated with Cys-78, the thiohemiacetal is readily reversed by reactions such as diamide-driven oxidation. However, reoxidation did not occur with the alternative oxidase that had been initially exposed to iodoacetate (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). Therefore, iodoacetate did not wash out of the mitochondria before DTT treatment. Instead, it was present and apparently was able to react with the disulfide bond sulfurs (Cys-78) as they were reduced to their component sulfhydryls by DTT treatment. As an alternative method of testing the involvement of Cys-78 in α-keto acid stimulation, the ability of diamide treatment to protect the alternative oxidase from NEM inactivation was determined. NEM, another sulfhydryl reagent, inhibits the alternative oxidase and its site of action was shown to be the same as that of pyruvate and iodoacetate (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DTT- or diamide-treated mitochondria were exposed to 5 mm NEM under assay conditions. NEM had an inhibitory effect on alternative oxidase activity in both types of treated mitochondria (Fig. 5). The mitochondria were removed from the assay cuvette, spun down, and washed. Then, both types of mitochondria were re-assayed for alternative oxidase activity. As Fig. 5 B shows, 5 mm DTT addition to the assay allowed recovery of activity and pyruvate stimulation by the diamide-treated mitochondria. However, DTT addition had no such effect on activity of the DTT-treated mitochondria (Fig. 5 A). Thus, NEM must have bound to Cys-78 of the DTT-treated alternative oxidase and caused inactivation of the enzyme in the initial step of the experimental series. Conversely, the oxidized Cys-78 of the diamide-treated mitochondria was protected and the enzyme activity was regained upon reduction by DTT of the disulfide bond to the constituent sulfhydryls. As shown above, Cys-128 is not involved in disulfide bond formation and, therefore, in either DTT- or diamide-treated mitochondria would be free to bind NEM. If this did happen, it had little effect on final enzyme activity (Fig. 5 B, after washing, +Pyr). Thus, the sites of NEM inhibition and α-keto acid stimulation both appear to be associated with the same sulfhydryl, Cys-78. The activity of all plant alternative oxidases investigated so far can be regulated by a redox-sensitive intersubunit sulfhydryl/disulfide system (10Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Umbach A.L. Wiskich J.T. Siedow J.N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Vanlerberghe G.C. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Vanlerberghe A.E. McIntosh L.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here we show the alternative oxidase of A. thaliana leaf mitochondria also forms homodimers that can be linked by a disulfide bond, making the Arabidopsisalternative oxidase gene a reasonable candidate for site-directed mutagenesis to determine which residues are involved in formation of the disulfide bond. Using the heterologous bacterial expression system first demonstrated by Kumar and Söll (16Kumar A.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we determined the effects of changing the two conserved Cys residues of the plant alternative oxidase on the ability of the mutated proteins to form the intersubunit disulfide bond. The disulfide linkage between alternative oxidase monomers was abolished in the mutant AO-C78A but not in the mutant AO-C128A (Fig. 2), indicating the more NH2-terminal of the two conserved cysteine residues, Cys-78 (Fig. 6), is involved in the sulfhydryl/disulfide redox regulatory system of the alternative oxidase. This cysteine was originally predicted to be the disulfide bond site based on its potential exposure to the mitochondrial matrix where it could interact with the naturally occurring sulfhydryl reductant, thioredoxin (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, for the tobacco alternative oxidase, the more NH2-terminal homologous Cys residue has recently been shown to be involved in disulfide bond formation (27Vanlerberghe G.C. McIntosh L. Yip J.Y.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One exception to the conservation of Cys-78 is now known. In one of a pair of tandem-arranged alternative oxidase genes of rice, the residue corresponding to Cys-78 is a Ser (28Ito Y. Saisho D. Nakazono M. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is not yet known if this is a pseudogene, or if a functional protein is produced which is free of redox control (28Ito Y. Saisho D. Nakazono M. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although mutation of Cys-78 abolished disulfide bond formation, it did not disrupt the homodimeric association of the protein (Fig. 2), indicating that other features of the protein are involved in the protein-protein interaction. It may be that while Cys-78 itself is not necessary for dimerization, the protein domain surrounding it is, but this requires further investigation. The bacterial expression system allowed us to demonstrate α-keto acid stimulation of the wild-type Arabidopsis alternative oxidase, a result technically difficult to obtain withArabidopsis mitochondria, and to examine the effects of Cys mutations on this stimulation. Our previous work showed that α-keto acids act at a sulfhydryl group, most likely through formation of a thiohemiacetal (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, contrary to our earlier conclusion, Cys-78, not Cys-128, is the site of α-keto acid action (Fig. 3). When Cys-78 was replaced by the carboxylate-bearing Glu, enzyme activity approached that of wild-type in the presence of pyruvate, and pyruvate stimulation was abolished (Fig. 3). The change of Cys-78 to a Glu residue was designed to approximate the adduct generated following thiohemiacetal formation between the cysteine sulfhydryl and an α-keto acid. However, the Glu side chain does not exactly match the structural properties of a thiohemiacetal. Glu is one methylene shorter than the thiohemiacetal formed by reaction between the cysteine residue and an α-keto acid. In contrast, the adduct formed by the reaction of iodoacetate with a sulfhydryl is equal in length to the thiohemiacetal. Iodoacetate treatment stimulates alternative oxidase activity to levels close to those achieved with pyruvate (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the shorter side chain of Glu might account for the lower level of activity, relative to wild-type plus pyruvate, exhibited by the C78E mutant. Another possibility exists, where Cys-78 is not the exact site of α-keto acid interaction with the protein, but has spatial proximity to it. If this were the case, then the C78E mutation would not be expected to recover enzyme activity to wild-type plus pyruvate levels. However, the simplest interpretation of the mutant protein results is that Cys-78 and the site of α-keto acid activation are one and the same. Consequently, the C78E mutation created an active alternative oxidase which is no longer subject to control by redox regulation or α-keto acid levels. The elevated activity of AO-C128A was unexpected. The predicted position of Cys-128 is at the base of the first membrane spanning helix of the alternative oxidase. This helix may contribute residues to the enzyme's postulated quinone-binding site (29Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If so, a mutation at Cys-128 could conceivably affect quinone binding and hence activity, but whether or not this is the basis of the greater activity of AO-C128A remains to be shown. The earlier conclusion that the Cys involved in α-keto acid activation was different from the Cys involved in the sulfhydryl/disulfide system was based on experiments using soybean mitochondria and iodoacetate, a sulfhydryl reagent which can act as an α-keto acid mimic (15Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In these previous experiments, even when the alternative oxidase protein was fully oxidized, iodoacetate appeared able to bind to the α-keto acid site, so that when the protein was subsequently reduced, it was fully activated without the addition of pyruvate. To the contrary, the results presented here demonstrate that iodoacetate remained present throughout the experimental protocol, not having been completely washed out of the mitochondria, and was able to react during DTT treatment to activate the alternative oxidase (Fig. 4 B). Also reported in this article is the observation that diamide treatment (oxidation) protects the activity of the alternative oxidase of soybean mitochondria from inhibition by NEM, whereas the activity of the reduced form of alternative oxidase is highly susceptible to NEM (Fig. 5). Thus, NEM inhibition apparently derives from its binding to the redox-regulatory Cys, Cys-78. NEM could bind at a different site that is sterically inaccessible in the oxidized form of the enzyme, but this more complex scenario is unnecessary to explain the other results of this study. Use of the sulfhydryl reagents with the mutant forms of alternative oxidase would supply a more complete picture of these interactions. For instance, NEM should not be able to inhibit AO-C78E activity. However, that reagent strongly inhibits NADH oxidation by theE. coli membranes, precluding these experiments. Part of the rationale for the earlier proposal that Cys-128 is the site of pyruvate action was the supposed proximity of this residue to the postulated active site of the enzyme (Fig. 6). As the structure of the alternative oxidase is currently conceptualized, Cys-78, now shown to be the site of α-keto acid activation, appears to be farther from the postulated active site, compared with Cys-128 (Fig. 6). In this context, it is interesting to note that a mutation influencing alternative oxidase sensitivity to its inhibitor SHAM, and therefore presumably the enzyme's quinol-binding site, has been recently identified in the extreme COOH terminus of the enzyme (21Berthold D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 1998; 1364: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A question still to be answered is how thiohemiacetal formation exerts such a profound effect on alternative oxidase activity, the answer to which should lead to further insights regarding the structure of this enzyme.

Madan Kumar and Dieter Söll for the gift of the Arabidopsis alternative oxidase clone, pAOX, Deborah Berthold for the SASX41B cells and advice regarding their growth, and Tom Elthon for the AOA antibody.

In addition, in oligomeric membrane proteins, subunit assembly essentially contributes to the structural maturation as well as to a fine control of the protein's function (for a review, see Ref. 3Geering K. von Heijne Membrane Protein Assembly. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 173-182Google Scholar). Still, little is known of the molecular determinants in oligomeric proteins that are involved in subunit assembly and of the particular structural and/or functional importance of different interaction sites. In this study, we have addressed these questions for the oligomeric Na,K-ATPase. Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous plasma membrane enzyme that is responsible for the K+ and Na+ homeostasis of animal cells (for a review, see Ref. 4Horisberger J.-D The Na,K-ATPase: Structure-Function Relationship. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-130Google Scholar). The functionally active enzyme is a heterodimeric protein that transports K+ and Na+ against their electrochemical gradients by using the energy of the hydrolysis of ATP. The catalytic α-subunit is a polytopic membrane protein with 10 transmembrane segments that contains the binding sites for the cations, for ATP and phosphate, and for drugs such as cardiac glycosides. The β-subunit is a type II membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic N terminus, one transmembrane segment, and an ectodomain that carries three disulfide bridges and several sugar chains. The β-subunit plays an essential role in the maturation of the catalytic α-subunit. Synthesized alone, the α-subunit is rapidly degraded in or close to the ER, and only assembly with β-subunits permits a structural maturation of the α-subunit, which protects it from cellular degradation and renders it functionally active (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition to this important structural function, the β-subunit also influences the transport properties of mature Na,K-pumps expressed at the cell surface. Several studies have reported that the β-subunit is involved in the apparent K+affinity of Na,K-ATPase (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J.

Experimental evidence suggests that the β-subunit interacts with the α-subunit at multiple sites, which are located in the ectodomain, the transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic domain. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, it was shown that in the ectodomain, the extracytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segment M7 and M8 of the α-subunit interacts with a β domain located within 63 amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane segment (13Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Another putative interaction site is located in the 10 most C-terminal amino acids of the β-subunit (14Beggah A.T. Béguin P. Jaunin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14117-14124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies suggest that the two subunits interact in the membrane domain, with the β intramembrane helix being in contact with portions of the M8–M10 membrane domain of the α-subunit (15Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Finally, proteolysis protection assays suggest that the cytoplasmic N terminus of the β-subunit interacts with the α-subunit (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The functional roles of the various interactions have not yet been clearly defined. Experimental evidence indicates that β assembly with the extracytoplasmic M7/M8 loop favors the correct packing of the C-terminal membrane domain and in consequence influences the stability of the α-subunit against cellular degradation (16Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24921-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other data also suggest that interaction of the transmembrane domain of the β-subunit may be important for efficient and stable assembly with the α-subunit (8Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10309-10316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) interactions of the β-subunit were proposed to play a role in the K+ binding process of the enzyme. We have previously shown that truncation of the cytoplasmic N terminus of the β-subunit does not influence the stabilization of the α-subunit but significantly reduces the apparent affinity for K+ of the Na,K-ATPase (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This result suggested an implication of cytoplasmic α-β interactions in the control of K+ binding. In this study, we intended to further characterize the functional role of the β N terminus and to identify the functionally relevant molecular determinants. We show that β N-terminal truncation not only influences the apparent affinity for K+ but also that of Na+ of the enzyme. However, our mutational analysis suggests that the β N terminus is not involved in K+ and Na+ binding through direct interaction with the α-subunit but rather by the effect of this domain on the correct folding of the whole β-subunit. Together with results obtained concerning the functional properties of chimeric Na,K-/H,K-ATPase β-subunits, our data indicate that neither the cytoplasmic nor the transmembrane domain but rather the ectodomain of the β-subunit is involved in the β-subunit's effects on the functional properties of Na,K-ATPase. Truncation and deletion and point mutants were prepared using a Xenopus Na,K-ATPase β (βNK) cDNA contained in a pSD5 vector (pSD5βNK) by the PCR method described by Nelson and Long (17Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mutants t34, t26, t29, and t32 (for description of mutants, see Fig. 1) were prepared as described previously (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The sense oligonucleotides for the preparation of the t26 (GTACCATGGGCAGAACAGGT), the t29 (GTACCATGGGTGGTAGCTGG), and the t32 mutant (GTACCATGGCCTGGTTTAAAA) contained a NcoI restriction site covering the sequence coding for the initiator methionine, which permitted us to subclone the mutant cDNA into a NcoI site-containing wild type pSD5βNK vector with NcoI and BamHI. For the preparation of multiple point mutants, fragments of pSD5βNK were first amplified by PCR using an antisense oligonucleotide consisting of nucleotides 628–648 tailed by primer D of Nelson and Long (17Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and sense oligonucleotides containing the mutated sequences replacing amino acids 26–34. The amplified mutated DNA fragments were then used as primers to elongate the inverse DNA strand and finally were amplified using a sense oligonucleotide encoding part of the pSD5 vector and primer D of Nelson and Long (17Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mutated DNA fragments were then introduced into wild type pSD5βNK using NheI and HpaI restriction sites and served as templates for mutants replacing amino acids 3–5, 9–12, or 21–24. For mutants in which four alanine (t26/G31A(4)), valine (t26/G31V(4)), aspartate (t26/G31D(4)), or arginine (t26/G31R(4)) residues replaced amino acids 31–34, t26 cDNA was used as a template. The sense oligonucleotide contained part of the noncoding sequence, the ATG coding for the first methionine, the sequences coding for amino acids Gly27–Gly30, and sequences coding for four alanine, valine, aspartate, or arginine residues followed by the sequence coding for Lys35–Leu40 of the βNK. The same antisense oligonucleotide was used as described above for the preparation of multiple point mutants. t26/G31A(4) and t26/G31V(4) cDNAs were used as templates for the preparation of mutants in which eight alanine or valine residues, respectively, replaced amino acids 27–34. Chimera NK TM/HK (see Fig. 1), in which the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains derive from Xenopus Na,K-ATPase β1-subunits (βNK) and the ectodomain from rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase subunits (βHK) and HK TM/NK with the inverse orientation were prepared as described previously (8Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For construction of the chimera NKcyt/HK, containing the cytoplasmic domain of βNK and the transmembrane and the ectodomain of βHK, a fragment encoding all 35 amino acid residues of the βNK N terminus was amplified using a sense oligonucleotide encoding part of the pSD5 vector and an antisense oligonucleotide containing nucleotides coding for amino acid residues Gly31–Lys35 of βNK and Ile40–Val45 of βHK. Another fragment encoding the sequence of the transmembrane domain of βHK was also amplified using an antisense oligonucleotide encompassing nucleotides 423–440 (Pro125–Phe130) of βHK and a sense oligonucleotide encoding Gly31–Lys35 of βNK and Ile40–Val45 of βHK. The two amplified fragments were then joined by recombinant PCR. NheI and AflII restriction sites were used to subclone the β chimera into pSD5βHK. For construction of the chimera HKcyt/NK, containing the cytoplasmic domain of the βHK and the transmembrane and ectodomain of the βNK, one fragment encoded the first 38 amino acid residues of βHK and was PCR-amplified using a sense oligonucleotide encoding part of the pSD5 vector and an antisense oligonucleotide encoding Leu34–Val38 of βHK and Lys35–Phe39 of βNK. Using pSD5βNK as a template, another fragment encoding the transmembrane domain of βNK was also amplified using an antisense oligonucleotide encompassing nucleotides 628–648 (Glu154–Ser160) of βNK and a sense oligonucleotide Leu34–Val38 of βHK and Lys35–Phe39 of βNK. The two amplified fragments were then joined by recombinant PCR.NheI and HpaI restriction sites were used to subclone the β chimera into pSD5βNK. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxysequencing. cRNAs coding for Bufo α1 Na,K-ATPase (6Jaisser F. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Oocytes were obtained from Xenopusfemales (Noerdhoek, Republic of South Africa) as described (22Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Häuptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, 7 ng of α and/or 0.2–1 ng of β cRNA were injected into oocytes. Oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytic) for 24 h and then subjected to a chase period of 48 h in the presence of 10 mm cold methionine. Microsomes were prepared as described (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the α- and β-subunits of Na,K-ATPase and the β-subunit of H,K-ATPase were immunoprecipitated under denaturing or nondenaturing conditions as described (8Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with a Xenopus β antibody (23Ackermann U. Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or a Bufo α1-subunit (24Girardet M. Geering K. Frantes J.M. Geser D. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.-P Bron C. Biochem. J. 1981; 20: 6684-6691Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The dissociated immune complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Quantification of immunoprecipitated bands was performed with a laser densitometer (LKB Ultrascan 2202). Na,K-pump activity was measured as the K+-induced outward current using the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described earlier (11Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Current measurements were performed 3 days after injection of oocytes withBufo α cRNA together with different β cRNAs. To determine the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-pumps, oocytes were loaded with Na+ in a K+-free solution containing of 200 nm ouabain, a concentration that inhibits the endogenous Na,K-pumps but not the ouabain-resistant exogenousBufo Na,K-pumps (25Wang X. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The kinetics of Na,K-pump current activation by K+ was determined in a Na+-containing solution (80 mm sodium gluconate, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 10 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-HEPES, 5 mm BaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4) or in a Na+-free solution (sodium gluconate was replaced by 140 mm sucrose). The current induced by increasing concentrations of K+ (with Na+: 0.3, 1.0, 3.3, and 10 mm K+; without Na+: 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 mmK+) was measured at −50 mV. To determine the kinetic parameters (maximal current (I maxK) and half-activation constant (K½K), the Hill equation was fitted to the data of the current (I) induced by various K+ concentrations ([K]) using a least square method. I=ImaxK/(1+(K1/2K/[K])nH)(Eq. 1) According to previously published data (11Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the Hill coefficient (n H) was set to a value of 1.6 for experiments in the presence of external Na+ and 1.0 for experiments in the absence of external Na+. Measurements of the half-activation constant for internal Na+ were performed by a recently developed method. 2P. Béguin, X. Wang, K. Geering, and J.-H. Horisberger, manuscript in preparation. The principle of this method is to co-express the amiloride-sensitive Na+channel with the Na,K-pump and to use the induced amiloride-sensitive conductance, first, to repeatedly measure the Na+concentration ([Na]i) by means of the reversal potential of the amiloride-sensitive current and, second, to load the oocyte progressively with Na+ by a controlled exposure to a Na+-rich extracellular medium in the absence of amiloride. In brief, in addition to Na,K-ATPase α and β cRNA, oocytes were also injected with cRNAs coding for α-, β-, and γ-subunits (0.3 ng/subunit/oocyte) of the rat renal epithelial Na+ channel (26Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were incubated for 3 days in a modified Barth's solution containing 10 mm Na+. During the night before the measurements, the oocytes were incubated in a Na+-free solution (50 mm NMDG-Cl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NMDG-Hepes, pH 7.4) in order to maximally reduce the internal Na+concentration. 5–8 pairs of measurements of [Na]i and of the Na,K-pump K+-activated current were performed successively on each oocyte. Between each pair of measurements, the oocytes were allowed to increase their intracellular Na+ concentration by exposure to a 100 mm Na+ solution (100 mmsodium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4) in the absence of amiloride and at a holding potential of −50 to −100 mV. Intracellular sodium concentrations were calculated from the reversal potential of the amiloride-sensitive current obtained from a pair of I-V curves recorded with and without amiloride in a solution containing 5 mm Na+ (5 mm sodium gluconate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmBaCl, 95 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mm NMDG-Hepes, pH 7.4). The Na,K-pump K+-activated current was measured in the Na+-free solution by the addition of increasing concentrations of external K+ (see above) in the presence of 20 μm amiloride. From each oocyte, we obtained a series of 5–8 quasisimultaneous measurements of [Na]i and of the maximal K+-activated Na,K-pump current. [Na]i was between 1 and 5 mm for the first measurement and increased progressively to above 50 mm for the last measurements. To avoid errors due to a small signal:noise ratio, only oocytes with a maximal Na,K-pump current of at least 200 nA and for which a final [Na]i of at least 50 mm was reached were analyzed. Then the kinetic parameters of the Na,K-pump activation by internal Na+ were determined by fitting the Hill equation to the measured I maxK and [Na]i values. ImaxK=ImaxNa/(1+(K1/2Na/[Na]i)nH)(Eq. 2) Parameter fitting was first performed with the Hill coefficient (n H) as a parameter to fit, yielding values of n H close to 3. Thereafter, the fitting procedure was repeated using fixed n H values of 2, 2.5, 3, and 4. The I maxNa and K 1/2Na values obtained with these differentn H values were slightly different, but the same amplitude of difference between experimental groups was observed with all n H values. The values reported are those obtained with a fixed value of 3 for n H. cRNA injected oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's medium for 3 days before preparation of microsomes as described (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and resuspended in a medium containing 30 mm dl-histidine/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, and 200 mm sucrose. Aliquots of 5 μg of protein were first incubated for 25 min at 19 °C with 0.15 μg of SDS/μg of protein before the addition (total volume, 500 μl) of a solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4, and varying concentrations (1–50 nm) of [21,22-3H]ouabain (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 90 min incubation at 37 °C, 450-μl aliquots were rapidly filtered under vacuum on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C). Filters were rinsed three times with 4 ml of an ice-cold buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 30 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4, and counted by liquid scintillation counting (Packard model 2250CA) after the addition of 4 ml of Emulsifier Scintillator Plus scintillation liquid (Packard). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of cold ouabain and amounted to about 10% of the total binding. Previous results have shown that the cytoplasmic N terminus of the β-subunit interacts with the α-subunit (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This interaction is not necessary for the structural maturation of the α-subunit. On the other hand, truncation of the β N terminus produces Na,K-pumps at the cell surface that exhibit a decreased apparent K+ affinity compared with wild type Na,K-pumps (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that β N-terminal interaction with the α-subunit may have a role in the functional properties of the α-subunit. In order to identify the amino acids in the cytoplasmic N terminus of the β-subunit that might be important for this functional effect, we prepared a series of Xenopus Na,K-ATPase β mutants with various truncations or point mutations in the N terminus. The β mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes together with Bufo Na,K-ATPase α-subunits, and the cellular expression and the transport properties of the exogenous α·β complexes were tested by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins and by electrophysiological measurements, respectively. As previously observed for Xenopus Na,K-ATPase α-subunits (5Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the t34 β mutant, in which 34 amino acids of the N terminus of Xenopus β1-subunits were truncated and the initiator methionine directly preceded the lysine residue adjacent to the transmembrane segment (for descriptions of mutants, see Fig. 1), was able to assemble with and stabilize co-expressed Bufo Na,K-ATPase α-subunits during a 48-h chase similar to wild type β-subunits (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4, 11, and 12). The α·β complexes containing either the wild type β-subunit or the t34 mutant became fully glycosylated (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12), indicating that they are targeted to the plasma membrane. Similar results with respect to assembly, stabilization of the α-subunit, and ER exit of the α·β complexes were obtained with β truncation mutants t26, t29, and t32 as well as with a deletion mutant (dG27-F34) in which Gly27 up to Phe34 in the β N terminus were deleted (Fig. 1,A and B, lanes 3–10, 13, and 14). All β mutants formed active Na,K-pumps at the cell surface withBufo α-subunits as shown by pump currents ranging between 200 and 600 nA (Fig. 2, C and D, insets). The maximal pump currents (I max) measured were variable but not consistently different from those of wild type α·β complexes when measured in different batches of oocytes. The apparent affinities for external K+ of the wild type and mutant Na,K-pumps were compared in the presence or absence of external Na+ (Fig. 2, C and D). In both conditions, the K+ activation constant (K½K) of Na,K-pumps containing the wild type β-subunit or the t26 β mutant was similar. TheK½K slightly but significantly increased in Na,K-pumps containing the t29 (lane 3) or the t32 β mutant (lane 4). A most pronounced increase in the K½K, compared with wild type Na,K-pumps, was observed in Na,K-pumps containing the t34 β mutant (lane 5), in particular in the absence of external Na+. These results suggested that amino acids between Leu26 and Phe34 in the β N terminus could be implicated in the apparent affinity for external K+ of the α-subunit. To verify the functional role of amino acids between Leu26 and Phe34 in the β N terminus, we measured the K+ activation kinetics of Na,K-pumps containing the dG27-F34 β mutant in which this domain was deleted (see Fig. 1) and found that theK½K of the α·βdG27-F34 complexes was not significantly different from that of the wild type α·β complexes both in the presence (Fig. 2 C, comparelanes 1 and 6) and absence (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 1 and 6) of extracellular Na+. One possible explanation for this result is that amino acid residues upstream of Gly27 may compensate for the loss of amino acids in the dG27-F34 β deletion mutant. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a series of β mutants containing double or triple alanine substitutions in the Gly27–Phe34 domain in combination with multiple alanine substitutions in the Arg2–Glu24 region (mutants 7–12 in Fig. 1) and measured the expression and the apparent K+ affinity of the Na,K-pumps formed after association of these β mutants withBufo Na,K-ATPase α-subunits. All β mutants associated with and stabilized co-expressed α-subunits similar to wild type β-subunits, and the α·β complexes left the ER as indicated by the acquisition of complex type sugars of the β-subunits after a 48-h chase"
https://openalex.org/W2140924908,"CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many vertebrate cells. It is a bifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyzes both the synthesis of Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ and the degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose by means of its ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR-hydrolase activities, respectively. The cyclase also converts NGD+ to cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR), which is refractory to cADPR-hydrolase. cADPR, but not cGDPR, is a potent calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. It has been demonstrated to be a new second messenger involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in many cell types, from plants to mammals. The number of physiological processes shown to be regulated by cADPR is steadily increasing. A topological paradox exists because ectocellularly generated cADPR acts intracellularly. Here we demonstrate that the catalytic functioning of CD38 is accompanied by a cADPR (cGDPR) -transporting activity across natural and artificial membranes. In resealed membranes from CD38(+) human erythrocytes, transport of catalytically generated cADPR or cGDPR was saturation dependent and occurred against a concentration gradient. Likewise, CD38-reconstituted proteoliposomes were active in concentrating NAD+ (NGD+) -derived cADPR (cGDPR) inside the vesicle compartment. Moreover, the cADPR-transporting activity in CD38 proteoliposomes prevented the hydrolase-catalyzed degradation to ADPR that occurs conversely with detergent-solubilized CD38, resulting in selective influx of cADPR. In the CD38 proteoliposomes, catalytically active CD38 exhibited monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric structures. In CD38 sense- but not in antisense-transfected HeLa cells, externally added NAD+ resulted in significant, transient increases in cytosolic calcium. These data suggest that transmembrane juxtaposition of two or four CD38 monomers can generate a catalytically active channel for selective formation and influx of cADPR (cGDPR) to reach cADPR-responsive intracellular calcium stores."

The membrane binding domain of ankyrin has been demonstrated to have two distinct binding sites for neurofascin and other membrane proteins and is proposed to form lateral complexes between ion channels and cell adhesion molecules as well as to couple these proteins to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton (13Michaely P.

Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, L1 and ankyrinB are co-localized and believed to associate with each other in unmyelinated axons based on loss of L1 in premyelinated axon tracts of ankyrinB (−/−) mice. 1P. Scotland, D. Zhou, H. Benveniste, and V. Bennett, submitted for publication. 1P. Scotland, D. Zhou, H. Benveniste, and V. Bennett, submitted for publication.Ankyrin binding activity of neurofascin requires a highly conserved sequence from Ser56 to Tyr81 in the cytoplasmic domain and in particular the sequence FIGQY (Phe77–Tyr81) that is present in all L1CAM family members (11Garver T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Internal deletion of these sequences abolishes ankyrin binding. In addition, the tyrosine residue in the FIGQY sequence has been identified as the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of neurofascin (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the FIGQY tyrosine eliminates ankyrin binding of neurofascin in vitro and reduces coupling of neurofascin to the cytoskeleton in vivo (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Inhibition of neurofascin-ankyrin interaction by tyrosine phosphorylation also results in dissociation of cell-cell adhesion mediated by homophilic interactions between neurofascin molecules expressed in cultured cells (18Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Questions remaining unanswered concern the oligomeric state and folding of the neurofascin cytoplasmic domain and the influence of tyrosine phosphorylation and mutations on these parameters. Furthermore, since previous studies on neurofascin-ankyrin interaction are largely based on in vitro binding assays (3Davis J.Q. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 232: 121-133Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garver T. Ren Q.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the high or low affinity interactions identified in vitro actually occur in living cells.This study presents analysis of primary and secondary structural requirements for association between neurofascin and 270-kDa ankyrinG. Ankyrin-neurofascin interactions were detected based on ability of transfected neurofascin to recruit GFP-tagged 270-kDa ankyrinG to the plasma membrane of human embryo kidney 293 cells. Results of this assay demonstrate that the FIGQY tyrosine residue as well as certain other aromatic and negatively charged residues in the sequence Ser56–Tyr81are essential for the neurofascin-ankyrin interaction. Moreover, mutation of the tyrosine residue in the FIGQY sequence to histidine (Y81H) greatly impairs ankyrin binding activity of neurofascin. An equivalent mutation in the human L1 gene (Y1229H) results in mental retardation and hydrocephalus (19Van Camp G. Fransen E. Vits L. Raes G. Willems P.J. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results provide evidence for a highly specific interaction between ankyrin and neurofascin involving residues conserved among L1CAM family members and suggest that ankyrin association with L1 is required for L1 function in humans.DISCUSSIONThis paper presents the first structural analysis of the conserved cytoplasmic domain of the L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules and provides a detailed structural and functional analysis of neurofascin-ankyrin interactions in living cells. The cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin dimerizes in solution, has an asymmetric shape, and exhibits a reversible temperature-dependent β-structure. The sequence from Ser56 to Tyr81, which is necessary for ankyrin binding, does not contribute to either dimerization or formation of structure in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin. A qualitative assay for evaluation of neurofascin-ankyrin interactions in living cells has been developed. Using this assay, we confirmed results of previous in vitrobinding assays in living cells (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and provided additional evidence that the sequence from Ser56 to Tyr81 contains the major ankyrin-binding site. The FIGQY tyrosine (Tyr81), which is the site for tyrosine phosphorylation that abolishes ankyrin binding (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to be critical for neurofascin-ankyrin interactions. Mutation of the FIGQY tyrosine to histidine greatly impairs neurofascin-ankyrin interactions. An equivalent mutation in the human L1 molecule (Y1229H) is responsible for certain cases of hydrocephalus and mental retardation (19Van Camp G. Fransen E. Vits L. Raes G. Willems P.J. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since L1 and neurofascin share a conserved cytoplasmic binding site for ankyrin (4Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), disruption of L1-ankyrin interactions may be the molecular basis for pathology due to this L1 mutation (Y1229H). Other conserved aromatic and negatively charged residues in the sequence Ser56–Tyr81 are also shown to contribute to neurofascin-ankyrin interactions. Mutation E73Q, which has a minimal alteration of the side chain, greatly impairs ankyrin binding activity, whereas a triple mutation of D57N/D58N/D62N resulted in no loss of ankyrin binding activity. These data provide strong evidence for a high degree of specificity in the interaction between neurofascin and ankyrin.The new assay for evaluation of neurofascin-ankyrin interactions in co-transfected 293 cells is rapid and effective, although qualitative, and has several potential applications. This assay could be used to screen various point mutations in ankyrin as well as in the L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules for their effects on ankyrin-L1CAM interactions in living cells. The membrane recruitment assay could also be used to identify potential proteins such as protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases that are involved in regulation of association of neurofascin with ankyrin (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The clinical importance of ankyrin-L1CAM interactions has been exemplified by the point mutation Y1229H in the human L1 gene. Moreover, the membrane recruitment assay could be applied to screen pharmaceutical drugs that can modulate ankyrin-L1CAM interactions and perhaps cause developmental defects in the nervous system. Nonetheless, the assay has drawbacks due to lack of quantitative information and does not provide a dissociation constant (K d) describing the affinity of association of mutant neurofascins with ankyrin. In addition, without a careful control of the amount of cDNAs used in co-transfection experiments, one species of cDNA could be overexpressed and complicate subsequent analysis. By using the same type of vector, the same promoter and 3′-untranslated region, and carefully controlled cDNA ratios, our results can be successfully reproduced.Previous studies of ankyrin-neuroglian interactions in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells have demonstrated that ankyrin selectively associates with neuroglian at sites of cell-cell contact but not other regions of the plasma membrane (10Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that recruitment of ankyrin by neuroglian requires activation of neuroglian by extracellular interactions. However, our study demonstrates that recruitment of transfected ankyrin to the plasma membrane of cultured human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) is solely governed by the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin localized at the plasma membrane and is independent of whether the co-transfected cell is isolated or has contact with other cells. The basis for these differences may reflect specialized behavior among L1 CAM family members, differences between S2 cells and human 293 cells, and differences between 270-kDa ankyrinG and the ankyrin expressed in S2 cells.An unexpected result of this study is identification of the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin as a dimer in solution. The effects of dimerization of neurofascin on ankyrin binding and on lateral organization of neurofascin in the plane of the membrane have yet to be determined. Since the ankyrin-binding sequence from Ser56–Tyr81 does not contribute to dimerization and sequences outside the Ser56–Tyr81 sequence do not contribute to ankyrin binding, it is likely that formation of neurofascin dimers does not directly affect ankyrin binding, at least at the qualitative level detectable in the membrane recruitment assay. However, dimerization of neurofascin provides a potential mechanism for formation of neurofascin-ankyrin polymers. Considered together with the multiple binding sites for neurofascin in ankyrinR (13Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the existence of neurofascin dimers implies that neurofascin and ankyrin are able to form lateral complexes containing multiple copies of neurofascin, ankyrin, and possibly other ankyrin-binding membrane proteins. These complexes could be further immobilized by coupling to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton through the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin. The ability to form such large immobilized complexes between ankyrin and neurofascin could be important for the assembly of specialized membrane domains such as axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, where these proteins are localized (16Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). 3Zhang, X., and Bennett, V. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 142, 1571–1581. Lack of discernible secondary structure in the sequence Ser56–Tyr81 indicates that effects of various deletions and mutations in this sequence on ankyrin binding are more likely exerted by direct perturbation of the contact site with ankyrin rather than by disrupting the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin. Atomic structure of ankyrin repeats of the transcription factor GAPB-β revealed that the protein binding site in ankyrin repeats is configured as a tandem array of extended loops, where the tips of these loops provide the binding interface (17Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Extrapolation of this information regarding the ankyrin repeats of GAPB-β to ankyrin suggests the sequence Ser56–Tyr81 in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin also is in contact with predicted loops. This prediction ultimately can be evaluated by determining the structure of ankyrin-neurofascin complexes. It may also be possible to mutate ankyrin at predicted loop sites and “repair” loss of binding of certain neurofascin mutations as well as create ankyrins specifically lacking neurofascin binding activity.In summary, this study presents a structural and functional analysis of the interaction between ankyrin and the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin in living cells. Since the ankyrin-binding site is conserved among members of L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules, our results with neurofascin are likely to apply to other L1CAM molecules. L1, CHL1, neurofascin, NrCAM, and NgCAM in vertebrates and neuroglian in Drosophila are members of the L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules (1Hortsch M.

Ser. 1997; 52: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically relevant sites for interactions between ankyrin and L1CAM molecules include nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments, where neurofascin and NrCAM are concentrated and co-localized with specialized isoforms of ankyrin, 270/480-kDa ankyrinG(16Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, L1 and ankyrinB are co-localized and believed to associate with each other in unmyelinated axons based on loss of L1 in premyelinated axon tracts of ankyrinB (−/−) mice. 1P. Scotland, D. Zhou, H. Benveniste, and V. Bennett, submitted for publication. 1P. Scotland, D. Zhou, H. Benveniste, and V. Bennett, submitted for publication. Ankyrin binding activity of neurofascin requires a highly conserved sequence from Ser56 to Tyr81 in the cytoplasmic domain and in particular the sequence FIGQY (Phe77–Tyr81) that is present in all L1CAM family members (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 12Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Internal deletion of these sequences abolishes ankyrin binding. In addition, the tyrosine residue in the FIGQY sequence has been identified as the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of neurofascin (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the FIGQY tyrosine eliminates ankyrin binding of neurofascin in vitro and reduces coupling of neurofascin to the cytoskeleton in vivo (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Inhibition of neurofascin-ankyrin interaction by tyrosine phosphorylation also results in dissociation of cell-cell adhesion mediated by homophilic interactions between neurofascin molecules expressed in cultured cells (18Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Questions remaining unanswered concern the oligomeric state and folding of the neurofascin cytoplasmic domain and the influence of tyrosine phosphorylation and mutations on these parameters. Furthermore, since previous studies on neurofascin-ankyrin interaction are largely based on in vitro binding assays (3Davis J.Q. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 232: 121-133Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garver T. Ren Q.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the high or low affinity interactions identified in vitro actually occur in living cells. This study presents analysis of primary and secondary structural requirements for association between neurofascin and 270-kDa ankyrinG. Ankyrin-neurofascin interactions were detected based on ability of transfected neurofascin to recruit GFP-tagged 270-kDa ankyrinG to the plasma membrane of human embryo kidney 293 cells. Results of this assay demonstrate that the FIGQY tyrosine residue as well as certain other aromatic and negatively charged residues in the sequence Ser56–Tyr81are essential for the neurofascin-ankyrin interaction. Moreover, mutation of the tyrosine residue in the FIGQY sequence to histidine (Y81H) greatly impairs ankyrin binding activity of neurofascin. An equivalent mutation in the human L1 gene (Y1229H) results in mental retardation and hydrocephalus (19Van Camp G. Fransen E. Vits L. Raes G. Willems P.J. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results provide evidence for a highly specific interaction between ankyrin and neurofascin involving residues conserved among L1CAM family members and suggest that ankyrin association with L1 is required for L1 function in humans. DISCUSSIONThis paper presents the first structural analysis of the conserved cytoplasmic domain of the L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules and provides a detailed structural and functional analysis of neurofascin-ankyrin interactions in living cells. The cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin dimerizes in solution, has an asymmetric shape, and exhibits a reversible temperature-dependent β-structure. The sequence from Ser56 to Tyr81, which is necessary for ankyrin binding, does not contribute to either dimerization or formation of structure in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin. A qualitative assay for evaluation of neurofascin-ankyrin interactions in living cells has been developed. Using this assay, we confirmed results of previous in vitrobinding assays in living cells (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and provided additional evidence that the sequence from Ser56 to Tyr81 contains the major ankyrin-binding site. The FIGQY tyrosine (Tyr81), which is the site for tyrosine phosphorylation that abolishes ankyrin binding (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to be critical for neurofascin-ankyrin interactions. Mutation of the FIGQY tyrosine to histidine greatly impairs neurofascin-ankyrin interactions. An equivalent mutation in the human L1 molecule (Y1229H) is responsible for certain cases of hydrocephalus and mental retardation (19Van Camp G. Fransen E. Vits L. Raes G. Willems P.J. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since L1 and neurofascin share a conserved cytoplasmic binding site for ankyrin (4Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), disruption of L1-ankyrin interactions may be the molecular basis for pathology due to this L1 mutation (Y1229H). Other conserved aromatic and negatively charged residues in the sequence Ser56–Tyr81 are also shown to contribute to neurofascin-ankyrin interactions. Mutation E73Q, which has a minimal alteration of the side chain, greatly impairs ankyrin binding activity, whereas a triple mutation of D57N/D58N/D62N resulted in no loss of ankyrin binding activity. These data provide strong evidence for a high degree of specificity in the interaction between neurofascin and ankyrin.The new assay for evaluation of neurofascin-ankyrin interactions in co-transfected 293 cells is rapid and effective, although qualitative, and has several potential applications. This assay could be used to screen various point mutations in ankyrin as well as in the L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules for their effects on ankyrin-L1CAM interactions in living cells. The membrane recruitment assay could also be used to identify potential proteins such as protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases that are involved in regulation of association of neurofascin with ankyrin (11Garver T. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The clinical importance of ankyrin-L1CAM interactions has been exemplified by the point mutation Y1229H in the human L1 gene. Moreover, the membrane recruitment assay could be applied to screen pharmaceutical drugs that can modulate ankyrin-L1CAM interactions and perhaps cause developmental defects in the nervous system. Nonetheless, the assay has drawbacks due to lack of quantitative information and does not provide a dissociation constant (K d) describing the affinity of association of mutant neurofascins with ankyrin. In addition, without a careful control of the amount of cDNAs used in co-transfection experiments, one species of cDNA could be overexpressed and complicate subsequent analysis. By using the same type of vector, the same promoter and 3′-untranslated region, and carefully controlled cDNA ratios, our results can be successfully reproduced.Previous studies of ankyrin-neuroglian interactions in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells have demonstrated that ankyrin selectively associates with neuroglian at sites of cell-cell contact but not other regions of the plasma membrane (10Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that recruitment of ankyrin by neuroglian requires activation of neuroglian by extracellular interactions. However, our study demonstrates that recruitment of transfected ankyrin to the plasma membrane of cultured human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) is solely governed by the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin localized at the plasma membrane and is independent of whether the co-transfected cell is isolated or has contact with other cells. The basis for these differences may reflect specialized behavior among L1 CAM family members, differences between S2 cells and human 293 cells, and differences between 270-kDa ankyrinG and the ankyrin expressed in S2 cells.An unexpected result of this study is identification of the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin as a dimer in solution. The effects of dimerization of neurofascin on ankyrin binding and on lateral organization of neurofascin in the plane of the membrane have yet to be determined. Since the ankyrin-binding sequence from Ser56–Tyr81 does not contribute to dimerization and sequences outside the Ser56–Tyr81 sequence do not contribute to ankyrin binding, it is likely that formation of neurofascin dimers does not directly affect ankyrin binding, at least at the qualitative level detectable in the membrane recruitment assay. However, dimerization of neurofascin provides a potential mechanism for formation of neurofascin-ankyrin polymers. Considered together with the multiple binding sites for neurofascin in ankyrinR (13Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the existence of neurofascin dimers implies that neurofascin and ankyrin are able to form lateral complexes containing multiple copies of neurofascin, ankyrin, and possibly other ankyrin-binding membrane proteins. These complexes could be further immobilized by coupling to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton through the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin. The ability to form such large immobilized complexes between ankyrin and neurofascin could be important for the assembly of specialized membrane domains such as axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, where these proteins are localized (16Davis J.Q. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). 3Zhang, X., and Bennett, V. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 142, 1571–1581. Lack of discernible secondary structure in the sequence Ser56–Tyr81 indicates that effects of various deletions and mutations in this sequence on ankyrin binding are more likely exerted by direct perturbation of the contact site with ankyrin rather than by disrupting the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin. Atomic structure of ankyrin repeats of the transcription factor GAPB-β revealed that the protein binding site in ankyrin repeats is configured as a tandem array of extended loops, where the tips of these loops provide the binding interface (17Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Extrapolation of this information regarding the ankyrin repeats of GAPB-β to ankyrin suggests the sequence Ser56–Tyr81 in the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin also is in contact with predicted loops. This prediction ultimately can be evaluated by determining the structure of ankyrin-neurofascin complexes. It may also be possible to mutate ankyrin at predicted loop sites and “repair” loss of binding of certain neurofascin mutations as well as create ankyrins specifically lacking neurofascin binding activity.In summary, this study presents a structural and functional analysis of the interaction between ankyrin and the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin in living cells. Since the ankyrin-binding site is conserved among members of L1CAM family of cell adhesion molecules, our results with neurofascin are likely to apply to other L1CAM molecules.

Expression of the wild-type protein enhanced migration by twofold compared to control transfectants, whereas expression of the mutant protein retarded migration by 40%. Since homologs of the small heat shock protein inhibit F-actin polymerization in vitro and may alter basolateral F-actin content in vivo, it was postulated that the 27 kDa heat shock protein affects microfilament extension essential for cell motility. Expression of the wildtype protein promoted the generation of long cellular extensions, whereas expression of the dominant negative mutant protein resulted in a marked reduction of lamellipodia and generated aberrant microfilament morphology at the wound edge. Immunofluorescence combined with phalloidin staining demonstrated the colocalization of the HSP27 gene products with lamellipodial microfilament structures. These data suggest that the 27 kDa heat shock protein regulates migration by affecting the generation lamellipodia microfilaments.—Piotrowicz, R. S., Hickey, E., Levin, E. G.

https://openalex.org/W1913031629,"Recently we demonstrated that a high percentage of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients displayed specific immunoglobulin E reactivity to human proteins. Here we show that IgE autoreactivity is found predominantly in AD patients with severe skin manifestations and reveal the molecular nature of four IgE autoantigens. An expression cDNA library constructed from a human epithelial cell line (A 431) was screened with serum IgE from two AD patients. DNA sequence analysis of three IgE-reactive clones identified the alpha-chain of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex, cytokeratin type II, and the BCL7B oncogen as atopy-related IgE autoantigens (ara). The fourth cDNA coded for an IgE autoantigen containing a typical calcium binding motif that occurred in histogenetically different cells and tissues (keratinocytes, muscle, brain). Recombinant Escherichia coli-expressed IgE autoantigens bound IgE from AD but not from patients with other immunologically mediated disorders (graft vs. host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus) and elicited immediate type skin reactions in AD patients. In serum samples collected from an AD patient over a period of 5 years, IgE anti-ara NAC antibody levels peaked during disease exacerbation. Our finding that ara BCL7B was detected in serum bound to IgE antibodies suggests that intracellular IgE autoantigens can become released after tissue damage and may occur as IgE immune complexes. Via binding to antigen presenting cells as well as to effector cells, IgE autoantigen immune complexes may contribute to exacerbation and/or perpetuation of severe atopic diseases even in the absence of exogenous allergens."

The families of eukaryotic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70/Hsc70) and heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) have a high degree of homology to DnaK and DnaJ, respectively. Hsp70 and Hsp40 proteins are co-localized to the cytosol and also function in the nucleus (15Yamane M. Hattori H. Sugito K. Hayashi Y. Tohnai I. Ueda M. Nishizawa K. Ohtsuka K.

As in prokaryotes, the Hsp40 proteins function as co-chaperones of Hsp70, but they also have weak, independent activity (5Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U.

All of the DnaJ homologues, such as HDJ-1, HDJ-2, and YDJ-1, members of the human and yeast Hsp40 family, have a conserved J domain at the amino terminus. Truncated E. coli or YDJ-1 containing only the J domain is sufficient to modulate the ATPase activity of DnaK/Hsp70 (20Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding J domain of the human Hsp40 proteins is also thought to mediate interactions with Hsp70 and regulate its ATPase activity (for a review, see Ref. 8Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Within the J domain, there is a highly conserved HPD tripeptide loop flanked by two α-helices, designated helix II and helix III (22Szyperski T. Pellecchia M. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K.

Mutations in the HPD motif or in the external faces of the α-helices significantly reduce its activity (21Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

Recent evidence suggests that helix II interacts with Hsp70 and that peptides encompassing helix II and the HPD loop inhibit the co-chaperone function of DnaJ/Hsp40, presumably because they compete for binding to Hsp70 (28Tsai J.

SV40 and polyomavirus DNA replication require the viral large T antigen (Tag),1which serves as the initiator (for a review, see Ref. 30Hassell J.A. Brinton B.T. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 639-677Google Scholar). In addition, the SV40 Tag is also the viral oncoprotein capable of transforming cells. The amino-terminal domain shared by the large, small, and tiny Tag of the SV40/polyomaviruses exhibits a sequence and functional homology with the J domain of the Hsp40 family (31Silver P.A. Way J.C.

The J domain, especially the HPD tripeptide loop, of the SV40 Tag plays a critical role in interacting with the Hsc70 (31Silver P.A. Way J.C.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1408-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggestive of a role of chaperone function in eukaryotic DNA replication. But the mechanisms of the Tag J domain function are not understood. As do SV40 and polyomaviruses, the papillomaviruses have served as model systems for eukaryotic DNA replication. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are prevalent and medically significant human pathogens (for a review, see Ref. 38zur Hausen H. de Villiers E.-M. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To support HPV ori replication, the virus supplies two proteins, E1 and E2, while the host cell provides all other known replication proteins, including DNA polymerases α and δ, replication protein-A, replication factor-C, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and topoisomerases (for reviews, see Refs. 39Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Intervirology. 1994; 37: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and 40Stenlund A. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 679-697Google Scholar). The partition of the HPV replication activities into two proteins simplifies their functional dissections relative to the Tag of SV40/polyomavirus. To this end, we and others have established cell-free replication systems for HPV or bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) ori plasmids by using human 293 cell or mouse cell extracts supplemented with E1 and E2 proteins purified from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses (41Yang L.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27283-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The E1 protein is analogous to the SV40/polyomavirus Tag in its role during replication. It has specific as well as nonspecific DNA binding activities, and it is an ATPase and helicase (46Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol.

Chow, and T. S.-F. Wang, unpublished results. thereby recruiting the host replication machinery to the ori. The E2 protein binds to its cognate binding sites (E2BS) in the ori, which consists of one E1BS and several copies of E2BS, and is located within the viral enhancer and promoter region. The bound E2 protein helps recruit E1 to the origin (39Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Intervirology. 1994; 37: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 40Stenlund A. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 679-697Google Scholar). In addition, E2 protein, in its role as a transcription factor, excludes nucleosome formation over theori, facilitating the assembly of the initiation complex (54Li R. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, neither the E1 nor the E2 protein has a J domain. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that host chaperone proteins are involved in the initiation of HPV DNA replication, as shown for bacteriophages. Our results demonstrate that these chaperones function independently and additively to facilitate the association between the E1 protein and the ori as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Hsp70 interacts with E1 transiently and requires ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, Hsp40 or a 20- amino acid-long J peptide remains associated with E1 independent of ATP, and this is the first example of the J domain of Hsp40 specifically associating with a protein with ATPase activity other than Hsp70/Hsc70. Electron microscopic examination of the E1-ori DNA complexes demonstrates that, in the presence or absence of Hsp70 or the J peptide, the majority of the E1 bound to ori DNA has a size corresponding to a hexameric complex. Strikingly, Hsp40 promotes an efficient formation of a bilobed multimeric E1 complex on the DNA. Each lobe had the size of a hexamer, as required for bidirectional replication known to occur for papillomaviruses. Preincubation of chaperone proteins with E1 and ori shortens the lag time in cell-free replication. These results strongly suggest that the human chaperone proteins facilitate the assembly of the preinitiation complex on the HPV ori. HPV ori plasmids pUC7730–99, pUC7874–99, and pUC7874–20 were named by inclusive nucleotides of the HPV-11 DNA fragment cloned from the double-stranded circular genome of 7933 bp (46Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27283-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, pUC7730–99 spans nucleotide 7730–7933/1–99 and contains three copies of E2BS flanking a single E1BS. pUC7874–99 also contains the same ori sequences but is shorter at the 5′ sequence. pUC7874–20 contains only one copy each for E2BS and E1BS. Each was chosen for a different assay as described. Hsp70 and HDJ-1 expression vectors, pET-11a Hsp70 and pET-21d HDJ-1, were obtained from Dr. Richard Morimoto (55Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes &Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 56Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The cDNA of HDJ-2 was obtained from Dr. T. Mohanakumar (57Chellaiah A. Davis A. Mohanakumar T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction amplification was used to add an NcoI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the cDNA, which was then inserted into the multiple cloning site of pET9d to generate the HDJ-2 expression vector, pET-9d HDJ-2. HPV-11 E1 protein, which was tagged at the amino terminus with a glutamate-rich epitope (EE), was purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (42Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27283-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Human chaperone proteins Hsp70, HDJ-1, and HDJ-2 were expressed and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS as follows. Protein induction was achieved by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside to cells at midlog phase for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-K+, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The purification of Hsp70 was modified from a protocol described previously (55Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes &Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, the soluble fraction was diluted with buffer Q (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) to a final NaCl concentration of 50 mm, applied to a 10-ml Q-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad), and eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer Q. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and those containing Hsp70 were pooled and applied to an ATP-agarose column (Sigma). Hsp70 proteins were eluted with 1 mm ATP or ADP in buffer Q, recaptured in a 1-ml Q-Sepharose column (Econo-Pac, Bio-Rad) and then eluted with 300 mm NaCl in Buffer Q, yielding a purity of about 95% at 2 mg/ml. Identical procedures were used to purify HDJ-1 and HDJ-2. Hsp40 eluted from the Q-Sepharose column with buffer Q containing 250 mm NaCl was then diluted with buffer Q to a final concentration of 50 mm NaCl and applied to an S-Sepharose column (Econo-Pac, Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted at about 150–200 mm NaCl in a 50–300 mm NaCl gradient. The final purity of Hsp40 was over 95% at 0.3–0.5 mg/ml. The HPV-11 origin-containing plasmid pUC7874–99 with one E1BS and three E2BS was used as anori template. The conditions for cell-free replication have been described (42Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27283-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The amount of viral E1 protein used was reduced due to a more active viral protein preparation, and the 293 cell extracts were minimized to reduce the endogenous chaperone proteins. In the preincubation experiments, 12 ng of HPV-11 E1 protein (in 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 40 ng of template, 4 mm ATP were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min in the presence or absence of 100 ng of Hsp70 and 100 ng of HDJ-1 proteins. The balance of the replication reaction (including 8 ng of E2) and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were then added, followed by an additional incubation at 37 °C for various times. The reaction was terminated by a stop solution containing SDS and proteinase K. Replication products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Peptides containing sequences from the J domain of YDJ-1 protein, p21–40, p41–60, and p21–40 H34Q were as described (28Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Peptide p33–52 was synthesized by Dr. David Klapper of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Mouse monoclonal antibody KA2A5.6 (Hsp40/HDJ-2) and SPA-815 (Hsc70/Hsp70) were purchased from Neomarkers and StressGen. Hybridoma cells producing monoclonal antibody against the EE epitope were obtained from Dr. Gernot Walter (58Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and the antibodies were harvested from the culture medium and enriched by Q-Sepharose column chromatography. The 130-bp fragment that contained the minimal HPV-11ori of one E1BS and one E2BS was liberated from pUC7874–20 by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and then 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In a 10-μl reaction mixture, 80 ng of HPV–11 EE-E1 protein were mixed with 100 ng of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 20 fmol (about 6000 cpm) of labeled DNA fragments in the binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-K+, pH 7.5, 4 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with or without purified chaperone proteins or peptides as indicated in each figure. The binding reactions were conducted at room temperature for 20 min followed by the addition of glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.2% and incubation for another 10 min at room temperature. For supershift experiments, antibodies were added at 10 min into the initial incubation. The protein-DNA complexes were then analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel with 1× Tris acetate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm for 18 h or to a PhosphorImager. 100 ng of purified HPV-11 EE-E1 protein, 500 ng of purified HDJ-2 protein, and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin were incubated in the binding buffer (20 mmHEPES-K+, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol) at room temperature for 20 min before 100 ng of KA2A5.6 anti-Hsp40 antibody and 10 μl of protein-A Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added. After washing with binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the precipitates were resuspended in sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with anti-EE antibody and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescent reactions (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Hyperfilm. 100 ng of a 600-bp PvuII DNA fragment from the plasmid pUC7730–99 or the supercoiled plasmid was used for electron microscopy. This plasmid was chosen because the E1BS was approximately located at the center of the restriction fragment. The DNA was incubated with 600 ng of E1 with or without 1.5 μg of chaperone protein (Hsp70 or HDJ-2) or 2.8 μg of peptide p21–40 in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-K+, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 10% glycerol at room temperature for 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were then cross-linked with 0.3% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and separated from free proteins by filtration through 2-ml columns of Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA. The filtrate was mixed with a buffer containing 2 mm spermidine and 0.15 m NaCl, adsorbed to glow-charged thin carbon foils, dehydrated through a graded water-ethanol series, and rotary shadow-cast with tungsten as described (59Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Samples were visualized in a Philips CM12 electron microscope. Micrographs were scanned from negatives using a Nikon multiformat film scanner, and the contrast was optimized and panels were arranged using Adobe Photoshop. Morphometry measurements were conducted by using NIH Image Software and a Summagraphics digitizer coupled to a Macintosh computer programmed with software developed by J. D. G. The physical state of HPV-11 E1 protein was examined by electrophoresis through a native 5–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel. In the presence or in the absence of ATP, the majority of the E1 protein existed as monomers, with the minority as homo-oligomers as revealed by Western blot (data not shown). When native E1 protein was adsorbed to thin carbon supports and examined by transmission electron microscopy (EM) after negative staining, fields of particles of different sizes representing monomers to oligomers were observed. At a high concentration (50 μg/ml) and in the presence or absence of 4 mm ATP or AMP-PNP, the majority of E1 was oligomeric. Large particles of a similar size, possibly hexamers (see below), were common, and occasionally ring-like oligomers were observed (data not shown). For size determination, glutaraldehyde-fixed E1 protein was rotary shadow-cast on separate supports but side-by-side with apoferritin (443 kDa). The projected areas of the large uniform E1 particles (n = 69) were measured and compared with those of the apoferritin particles (n = 23). The results showed that E1 particles were 1.0 times the average volume of the apoferritin (60Griffith J.D. Makhov A. Zawel L. Reinberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 256: 576-584Google Scholar), a value consistent with a hexamer of a 73-kDa protein. As demonstrated previously by EMSA (46Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol.

To visualize the binding of E1 to HPV ori DNA, superhelical forms of the 2.77-kilobase pair plasmid pUC7874–20 were incubated with E1 protein in the presence of ATP, and the complexes were fixed with glutaraldehyde, filtered through Bio-Gel A-5m to remove the fixative, and prepared for"
https://openalex.org/W2028684039,"The contact of fibrin with the apical surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) can induce capillary tube formation via the interaction of fibrin β15–42 with a putative cell receptor (Chalupowicz, D. G., Chowdhury, Z. A., Bach, T. L., Barsigian, C., and Martinez, J. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 130, 207–215). To characterize this interaction, we studied the binding of the thrombin-cleaved N-terminal disulfide knot of fibrin (NDSK II), a dimeric fragment with exposed β15–42, to HUVEC in three separate assay systems. Time-course binding of125I-NDSK II to HUVEC monolayers or suspensions revealed that binding was specific at 50–60%, as determined by the addition of unlabeled NDSK II. Specific binding of 125I-NDSK II to HUVEC was 70% reversible by dilution or by competition, and was found to be divalent cation-independent. Binding plateaued after 10 min at a saturation of 15–20 nm. Scatchard analysis using the LIGAND computer program defined a single population of receptors with aK D of 7.7 ± 1.6 nm and approximately 21,000 ± 7000 binding sites/cell. N-terminal disulfide knot derivatives in which β15–42 was absent (NDSK 325) or unexposed (NDSK, NDSK I) did not show specific binding. Specific binding of 125I-NDSK II could not be inhibited by RGDS or by antibodies to the αvβ3 or β1 integrins, PECAM-1, ICAM-1, or N-cadherin. In contrast, a synthetic β15–42/ovalbumin conjugate inhibited total125I-NDSK II binding by 47 ± 19% (corresponding to 95% of specific 125I-NDSK II bound) and a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) inhibited binding by 35 ± 8% (corresponding to 70% of specific125I-NDSK II bound). Another assay was based on the capture of cadherins from HUVEC lysates by a polyclonal pan-cadherin antibody immobilized on plastic dishes. Binding of NDSK II to the captured cadherins was 89 ± 5% specific, while specific binding of NDSK 325 and NDSK was negligible. An immortalized line of human adipose-derived microvascular endothelial cells, which express N-cadherin but not VE-cadherin, demonstrated no specific binding of NDSK II by the capture assay. These data define a novel interaction of fibrin with VE-cadherin, which is mediated by the fibrin N-terminal β15–42 sequence, and may contribute to the mechanism through which fibrin induces angiogenesis.

In the final steps of blood coagulation, the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen is enzymatically converted by the action of thrombin into insoluble fibrin monomers, which spontaneously polymerize to yield a fibrin mesh containing entrapped platelets and red blood cells (1Mosesson M.W. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrin blood clot plays a vital role in many physiologic and pathophysiologic processes including hemostasis and thrombosis (1Mosesson M.W. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar), and in angiogenic processes such as wound healing and tumor growth (2Dvorak H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1650-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar, 3Arnold F. West D.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In these processes fibrin interacts with a variety of plasma proteins, cells, and tissue matrix components. The main hemostatic function of fibrin clot formation in vivo is to provide structural support and scaffolding for the cellular and other blood elements comprising the thrombus (1Mosesson M.W. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the process of normal wound healing, the main purpose of the fibrin clot that fills the wound is to serve as a provisional matrix into which inflammatory cells migrate and upon which new blood capillaries are formed (2Dvorak H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1650-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar). Fibrin formation is also involved in pathological conditions, such as tumor growth, where it is thought to provide a matrix for tumor cell proliferation and possibly for maintenance of angiogenesis (2Dvorak H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1650-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar). The interaction of the N-terminal region of fibrin with the endothelial cell surface influences cell behavior in several respects. It can disrupt the normal integrity of the endothelial cell monolayer (4Weimer B. Delvos U. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it can stimulate secretion of stored von Willebrand factor (5Ribes J.A. Ni F. Wagner D. Francis C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and it can induce human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)1 morphogenesis into capillary tube-like structures (6Dvorak H.F. Harvey S. Estrella P. Brown L.F. McDonagh J. Dvorak A.M. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 673-686PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chalupowicz D.G. Chowdhury Z.A. Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Martinez J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), thus initiating the process of in vitro angiogenesis. These observations indicate that the thrombin-mediated exposure of neo-epitopes at the N terminus of the fibrin molecule confers fibrin, as opposed to fibrinogen, with the ability to bind to endothelial cell surface receptors and thereby induce the specific cellular responses referred to above. We have previously shown that a specific form of fibrin designated fibrin II, in which the neo-N terminus of the fibrin β chain (β15–42) is exposed, induces the formation of capillary tube-like structures when in contact with the apical surface of HUVEC monolayers (7Chalupowicz D.G. Chowdhury Z.A. Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Martinez J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have also more recently demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin, or cadherin-5 (8Suzuki S. Sano K. Tanihara H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), inhibited fibrin II and collagen-induced capillary tube formation whereas antibodies against N-cadherin, PECAM-1, or the αvβ3 integrin did not (9Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz D.G. Busler D. Yaen C.H. Grant D.S. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In related experiments, others have shown that antibodies against VE-cadherin or PECAM-1 do not inhibit capillary tube formation when used individually, but do inhibit tube formation when incubated together with endothelial cells cultured on single-layer Matrigel (10Matsumura T. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the aforementioned studies, which report the inability of PECAM-1 alone to induce tube formation (9Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz D.G. Busler D. Yaen C.H. Grant D.S. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Matsumura T. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar), others have found PECAM-1 to play an important role in both in vivo and in vitroangiogenesis (11DeLisser H.M. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Strieter R.M. Burdick M.D. Robinson C.S. Wexler R.S. Kerr J.S. Garlanda C. Merwin J.R. Madri J.A. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that VE-cadherin or PECAM-1 (both of which have a molecular mass of roughly 130 kDa) may serve as endothelial cell receptors for matrix proteins, including but not limited to fibrin, that play an important role in mediating capillary tube formation. This idea is supported by the report that a 130-kDa protein can be purified from human umbilical vein endothelial cell lysates by affinity chromatography over fibrin β15–42/Sepharose (12Erban J.K. Wagner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2451-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the major hypothesis of the present work was that the neo-N terminus of the fibrin II β chain (β15–42) can bind to endothelial cell surface receptors, possibly VE-cadherin, and that this binding may underlie the reported ability of VE-cadherin antibodies to inhibit fibrin II-induced capillary tube formation (9Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz D.G. Busler D. Yaen C.H. Grant D.S. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because angiogenesis is a complex process, which likely involves receptors from various cell adhesion molecule families (13Bischoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Stromblad S. Cheresh D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we also assessed the potential role of members of three families of adhesion receptors including the integrins, the immunoglobulin gene (Ig) superfamily, and the cadherins as putative endothelial cell receptors for fibrin. Among the integrins, we focused on the αvβ3 (15Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and α5β1 (16Suehiro K. Gailit J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) integrins, which are known to bind fibrinogen. Within the Ig superfamily, in addition to PECAM-1, which participates in both heterophilic and homophilic interactions (17Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S25-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as well as in capillary tube formation (10Matsumura T. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 11DeLisser H.M. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Strieter R.M. Burdick M.D. Robinson C.S. Wexler R.S. Kerr J.S. Garlanda C. Merwin J.R. Madri J.A. Albelda S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 671-677PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined ICAM-1, which acts as a fibrinogen receptor on endothelial cells and mediates leukocyte adhesion to inflamed endothelium (18Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 19Altieri D.C. Duperray A. Plescia J. Thornton G.B. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 696-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also examined the role of N-cadherin, which appears to be diffusely distributed over the endothelial cell plasma membrane (20Salomon D. Ayalon O. Patel-King R. Hynes R.O. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 7-17PubMed Google Scholar), and of VE-cadherin, which, in addition to being specific to the vascular endothelium (21Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A.

Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 24Dejana E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S7-S10PubMed Google Scholar), has also been shown to mediate vasculogenesis (25Vittet D. Buchou T. Schweitzer A. Dejana E. Huber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and both in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis (9Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz D.G. Busler D. Yaen C.H. Grant D.S. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Matsumura T. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we focused our attention on the interaction of the N terminus of fibrin, namely the β15–42 sequence, with an endothelial cell receptor by characterizing binding of the N-terminal disulfide knot (NDSK) of fibrin to HUVEC. We have also utilized a cadherin capture assay to analyze the direct interaction of fibrin with isolated cadherins. Based on our results, we propose that VE-cadherin serves as a fibrin-specific receptor on endothelial cells and that the N terminus of the fibrin β chain (β15–42) functions as a heterophilic ligand for VE-cadherin.

Primary cultures of HUVEC were isolated from human umbilical cords and maintained in culture as described (26Martinez J. Rich E. Barsigian C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20502-20508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passages 1–4 were used in this study and were periodically checked for the expression of von Willebrand factor by immunohistochemistry. Human aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, amphotericin, and 20% fetal calf serum. Cells from passages 15–20 were used in this study. HADMEC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum on tissue culture dishes coated with 1% gelatin and were confirmed to be endothelial cells by immunofluorescent assessment of the expression of von Willebrand factor. Cells from passages 10–15 were used in this study. Human fibrinogen was purified as described previously (26Martinez J. Rich E. Barsigian C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20502-20508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the NDSK, fibrinogen (10 mg/ml) was dialyzed into 70% formic acid and was treated with cyanogen bromide (1.3 mg/100 mg of fibrinogen) for 24 h at room temperature (27Blomback B. Blomback M. Hessel B. Iwanaga S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The solution was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, and contaminating hydrophobic fragments (28Shainoff J.R. Stearns D.J. DiBello P.M. Hishikawa-Itoh Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 63: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant, containing two major cleavage products, was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 column, and fractions eluted after the void volume were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified NDSK was treated with thrombin (3 units/ml for 3 h at 37 °C) to generate NDSK II (NDSK lacking fibrinopeptides A and B). NDSK I (NDSK minus fibrinopeptide A) was prepared by treating NDSK with Atroxin (2 μg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C), and NDSK 325, which lacks Bβ1–42, was prepared by treatment of NDSK with protease III (8 μg/ml for 3 h at 37 °C) from C. atrox venom (29Pandya B.V. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The identities of the NDSK derivatives were assessed by SDS-PAGE. For binding experiments, NDSK fragments were labeled with iodine 125, by the IODOGEN method (30Fraker P.M. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar), to a specific activity of 3000–5000 cpm/ng. The β15–42 sequence, corresponding to the neo-N terminus of the fibrin β chain following cleavage of fibrinopeptide B by thrombin, was synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy of solid-phase synthesis (31Chang C.D. Meienhofer J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer and was purified by reversed-phase chromatography using an Applied Biosystems semipreparative system equipped with a Rainin C18 column. The sequence of the purified β15–42 peptide was verified by mass spectroscopy. The purified peptide was conjugated to ovalbumin by glutaraldehyde cross-linking (12Erban J.K. Wagner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2451-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of NDSK derivatives to HUVEC suspensions was performed essentially as described previously for fibrinogen binding to HUVEC (26Martinez J. Rich E. Barsigian C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20502-20508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC (∼250,000 cells/ml) suspended in buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and no added cations, were incubated in 12-mm multiwells with the125I-NDSKs at a final concentration of 20 nm. The suspensions were incubated with horizontal shaking at 4 °C and aliquots of suspension were removed in duplicate and added to microcentrifuge tubes containing a mixture of 1 part light mineral oil and 4 parts DC550 silicone oil (26Martinez J. Rich E. Barsigian C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20502-20508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the tips of the tubes were amputated, and the cell-bound radioactivity was counted by γ-scintillation. Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubating cells for 20 min with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NDSK, NDSK I, NDSK II, or NDSK 325, prior to the addition of the respective 125I-labeled derivatives. Specific binding was calculated from the difference in total binding and nonspecific binding. Reversibility of binding was assessed either by dilution with excess binding buffer or by displacement with excess unlabeled NDSK II. To assess the cation dependence of the system, binding studies were carried out with binding buffer containing added CaCl2 (2 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), MnCl2 (0.5 mm), or EDTA (8 mm). To assess the integrity of the cell-bound125I-NDSK, the radioactive pellet was extracted into Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar), electrophoresed, and subjected to autoradiography as described below. Potential inhibitory agents, such as antibodies (5–10 μg/ml) to endothelial cell integrins, cadherins, or Ig superfamily molecules, or specific fibrin-derived peptides such as β15–42 (25 μg/ml) or RGDS (0.5 mm), were preincubated with the cells for 20 min prior to the addition of the 125I-NDSKs. For assessment of the potential inhibitory role of heparin, heparin was preincubated at increasing concentrations with the purified 125I-NDSK II (33Odrljin T.M. Francis C.W. Sporn L.A. Bunce L.A. Marder V.J. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1544-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Following incubation of HUVEC with the 125I-NDSK fragments, binding was quantitated as described above. For the studies in monolayer, HUVEC were grown to confluence on 5-cm wells (∼500,000 cells/well), washed twice with 2 ml of serum-free Medium 199 containing 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and preincubated with the same medium for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the NDSK derivatives. All monolayer studies were carried out at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined as described above for cell suspensions. Following incubation, duplicate wells were washed twice with TBS and detached with TBS/EDTA, 900-μl aliquots of detached cells were added to microcentrifuge tubes containing a mineral oil/DC550 silicone oil mixture, and the cell-bound125I-NDSK was quantitated as described above for the suspension studies. Scatchard plots of NDSK II binding to HUVEC were analyzed by curve-fitting software developed by Munson and Rodbard (34Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Ann. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) for estimation of dissociation constants (K D) and maximal binding (B max). The data were analyzed initially using both a two-site and a one-site model with nonspecific binding set at zero. Convergence of the data was obtained with only the one-site model. The data were subsequently analyzed by a one-site model with nonspecific binding set as a parameter proportional to the ligand concentration. The experimental estimates of nonspecific binding, determined from the binding of labeled ligand in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ligand, coincided within 15% of estimates by curve fitting using the one-site model. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (35Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HUVEC monolayers (10–15 T-75 flasks; ∼30–45 × 106 cells) were washed three times with TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and then scraped, on ice, into TBS, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, and 15 μg/ml leupeptin (lysis buffer). The samples were centrifuged for 5–10 min at 1000 × g and the supernatants resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 1% Nonidet P-40, put on ice for 15 min, and aspirated back and forth several times through a 27.5-gauge needle. After 15 min, lysis buffer containing only 1% Nonidet P-40 was added to bring the final concentration of SDS to 0.1%, the samples were allowed to stand on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, 125I-NDSK II was added to a final concentration of 30 nm and the tubes were capped and rotated end-over-end for 20–30 min at room temperature. The NDSK II-bound lysate was then incubated for 2 h on ice with either an anti-pan-cadherin IgG or a control rabbit IgG, both at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Subsequently, 100 μl of the Protein A-Sepharose suspension was added to each sample and incubated for 60 min on an end-over-end shaker. The incubation mixture was centrifuged for 1–2 min at 12,000 × g and the pellet washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. After the final wash, the pellets were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar), electrophoresed, and immunoblotted as described above. Antibody capture assays were performed as follows. To each 12-mm well of a Nunclon multiwell dish, 500-μl aliquots of anti-pan-cadherin IgG or control rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml TBS) were added and the dishes incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Following aspiration of the antibody solutions, each well was washed three times with 1 ml of TBS and residual protein binding sites were blocked by incubation with 10% powdered milk in TBS for 1–3 h at 37 °C. The wells were then aspirated and rinsed with lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS/1% Nonidet P-40, and 500-μl portions of cell lysates (250,000–500,000 cells/ml), lysed as described previously for the immunoprecipitation studies, were added for 2 h at 37 °C. The lysates were then aspirated, and the wells were washed and resupplemented with 500-μl aliquots of detergent-containing lysis buffer. To measure total binding of the NDSK fragments, 125I-labeled NDSK, NDSK II, or NDSK 325 were added to the buffer at a final concentration of 20 nm for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubating certain wells for 20 min with a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled derivatives prior to the addition of the respective labeled derivatives. The wells were then washed three times with 1-ml aliquots of detergent-containing lysis buffer to remove free radioactivity, and the well contents were scraped into 1-ml portions of 1 m NaOH and counted by γ scintillation. Integrity of the various NDSK derivatives was examined by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by either Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (T2G1) to the fibrin β15–21 sequence (36Procyk R. Kudryk B. Blood. 1991; 77: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL detection system. The 125I-labeled NDSK derivatives were analyzed by autoradiography of dried gels. HUVEC and HADMEC cadherins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, under reducing conditions, and Western blots performed using either the monoclonal antibody against human VE-cadherin or the polyclonal anti-pan-cadherin antibody, each at 10 μg/ml. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL detection system. The n values for all experiments range from three to six separate determinations of data points measured in duplicate. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Student's t test (two-sample assuming unequal variances) and single-factor analysis of variance with Microsoft Excel Analysis Toolpak version 5.0 software (Gray Matter International, Inc., Fremont, CA). Probability values of less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered significant. Fibrinogen can be cleaved with cyanogen bromide to generate a fragment termed the NDSK, which is composed of the intact N termini of the Aα, Bβ, and γ chains held together by disulfide bonds. The NDSK can be treated with thrombin, Atroxin, or proteas"

Inhalation of environmental allergens from pollens, mites, animal danders, insects, and fungi induces IgE antibody responses in ∼20% of the Western population. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions caused by IgE antibodies (Ab)1 occur in genetically predisposed individuals and may result in the development of allergic diseases such as rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Most allergens are soluble low molecular proteins or glycoproteins (5–50 kDa), which rapidly diffuse through mucosal surfaces where they cross-link IgE Ab bound to mast cells and basophils (1Chapman M.D. Roitt I.M. Delves P.J. Encyclopedia of Immunology. 2nd Ed. 1. Academic Press, London1998: 64-69Crossref Google Scholar). Over 200 allergen sequences have now been cloned. Allergens are usually single polypeptide chains and occasionally occur as homodimers (e.g. Alternaria, Alt a 1) or heterodimers (cat, Fel d 1). Sequence comparisons, structural studies, and assays of biological function have shown that allergens are a diverse group of proteins, including enzymes, ligand binding proteins, and structural and regulatory proteins (2Scheiner O. Kraft D. Allergy. 1995; 50: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Stewart G.A. Thompson P.J. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1996; 25: 1020-1044Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is some evidence, especially for mite allergens, that proteolytic enzyme activity contributes to allergenicity (4Hewitt C.R.A. Brown A.P. Hart B.J. Pritchard D.I. J. Exp.

Aerodynamic particle size, allergen dose, and sensitization through the respiratory tract are also important determinants for IgE responses. Cockroaches produce potent allergens that are a common cause of asthma in United States cities (6Chapman M.D. Smith A.M. Vailes L.D. Arruda L.K.

Vailes L.D. Pomés A. Arruda L.K. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 101: 156Google Scholar). A novel feature of these allergens, which has not previously been described among allergen structures, is that they are composed of several tandem repeats of ∼100 amino acid residues. The allergens show sequence homology to a mosquito protein associated with digestive function (ANG12 precursor), and the repeat sequences may have evolved from ancestral amino acid domains found in mitochondrial energy transfer proteins. A B. germanicacDNA library was prepared in the Uni-ZAPTM XR expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using 10 μg of mRNA isolated from adult cockroaches as described previously (9Arruda L.K.

Three positive clones (Bla g 1 clone 1, clone 2, and clone 3) were identified and further screened by plaque immunoassay for IgE Ab using 15 sera from cockroach-allergic patients. Nine sera were obtained from patients having detectable IgE Ab to Bla g 1 by radioimmunoassay; four patients had IgE Ab to cockroach, but not to Bla g 1; and two sera were from nonallergic controls. Positive plaques were detected using alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-human IgE (1:500) (KPL). In addition, the Bla g 1 cDNA clones were screened against a panel of high performance liquid chromatography-purified mAb to cockroach allergens: Bla g 1 (mAb 10A6), Bla g 2 (mAb 8F4), and Per a 1 (mAb Per a 1–03, kindly provided by Drs. Henmar and Schou, ALK-ABELLO, Horsholm, Denmark) (17Pollart S.M. Smith T.F. Morris E.C. Gelber L.E. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin.

The mAb were used at 1–10 μg/ml for screening, and bound mAb was detected using alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG Ab at 1/1000 dilution. The pBluescript phagemids containing cloned cDNA inserts were excised from the Uni-ZAPTM XR vector and plated with fresh Escherichia coli cells to produce colonies (ExAssist/SOLR System, Stratagene). The size of the inserts was assessed by double digestion with BamHI and KpnI. Double-stranded cDNA was isolated and sequenced using an ABI Prism 100 Model 377 automated DNA sequencer (Biomolecular Research Facility, University of Virginia). The nucleotide sequences of the three Bla g 1 cDNA clones were submitted to the GenBank with accession numbers AF072219 (Bla g 1.01 clone 1), AF072221(Bla g 1.01 clone 2), and AF072220(Bla g 1.02). 2These sequences have been scanned against the data base, and all sequences with significant relatedness to them identified and their accession numbers included. Sequences were analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis package (Wisconsin package, Oxford Molecular Group, Inc.). Protein sequences were compared with the GenBank, EBI, DDBJ, PDB, SwissProt, SPupdate, PIR data bases using FASTA and BLAST (18Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The GCG package was used to search for motifs in the amino acid sequences and for dot-plot analysis of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. Transmembrane spanning domains in the amino acid sequences were predicted using the program TMpredict, which is based on a data base of membrane-spanning protein segments, TMbase (21Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). Prediction of protein localization sites was done using the program PSORT (22Nakai K. Kanehisa M.

Amino-terminal amino acid sequences of purified Bla g 1 and Per a 1 (kindly provided by Dr. Schou, ALK-ABELLO) were determined by Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer (model 470-A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Biomolecular Research Facility (University of Virginia). The first 10 and 47 N-terminal amino acids were obtained for Bla g 1 and Per a 1, respectively. Cockroaches were dissected and body parts identified according to the method of Bell (23Bell W.J. Chapman Hall The Laboratory Cockroach: Experiments in Cockroach Anatomy, Physiology, and Behavior. 1st Ed. University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS1981: 33-38Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer and extracted overnight in 0.5 ml of BBS at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 15 min, extracts were stored at –20 °C until assayed. Bla g 1 levels in cockroach tissues were measured by mAb ELISA (17Pollart S.M. Smith T.F. Morris E.C. Gelber L.E. Platts-Mills T.A.E. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin.

Three cDNA clones encoding Bla g 1 were obtained by screening a B. germanica cDNA expression library with anti-Bla g 1 mAb, 10A6. The cDNA clones contained inserts of 1429, 1791, and 715 base pairs encoding 412, 492, and 188, respectively, amino acid fragments with calculated molecular masses of 45.8, 55.5, and 21.0 kDa, respectively, and isoelectric points of 4.31, 4.55, and 4.22, respectively. Bla g 1 clones 1 and 2 were isoallergens and showed 75% sequence identity (Fig. 1). Following the WHO/IUIS allergen nomenclature, the cDNAs were designated as Bla g 1.01 and Bla g 1.02. The third clone corresponded to a C-terminal fragment of clone 1, shown in bold in Fig. 1. IgE Ab reactivity to the three Bla g 1 clones, and to a recently isolated Per a 1 cDNA, was compared by plaque immunoassay (Fig. 2). The proportion of sera from nine patients allergic to Bla g 1 that recognized Bla g 1 clones 1, 2, and 3, and Per a 1 was 8/9 (89%), 9/9 (100%), 7/9 (78%), and 8/9 (89%), respectively. Four sera from patients allergic to Bla g 2, but not to Bla g 1, and two sera from nonallergic patients were used as controls and gave negative results. Monoclonal antibodies against Bla g 1 (10A6), Bla g 2 (8F4), and Per a 1 (Per a 1–03) were also tested; 10A6 and Per a 1–03 reacted strongly with Bla g 1 and Per a 1, whereas 8F4 gave no reaction (data not shown).Figure 2Plaque immunoassay showing the reactivity of IgE Ab from patients allergic to Bla g 1 (first 4 rows) and to cockroach allergens but not to Bla g 1 (last row), against fusion proteins produced by the three Bla g 1 cDNA clones: Bla g 1.01, Bla g 1.02, and Bla g 1.01 clone 2 (first three columns), and by Per a 1 clone (last column).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initially, we compared the sequence similarity of the three Bla g 1 clones with the antigenically related allergen fromP. americana, Per a 1 (16Melén E. Vailes L.D. Pomés A. Arruda L.K. Chapman M.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 101: 156Google Scholar). The results showed 70–72% sequence identity between Per a 1, Bla g 1.01, and Bla g 1.02 (Table I). The Per a 1 and the Bla g 1 sequences showed 32% homology to mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) ANG12 precursor protein (Fig. 3). The ANG12 precursor is found exclusively in the midgut of female mosquito and is induced following a blood meal.Table ISequence homology of Bla¦g¦1 cDNA clones with related cockroach allergens and ANG12 precursorBla¦g¦1.01Bla¦g¦1.01 (clone 2)Bla¦g¦1.02Bla¦g¦Bd90K (4058 base pairs)949574Per¦a¦1 (231 aa1-aaa, amino acids.)727070Cr-PII (274 aa)717071Cr-PII2 (446 aa)606460Cr-PII3 (395 aa)666764Cr-PII4 (228 aa)726970ANG12precursor (211 aa)3235321-a aa, amino acids.

Lee M.-F. Kao C.-Y.Y. Luo S.-F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 101: 832-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Table I). A partial nucleotide sequence of Bla g Bd90K from B. germanica was previously published, and the full sequence is deposited in the GenBank. This long sequence (4058 base pairs) is untranslatable as a whole unit. However, Bla g 1.01 clearly aligns with the translatable part of Bla g Bd90K C terminus, including the sequence following the stop codon, and with other translated parts in different reading frames (Fig. 3). Translation of the N terminus in the third reading frame encodes for a methionine after the first five nucleotides, which presumably is the start of the open reading frame for Bla g Bd90K protein (Fig. 3). The four P. americana clones described as Cr-PII (GenBank accession numbers U69261, U69260, U69957, and U78970) encode for sequences of 274, 446, 395, and 228 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 31, 51, 45 and 26 kDa, respectively. These clones show 60–72% amino acid sequence homology to Bla g 1 (Table I). One of the four cDNA clones (Cr-PII3) encodes for a protein which N terminus aligns with the N termini of Bla g Bd90K and ANG12 precursor proteins (Fig. 3, top panel). Together, the results of these sequence comparisons show an extended family of B. germanicaand P. americana allergen cDNAs encoding for proteins with deduced molecular masses of 20–90 kDa. A unique feature of the primary structure of Bla g 1.01 was the existence of multiple amino acid repeats, which have not previously been found in allergen sequences. Close inspection of the sequences revealed segments that were repeated every ∼100 amino acids and suggested that the sizes of the Bla g 1, Per a 1, and related cDNAs varied with the number of repeat sequences they contained. The repeats were compared using a dot-plot matrix analysis that plots a point file with the coordinates of the points in common between two sequences that are compared and a diagonal where two sequences are identical. Repeated fragments show as parallel lines above the diagonal. Dot-plot matrix analysis showed that there were four entire amino acid repeats in Bla g 1.01, five in Bla g 1.02, and two in Bla g 1.01 clone 2 and Per a 1 (Fig. 4). Each repeat is about 100 amino acids long. In Bla g 1.01, the first and third and the second and fourth repeats are identical (Fig. 5,panel A), and in Bla g 1.02, the first, third, and fifth and the second and fourth repeats are almost identical (Fig. 5,panel B).Figure 5Alignment of Bla g 1.01 (panel A) and Bla g 1.02 (panel B) entire repeats, and of Bla g 1.01 clone 2 with Bla g Bd90K translated repeat previously published by Helm et al. (panel C) (24Helm R. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Brenner R.J. Burks W. Bannon G.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 172-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Bla g Bd90K sequence contained seven repeats of ∼576 nucleotides (192 amino acids) (Fig. 4, and Ref. 24Helm R.

A repeat in Bla g Bd90K corresponds to two different consecutive repeats of Bla g 1.01, which occur within Bla g 1.01 clone 2 (Fig. 5,panel C), and this clone encodes for the basic unit that constitutes the 90-kDa protein (Fig. 5, panel C). Dot-plot analysis for ANG12 precursor, a less closely related sequence, shows absence of the clear structure of 100 amino acids repeats. Remains of that structure are apparent as smaller repeated fragments (Fig. 4). The Bla g 1.01 and Bla g 1.02 sequences contained myristoylation, amidation, and phosphorylation sites, with no obvious N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 6). Myristoylation sites are localized at the beginning of each repeat. Bla g 1.01 also has a motif that is characteristic of mitochondrial energy transfer proteins (P-x-[DE]-x-[LIVAT]-[RK]-x-[LRH]-[LIVMFY]), which is present in Per a 1 and degenerates in Bla g 1.02, and the ANG12 precursor. Proteins belonging to this family are evolutionarily related membrane proteins with three repeated sequences, each containing two transmembrane domains. However, analysis of Bla g 1 using the program TMpredict showed that Bla g 1 is not a membrane protein. The program PSORT predicts that Bla g 1 and Bla g Bd90K proteins would be directed to the outside of the cell following the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The N terminus of Bla g Bd90K contains an ER targeting signal (KLALIFLAFL) that would initiate transport across the ER (Fig. 6). Natural Bla g 1 and natural Per a 1 were partially sequenced by Edman degradation. The results showed that each natural allergen preparation contained three amino acid sequences. The N-terminal residues of each of these sequences were preceded by arginine residues (deduced from the cDNA sequence), suggesting that the natural allergen had been cleaved by trypsin-like enzymes (Fig. 6). The most abundant of the natural Bla g 1 sequences was located in the first and third Bla g 1.01 repeats, and the other two minority sequences were located in the second and third repeats. The results of these experiments suggest that Bla g 1 and Per a 1 are secreted in the cockroach digestive tract and cleaved by trypsin-like enzymes before being excreted. To localize sites of Bla g 1 production, cockroach tissues were dissected and assayed for Bla g 1 content by ELISA. The results showed that Bla g 1 was predominantly found in digestive organs, with highest amounts in the hindgut (633 units/mg protein), followed by the proventriculus (623 units/mg protein), and esophagus (334 units/mg protein). Previous studies established that Bla g 1 and Per a 1 are important allergens that elicit IgE Ab responses in ∼50% of cockroach allergic patients. They are the only allergens identified to date that show antigenic cross-reactivity between B. germanica and P. americana. In keeping with this, the cDNA cloning studies showed extensive amino acid sequence homology between Bla g 1 and Per a 1 (70–72% sequence identity), confirming that these are structurally related proteins. The three Bla g 1 cDNA clones encode the sequences of two isoallergens, Bla g 1.01 and Bla g 1.02, with 75% amino acid sequence identity. Antigenic cross-reactivity between bacterially expressed Bla g 1 and Per a 1 clones was confirmed by plaque immunoassay; IgE antibodies against Bla g 1 and the monoclonal anti-Bla g 1 antibody reacted strongly with Per a 1 fusion proteins, and, conversely, anti-Per a 1 mAb bound to Bla g 1 fusion proteins. The novel and unique feature of the Bla g 1 (and Per a 1) allergen sequences is that they contain multiple tandem repeats of ∼100 amino acid residues. This type of structure has not previously been described for any allergen but does occur in other proteins. An earlier report by Helm et al. described a long (4058 base pair) cockroach sequence with seven 576-nucleotide repeats (24Helm R. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Brenner R.J. Burks W. Bannon G.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 172-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the full sequence was untranslatable, and the identity of the putative ∼90 kDa protein encoded by the sequence could not be established. Our data clearly shows that Bla g 1, Per a 1, Bla g Bd90K, and the four recently described Cr-PII sequences (25Wu C.-H. Wang N.M. Lee M.-F. Kao C.-Y.Y. Luo S.-F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 101: 832-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), form a family of structurally and antigenically related cockroach allergens, which differ in the number of amino acid repeats they contain. Collectively, these sequences belong to the “Group 1” allergens produced by B. germanica and P. americana. It also seems likely that these allergens occur in other cockroach species. Dot-plot analysis showed that two consecutive amino acid repeats from Bla g 1.01 corresponded to one of the Bla g Bd90K nucleotide repeats. Analysis of these repeat amino acid sequences suggests that they probably derived from an original domain of approximately 100 amino acids by duplication. Both repeats in the “duplex” would diverge in a way that they are recognized by dot-plot analysis as two amino acid repeats but the corresponding nucleotide sequence does not show any repeat. Despite their divergence during evolution, both repeats have conserved amino acids that may be important for biological function (26Bowie J.U. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 247: 1306-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The “duplex” would replicate up to seven times to form the long DNA with seven tandem repeats in the Bla g Bd90K nucleotide sequence. The related mosquito protein ANG12 precursor has lost the clear structure of 100 amino acid repeats, indicating that ANG12 precursor had degenerated from the original structure during evolution. This would be consistent with the fact that mosquitoes appeared later in evolution than cockroaches in which the repeat allergen structure was conserved. The similarity between Bla g 1 and mitochondrial energy transfer proteins is interesting, because these proteins share amino acid motifs in a structure involving repeat sequences. This raises the possibility that the allergen may have evolved from a primordial mitochondrial sequence. Several lines of evidence indicate that the Bla g Bd90K cDNA clone contains the open reading frame for Bla g Bd90K protein: (i) labeled Bla g Bd90K insert hybridized to a single-size mRNA of approximately the same size, 4kb (24Helm R. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Brenner R.J. Burks W. Bannon G.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 172-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); (ii) there is a methionine in the third reading frame translation of the Bla g Bd90K N terminus; (iii) a 90-kDa protein was reported in cockroach extracts (24Helm R. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Brenner R.J. Burks W. Bannon G.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 172-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); and (iv) the N terminus of the third reading frame translation of Bla g Bd90K aligned with the N termini of the related proteins Cr-PII3 and ANG12 precursor. Despite the evidence for production of a 90-kDa protein, a broad range of molecular masses (6–37 kDa) has previously been reported for purified Bla g 1 and Per a 1 and for cross-reacting IgE Ab binding bands in cockroach extracts (13Schou C. Lind P. Fernandez-Caldas E. Lockey R.F. Løwenstein H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1990; 86: 935-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Pollart S.M. Mullins D.E. Vailes L.D.

Immunol. 1996; 98: 172-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Natural Bla g 1 and Per a 1 appear to be produced following trypsin cleavage. A 90-kDa protein could be a precursor (like ANG12 precursor) that would be post-translationally modified and cleaved in certain sites such as myristoylation sites. The number of repeats contained in trypsin-cleaved fragments or in fragments derived from post-translational modifications would explain this broad range of molecular masses. If cockroach trypsin-like enzymes have the same characteristics as mosquito trypsin-like enzymes, they may have been co-purified with Bla g 1 and Per a 1 (27Graf R. Boehlen P. Briegel H. Experientia. 1991; 47: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Then, the trypsin cleavage of the natural allergen could take place not only in the digestive tract but also during and after purification. Plaque immunoassay with Bla g 1.01 clone 2 also showed that a 21-kDa unit, which contained two amino acid repeats, is sufficient to be recognized by Bla g 1- and Per a 1-specific IgE antibodies. Therefore, cloning the “duplex” represents cloning the basic allergenic unit of Bla g 1. Despite the presence in Bla g 1 of a signature motif for mitochondrial energy transfer membrane proteins, Bla g 1 is not a membrane protein. Rather, Bla g 1 is predicted to follow a secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum, for which it has a targeting signal, to the outside of the cell and into the digestive tract. Accordingly, high levels of Bla g 1 were measured by ELISA in the proventriculus and hindgut, in keeping with a previous report of localization of cockroach allergens in gastrointestinal cells using IgE Ab (28Zwick H. Popp W. Sertl K. Rauscher H. Wanke T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1991; 87: 626-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). From the digestive tract, Bla g 1 would be excreted into the feces, where it becomes a potential allergen if inhaled by humans. The homology between Bla g 1 and mosquito ANG 12 suggests that Bla g 1 may have a digestive function. Mosquitos (A. gambiae) also produce trypsin-like proteins after taking blood meals (29Müller H.-M. Catteruccia F. Vizioli J. della Torre A. Crisanti A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Müller H.-M. Crampton J.M. della Torre A. Sinden R. Crisanti A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2891-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We speculate that similar enzymes may be produced in the cockroach digestive tract and give rise to the different molecular forms of the Bla g 1 and Per a 1 allergens. Proteases are found in commercial cockroach allergen extracts and can reduce allergenic potency when mixed with other extracts (31Esch R.E. Klein R Regulatory Control and Standardization of Allergenic Extracts. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1991: 171-179Google Scholar, 32Nelson H.S. Iklé J.D. Buchmeier A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 382-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The precise digestive function of Bla g 1 and ANG 12 remains to be determined. In conclusion, the molecular cloning of Bla g 1 has revealed a new family of “Group 1” cockroach allergens. The novel feature of these allergens is the occurrence of multiple tandem amino acid repeats, which has not previously been described among allergen structures. We have recently expressed Per a 1 in the yeast, Pichia pastoris. Manipulation and overexpression of the sequences in appropriate vectors will facilitate structural and immunologic studies and the production of recombinant allergens for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

The first human TSHR sequence submitted differs from subsequently cloned wild-type receptors by an exchange of a conserved Y residue within transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) for an H residue. We did not detect the Y601H mutant in 263 European individuals, but confirmed the homozygous occurrence of TSHR-Y601. Expression of TSHR-Y601H in COS-7 cells revealed a loss of constitutive cAMP production and selective lack of TSH-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis, whereas agonist-induced cAMP formation remained unaltered. Analysis of several mutant receptors (Y601A, Y601D, Y601F, Y601K, Y601P, Y601S, Y601W, Y601Δ) did not show restoration of constitutive activity and dual signaling, thus suggesting a functional role of a properly spaced hydroxyl group at position 601. Molecular modeling revealed that the formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Y601 in TM5 and the carbonyl oxygen of A623 in the peptide backbone of TM6 is critical for the receptor to adopt active conformations that impart wild-type signaling properties. Our findings indicate that multiple active receptor states underlie coupling of a G-protein-coupled receptor to different G-proteins.—Biebermann, H., Scho¨neberg, T., Schulz, A., Krause, G., Gru¨ters, A., Schultz, G., Gudermann, T.

Cytokine signal transduction in hematopoietic cells includes the activation of latent transcription factors termed signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).1 Seven mammalian STATs are known, referred to as STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT6 (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). STAT proteins are activated by direct phosphorylation by cytokine receptor-associated tyrosine kinases called Janus-activated kinases (JAKs). The JAK family of tyrosine kinases includes four members known as JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2 (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 3Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). JAKs are activated by cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. The STATs are subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAKs, accompanied by STAT homo- or heterodimerization and the translocation of STAT dimers to the nucleus, where STATs activate gene transcription through binding to specific response elements in gene promoters. Recent reports have also implicated the Src family of tyrosine kinases in the phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins (4Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J.

STAT activation is transient in nature and is likely terminated by STAT tyrosine dephosphorylation because the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate prolongs STAT activation in cells treated with the inhibitor (12Igarashi K.

We have shown previously that Ang II stimulation of VSMCs induces the rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. Ang II-induced JAK2 phosphorylation is accompanied by an increased association of the enzyme with the AT1 receptor and an increase in enzyme catalytic activity. In addition, Ang II induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, associated with a translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus (16Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P.

B., Venema, V. J., Ju, H., Eaton, D. C., and Venema, R. C. (1998) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the JAK/STAT pathway in VSMCs is critical to Ang II stimulation of cell proliferation by demonstrating that the pharmacological JAK2 inhibitor, AG-490, or electroporation of neutralizing antibodies against STAT1 and STAT3 inhibits Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation and DNA synthesis (17Marrero M.B.

However, the possible involvement of Src kinases in Ang II-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and translocation has not been investigated. The tyrosine phosphatase responsible for STAT1 dephosphorylation in VSMCs is also unidentified. Therefore, in the present study, we have used specific enzyme inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides to define the roles of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase and Src family tyrosine kinase p59 Fyn in the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 in VSMCs. We have also examined the role of the dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase MKP-1 in STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation.

Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) by the method of Dignam et al. (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). p59 Fyn autophosphorylation was measured as described previously for p60 c-Src (29Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The SIE oligonucleotide was 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated with nuclear extracts in the presence of 1 μg of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid), 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were analyzed by autoradiography. We have shown previously that JAK2 is transiently activated in VSMCs in response to Ang II stimulation associated with tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 (16Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To confirm that these events are causally related rather than being simply temporally correlated, we utilized the specific JAK2 inhibitor, AG-490. This inhibitor inhibits JAK2 with an IC50 in the low (<5 μm) micromolar range, whereas concentrations as high as 50 μm have no effect on the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases (36Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpala E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Rolfman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Cultured rat aortic VSMCs were incubated for 1 h with serum-free medium only (control) or with serum-free medium supplemented with 10 μm AG-490. Cells were then treated with Ang II (100 nm) for various times and lysed, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-STAT1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, Ang II induced a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (91 kDa) in untreated cells that peaked at 15–30 min. However, STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was completely blocked by pretreatment of the cells with AG-490. Ang II-induced STAT1 phosphorylation is thus dependent on the activity of JAK2 and very likely involves direct JAK2 phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein. A major additional band or doublet observed in these (and other) immunoblots at about 45–50 kDa is due to the reactivity of the secondary antibody with the IgG heavy chains of the immunoprecipitating antibody. To further confirm that JAK2 phosphorylates STAT1 in response to Ang II stimulation, we utilized an antisense oligonucleotide strategy. A JAK2 antisense oligonucleotide, which has been shown previously to suppress JAK2 expression in the murine erythroleukemia cell line HCD-57 (30Bittorf T. Jaster R. Lüdtke B. Kamper B. Brock J. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was tested for its inhibitory effects on JAK2 expression in rat aortic VSMCs. As a negative control, a complementary JAK2 sense oligonucleotide was also tested. VSMCs were treated for various times with either the antisense or the sense oligonucleotide, and levels of JAK2 protein expression were quantitated by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the JAK2 antisense oligonucleotide completely suppressed JAK2 (130 kDa) expression after 12 h of treatment. In contrast, the sense oligonucleotide had no effect. Experiments were then carried out in which VSMCs were treated with either the antisense or the sense oligonucleotide for 12 h and then stimulated with Ang II for various times before the analysis of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation as described before. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the JAK2 antisense oligonucleotide (but not the JAK2 sense oligonucleotide) completely blocked Ang II-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 2Effect of JAK2 sense and antisense oligonucleotides on JAK2 expression and Ang II-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMCs. A, VSMCs were treated with JAK2 sense and antisense oligonucleotides for the times indicated, the cells were lysed, and JAK2 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates with the anti-JAK2 antibody. Precipitated proteins were then immunoblotted with the anti-JAK2 antibody. B, VSMCs were pretreated with either the JAK2 sense or antisense oligonucleotides for 12 h. Cells were then treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times indicated and lysed, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with the anti-STAT1 antibody. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown previously that the p60 c-Src tyrosine kinase is activated in Ang II-stimulated VSMCs (28Marrero M.B.

Because Src family tyrosine kinases have been suggested to have a role in the phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins (4Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J.

J. 1998; 331: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that Src kinases might be required for STAT1 phosphorylation. Ang II-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was thus examined after the treatment of VSMCs with the Src family kinase-selective inhibitor, PP1. PP1 has IC50s for the inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases that are in the low nanomolar range. In contrast, the IC50 of the compound for JAK2 is greater than 50 μm (37Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). VSMCs were preincubated for 30 min in the presence and absence of 1 μm PP1 before stimulation of the cells for various times with Ang II and analysis of the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. As shown in Fig. 3, PP1 pretreatment of VSMCs completely blocked Ang II-stimulated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that Src family kinase activity is indeed required for STAT1 phosphorylation in response to Ang II. PP1 potently inhibits several Src tyrosine kinase family members including p60 c-Src, p56 Lck, and p59 Fyn (37Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). To determine whether it is p60 c-Src specifically that is required for Ang II-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, we utilized an antisense oligonucleotide to p60 c-Src that was previously shown to inhibit the expression of the enzyme in murine primary osteoblasts and bone marrow cells (31Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). VSMCs were treated for 6, 12, and 24 h with either p60 c-Src antisense or complementary sense oligonucleotides, and p60 c-Src protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the Src antisense (but not the sense) oligonucleotide completely suppressed p60 c-Src expression within 24 h. Additional experiments were performed examining the effect of a 24-h treatment of the antisense oligonucleotide on the subsequent Ang II-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation. Untreated (control) cells and antisense-treated cells were stimulated with Ang II for various times, and STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4 C, p60 c-Src antisense treatment had no effect on STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that p60 c-Src does not have a role in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor. Another Src family tyrosine kinase that has been previously shown to be activated in response to Ang II in cardiac myocytes is p59 Fyn (38Sadoshima J.-i. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of a p59 Fyn antisense oligonucleotide on Ang II stimulation of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in VSMCs, using the same protocol described above for p60 c-Src. The Fyn antisense oligonucleotide, which has been previously shown to block p59 Fyn expression in murine macrophages (32Li Y. Chen B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), completely inhibited the expression of the enzyme in VSMCs after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the Fyn sense oligonucleotide was without effect. VSMCs were then treated with Ang II for various times after a 24-h pretreatment with the Fyn antisense oligonucleotide. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was then determined as described previously. As shown in Fig. 4 C, treatment of VSMCs with the p59 Fyn antisense oligonucleotide completely blocked Ang II stimulation of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest that among the members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, it is p59 Fyn specifically that is required for Ang II-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of STAT proteins promotes their translocation to the cell nucleus, where they activate the transcription of specific genes. The roles of both JAK2 and p59 Fyn tyrosine kinases in Ang II-induced nuclear translocation were thus examined in nuclear translocation studies. VSMCs were exposed to Ang II for various times after pretreatment or no pretreatment with either AG-490 or PP1. Cell nuclei were then isolated as described previously (16Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted with anti-STAT1 antibody. In control experiments (no pretreatment), Ang II induced the nuclear translocation of STAT1 within 30 min after ligand addition. In contrast, in cells that were pretreated with either AG-490 or PP1, no nuclear translocation was observed (Fig. 5), suggesting that both JAK2 and p59 Fyn tyrosine kinases are required for Ang II-stimulated nuclear translocation of STAT1. STAT translocation to the nucleus induces the formation of a complex of STAT proteins termed sis-inducing factor (SIF) that binds the DNA sequence termed SIE in the promoter of a number of genes (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar, 3Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). The JAK and Src family-selective inhibitors, AG-490 and PP1, were thus tested for their ability to block Ang II-induced binding of SIF to SIE in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. VSMCs were pretreated for various times with either AG-490, PP1, or an inactive tyrphostin related to AG-490 termed tyrphostin A1 and then stimulated with Ang II for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared from each condition and tested for their abilities to gel shift a32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the SIF consensus binding site. As shown in Fig. 6, both AG-490 and PP1 time-dependently blocked the binding of SIF to the labeled probe. In contrast, the inactive tyrphostin A1 was without effect. These results suggest that both JAK2 and p59 Fyn tyrosine kinases are required for Ang II-stimulated binding of SIF to SIE. The complete blockade of Ang II-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by pharmacological and antisense inhibitors of both JAK2 and p59 Fyn tyrosine kinases demonstrates that both enzymes are absolutely required for Ang II activation of the STAT1-mediated signaling pathway in VSMCs. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the two enzymes act in series in a phosphorylation cascade. The possibility that p59 Fyn activation is upstream in a cascade from JAK2 activation was tested in studies in which VSMCs were pretreated or not pretreated with PP1 before Ang II stimulation and the analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2. JAK2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in these experiments with a time course similar to that reported previously (16Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, no inhibitory effect of PP1 on JAK2 phosphorylation was observed, indicating that p59 Fyn activation is not a prerequisite for JAK2 phosphorylation and activation. We also examined the possibility that Ang II-induced JAK2 activation might be upstream from p59 Fyn activation. VSMCs were pretreated or not pretreated with AG-490 and then treated with Ang II. p59 Fyn was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the activity of the enzyme was determined by an immune complex autophosphorylation assay as described previously (29Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ang II induced a transient increase in p59 Fyn activity with a time course similar to that described previously for Ang II stimulation of p60 c-Src activity (29Ishida M. Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Ishida T. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of VSMCs with AG-490 had no effect on p59 Fyn activation, suggesting that JAK2 activation is not a requisite upstream event for p59 Fyn activation. Because JAK2 and p59 Fyn tyrosine kinases do not appear to function in series in an Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation cascade, we investigated another possible explanation for why both enzymes are absolutely required for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. JAK2 is known to phosphorylate STAT1 directly and probably does so in response to Ang II stimulation of VSMCs. However, JAK2 phosphorylation of STAT1 may require the presence of active p59 Fyn. For example, activated p59 Fyn could function as a common docking site or an adaptor protein for both JAK2 and STAT1 in VSMCs that facilitates the interaction of the JAK enzyme with the STAT substrate. This hypothesis predicts that JAK2 and STAT1 will both form complexes with p59 Fyn in response to Ang II stimulation. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a commercially available p59 Fyn-GST fusion protein in in vitro binding assays. Cultured cells were exposed to Ang II for various times, and cell lysates were prepared. Lysates and the p59 Fyn-GST fusion protein prebound to agarose beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively in buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and the bound proteins were eluted. The amount of JAK2 eluted (and therefore bound by the fusion protein) was quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-JAK2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 7, Ang II stimulated a rapid and transient complex formation between p59 Fyn and JAK2. Similar experiments were also carried out to determine whether Ang II induced complex formation of p59 Fyn with STAT1. Lysates from Ang II-stimulated cells were incubated with the p59 Fyn-GST fusion protein, and STAT1 binding to the fusion protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT1 antibody. In these experiments, Ang II was found to promote p59 Fyn-STAT1 complex formation (Fig. 8) with a time course that overlaps that of Ang II-stimulated p59 Fyn-JAK2 complex formation. Thus, p59 Fyn does appear to function in VSMCs as an Ang II-activated docking protein for both JAK2 and STAT1. In this role, p59 Fyn would bring JAK2 and STAT1 together in close physical proximity, which could be a requirement for JAK2-mediated STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 8Time course of Ang II-induced complex formation of STAT1 with p59 Fyn. VSMCs were treated with Ang II (100 nm) for the times indicated, and the cells were lysed. Lysates were incubated with a p59 Fyn-GST fusion protein prebound to agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and the bound proteins were eluted. The amount of STAT1 eluted for each time point was quantitated by immunoblotting with the anti-STAT1 antibody. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because STAT1 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, it is probable that it is inactivated by tyrosine dephosphorylation. STAT1 is phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues, and both types of phosphorylation are required for full STAT1 activity (10Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 11Ng J. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24542-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inactivation of STAT1 by dephosphorylation is likely to occur in the nucleus while the protein is bound to the promoter of target genes. Therefore, we considered the possibility that tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT1 might be catalyzed by the nuclear dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1, which dephosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues of mitogen-activated protein kinase, resulting in mitogen-activated protein kinase inactivation (39Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 40Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). VSMCs were transfected for 16 h with a MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide termed 8155 that has been previously shown to significantly inhibit MKP-1 expression in rat aortic VSMCs (33Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As a negative control, cells were also transfected with a complementary sense oligonucleotide. After treatment with the antisense and sense oligonucleotides, cells were treated with Ang II for various times. Cells were lysed, and lysates were immunoblotted with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated (but not the nonphosphorylated) form of STAT1. As shown in Fig. 9, the MKP sense oligonucleotide had no effect on the usually observed time course of Ang II-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, the antisense oligonucleotide had two clear effects on the time course observed. STAT1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated even without Ang II exposure and remained phosphorylated until at least 120 min after exposure, a time at which STAT1 was completely dephosphorylated in the sense control. Similar results were also obtained using a different experimental protocol in which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Ang II-stimulated VSMC lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and probed with anti-STAT1 antibody. These data thus suggest that MKP-1 is the phosphatase responsible for STAT1 dephosphorylation and inactivation in VSMCs. We have shown previously that MKP-1 gene expression is rapidly induced in VSMCs in response to Ang II stimulation (41Duff J.L. Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This induction may therefore provide a negative feedback mechanism that contributes to the termination of Ang II-induced JAK/STAT1 signaling."

It has been suggested that homocysteine-induced cell injury involves oxidative damage because homocysteine is readily oxidized in plasma to form reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, and cell injury caused by homocysteine is blocked by catalase (14Wall R.T. Harlan J.M. Harker L.A. Striker G.E. Thromb. Res. 1980; 18: 113-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 15Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that, unlike their response to other oxidative stress conditions, exposure of cultured human vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to homocysteine fails to elicit an oxidative stress response (18Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Instead, homocysteine causes reductive stress with decreased expression of several antioxidant enzymes and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction. Given that homocysteine decreases intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity (19Upchurch Jr., G.R. Welch G.N. Fabian A.J. Freedman J.E. Johnson J.L. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17012-17017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), these studies raise the possibility that homocysteine may enhance the cytotoxic effect of agents or conditions known to generate reactive oxygen species. The purpose of this study was to test this possibility. In this investigation, we demonstrate that homocysteine alters mitochondrial gene expression, structure, and function and that severe mitochondrial damage occurs in the presence of homocysteine and H2O2. These studies support a mechanism whereby homocysteine and H2O2 act synergistically to cause mitochondrial damage, thereby promoting cell injury and/or dysfunction. The human megakaryocytic cell line DAMI was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Homocysteine, homoserine, methionine, cysteine,S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM),S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH),N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC),dl-dithiothreitol, cupric sulfate (Cu2+), and catalase (Sigma) were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium, which was filtered and added to cell cultures at the desired concentrations. For heat shock experiments, DAMI cells were heated for 2 h at 42 °C in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After exposure to heat, cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C for 6 or 18 h and then treated with homocysteine, in the absence or presence of Cu2+. Unless otherwise stated, DAMI cells were used at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After incubation for the appropriate time period, cell number and viability were assessed by counting cells in a hemocytometer after suspension in PBS containing 0.5% trypan blue. All solutions were prepared with water that had been treated with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma) and autoclaved. Following treatment, DAMI cells were washed with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy total RNA kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For mRNA differential display experiments, contaminating DNA was removed by incubation of the RNA with 2 units of RQ DNase (Promega, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and 12 units of RNasin (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to 100 μl, samples were mixed with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (3:1) and centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was transferred to an RNase-free, 1.7-ml centrifuge tube. After the addition of 10 μl of 3m sodium acetate and 300 μl of absolute ethanol, the RNA was precipitated overnight at −70 °C. RNA was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed briefly with 85% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA samples withA 260/A 280 ratios above 1.6 were stored at −70 °C for further analysis. mRNA differential display was performed using the RNA map kits (GenHunter, Brookline, MA) as described previously (18Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Candidate cDNA fragments excised from the display gel were amplified by PCR, purified from 1% agarose gels, and used as probes on Northern blots. Amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into T-ended pBluescript II (KS) (Stratagene), and double-stranded DNA sequencing was done using a modified T7 polymerase system (Sequenase, version 2, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The cDNA sequences were analyzed and compared for similarity with sequences deposited in the EMBL and GenBankTM DNA data bases. Total RNA was fractionated on 2.2m formaldehyde/1.2% agarose gels and transferred overnight onto Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes (Bio-Rad) in 10× SSC. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (PDI Bioscience, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) prior to hybridization. Specific probes were generated by labeling the reamplified or cloned cDNA fragments with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C, the filters were washed as described previously (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), covered in plastic wrap, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AP film at −70 °C for 1–3 days. Probes for NADH-coenzyme Q oxireductase subunit 5 (ND5), 12 S and 16 S rRNAs were derived from mouse mitochondrial DNA, whereas HSP60 cDNA was obtained from StressGen (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Hybridization with a partial cDNA fragment to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. Changes in the expression of mRNA transcripts were quantified using the ImageMaster VDS and Analysis Software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A human EC 5′-STRETCH cDNA library in λgt11 (CLONTECH, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was screened using a 32P-labeled dhc-1 cDNA probe. Positive cDNA phage clones were plaque-purified as described previously (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the size of the cDNA inserts was determined by PCR using λgt11 forward and reverse primers (synthesized at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, McMaster University). The largest cDNA inserts were excised from the λgt11 vector with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II (KS). DNA sequencing and homology searches were done as described above. Total cellular proteins were immunoblotted as described previously (18Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) using antibodies directed against either cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, IV, Vb (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or HSP60 (StressGen). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine IgG as the standard. Control or treated DAMI cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and fixed for 2 h in 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS. After overnight fixation in 1% OsO4in PBS, cells were washed, dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections (70 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and examined using a Jeol 100B electron microscope. A minimum of 10 micrographs were evaluated for each experimental condition. To measure mitochondrial respiration rates in control or homocysteine-treated DAMI cells, steady-state oxygen consumption of whole cells permeabilized with digitonin (0.005%) was quantified at 37 °C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co. Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). After treatment, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in respiration buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.01m MgCl2, 0.02 m HEPES, 0.02m KH2PO4, pH 7.1) at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. To each 100-μl aliquot of cell suspension was added 1 μl of digitonin diluted in 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 610 μl of the suspension was then loaded into the microchamber. Trypan blue uptake was used to confirm plasma membrane permeabilization. After measuring baseline respiration rates, 5 mm succinate and 1 mm adenosine diphosphate were added to maximally stimulate mitochondrial respiration rates. Respiration rates were measured in the absence or presence of 1 μm oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so that the increase attributable to mitochondria could be determined. Respiration rates were calculated as percentage of oxygen consumed per min per 1 × 106cells, and air-saturated buffer was considered as 100%. Intracellular levels of H2O2 were determined by flow cytometry using the nonfluorescent probe 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescin (DCF) diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Removal of the acetate groups by intracellular esterases results in the release of dichlorofluorescin, which upon exposure to hydroperoxides, such as H2O2 and lipid peroxides, is hydrolyzed to the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein (21Cathcart R. Schwiers E. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). DAMI cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) pulsed for 60 min in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 μmDCF-diacetate (10 mm stock solution freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide) were pelleted and resuspended in fresh media without DCF-diacetate. Cells were then treated for 60 min in medium containing either Cu2+, homocysteine, homocysteine and Cu2+, or H2O2. A minimum of 5 × 105 cells from each treatment were analyzed to obtain a distribution of population fluorescence at 525 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation using an EPICS PROFILE II flow cytometer (Coulter, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Data represent a comparison of treatedversus control samples in which control means were set to 100% in each individual test. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured using the BIOXYTECH GSH-400 colorimetric assay as described by the manufacturer (OXIS International, Portland, OR). Briefly, DAMI cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 4 h in control medium or medium containing either homocysteine or NAC. After washing in Hanks' balanced saline solution, cells were snap-frozen on dry ice, homogenized in ice-cold 2.5% (w/v) metaphosphoric acid (Sigma), and centrifuged at 4 °C to remove any insoluble material. Samples were measured at a final absorbance of 400 nm in a LKB Ultrospec II spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and intracellular GSH levels were determined from a standard curve using reduced GSH (Sigma). Mitochondrial mass was measured by flow cytometry using nonyl acridine orange (Molecular Bioprobes), a fluorescent dye capable of binding mitochondrial cardiolipin in an energy-independent manner. DAMI cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 105cells/ml in RPMI medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After a 4-h adjustment period in fresh medium, cells were treated for 18 h in medium containing either Cu2+, homocysteine, or homocysteine and Cu2+. Nonyl acridine orange was then added to a final concentration 0.1 μm for 45 min, and the fluorescence distribution of each treated cell population was evaluated by flow cytometry. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Significance of differences between control and treated groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance. If significant differences were detected, unpaired Student's t tests were performed. For all analyses, p values <0.05 were considered significant. Earlier studies have shown that in the presence of Cu2+, homocysteine is readily oxidized in plasma or culture medium to generate H2O2, which can cause cell lysis (14Wall R.T. Harlan J.M. Harker L.A. Striker G.E. Thromb. Res. 1980; 18: 113-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 15Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Table I, exposure of DAMI cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) to 1 mm homocysteine for up to 18 h, in the absence or presence of Cu2+, had no effect on cell viability. However, viability was dependent on initial cell density because DAMI cells seeded at <1 × 105cells/ml were lysed when exposed to homocysteine and Cu2+for 18 h. In contrast, neither Cu2+ nor catalase alone had any significant effect on cell viability.Table IEffect of homocysteine, in the absence or presence of Cu2+, on DAMI cell viabilityTreatmentLive cells%Control93 ± 0.6Control + 4 μm Cu2+87 ± 2.61 mmhomocysteine93 ± 1.05 mm homocysteine87 ± 1.91 mm homocysteine + 4 μmCu2+90 ± 1.85 mm homocysteine + 4 μm Cu2+54 ± 4.41 mmhomocysteine + 4 μm Cu2+ + catalase (2500 units/ml)89 ± 0.65 mm homocysteine + 4 μm Cu2+ + catalase (2500 units/ml)80 ± 1.7Catalase (2500 units/ml)93 ± 1.5DAMI cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in control or test medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 18 h.

Open table in a new tab DAMI cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in control or test medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 18 h. Cell viability was assessed by counting cells on a hemocytometer after suspension in PBS containing 0.5% trypan blue stain. The data represent the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. To examine the effect on cell growth, DAMI cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were exposed to varying concentrations of homocysteine, in the absence or presence of Cu2+, for periods up to 7 days (Fig. 1). Although 1 mm homocysteine had no significant effect on growth rates, 5 mm homocysteine significantly reduced growth (p < 0.01) beyond 2 days. Unlike 1 mmhomocysteine alone, exposure to 1 mm homocysteine and Cu2+ completely blocked cell growth and led to cell lysis by 48 h. In contrast, Cu2+ alone had no significant effect on cell growth rates (data not shown). To identify changes in gene expression induced by homocysteine, we compared mRNA differential display patterns from DAMI cells exposed to 1 mmhomocysteine for 18 h with those from cells cultured in the absence of homocysteine. After screening through 48 primer combinations, a total of 10 differentially expressed cDNA fragments were identified on sequencing gels. Among these, a cDNA fragment amplified with T12MG and AP-1 primers, designated dhc-1 (Fig. 2 A), was shown to be reproducibly up-regulated in DAMI cells exposed to homocysteine. Initial Northern blot hybridization experiments using RNA from control or homocysteine-treated DAMI cells indicated that the dhc-1 cDNA fragment hybridized to a homocysteine-inducible transcript of ∼1.8 kb (Fig. 2 B). This 1.8-kb transcript was also shown to be up-regulated in human umbilical vein ECs exposed to homocysteine (data not shown). Searching of the GenBank™ and EMBL data bases revealed that dhc-1 had >96% sequence similarity to a human cDNA clone designated HHCJ64 (GenBank™ accession number M62278). To identify this cDNA, a human EC library in λgt11 was screened with the dhc-1 cDNA fragment to obtain larger cDNA clones. Five positive phage clones were plaque-purified. The largest of the cDNA inserts (designated 16-1), which was ∼1.8 kb in size, was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to encode cytochrome c oxidase III/ATPase 6,8 (CO3/ATPase 6,8), a mitochondrial electron transport chain transcript encoded by mitochondrial DNA. To confirm that expression of CO3/ATPase 6,8 in DAMI cells was induced by homocysteine, total RNA from cells grown in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of homocysteine was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization, using the 16-1 cDNA as a probe. Of significance, 16-1 was shown to hybridize to two major transcripts of approximately 1.8 and 0.9 kb, respectively (Fig. 2 C), which correspond to the primary and mature transcripts of CO3/ATPase 6,8 (22Whitfield C.D. Jefferson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18852-18859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Exposure of DAMI cells to increasing concentrations of homocysteine for 18 h caused a dose-dependent increase in the steady-state levels of both transcripts (Fig. 2 C). Even exposure to as little as 0.1 mmhomocysteine for 18 h increased both the primary and mature CO3/ATPase 6,8 mRNA transcripts by 2- and 3-fold, respectively. In addition to homocysteine, other thiol-containing agents, such as dithiothreitol, NAC, and cysteine were shown to induce CO3/ATPase 6,8 mRNA levels (data not shown). However, this effect was not solely dependent on the thiol group because mRNA levels induced by these agents were lower than those observed for homocysteine. To determine whether homocysteine increases the expression of other mitochondrial genes, total RNA from control and homocysteine-treated DAMI cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis using the following mitochondrial probes: ND5 (component of the electron transport chain), 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and HSP60 (nuclear-encoded mitochondrial chaperone). Fig. 2 D shows that the steady-state levels of these transcripts also are up-regulated by homocysteine. In contrast, there was no change in the steady-state mRNA levels of GAPDH. Although HSP60 was induced, HSP70 mRNA levels remained unchanged (data not shown), suggesting that induction of HSP60 is not due oxidative stress, a finding consistent with previous studies (18Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Despite an increase in mitochondrial RNA levels upon exposure to homocysteine for 18 h, Western blot analysis using antibodies against cytochrome C oxidase subunits I, II, IV, Vb, or HSP60 indicated no significant increase in mitochondrial protein levels at 18 h (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether altered mitochondrial gene expression induced by homocysteine involves reactive oxygen species generated by Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation of homocysteine, Northern blot analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from DAMI cells exposed to 1 mm homocysteine, in the absence or presence of 4 μm Cu2+, for up to 18 h (Fig. 4). As expected, exposure of DAMI cells to 1 mm homocysteine alone caused a time-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of both CO3/ATPase 6,8 and HSP60 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the steady-state mRNA levels of CO3/ATPase 6,8 and HSP60 decreased in a time-dependent manner when DAMI cells were exposed to both 1 mm homocysteine and Cu2+ (Fig. 4 B). The absence of smearing of the bands suggests that the decrease in the mRNA levels is likely due to a reduced transcription rate and not degradation. By 18 h, mRNA levels of CO3/ATPase 6,8 and HSP60 were <10% of control levels. However, this effect was completely blocked by the addition of catalase (Fig. 4 C). Additional mitochondrial transcripts, including ND5, 12S, and 16S rRNAs, also decreased to a similar extent when DAMI cells were exposed to homocysteine and Cu2+; however, GAPDH levels were unchanged (data not shown). Exposure of DAMI cells to either Cu2+ or catalase alone had no effect on mitochondrial gene expression. Mitochondrial protein levels were also decreased by 18 h in the presence of at least 1 mmhomocysteine and Cu2+ (Fig. 3 B); however, the decrease was not as dramatic as that observed with RNA levels. Having shown that homocysteine and Cu2+ decrease mitochondrial mRNA levels, we next determined the minimal concentrations of homocysteine and Cu2+ necessary to cause this effect. In the presence of 4 μm Cu2+, concentrations of homocysteine less than 1 mm did not significantly decrease CO3/ATPase 6,8 mRNA levels (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, concentrations of at least 1 μm Cu2+ together with 1 mm homocysteine are needed to decrease mRNA levels to <10% of control levels (Fig. 5 A). In addition to homocysteine, other structurally related molecules were examined for their ability to decrease CO3/ATPase 6,8 mRNA levels in the presence of Cu2+ (Fig. 5 B). Cysteine, which like homocysteine contains a free thiol group, also causes a decrease in CO3/ATPase 6,8 mRNA levels, albeit to a lesser extent than equimolar concentrations of homocysteine. In contrast, methionine, SAH, SAM, cystathionine, or homoserine had little or no effect on mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B) or DAMI cell viability, even in the presence of Cu2+ (Table II).Table IIEffect of homocysteine and other related compounds, in the absence or presence of 4 μm Cu2+, on DAMI cell viabi"
https://openalex.org/W2092880117,"Oxysterols exert a major influence over cellular cholesterol homeostasis. We examined the effects of oxysterols on the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which increases the delivery of cholesterol to sterol-metabolizing P450s in the mitochondria. 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)-OHC), 25-OHC, and 27-OHC each increased steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)-mediated StAR gene transactivation by ∼2-fold in CV-1 cells. In contrast, cholesterol, progesterone, and the 27-OHC metabolites, 27-OHC-5β-3-one and 7α,27-OHC, had no effect. Unlike our findings in CV-1 cells, SF-1-dependent StAR promoter activity was not augmented by 27-OHC in COS-1 cells, Y-1 cells, BeWo choriocarcinoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and human granulosa cells. Studies examining the metabolism of 27-OHC indicated that CV-1 cells formed a single polar metabolite, 3β-OH-5-cholestenoic acid from radiolabeled 27-OHC. However, this metabolite inhibited StAR promoter activity in CV-1, COS-1 and CHO cells. Because 7α,27-OHC was unable to increase SF-1-dependent StAR promoter activity, we examined 27-OHC 7α-hydroxylase in COS-1 and CHO cells. COS-1 cells contained high 7α-hydroxylase activity, whereas the enzyme was undetectable in CHO cells. The hypothesis that oxysterols act in CV-1 cells to increase StAR promoter activity by reducing nuclear levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein was tested. This notion was refuted when it was discovered that sterol regulatory element binding protein-1a is a potent activator of the StAR promoter in CV-1, COS-1, and human granulosa cells. Human granulosa and theca cells, which express endogenous SF-1, contained more than 5-fold more StAR protein following addition of 27-OHC, whereas StAR mRNA levels remained unchanged. We conclude that 1) there are cell-specific effects of oxysterols on SF-1-dependent transactivation; 2) the ability to increase transactivation is limited to certain oxysterols; 3) there are cell-specific pathways of oxysterol metabolism; and 4) oxysterols elevate StAR protein levels through posttranscriptional actions.

Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Thus, oxysterols regulate transcriptional as well as posttranscriptional events. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) plays an essential role in steroid hormone synthesis by enhancing the delivery of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) system resides (8Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the first committed step in steroid hormone synthesis. In addition to enhancing cholesterol delivery to P450scc, StAR also increases cholesterol metabolism by another mitochondrial cholesterol metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450c27, which generates the oxysterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (3β-OH-5-CA) through further oxidation of the c27 hydroxyl function (9Sugawara T.

SF-1 response elements in the StAR gene promoter are essential for basal as well as cAMP-stimulated gene transcription (10Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Kiriakidou M. Strauss III, J.F.

Because of the pivotal role that StAR plays in controlling one arm of the cholesterol metabolic pathway, we wished to determine whether oxysterols influence StAR expression. The cDNA for mouse SF-1, a generous gift from Dr. K. L. Parker (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), was cloned into the pSV-SPORT-1 expression vector in the correct and reverse orientations using standard procedures. The pCMV-CSA and pCMV-CS2 expression plasmids that produce the cleaved transcriptionally active forms of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 were previously described (13Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The pGL2-basic vector (Promega) was the source of the luciferase reporter gene for the 1.3-kilobase human StAR promoter (11Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Kallen C.B. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7249-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and human LDL receptor promoter (13Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for normalization of luciferase data. Plasmids for transfection were prepared using the Qiagen Maxiprep system. BeWo choriocarcinoma cells, COS-1 cells, CHO cells, and Y-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg of gentamycin/ml in an atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air at 37 °C for cell propagation and plating. CV-1 cells were propagated in the same basal medium plus 4 mml-glutamine. BeWo (b30 clone) cells were a gift from Dr. Arnold Schwartz (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The COS-1, CHO, and Y-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Proliferating human granulosa and theca cells were prepared and cultured as described previously by McAllister et al. (14McAllister J.M. Byrd W. Simpson E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All cell types except human granulosa and theca cells were plated at 120,000 or 60,000 cells/well for the 6- and 12-well plates, respectively, on day 0. On day 1, cells were washed twice in DMEM alone and then transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) plus plasmid DNA. Cells were transfected with 500 ng each of the β-galactosidase expression and reporter vectors and 500 ng of the SF-1 expression plasmid or 250 ng each of the SREBP expression plasmids. After a 2-h exposure to the DNA/LipofectAMINE complex, an equal volume of DMEM + 20% delipidated fetal calf serum or DMEM + 2× Nutridoma-SP (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the each well and left overnight. On day 2, medium was changed to either 10% delipidated fetal calf serum or 1× Nutridoma-SP, and compounds (treatments) were added. After 24 h, cells were harvested by scraping the cells in Reporter lysis buffer (Promega) followed by a single freeze/thaw cycle. Transfection of human granulosa cells utilized the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described by Kiriakidou et al.(15Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Human granulosa cells were transfected with 10 μg of the StAR or LDL receptor reporter constructs, 5 μg of pCH110, and 1 μg of the SREBP-1a expression plasmid. Cells were then cultured in DMEM + 10% delipidated fetal calf serum plus compounds. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Human granulosa and theca cells (60–80% confluent) for Western and Northern analysis were cultured in DMEM minus fetal calf serum for 2 days and then treated for 24 h with oxysterols/forskolin (20 μm) before harvesting. Luciferase activity was determined in a LUMAT LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold) with Promega luciferin as substrate as described previously (9Sugawara T. Lin D. Holt J.A. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12506-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined by the standard colorimetric assay using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. Relative luciferase activity for each well was determined by dividing luciferase relative light units by the β-galactosidase activity (A 420). To determine the effect of oxysterol treatment on a SF-1-dependent gene, StAR expression was determined in cultured human granulosa and theca cells. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The RNA was blotted, and the blots were probed with human StAR cDNA. The membranes were later reprobed with a labeled 28S rRNA probe (700 base pairs) in order to assess the loading of lanes. Blots were visualized on a Storm PhosphorImager, and relative levels of StAR RNA and 28S RNA were determined with the ImageQuant 1.11 software (Molecular Dynamics). Protein extracts from human granulosa and theca cells were generated as described previously (17Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H.W. Stocco D.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (12.5%) for electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for probing with anti-StAR antibody. The rabbit polyclonal antibody was produced against recombinant human StAR protein as described previously (18Pollack S.E. Furth E.E. Kallen C.B. Arakane F. Kiriakidou M. Kozarsky K.F. Strauss III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4243-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Detection of the anti-StAR antibody used the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nearly confluent CV-1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1×-Nutridoma-SP. CV-1 cells in T75 flasks were incubated with unlabeled 27-OHC (10 μm), 27-[22,23-3H]OHC (2 × 106 cpm), or 27-[3H]OHC + unlabeled 27-OHC (5 μm). After 24 h of exposure to these treatments, the culture medium was collected for isolation and determination of metabolic end products. Medium harvested from cells to which only radioactive 27-OHC was added was combined with medium harvested from the cells to which unlabeled 27-OHC had been added to increase the mass of metabolites that may be present and avoid analytical problems that occur with trace analysis. Medium from the cells cultured in the presence of both labeled and unlabeled 27-OHC and that combined as described above were reduced by evaporation and then subjected to Folch partition (chloroform/methanol 2:1); >85% of the radioactivity was recovered in the chloroform fraction. Aliquots of medium were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Silica Gel G) in solvent of system chloroform/methanol 4:1 (v/v). Subsequently, aliquots of the media were solvolyzed for 2 h and then re-extracted with chloroform; during this procedure methyl esters were also formed. Therefore, a portion of the solvolyzed material was further treated with methanolic KOH overnight. The solvolyzed and KOH samples were then analyzed by thin-layer chromatography as described previously (19Lee C. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1356-1362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 and CHO cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in DMEM and F12 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was then changed to DMEM plus 10% delipidated fetal calf serum containing 5 μm 27-OHC. Cells were incubated for 24 h; then, the medium was removed, and 7α,27-OHC levels were determined as described previously (20Martin K.O. Reiss A.B. Lathe R. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1053-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular protein concentrations were determined for normalization of the data across experiments. Fig. 1 shows the effect that several oxysterols have on SF-1-dependent StAR promoter activity in the context of CV-1 cells. 27-OHC and 25-OHC were equal in their ability to stimulate SF-1-dependent promoter activity; both oxysterols increased activity 2.3-fold over control values (p < 0.05 by analysis of variance) in a dose-dependent fashion. At 1 μmconcentrations, there was no effect, whereas a 10 μm dose maximally stimulated promoter activity. Higher concentrations, 15 μm (Fig. 1) and 25 μm (data not shown), did not further stimulate StAR promoter activity. 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol also stimulated SF-1-dependent promoter activity, but a 15 μmdose was required to observe an effect (Fig. 1). StAR promoter activity in the transfected CV-1 cells did not respond to progesterone or cholesterol. Because SF-1 is essential for cAMP responsiveness of the human StAR gene promoter as well as the promoters of many of the steroid hydroxylase genes (7Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 11Sugawara T. Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Kallen C.B. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7249-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of 27-OHC on 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated StAR promoter activity. CV-1 cells co-transfected with the SF-1 expression vector and the StAR promoter construct were treated with a maximal stimulatory dose of 27-OHC (10 μm) and increasing concentrations of 8-bromo-cAMP (Fig. 2). 27-OHC alone caused a 2.3-fold increase in StAR promoter activity. Low concentrations of 8-bromo-cAMP (0.001 to 0.1 mm) did not significantly augment StAR promoter function in the absence or presence of 27-OHC. However, 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP alone increased StAR promoter activity 5.5-fold. The addition of 27-OHC did not further increase expression of the luciferase reporter gene, indicating that oxysterols do not have an additive or synergistic effect on cAMP-stimulated StAR promoter activity. Table I compares the effect of 27-OHC in four different cell types that were co-transfected with the SF-1 expression vector and the StAR reporter construct and a fifth cell type, human granulosa cells, that express endogenous SF-1 and were not co-transfected with the SF-1 expression plasmid. StAR promoter activity in all of these cells failed to increase in response to 27-OHC. In Y-1 cells, which also expresses endogenous SF-1, 27-OHC caused a decline in SF-1 driven StAR promoter activity. In contrast to these cell types, co-transfected CV-1 cells studied concurrently responded to 27-OHC with a 2.3-fold increase in SF-1-dependent StAR promoter activity.Table IComparison of different cell types responsiveness to SF-1-dependent StAR reporter activity following EtOH or 27-OHC treatmentCell typeRelative luciferase unitsSF-1Empty pSV-SPORT-1/reverse SF-1EtOH27-OHCEtOH27-OHCCV-11886 ± 6001-aIndicates a difference (p < 0.05) between the EtOH-treated and 27-OHC treated cells.

The fact that 27-OHC only influenced SF-1-dependent promoter activity in CV-1 cells raised several questions. Do CV-1 cells produce a unique metabolite of 27-OHC that activates SF-1? Do other cell types rapidly inactivate 27-OHC? Are there alternative mechanisms by which 27-OHC controls SF-1-dependent promoter function in CV-1 cells beyond a ligand induced activation of SF-1? To determine whether CV-1 cells produce unique metabolites of 27-OHC, we incubated these cells with 27-[3H]OHC and characterized the metabolic products. Medium from CV-1 cells cultured in the presence of 27-[3H]OHC yielded a single radioactive band on thin-layer chromatography that remained at the origin, indicating a very polar metabolite. Cells cultured in the presence of both 27-[3H]OHC and unlabeled 27-OHC yielded the same radiolabeled polar product, but 20% of the radioactivity was recovered in a band migrating with authentic 27-OHC. Thin-layer chromatography of the solvolyzed samples yielded a radioactive band corresponding to 27-OHC and a band corresponding to the methyl ester of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (3β-OH-5-CA). Treatment of the sample with methanolic KOH to de-esterify the material followed by thin-layer chromatography revealed that the radioactive product migrated with 3β-OH-5-CA. After demonstrating that 3β-OH-5-CA is the primary metabolite of 27-OHC produced by CV-1 cells, 3β-OH-5-CA and several other metabolites known to be produced from 27-OHC were tested on transfected CV-1 cells for their ability to regulate StAR promoter activity. Three concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 μm) of 3β-OH-5-CA and the other metabolites were examined. All doses of 3β-OH-5-CA tended to reduce SF-1-dependent transactivation (Fig. 3; data for the highest dose (10 μm) are shown). 3β-OH-5-CA was also not effective in stimulating SF-1 transactivation in COS-1 cells (data not shown). 27-OHC-4-ene-3-one produced a modest increase in SF-1-dependent transactivation, whereas 27-OHC-5β-3-one and 7α,27-OHC (1, 5, 10, and 15 μm) had no effect (Fig. 3). The fact that 7α-hydroxylation of 27-OHC ablated its ability to modulate SF-1-dependent StAR promoter activity raised the possibility that other cell types rapidly inactivate 27-OHC through this pathway. COS-1 cells produced high levels of 7α,27-OHC (mean, 2514 pmol/mg of cell protein; range, 1170–4363 for five separate determinations) following incubation of cells in the presence of 5 μm 27-OHC, indicating that these cells have high endogenous 7α-hydroxylase activity. In contrast, CHO cells had no detectable 7α-hydroxylase activity. These studies failed to provide a clear explanation for the ability of 27-OHC to increase SF-1-dependent StAR promoter activity in CV-1 cells but not in other cell hosts. Because oxysterols are known to be potent regulators of SREBP levels, we examined the hypothesis that SREBP inhibits StAR gene transcription and that oxysterol suppression of nuclear SREBP levels would result in increased StAR promoter activity. CV-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for the SREBP-1a, SREBP-2, or the empty pCMV-5 expression plasmid and the StAR-reporter construct. Data presented in Table II show that SREBP-1a increased (p < 0.05 by analysis of variance) StAR promoter activity > 10-fold. The ability of SREBP-1a to enhance StAR promoter activity was also observed in COS-1 cells and human granulosa cells (Table II). Remarkably, the related transcription factor, SREBP-2, was ineffective in increasing StAR promoter activity, even though SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 had equivalent stimulatory effects on the LDL receptor gene promoter construct. These findings are inconsistent with the notion that oxysterols increase StAR promoter function by suppressing nuclear SREBP.Table IIDifferential regulation of the StAR gene promoter by SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 in CV-1 and COS-1 cellsCell typeRelative luciferase unitsReporter constructEmpty vectorSREBP-1aSREBP-2CV-12-aMeans ± S.E. for three individual experiments with CV-1 cells are reported; results for COS-1 and human granulosa cells are representative results of a single experiment performed with triplicate cultures.

Western analysis revealed that 27-OHC treatment of human granulosa cells increased StAR protein levels ∼5-fold over controls (Fig. 4). Stimulation of granulosa cells with forskolin increased StAR levels ∼10-fold, whereas cells treated with both forskolin and 27-OHC had the greatest StAR content. Granulosa cells treated with 3β-OH-5-CA, 27-OHC-4-ene-3-one, 27-OHC-5β-3-one, and 7α,27-OHC also exhibited similar increases in StAR protein (Fig. 4). Human theca cells responded in a manner similar to that observed for the granulosa cells (data not shown). Northern analysis indicated that StAR mRNA levels are unaltered by oxysterol treatment, whereas forskolin caused a marked increase in StAR mRNA (Fig. 5) in both granulosa (Fig. 5 A) and theca (Fig. 5 B) cells. Similarly, 7α,27-OHC did not alter StAR mRNA levels in granulosa cells. The present study demonstrates that SF-1-dependent transactivation of the human StAR promoter is enhanced by certain oxysterols including 22(R)-OHC, 25-OHC, and 27-OHC in the context of CV-1 cells. Moreover, in preliminary experiments, we found that SF-1-dependent transactivation of the human P450c21, P45017α, and the P450scc promoters was also increased 2–4-fold in the presence of 27-OHC relative to CV-1 cells treated with the ethanol vehicle. 2L. K. Christenson and J. F. Strauss, unpublished observations. Since no stimulation was observed in CV-1 cells transfected with empty vector, reverse SF-1, or an SF-1 mutant lacking the DNA binding domain, the effect of oxysterols on StAR promoter activity was dependent on the presence of SF-1. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the recent report of Lala et al. (6Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchik S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) demonstrating that some oxysterols enhance SF-1-dependent activation of a construct derived from the P450c21 promoter. The lower magnitude of the oxysterol effect in our experiments (∼2-fold stimulation) compared with that described by Lala et al. (6Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchik S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), who reported an approximately 10-fold increase in SF-1-dependent transactivation, could be explained by their use of an “artificial” SF-1 response element (i.e. five copies of the P450c21 promoter SF-1 responsive element in series; Ref. 21Ikeda Y. Lala D.S. Luo X. Kim I. Moisan M.P. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, our study is the first to document that a native promoter can respond to oxysterols in the presence of SF-1 in CV-1 cells. Only certain oxysterols activated transcription, arguing for a specific interaction of these oxysterols or a metabolite derived from them with factors controlling StAR promoter activity. Notably, 7α-hydroxylation of 27-OHC resulted in the loss of transcription enhancing activity. The 7α-hydroxylation of oxysterols is also associated with loss of ability to regulate sterol homeostasis and a loss of apoptosis-inducing activity (20Martin K.O. Reiss A.B. Lathe R. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1053-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhang J. Xue Y. Jondal M. Sjovall J. Eur. J.

Although our results in CV-1 cells confirm and extend those of Lalaet al.(6), the oxysterol effects could not be replicated in another monkey kidney cell line (COS-1 cells), nor in two other human cell types ("

The regulated phosphorylation is at Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα and, correspondingly, Ser-19 and Ser-23 of IκBβ (2Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 3DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The more recently cloned IκB isoform, IκBε, also contains the two conserved Ser residues at the N terminus for signal-induced degradation (4Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.-C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκBα and IκBβ are subsequently ubiquitinated and undergo ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB results in the release of NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus, where it up-regulates the transcription of its target genes (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5572) Google Scholar). A 500–900-kDa protein complex that contains the TNF-α-induced IκB kinase (IKK) has been purified and characterized independently by two groups (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα at the specific Ser residues that target the protein for ubiquitination and degradation. Two kinase subunits of the IKK complex, denoted IKKα and IKKβ, have been cloned (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). IKKα or IKKβ overexpressed in mammalian cells specifically phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ after immunoprecipitation, and their kinase activities can be induced by TNF-α or IL-1 (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, expression of antisense IKKα inhibited NF-κB activation by TNF-α or IL-1 (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of either IKKα or IKKβ blocked TNF-α/IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (8Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 10Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Thus, both IKKα and IKKβ contribute to the activity of the IKK complex and are involved in NF-κB activation. An additional protein kinase, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), has been shown to be involved in the activation of IκB phosphorylation in both the IL-1 and TNF-α pathways (11Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). IKKα has also been identified as an NIK-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis (8Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Co-expression of NIK and IKKα (or IKKβ) stimulates the kinase activity of IKKα and IKKβ (8Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 12Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Moreover, NIK-dependent NF-κB activation is blocked by a dominant-negative IKKα mutant (8Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). These results indicate that NIK is an upstream regulator of IKKα and IKKβ. Although the results using expressed and immunoprecipitated proteins are consistent with IKKα and IKKβ being the IκB kinases, it has not been demonstrated that IKKα or IKKβ directly phosphorylates IκBα. All phosphorylation experiments reported so far involve co-precipitation of other components of the high molecular mass complex from mammalian cells (8Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 9Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that IKKα or IKKβ synthesized in wheat germ extracts was unable to phosphorylate IκB (9Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that IKKα and IKKβ may activate an as yet unidentified IκB kinase that co-immunoprecipitates with IKKα and IKKβ and phosphorylates IκBα (13Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To resolve this issue, we have pursued in vitro studies with purified recombinant proteins. Recombinant IKKα and IKKβ were overexpressed in insect cells and purified. Here we demonstrate that purified IKKα or IKKβ alone is capable of phosphorylating specific Ser residues of IκBα in vitro, demonstrating that both IKKα and IKKβ are direct kinases of IκBα. We also show that both IKKα and IKKβ display a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. Kinetic parameters for both enzymes indicate that IKKβ is 50–60-fold more active than IKKα in catalyzing the phosphorylation of IκBα. Interestingly, IKKα and IKKβ showed no synergy in catalyzing the phosphorylation of IκBα in vitro. Such mechanism studies with purified IKKα and IKKβ provide new insights into the functions of these two kinase components of the multiprotein IKK complex. IKKα and IKKβ were cloned from a Jurkat cDNA library (CLONTECH) by polymerase chain reaction and were expressed as N-terminal Flag-tagged fusion proteins using the baculovirus expression vector pFastBacI (Life Technologies, Inc.). IKKα was cloned into the RsrII and XhoI sites of pFastBacI. IKKβ was cloned into the RsrII and KpnI sites of pFastBacI. The protein sequences for the expressed IKKα and IKKβ are MDYKDDDDKEF-IKKα (8Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) and MDYKDDDDKLAAANSS-IKKβ (10Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), respectively. The K44M IKKβ mutant was constructed in the same vector as used for wild-type IKKβ. The Flag-tagged K44A IKKα mutant was constructed in the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen) at the BamHI and NotI sites. The above Flag-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells. IKKα was also expressed as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein in Sf9 cells using pFastBacIHTa (Life Technologies, Inc.; EcoRI and XhoI sites). IκBα and IκBα(S32A/S36A) were expressed as a His6-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein (TRX-IκBα-(1–54)) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The sequences of all the constructed clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Sf9 cells were grown in Sf-900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1% fetal bovine serum and infected with baculoviruses following standard protocols (14King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1992Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h after infection. Recombinant Flag-tagged IKKα, IKKβ, K44A IKKα, and K44M IKKβ were purified by affinity chromatography using anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Co.). One liter of infected Sf9 cells was lysed in 25 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim and PharMingen). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the NaCl concentration in the lysate was adjusted to 250 mm. The lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml column of anti-Flag M2 affinity gel; washed with 60 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and eluted with 250 μg/ml Flag peptide (Eastman Kodak Co.) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. His6-tagged IκBα was expressed and purified using standard protocols as described (15Novy R. Yaeger K. Berg J. Mierendorf R. inNovations. 1995; 3: 9-11Google Scholar, 16LaVille E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Koviac S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified proteins were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Kinase assays were performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μmNa3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm DTT. The amounts of the substrates ATP, [γ-33P]ATP (2000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and IκBα are specified for each individual experiment. Reactions were performed at 23 °C for 10–30 min. Samples were analyzed by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography or by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on a microtiter plate (Millipore Corp.). For microtiter plate assays, 55 μl of reaction sample/well was quenched with 50 μl of 5% pyrophosphate, precipitated with 75 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid plus 5% pyrophosphate on a Millipore plate harvester, washed twice with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid plus 5% pyrophosphate, and counted in 100 μl of scintillation mixture (SCINT 20, Packard Instrument Co.) using a TopCount liquid scintillation counter (Packard NXT). Autophosphorylation of IKKα or IKKβ was subtracted out using a control assay without IκBα. Assay conditions were controlled so that the degree of phosphorylation of IκBα was linear with time and concentration of enzyme. The counts represent initial velocity of IKK-catalyzed phosphorylation (<10% of total ATP conversion). All experiments were performed in duplicate. All kinetic assays were performed using a microtiter plate assay (see above). For two-substrate profile analysis, initial velocity studies were performed with varying concentrations of IκBα at several fixed ATP concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots were generated by linear least-square fits of the data. The apparent kinetic constants were determined from thex and y intercepts of the double-reciprocal plots. Secondary plots were generated by replotting the slopes and they intercepts of the lines as a function of 1/[ATP]. For a random sequential model as described previously (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 265-268Google Scholar), values of K ATP, K IκBα,V max, and α can be determined from thex and y intercepts of the secondary plots.K ATP and K IκBα are the dissociation constants for ATP and IκBα, respectively. The constant α is the ratio of apparent dissociation constants for binding IκBα in the presence and absence of ATP, as described (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The value of α indicates whether binding of one substrate (ATP) affects the affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate (IκBα) (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 265-268Google Scholar). Sf9 cells (1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with various combinations of baculoviruses encoding His6-IKKα, Flag-IKKα, or Flag-IKKβ at a multiplicity of infection of 6 for each virus and grown at 28 °C until harvested at 72 h post-infection. A fraction of the infected cells (5 × 106 cells) were lysed in 250 μl of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim and PharMingen). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The lysate was mixed with 4 μg each of anti-His4 and anti-His5 monoclonal antibodies (QIAGEN Inc.) and 30 μl of protein G Plus/protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Science Inc.) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with 500 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. Sf9 cells were doubly infected with baculoviruses encoding His6-IKKα and Flag-IKKβ. The cell pellet was lysed and purified using a Flag affinity column as described above, except that 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol instead of DTT was used in the elution buffer. One milliliter of the Flag eluate (0.5 mg/ml protein) was mixed with 50 μl of 1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (QIAGEN Inc.). The column was washed three times with 0.6 ml of 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.3m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and eluted with 250 μl of 0.1m Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.3m NaCl, 0.3 m imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim). To investigate whether IKKα and IKKβ directly phosphorylate IκBαin vitro, we expressed IKKα and IKKβ in insect cells as N-terminal Flag-tagged proteins and purified them by affinity chromatography. Both IKKα and IKKβ were purified to apparent homogeneity and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel with molecular masses predicted by their respective DNA sequences (Fig. 1). The predicted molecular masses of recombinant IKKα and IKKβ (86 kDa and 88 kDa, respectively) were confirmed by mass spectroscopic analysis (data not shown). Purified recombinant IKKα and IKKβ were tested for kinase activity by phosphorylation of IκBα. Either IKKα or IKKβ alone could phosphorylate IκBα (Fig. 2). Autophosphorylation of both IKKα and IKKβ was also observed. The phosphorylation of IκBα was specific for Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα since there was no phosphorylation of the S32A/S36A mutant of IκBα (Fig. 2). To eliminate the possibility of trace kinase contaminants from the insect cells, two catalytically inactive kinase mutants (K44A IKKα and K44M IKKβ) were expressed and purified. The purified recombinant kinase mutants K44A IKKα and K44M IKKβ lacked activity in both the autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 2). Thus, both IKKα and IKKβ are direct IκBα kinases.Figure 2In vitro phosphorylation of IκBα by IKKα and IKKβ. The reactions (10 μl) were performed at 37 °C for 10 min with 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, and 3.8 μm TRX-IκBα or TRX-IκBα(S32A/S36A). For IKKα and K44A IKKα, 100 ng of each enzyme was used. For IKKβ and K44M IKKβ, 50 ng of each enzyme was used in the reaction. Samples were electrophoresed on a 4–20% SDS gel, and visualization was performed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One distinguishing feature of IKK as a Ser/Thr kinase is that it preferentially phosphorylates Ser versus Thr (6DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar, 7Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). To test whether purified IKKα and IKKβ are Ser-selective kinases, we compared the phosphorylations of the peptides IκBα-(21–41), IκBα-(21–41)S32T/S36T, and IκBα-(21–41)S32pS36p by IKKα and IKKβ. Both IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylated IκBα-(21–41) and IκBα-(21–41)S32T/S36T, but not IκBα-(21–41)S32pS36p, which contained two phosphoserines (Fig. 3). Both IKKα and IKKβ showed significantly higher activity in the phosphorylation of Ser versus Thr residues of IκBα (Fig. 3). Quantitation of the phosphorylation by PhosphorImager analysis indicated that IKKα and IKKβ had 11- and 9-fold higher activities in the phosphorylation of Ser versus Thr residues of IκBα-(21–41), respectively. The results indicate that the Ser selectivity of IKK is, at least in part, conveyed at the kinase subunit level. Since both IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylate IκBα independently in vitro, we determined the kinetics of both in phosphorylating IκBα. Fig. 4 shows Michaelis-Menten plots of IKK velocity as a function of the concentration of ATP at a constant concentration of IκBα. Both IKKα and IKKβ displayed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparentK m(ATP) values of IKKα and IKKβ were 126 and 136 nm, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table I). The kinase activities of IKKα and IKKβ were further determined as a function of varying concentrations of IκBα (0.7–53 μm) at five fixed concentrations of ATP (30–1200 nm). The Lineweaver-Burk plots of the data for both IKKα and IKKβ followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 5, A and B). For both IKKα and IKKβ, a series of double-reciprocal straight-line plots intersected to the left side of the ordinates, indicating a sequential kinetic mechanism (18Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 265-268Google Scholar). At a saturating concentration of ATP (10-fold of K m(ATP)app), the apparent K m value of IKKα for IκBα (23 μm) was 17-fold higher than that of IKKβ (1.3 μm). Under the same conditions, the apparent maximal turnover rates of IKKα and IKKβ were 0.08/min and 0.27/min at 23 °C, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B; and Table I). Based on the values of k cat/K m(IκBα), IKKβ is 58-fold more potent than IKKα in the phosphorylation of IκBα (Table I). This result is consistent with the observation that when overexpressed in 293 cells, IKKβ is more potent in activating the NF-κB pathway than IKKα (10Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). One interesting observation is that the plots shown in Fig. 5 (A and B) intersected on the abscissa, indicating that the concentration of ATP has no effect on the apparentK m for IκBα. It was recently reported by Burkeet al. (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that a multisubunit IκB kinase complex purified from TNF-α-stimulated HeLa cells showed random Bi Bi sequential kinetics with ATP and IκBα binding in a cooperative fashion (α = 0.11). To directly compare the kinetics of purified IKKα and IKKβ with those of the multisubunit IKK complex, the plots shown in Fig. 5 (A and B) were fitted to the random sequential model as described (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 265-268Google Scholar). Accordingly, the data from Fig. 5 (A and B) were replotted as the slopes of the lines as a function of 1/[ATP] (Fig. 5 C), and the y intercepts as a function of 1/[ATP] (Fig. 5 D) (18Copeland R.A. Enzymes. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 265-268Google Scholar). For IKKα, values of 85 nm, 25 μm, 0.09/min, and 1.0 were obtained forK ATP, K IκBα,k cat, and α, respectively (Fig. 5,C and D; and Table I). For IKKβ, values of 130 nm, 1.4 μm, 0.30/min, and 1.0 were obtained for K ATP, K IκBα,k cat, and α, respectively (Fig. 5,C and D; and Table I). The 1.0 α value for IKKα and IKKβ demonstrates that the binding of one substrate to the enzyme has no effect on the affinity for the other substrate. The obtained K ATP and α values for IKKα and IKKβ are significantly different from those for the multisubunit IKK complex (K ATP = 7.3 μmand α = 0.11) (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The K m for the N-terminal peptide (residues 26–42) of IκBα for the multisubunit IKK complex reported by Burke et al. (17Burke J.R. Miller K.R. Wood M.K. Meyers C.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1819017172,"Antibodies of chronic chagasic patients have been shown to interfere with electric and mechanical activities of cardiac embryonic myocytes in culture and with whole mammalian hearts. A mechanism proposed for this effect involves interaction of the antibodies with G-protein-linked membrane receptors, thus leading to activation of beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors; more specifically, IgG of chagasic patients would interact with the negatively charged regions of the second extracellular loop of these receptors. We performed competition experiments to test this hypothesis. We evaluated the effect of sera/IgG from patients previously known to depress electrogenesis and/or atrioventricular conduction in isolated rabbit hearts after incubation with live and lysed parasites, the peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop (O2) of the M2 receptor, and different peptides derived from two ribosomal proteins of T. cruzi: P0 and P2beta. Our results indicate that 1) the antigenic factor inducing the functionally active IgGs in the chagasic patients is probably an intracellular T. cruzi antigen; 2) IgG/serum is interacting with the O2 region of the M2 receptor in the rabbit heart; and 3) the negative charges present in the ribosomal proteins of T. cruzi are important in mediating the interaction between the patients' serum/IgG and the receptor."

Unfractionated membranes and fractions enriched 5-fold in plasma membranes relative to postnuclear supernatants exhibited high NBMPR binding activity. Intact nuclei and nuclear envelopes also exhibited abundant quantities of NBMPR-binding sites with affinities similar to those of enriched plasma membranes (K d = 0.4–0.9 nm).

The equilibrative transporters accept both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides as permeants and are found in most, possibly all, cell types, whereas the concentrative transporters have relatively narrow selectivities for nucleoside permeants and are limited to specialized cell types. The transporters are low abundance proteins, and the equilibrative transporters of human and pig erythrocytes are the only ones that have been purified to homogeneity (4Kwong F.Y.P. Fincham H.E.

The equilibrative transporters have been subdivided on the basis of sensitivity to nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR); one subtype (es) is inhibited by ≤1 nm NBMPR, as a result of high affinity (K d < 5 nm) binding of NBMPR at or near the permeant binding site (6Cass C.E.

Cultured human choricarcinoma (BeWo) cells have been studied mainly for their ability to undergo differentiation from proliferating cytotrophoblast-like cells to larger syncytiotrophoblast-like cells when exposed to methotrexate in a process that resembles normalin utero development (17Friedman S.J. Skehan P. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 1960-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 18Burres N.S. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previous studies with proliferating BeWo cells (19Boumah C.E. Hogue D.L. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) revealed unusual NBMPR binding characteristics in comparison with other cell types. BeWo cells have extraordinarily large numbers of high affinity sites (>2 × 107/cell) of two apparent classes (K d = 0.6 and 14.5 nm), whereas most cultured cell types have far fewer high affinity sites of a single apparent class (e.g.HeLa cells possess 4.1 × 105/cell withK d = 0.7 nm). NBMPR-binding proteins have been shown in reconstitution studies to mediate es NT activity in human erythrocytes (20Kwong F.Y.P. Davies A. Tse C.M. Young J.D. Henderson P.F.J. Baldwin S.A. Biochem.

The existence of two classes of binding sites, together with the lack of proportionality between NBMPR-binding sites and maximal transport activities of BeWo and HeLa cells, led to the suggestion (19Boumah C.E. Hogue D.L. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that the second class of NBMPR-binding sites in BeWo cells may be es transporters associated with intracellular membranes. In the present study, we established that BeWo cells, which possesses- and ei-mediated nucleoside transport activities, express hENT1 and hENT2 mRNAs. We quantified binding of NBMPR to various BeWo membrane fractions by analysis of isolated and detergent-solubilized membranes and of reconstituted proteoliposomes. A single class of high affinity NBMPR-binding sites was observed in all membrane preparations, including intact nuclei and nuclear envelopes. There was no evidence of the lower affinity NBMPR-binding sites previously observed in intact BeWo cells in any of the membrane preparations, suggesting loss of these sites during cell disruption. Functional reconstitution of both NBMPR-sensitive (es) and NBMPR-insensitive (ei) uridine transport activities was demonstrated in proteoliposomes derived from both crude membrane and nuclear envelope-enriched fractions. Our results suggest that hENT1 and hENT2 may play a role in the translocation of nucleosides between the cytosol and the lumen of nuclear envelopes and/or endoplasmic reticulum and provide the first evidence for functional ENTs in intracellular membranes of mammalian cells.

Cell numbers were determined with an electronic particle counter after dissociation with trypsin/EDTA and resuspension in 0.15 m NaCl solution. For preparation of membranes, cells (5 × 106/flask) were grown in 15 Corning disposable tissue culture flasks (15-cm2 surface area), and actively proliferating cells were harvested 10–14 days later, yielding from 8 × 108 to 1 × 109 cells. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 1.0 × 108 cells with a Fast Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and used on RNA blots and in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. To prepare the RNA blots, BeWo mRNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% denaturing agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon filters (Amersham). The resulting RNA blots were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA specific to hENT1 (10Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D.

The blots were washed to high stringency and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. To perform the RT-PCR reactions, BeWo cDNA was made using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subjected to PCR amplification using Taqpolymerase (Life Technologies) and primers specific to hENT1 (5′-CCTGTGTCCTGTTTCTTGAC and 5′-TTGTCACACAATTGCCCGGAACAG) or hENT2 (5′-GCCTGCGGTTCCTGTTCGTGC and 5′-GCAGCATGCTCAGAGCAGCGCCTTGAAG). The resulting PCR products were resolved on 0.8% agarose gels and either (i) stained with ethidium bromide for visualization using a 1-kilobase pair ladder (Life Technologies) as a size standard or (ii) purified and sequenced using the PCR primers, a dRhodamine cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer), a model 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer), and MacVector sequence analysis software (Oxford Molecular, Oxford, UK). Membrane fractions were prepared from trypsin-treated cultures of BeWo cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation (26Johnson P.A. Johnstone R.M. Membr.

Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) composed of 20 mm phosphate and 0.15 m NaCl at pH 7.4 and centrifuged (10 min, 1000 × g). Packed cells were resuspended in 1 mm ZnCl2 and fragmented with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by gentle centrifugation (2 min, 900 × g), after which the supernatants were centrifuged (30 min, 11,000 ×g) and the resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in 9.25% (w/w) sucrose. The membrane fractions were then separated using a 15–45% sucrose gradient and stored at −80 °C in 15% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Sucrose solutions were in 0.5 mmZnCl2, 5 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4. The fractions collected at 25% sucrose had 4–5 times the specific activity of crude nuclei-free membranes when assayed for alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) and 5′-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) and thus were enriched in plasma membranes (Sigma Diagnostics 5′-nucleotidase assay kit). Nearly 40% of the total protein applied to the sucrose gradient was recovered in this sucrose fraction. Nuclear membranes were prepared from the nuclei collected during the initial stage of membrane preparation according to Kay et al. (28Kay R.A. Fraser D. Johnston I.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereby nuclei were treated with a low level of DNase I in the presence of Mg2+ at slightly alkaline pH, after which membranes were collected by centrifugation (30 min, 11,000 × g) and stored at −80 °C in 15% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Membranes were thawed at room temperature, washed extensively to remove dimethyl sulfoxide, and resuspended in ice-cold reconstitution buffer (pH 7.4) composed of 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. Membranes were then mixed with a solution of OCTG (1% final concentration) and asolectin (0.15% final concentration) prepared in reconstitution buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h with frequent mixing. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (60 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was retained on ice until use. Because solubilization efficiency of detergents is often more dependent on the ratio of detergent to protein than on the actual detergent concentration used (29Hjelmeland L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Loizaga B. Gurtubay I.G. Macarulla J.M. Goni F.M. Gomez J.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the membrane protein concentrations were monitored using a modified Bradford assay (23Hammond J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 906-917PubMed Google Scholar) and adjusted to approximately 200 μg of protein/ml. The reconstitution technique was based on a method used previously (23Hammond J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 906-917PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized membranes (2 ml) were supplemented with a sonicated preparation of lipids (0.3 ml) consisting of phosphatidylcholine (bovine brain), cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine (egg) and phosphatidylserine (bovine brain) in molar ratios of 33:33:26:8, respectively, plus a trace (105dpm/ml) of [14C]cholesteryl oleate. The detergent was removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G-50 medium, 1.5 × 38-cm column) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; this procedure is known to result in the formation of unilamellar vesicles (31Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The void volume fractions containing proteoliposomes were pooled, frozen in ethanol and dry ice, and stored at −80 °C for up to 1 month. For functional assays, proteoliposomes were thawed at room temperature, centrifuged (40,000 × g, 20 min), resuspended in approximately 1 ml of reconstitution buffer, sonicated for 15 s in a cylindrical tank sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Company Inc., Hicksville, NY), and then stored on ice until use. Brief sonication after the freeze/thaw cycle is known to enhance the activity of the reconstituted erythrocyte nucleoside transporter (21Tse C.M. Belt J.A. Jarvis S.M. Paterson A.R.P. Wu J.S.

High affinity binding of [3H]NBMPR, which has been used extensively in the characterization of equilibrative nucleoside transport proteins (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H.

Membrane preparations, proteoliposomes (∼10 μg of protein/ml final concentration), and intact nuclei and nuclear membranes (at ∼40 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with a range of concentrations (0.24–24 nm) of [3H]NBMPR in either the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μm NBMPR (1-ml final assay volume). Proteins were precipitated by incubation (15 min) with a mixture of γ-globulins (1.65 mg/ml final concentration) and polyethylene glycol (M r 8000, 10% (w/v) final concentration) and then filtered under vacuum through Whatman GF/B filters. The filters were washed twice with reconstitution buffer containing 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol at 4 °C and analyzed for radioactive content by standard liquid scintillation counting techniques as described previously (23Hammond J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 906-917PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake assays were initiated by the rapid addition of 100 μl of proteoliposome suspension (∼5 μg of protein, with or without inhibitors) to 25 μl of reconstitution buffer with [3H]uridine (20 μm final concentration) and mixed by repeated pipetting. After specific incubation times, 100 μl of the reaction mixtures were layered on ice-cold Sephadex G-50 fine minicolumns (see below) and centrifuged (45 s, 700 ×g). The effluents were collected in preweighed tubes from which portions were removed for the determination of protein content and 3H and 14C contents (dual label counting). The [3H]uridine content of each sample was normalized for intraexperimental variation in eluate volume and phospholipid content based on the 14C-labeled lipid concentration of the minicolumn effluent. Approximately 50% of the volume added to the minicolumns was recovered in the effluents. The minicolumns used were prepared by filling 1-ml syringes (fitted with a polyethylene filter) with Sephadex G-50 equilibrated in reconstitution buffer containing 10 μm dilazep and nitrobenzylthioguanosine (NBTGR). The gel-filled minicolumns were centrifuged (45 s, 700 ×g) and placed on ice for at least 30 min prior to use. Estimates of zero time uptake values were obtained by measuring the uptake of [3H]uridine at ∼2 s in the presence of ice-cold solutions containing 10 mm adenosine, 10 μm dipyridamole, and 10 μm NBTGR to inhibit all transporter-mediated influx. The zero-time uptake values were subtracted from all other data points, and the accumulation of [3H]uridine was expressed as picomol taken up/mg of proteoliposomal protein. Mediated influx of [3H]uridine was defined as the total uptake minus uptake observed in the presence of 1 mm adenosine, 10 μm dipyridamole, and 10 μm NBTGR (nonmediated). For inhibition assays, proteoliposomes were incubated with test compounds for 10 min before initiating transport reactions. Protein was measured using bovine serum albumin as the standard with appropriate corrections for detergent interference (34Tse C.-M. Young J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 985: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Markwell M.A.K. Hass S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Nuclei (obtained by cell disruption as described above) were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 500 ×g), washed twice in PBS, and resuspended at a density of 106 nuclei/ml. The nuclei were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with either (i) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies directed against nuclear pore complex proteins (M414-FITC from Babco (Richmond, CA)) at 0.01 mg/ml or (ii) with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1 μg/ml) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 55–64 (ELSKDAQASA) of the predicted hENT1 sequence (designated hENT1-(55–64)) and immediately thereafter with goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibodies. The nuclei were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 1% paraformaldehyde-PBS solution prior to being analyzed on a FACSort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytochemistry Systems, San Jose, CA). Rabbit anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibodies were used as the negative control for the M414-FITC, and goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibodies were used as a negative control for the hENT1-(55–64) antibodies. The synthetic peptide (hENT1-(55–64)) was prepared and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Alberta Peptide Institute, Edmonton, Canada) from an analysis of the hENT1 sequence with an algorithm (Surface Plot) that predicts exposed, potentially immunogenic residues. The antibodies that recognized hENT1-(55–64) were purified by first passing rabbit sera through a Protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column to collect the IgG fraction, followed by dot blot affinity purification using the synthetic peptide. The specificity of the hENT1-(55–64) antibodies was assessed by comparing fluorescence intensity of hENT1-containing cells in the presence and absence of excess hENT1-(55–64). BeWo cells have previously been shown (19Boumah C.E. Hogue D.L. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to exhibit es and eifunctional transport activity. Since hENT1 and hENT2 were initially identified by molecular cloning of a placental cDNA library (10Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I. Cass C.E.

J. 1992; 288: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), BeWo RNA was examined for evidence of expression of hENT1 and hENT2 mRNA. RNA blot analysis at high stringency demonstrated a single band of 2.4 or 2.6 kilobase pairs with either the hENT1 or hENT2 probe, respectively (data not shown). The identity of the two bands was subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR amplification (Fig. 1). Primers"

The activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA was blocked by brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ARF activation, but not by Clostridium botulinum C3 exotoxin, an inhibitor of the activity of Rho. PDGF and PMA, in the presence of GTPγS, promoted the association of ARF and RhoA with cell membranes. Cells depleted of ARF and Rho by digitonin permeabilization showed a significant reduction of the activity of phospholipase D. Recombinant ARF was sufficient to restore agonist-induced PLD activity to digitonin-permeabilized, cytoplasm-depleted cells. In contrast, isoprenylated recombinant RhoA had no effects in this reconstitution assay. HIRcB cells were transiently transfected with wild-type and dominant-negative mutants of ARF1 and ARF6. Neither wt-ARF1 nor wt-ARF6 had any effects on agonist-dependent PLD activity. However, dominant-negative ARF1 and ARF6 mutants blocked the stimulation of PLD by PDGF but only partially inhibited the effects of PMA.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)1 stimulates a number of cellular responses following the binding to its specific cell surface receptor and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase (1Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar,2Ulrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). Some of the actions of PDGF are mediated by lipid second messengers, including phosphatidylinositol derivatives, diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid (PA) (3Price B.D. Morris J.D. Hall A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fukami K. Takenawa T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yeo E.J. Exton J.H. J.

PA has been proposed to play an important role in intracellular signaling. On one hand, PA is a precursor of other second messengers, such as diacylglycerol (by removal of the phosphate from the head group) or lyso-PA (by removal of the fatty acid from the sn-2 position by phospholipase A2). On the other, PA has been shown to activate tyrosine phosphorylation, to inhibit Ras-GAP, and to stimulate the recruitment of Raf-1 to membranes (6Ohguchi K. Kasai T. Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Tsai M.-H., Yu, C.L. Wei F.S. Stacey D.W. Science. 1989; 243: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Ghosh S.

The mechanism by which PDGF stimulates PLD activity has not been well established. Several lines of evidence suggest that the effects of PDGF on the activation of PLD require the activation of the phospholipase C/diacylglycerol/PKC signaling cascade (5Yeo E.J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Plevin R. Cook S.J. Palmer S. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data support the idea that PLD may be tyrosine-phosphorylated (13Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a potential mechanism by which PDGF might regulate PLD activity. However, the most potent physiological activators of PLD are small G proteins of the Ras superfamily. Several members of the family appear to regulate PLD activity, including most members of the ARF and Rho families (14Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

(20Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and Frohman and Morris (21Frohman M.J. Morris A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 945-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have confirmed that Rho and ARF proteins act as direct stimulators of PLD. The relationship between the activation of small G proteins and receptor-mediated PLD activation has been explored in a few recent studies. Karnam et al. (22Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have shown that insulin induces the translocation of ARF and Rho to the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes and that the activation of PLD by insulin correlates with the activation of Rho proteins. We showed that ARF mediates insulin-dependent activation of PLD in a rat fibroblast cell line (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies using Rat1 fibroblasts strongly suggest that Rac proteins mediate the stimulation of PLD by epidermal growth factor, another member of the Rho family (11Hess J.H. Ross A.H. Qiu R-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Morgan et al. (24Morgan C.P. Sengelov H. Whatmore J. Borregaard N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have reported that ARF-regulated PLD activity is translocated to the plasma membrane from secretory vesicles upon stimulation of neutrophils with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Thus, small G proteins of the ARF and Rho families are likely to play an important role in the regulation of PLD activity by cell surface receptors although the details of these roles have not been fully established. Here we provide evidence that links the activation of ARF by PDGF and phorbol esters to the effects of these agonists on the activation of PLD. First, we show that the activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA is inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of the activation of ARF proteins, (25Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 26Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 27Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10820-10825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not by exotoxin C3, an inhibitor of the function of Rho proteins. Second, using a permeabilized cell assay, we show that PDGF in the presence of ATP and GTPγS stimulates the recruitment of ARF and Rho proteins to the membrane. PMA had similar effects but only in the presence of exogenous PKCα. Third, we show that permeabilized, cytoplasm-depleted cells lose their ability to stimulate PLD in response to agonist and GTPγS, and that the observed responses are reconstituted, at least partially, by the addition of recombinant ARF but not by RhoA. Finally, we show that overexpression of putative dominant-negative mutants of ARF1 and ARF6 block the activation of PLD by PDGF and significantly reduce the effects of PMA. These results indicate that the activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA in HIRcB cells is mediated by ARF proteins and that the role of Rho in this process is not essential. HIRcB cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Shome K. Xu X.Q. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cells were used within 3 days of subculture and were serum-starved for 20 h in medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin before treatment. The following ARF proteins were used: wt-ARF1, wt-ARF6, T31N-ARF1, and T27N-ARF6. The latter are putative dominant-negative mutants with reduced affinity for GTP. These mutants were cloned in the multiple cloning site of the vector pGEFP-N1 (CLONTECH) and fused to the green fluorescent protein of Aequorea victoria as described (29Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y. Li D. Shome K. Watkins S. Levitan E. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with these constructs as described elsewhere (29Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y. Li D. Shome K. Watkins S. Levitan E. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection was estimated by counting cells using phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy of the same fields. The transfection efficiency was 60–80% for all the experiments reported. The PLD activity of ARF-GFP-transfected cells was determined approximately 48 h after transfection. Protein bands resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween 20). ARF was detected with 2 μg/ml affinity purified 1D9 (a monoclonal antibody that recognizes most members of the ARF family (30Zhang C.-J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); a gift from R. Kahn) or a commercial anti-RhoA antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence. Cells (100-mm plates; 70–80% confluency) were serum-starved and labeled overnight with [3H]palmitate (5 μCi/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated with PDGF (30 ng/ml) or PMA (500 nm) in the presence of 0.3% butanol for 20 min. Cells were treated with brefeldin A (50 μg/ml) for 10 min prior to PDGF or PMA where indicated. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The lipid phase was extracted and developed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 plates using ethyl acetate:trimethylpentane:acetic acid (9:5:2) as the solvent. The position of major phospholipids was determined using true standards (Avanti Biochemicals) and autoradiography. The TLC plates were scraped, and the total amount of radioactivity associated to each lipid species was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The data are expressed as the number of counts associated to the phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBu) spot normalized by the total number of counts of lipid. HIRcB cells were serum-starved, scraped gently, resuspended in PBS, and treated with 8 μM digitonin in the presence or absence of PDGF (30 ng/ml) or PMA (500 nm) and/or GTPγS (100 μM) at 37 °C for 15–20 min. ATP (1 mm) and magnesium (2 mm) were included in all the experiments. To release intracellular proteins, digitonin-treated cells were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 20 min. Supernatants and pellets were collected separately and resolved by SDS-PAGE. ARF and Rho proteins were detected by immunoblotting as mentioned above. PLD activity of digitonin-treated cells was determined using cells that had been labeled overnight with [3H]palmitate (see above). Recombinant ARF was isolated from bacteria that co-express ARF1 and yeast N-myristoyltransferase as described (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recombinant RhoA obtained from yeast cells as a RhoA-GDI complex was a gift of Dr. Avril Somlyo (University of Virginia). Geranyl-geranylated RhoA was a gift from Dr. Patrick Casey (Duke University). Recombinant ARF and Rho proteins (final concentration: 8 μmg/ml) were added to cytosol-depleted cells where indicated. Human recombinant PKCα (Calbiochem; 5 μg/ml final concentration) was included in all assays of the effects of PMA. Cells were treated with BFA (50 μg/ml final) 10 min before stimulation with the agonists in serum-free medium. C3 exotoxin treatment was done by the scrape loading method of Malcolm et al. (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 10-cm plates and scraped gently in 500 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 114 mm KCl, 25 mmNaCl, 5.5 mm MgCl2) with or without 5 μg/ml C3 transferase. The cells were then distributed onto 6-cm plates and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were then serum-starved and labeled with 5 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate for 17 h as described previously (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As a control, an inactive analog of BFA (B17, a 13-hydroxymethylether derivative of BFA obtained from Dr. Julie Donaldson (NIH)) was also used. Control and C3-treated cells were washed and homogenized separately. The level of ADP-ribosylation was determined by incubation of cell homogenates with additional C3 transferase (5 μg/ml) in the presence of 5 μCi of [32P]NAD for 90 min at 30 °C, as described by Moriiet al.

The reaction was terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. After normalizing for protein contents, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Stimulation of HIRcB cells with PDGF resulted in a large increase in the levels of PLD activity (480 ± 45%) (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with PMA resulted in an even greater increase (955 ± 78%) (Fig. 1 B). When BFA (50 μg/ml) was added 10 min before stimulation of the cells with either agonist, the activity of PLD was significantly reduced. The effects of PDGF were completely abolished by BFA treatment (Fig. 1 A) whereas the effects of PMA were reduced by 62% (Fig. 1 B). PMA-stimulated PLD activity was significantly reduced but never completely abolished by the inhibitor. Since BFA is a potent inhibitor of the activation of ARF proteins (25Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 26Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 27Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10820-10825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) this finding suggests that the activation of ARF is a key step in the signaling pathway by which PDGF regulates PLD activity. In contrast, the activation of PLD by PMA could only be partially blocked by BFA, suggesting that the activation of ARF is one of two or more parallel pathways by which the activation of PKC modulates PLD activity. Since the exposure to BFA was acute (10 min), the effects of the drug cannot be related to the long-term cytotoxic effects of BFA. Fig. 2 shows the dose response of PDGF-induced PLD activity to increasing concentrations of BFA. As shown, the half-maximal dose of BFA was less than 5 μg/ml, and doses of 25–50 μg/ml completely ablated the stimulatory effects of PDGF. In contrast, the inactive BFA analog B17 (25 μg/ml) had no effects on the stimulation of PLD activity by PDGF. These experiments confirmed that the effects of BFA were specific. The effects of Clostridium botulinum C3 exotoxin were also examined. This protein catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of proteins of the Rho family and has been reported to inhibit agonist-induced PLD activation in some cellular systems (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Hess J.H. Ross A.H. Qiu R-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with C3 using the scrape loading procedure reported by Malcolm et al. (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells loaded with C3 and controls were incubated overnight. The action of the toxin was evident, since treated cells were rounded and were not tightly attached to the culture dish. Furthermore, the level of ADP-ribosylation of Rho was determined by incubating cell extracts with additional C3 in the presence of 32P-labeled NAD. After incubation for 90 min, aliquots of the reaction mixture, normalized according to their protein contents, were electrophoresed, and the level of incorporation of 32P to specific bands was determined by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3 A, control untreated cells were extensively labeled during the in vitroADP-ribosylation reaction, whereas cells pretreated with C3 incorporated very little [32P]ADP-ribose. This confirms that the scrape-loading procedure was effective in the modification of endogenous Rho proteins. Fig. 3 B shows the activity of PLD in HIRcB cells scrape-loaded with C3 transferase and mock-scraped cells. Both agonist and PMA induced a significant activation of PLD although to a smaller level than that observed with cells that had not been previously subjected to scraping (compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 B). However, C3 exotoxin had no significant effects on the activation of PLD by either agent. These results clearly support the hypothesis that ARF rather than Rho activation is necessary for the stimulation of PLD by PDGF and PKC. We have recently used a simple cell permeabilization and reconstitution assay to analyze the role of cytosolic factors in the stimulation of membrane-bound PLD (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the use of low concentrations of digitonin to permeabilize the cells. Since digitonin induces the formation of membrane pores large enough to allow the passage of macromolecules, this permeabilization procedure results in the depletion of cytoplasmic proteins (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Rumenapp U. Geiszt M. Wahn F. Schmidt M. Jacobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that, after digitonin permeabilization, both ARF and Rho proteins leak out of the cell in substantial quantities. This suggests that both ARF and Rho proteins are mainly cytosolic in non-stimulated cells. However, when the cells were permeabilized in the presence of GTPγS (100 μM), PDGF (30 ng/ml), ATP (1 mm), and Mg2+ (2 mm), most of the G protein was found associated to a particulate fraction. Similar effects were obtained when PDGF was replaced by PMA (500 nm), but the effects of PMA required the addition of PKCα (5 μg/ml). This demonstrates the recruitment of both ARF and Rho to membranes by the combined effect of the agonist and the GTP analogue. Neither PDGF nor PMA in the absence of GTPγS had any effects on the translocation of ARF and RhoA. Likewise, the guanine nucleotide alone was ineffective in promoting the translocation of ARF and RhoA in the absence of agonist. Fig. 4 also shows that digitonin-treated cells can be ARF- and Rho-depleted when permeabilization is done in the absence of agonists and GTP analogues. We took advantage of this phenomenon to study the involvement of these G proteins in the process of activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA. During permeabilization, GTPγS and PDGF added separately did not alter PLD activity whereas the inclusion of both agents together activated PLD significantly (Fig. 5). Cells that were permeabilized in the absence of agonist and GTPγS (conditions in which they were depleted of ARF and Rho proteins, as shown in Fig. 4) failed to respond to PDGF and GTPγS added after permeabilization. This shows that some cytosolic factor lost during the permeabilization treatment is necessary to mediate the effects of PDGF on PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of myristoylated recombinant ARF1 was sufficient to restore the sensitivity of PLD to PDGF- and GTPγS. In contrast, addition of either recombinant RhoA that had been geranyl-geranylated in vitro or recombinant RhoA-GDI complexes produced in yeast failed to reconstitute agonist-dependent PLD activation. These results demonstrate that ARF proteins mediate the effects of PDGF on PLD and that Rho proteins are not necessary for the effects of PDGF on the activity of PLD. This result confirms the data obtained with exotoxin C3 reported above. The role of ARF proteins in the PKC-dependent activation of PLD was studied using a similar experimental design. In these studies, however, all permeabilization studies (including controls) were carried out in the presence of ATP and additional PKCα (5 μg/ml). Fig. 6 shows that the PLD activity of cells permeabilized in the absence of agonist and GTPγS was no longer sensitive to the addition of PMA and GTP analogues. Addition of myristoylated recombinant ARF1 restored PMA and GTPγS sensitivity to PLD, but recombinant RhoA had no effects. Therefore, PKC-mediated activation of PLD is also mediated, at least in part, by ARF proteins. The evidence presented here shows that the activation of Rho is not necessary for PKC- or PDGF-dependent PLD activation. To confirm the conclusion that ARF proteins mediate PDGF and PMA-dependent activation of PLD, HIRcB cells were transiently transfected with ARF-GFP chimeras created using wild-type and mutated ARF1 and ARF6. We have previously shown that ARF1-GFP chimeras behave very similarly to ARF1 (29Vasudevan C. Han W. Tan Y. Nie Y. Li D. Shome K. Watkins S. Levitan E. Romero G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these ARF-GFP constructs behave like the endogenous ARF proteins with the additional advantage that, because of the expression of the fluorescent chimera, the efficiency of the transfection procedure can be determined for each plate of cells by epifluorescence and phase contrast microscopy. The effects of the overexpression of wt-ARF1, wt-ARF6, T31N-ARF1, and T27N-ARF6 on the activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA are shown in Fig. 7. The overexpression of either wild-type protein had no effect on the stimulation of PLD by either PDGF or PMA. In contrast, the overexpression of the putative dominant-negative mutants T31N-ARF1 and T27N-ARF6 blocked completely the effects of PDGF and significantly reduced the response to phorbol esters. We have previously shown that ARF proteins mediate the activation of PLD by insulin in HIRcB cells. The data reported here suggest that ARF proteins also mediate the activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA. This conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) BFA, an inhibitor of ARF activation, inhibits PDGF- and PMA-induced PLD activation; 2) addition of recombinant ARF is sufficient to restore agonist-dependent PLD activation to permeabilized, cytoplasm-depleted cells; and 3) dominant-negative mutants of ARF1 and ARF6 inhibit the response of cellular PLD to stimulation by PDGF or phorbol esters. Since a significant amount of evidence suggestive of a direct role of Rho proteins in receptor-mediated PLD activation has been published in the past few years, we also examined the role of Rho in PDGF- and PMA-dependent PLD activation in HIRcB cells. This was done by delivering C3 transferase to cells by the scrape-loading procedure of Malcolm et al. (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Preloading of cells with exotoxin C3 was apparently toxic to cells and significantly reduced the levels of incorporation of labeled fatty acid. Because of this reduced uptake (20–30% of that of control cells), the amount of PtdBu generated after addition of the agonist was significantly smaller than that observed with control cells. However, when the amount of PtdBu was normalized to the total levels of radiolabeled lipids, we observed that the fraction of the lipid converted to PtdBu was the same in C3-treated and untreated cells. Thus, we conclude that the net activity of PLD remained unchanged after C3 treatment. These results appear to contradict the reports of Malcolm et al. (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and Hesset al. (11Hess J.H. Ross A.H. Qiu R-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), who claimed, based on a similar assay, that C3 blocked the activation of PLD by PDGF and PMA. To validate our observations, several independent analyses were performed to confirm the effectiveness of the C3 exotoxin scrape-loading procedures. First, we examined the morphology of the scrape-loaded cells. Our observations confirmed that at least 80% of the C3-treated cells had a round morphology and were loosely attached to the plate, as reported by Malcolm et al. (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Since these morphological changes could have been attributed to a small but measurable fraction of Rho being ADP-ribosylated, we also confirmed the extent of the modification of Rho by a standard ADP-ribosylation assay. This assay is based on the incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose to Rho extracted from cells after pretreatment with C3 transferase. Our data, shown in Fig. 3 A, clearly confirm that greater than 95% of the intracellular Rho had been modified during the treatment with the transferase in vivo. On close inspection, the discrepancies between our conclusions and those of Malcolm et al. (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are likely consequences of the normalization of our data. Malcolm et al. reported total amounts of PtdBu formation (10Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas our data are expressed in terms of the fraction of lipid converted to PtdBu. Since the incorporation of radiolabeled fatty acid was much smaller in the C3-treated cells, normalization of the data to the total amount of available substrate eliminates the apparent effect of C3 on PLD activity. We also observed a few additional features of the scraped cells. For instance, agonist- and PMA-induced PLD activities of cells that had been previously scraped and replated were always significantly smaller than those of cells that had not been scraped, independently of whether or not the cells were loaded with C3 exotoxin. An explanation of this is that during the scraping procedure some cell components that participate in the physiological activation of PLD may be lost. In agreement with this idea, the levels of activation of PLD in scraped cells were comparable with those observed in digitonin-permeabilized cells. These observations do not exclude a role for Rho in the mediation of the activation of PLD in these cells. The data show that PDGF and PMA induce Rho translocation, suggesting that these agents promote the activation of the G protein. However, ARF translocation occurs as well (Fig. 4). Thus, a simple correlation between the activation of these G proteins and PLD activity is insufficient to prove a role in agonist-mediated activation of PLD. A more detailed analysis is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In these experiments, untreated cells were permeabilized with digitonin and then treated with PDGF and PMA + PKCα in the presence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 4, under these conditions both Rho and ARF proteins are depleted from the cells. The data show that these cells can no longer activate PLD in response to the addition of agonists. However, the addition of recombinant ARF was sufficient to reconstitute agonist-dependent PLD activity. Therefore, the role of RhoA in PMA- and PDGF-induced PLD activation is not essential in these cells. These conclusions are in agreement with our previous analysis of the activation of PLD by insulin in HIRcB fibroblasts (23Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Treatment with C3 transferase had no detectable effects on insulin-induced PLD activity, but BFA abolished it completely in a dose-dependent manner. Reconstitution studies using permeabilized cells demonstrated that ARF proteins mediate insulin-dependent PLD activation in HIRcB cells. Furthermore, experiments done with cells transiently overexpressing ARF mutants further strengthen this conclusion: putative dominant-negative mutants of ARF1 and ARF6 inhibit PDGF- and PMA-dependent PLD activation (although to different degrees) while the overexpression of the wild-type proteins had no effects. Therefore, we conclude that the main pathway by which growth factors and PMA modulate PLD activity in these cells involves the activation of ARF proteins. EGF-mediated modulation of PLD activity appears to be mediated by Rac1 proteins in Rat1 fibroblasts (11Hess J.H. Ross A.H. Qiu R-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PKC activates PLD directly by a mechanism that does not appear to involve protein phosphorylation (12Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKC in growth factor-dependent PLD activation has been shown in 3T3 cells (5Yeo E.J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), but the role of PKC in PLD activation has been questioned in other systems (34Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A role for RhoA has been suggested in several systems (5Yeo E.J. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the ARF proteins have been shown to activate PLDin vitro (14Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 20Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, many signaling pathways appear to converge on the activation of PLD. This level of redundancy in the pathways that lead to PLD activation is strongly suggestive of an essential role for these enzymes in cellular signaling. Much further work is needed to determine the relative roles of these diverse pathways in receptor-mediated PLD regulation and to understand the precise functional role of PLD in cell physiology. We thank Dr. Richard Kahn for his gift of 1D9 antibody and Dr. Julie Donaldson for her gift of inactive BFA analogues.

https://openalex.org/W1898252427,"The goal of this study was to explain the priming effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes on leukotriene B4 (LTB4) biosynthesis after stimulation with the receptor-mediated agonist formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). This priming effect for LTB4 biosynthesis was maximal after a 30 min preincubation with LPS but was lost when incubations were extended to 90 min or longer. Priming with LPS resulted in an enhanced maximal activation of 5-lipoxygenase (5- to15-fold above unprimed cells) as well as a prolonged activation of the enzyme after stimulation with fMLP compared to that measured in unprimed cells. The activation of 5-lipoxygenase was associated with its translocation to the nuclear fraction of the cell after stimulation of LPS-primed cells but not of unprimed cells. Priming of cells with LPS also resulted in an enhanced capacity (fivefold increase) for arachidonic acid (AA) release after stimulation with fMLP compared to unprimed cells as measured by mass spectrometry. This release of AA was very efficiently blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the 85 kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor MAFP (IC50=10nM) but not by the 14 kDa secretory PLA2 inhibitor SB 203347 (up to 5 microM), indicating that the 85 kDa cPLA2 is the PLA2 responsible for AA release in response to receptor-mediated agonists. In accord with inhibitor studies, the LPS-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2 followed the same kinetics as the priming for AA release, and a measurable fMLP-induced translocation of cPLA2 was observed only in primed cells. As with AA release and LTB4 biosynthesis, both the phosphorylation and capacity to translocate cPLA2 were reversed when the preincubation period with LPS was extended to 120 min. These results explain some of the cellular events responsible for the potentiation and subsequent decline of functional responses of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes recruited to inflammatory foci."
https://openalex.org/W1543083586,"Although oxidation of cortisol or corticosterone by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) represents the physiological mechanism conferring specificity for aldosterone on the mineralocorticoid receptor in mineralocorticoid target tissues, little attention has been paid until now to the expression and activity of this enzyme in human adrenals. We have shown that human adrenal cortex expresses 11beta-HSD type 2 (11beta-HSD2) gene, and found a marked 11beta-HSD2 activity in microsomal preparations obtained from slices of decapsulated normal human adrenal cortices. Under basal conditions, adrenal slices secreted, in addition to cortisol and corticosterone (B), sizeable amounts of cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (DH-B), the inactive forms to which the former glucocorticoids are converted by 11beta-HSD. Addition of the 11beta-HSD inhibitor glycyrrhetinic acid elicited a moderate rise in the production of cortisol and B and suppressed that of cortisone and DH-B. ACTH and angiotensin II evoked a marked rise in the secretion of cortisol and B, but unexpectedly depressed the release of cortisone and DH-B. ACTH also lowered the capacity of adrenal slices to convert [3H]cortisol to [3H]cortisone. This last effect of ACTH was concentration-dependently abolished by both aminoglutethimide and cyanoketone, which blocks early steps of steroid synthesis, but not by metyrapone, an inhibitor of 11beta-hydroxylase. Collectively, these findings indicate that the human adrenal cortex possesses an active 11beta-HSD2 engaged in the inactivation of newly formed glucocorticoids. The activity of this enzyme is negatively modulated by the main agonists of glucocorticoid secretion through an indirect mechanism, probably involving the rise in the intra-adrenal concentration of non-11beta-hydroxylated steroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2126597796,"Previous studies have shown that an inducible Raf-1 kinase protein, ΔRaf-1:ER, activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-signaling pathway, which is required for the transformation of the rat salivary epithelial cell line, Pa-4.

Through this approach, the gene encoding the α-subunit of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (α-ENaC) was identified as a target of activated Raf-1 kinases. α-ENaC down-regulation could also be seen in cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), indicating that the repression of steady-state α-ENaC mRNA level was dependent upon the activity of protein kinase C, the target of TPA, as well.

Its sodium channel activity has been identified in distal segments of kidney tubule, airway epithelium, skin, bladder, colon, sweat, and salivary glands. By using functional expression assays in a Xenopusoocyte system, three ENaC subunits, denoted α-, β-, and γ-ENaC, have recently been identified, cloned, and characterized (2Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

Although the α-subunit is sufficient for channel activity, expression of the β- or γ-subunit(s) of ENaC alone or concurrently does not reconstitute an amiloride-sensitive conductance in Xenopus oocytes, but either subunit augments the channel activity of α-ENaC by three- to five-fold. When both β- and γ-ENaC are co-injected with α-ENaC, greater than 100-fold potentiation of the amiloride-sensitive current is observed (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I.

ENaC plays a major role in the control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, as demonstrated by the discovery that mutations in ENaC subunits are associated with hypertensive or hypotensive genetic diseases such as Liddle's syndrome (8Shimkets R.A.

Though the exact subunit composition of ENaC is still being resolved, the expression of a functionally active sodium channel is dependent on the presence of α-ENaC. Indeed, mouse α-ENaC(−/−) neonates, generated by homologous gene targeting, develop respiratory distress and die within 40 h from an inability to clear the lung liquid (10Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The expression of ENaC is up-regulated by glucocorticoids in the human fetal lung, where mRNAs of all three subunits increase in response to dexamethasone. In contrast, the induction of ENaCgenes by aldosterone appears to be subunit-specific, since β- and γ-ENaC, but not α-ENaC mRNAs, are increased in rat distal colon (11Lingueglia E. Renard S.

However, the molecular components that constitute the complete signaling pathway(s) of these events are far from clear. In most eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated by several distinct signaling modalities. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, characterized as proline-directed serine/threonine kinases (14Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), are important cellular-signaling components that transduce signals from cell membrane to nucleus in response to a wide variety of stimuli (15Davis R.J.

Each MAP kinase is activated by a distinct kinase module, which consists of MAP kinase kinase kinase, MAP kinase kinase, and MAP kinase. These kinase modules may provide a structural basis for different signaling cascades and thereby relay extracellular stimuli to specific effectors. The MAP kinase kinases in the ERK-signaling module are MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 (25Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), although the MAP kinase kinase kinases includes Raf-1 and MEKK1 (26Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M.

Biochemical and genetic studies have revealed that the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is a pivotal cascade that culminates in phosphorylation of downstream cytosolic and nuclear substrates, ultimately leading to phenotypic cellular changes. The mechanisms involved in the activation events for the ERK kinase cascade have been studied in detail. Raf-1 kinase is activated through interaction with membrane-associated Ras-GTP and in part by phosphorylation (28Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 29Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In addition, there is ample evidence for the protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway of ERK kinase activation via Raf-1 kinase (30Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC is the major effector for phorbol esters, it has been implicated in the activation of the Raf/ERK pathway (31Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G.

For instance, treatment with phorbol esters (e.g. TPA) leads to a rapid activation of Ras and/or Raf in most cell types (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 34El-Shemerly M.Y. Besser D. Nagasawa M. Nagamine Y. J. Biol.

More direct evidence for the involvement of PKC in regulating this pathway has come from transfection or microinjection experiments, which report that TPA treatment or expression of PKC-α and PKC-η can induce Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation (34El-Shemerly M.Y.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In our efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Raf-1-mediated cell differentiation, proliferation, and transformation, we employed the polymerase chain reaction-based differential display method (38Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4705) Google Scholar) to identify genes that are regulated in response to Raf-1 activation. In this report, we demonstrate that the α-ENaC mRNA level is selectively down-regulated. Because the α-subunit of ENaC is critical for channel activity, we have investigated the signaling pathway that modulates its expression. Recently, the α-ENaC gene has been shown to be organized into 13 exons and spans at least 17 kb of the human genome (39Ludwig M. Bolkenius U. Wickert L. Marynen P. Bidlingmaier F. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have characterized the first 5 kb of theα-ENaC promoter and engineered several α-ENaC/CAT reporter constructs to study the molecular regulatory mechanism(s) forENaC gene expression. Although much attention has focused on the up-regulation of ENaC, to date very little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which cells down-regulate ENaC expression. This paper proposes one such mechanism in salivary epithelial cells, where MAP kinase/ERK activation leads to down-regulation of α-ENaC by repressing the transcription of the α-ENaC gene. The rat parotid epithelial cell line Pa-4, also known as parotid C5 cells (40Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was plated out on Primaria culture dishes (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (1.1 μm), glutamate (5 mm), and kanamycin monosulfate (60 μg/ml) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 35 °C. A stably transfected Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER clonal cell line was established by transfecting Pa-4 cells with the plasmid pLNCΔRaf-1:ER (41Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by a LipofectAMINETM-mediated method and selected with Geneticin (G418, 600 μg/ml) as described previously (42Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 (1:1, phenol red-free) medium supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum plus the aforementioned ingredients. The following reagents were stored under light-sensitive conditions. β-Estradiol was resuspended to 1 mm in ethanol and stored at −20 °C, TPA was resuspended to 100 μg/ml ethanol and stored at −80 °C, and PD 98059 was purchased from Calbiochem, resuspended to 20 mm in Me2SO, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA (200 ng) from either parental or ΔRaf-1:ER stably transfected Pa-4 cells was reverse-transcribed using primer pair sets provided by GenHunter's RNAimageTM kit 1. Products were labeled by incorporation of35S-dATP during DNA synthesis via polymerase chain reaction. Reaction products from both parental and stably transfected cells utilizing identical primer pairs were compared in parallel by size fractionation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. Changes in gene expression between parental and transfected cells were visually indicated by asymmetric banding patterns on autoradiographic X-OmatTM film. Bands of interest were excised from the gel, eluted, and reamplified before being ligated into pCRTMII TA Cloning vector (Invitrogen). All clones were sequenced using a SequenaseTM version 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA fragments were further analyzed using the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis PackageTM to search nucleic acid data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for sequence comparison. Total RNA was extracted from parental or ΔRaf-1:ER-transfected Pa-4 cells with Trizol® Reagents (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) as instructed. The quality and quantity of RNA were analyzed by fractionating the same amount of RNA from each sample on a 1.5% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 mm formaldehyde, staining with ethidium bromide, and comparing 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNAs. Equal amounts of RNA (18 μg/sample) from parental, transfected, or treated cells were electrophoresed through a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and UV-cross-linked. All blots were prehybridized for 1 h with QuickHyb (Stratagene) and hybridized according to manufacturer's recommendations. To screen various blots, [32P]dCTP-labeled probes were synthesized using isolated α-ENaC cDNA fragment (bases 1–905) as a template. A rat β-actin probe was also included to ensure that the quality and quantity of RNA between lanes were comparable. All blots were washed in a 0.1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.5% SDS solution at 60 °C. To improve autoradiographic detection, exposure was carried out overnight at −80 °C between intensifying screens. The membranes were also subjected to electronic autoradiography with the Instantimager 228 (Packard Instrument Co.) to quantitate radioactivity in each band for comparative analysis. Parental and ΔRaf-1:ER stably transfected Pa-4 cells were washed and pelleted at 4 °C in Earle's balanced salt solution. Equal amounts of total protein from cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted on Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane (Millipore), and incubated with either anti-α-ENaC antibody (courtesy of Dr. Peter Smith, Allegheny University) or anti-eIF-2α antibody (courtesy of Dr. Roger Duncan, University of Southern California). ERK1/2 blots were probed with either Anti-ActiveTM MAP kinase (Promega, WI) or anti-ERK1 C-16-G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham) were used to visualize proteins of interest. To study the rat α-ENaC gene promoter/enhancer, a male Sprague-Dawley rat genomic library (in λ DASH II, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with the32P-labeled 5′-most α-ENaC cDNA probe as described previously (43Lin H.H. Ann D.K. Genomics. 1991; 10: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Four positive plaques were identified from an initial screening of four rat genomic equivalents. Corresponding phage plaques were selected, diluted, replated, and rescreened to obtain single phage clones. One purified positive clone, named λφ7, showed a strong hybridization signal. λφ7 was further characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing analyses. A 5.5-kb EcoRI fragment of λφ7 (clone 38) that contains the 5′-flanking region of the α-ENaC gene was used to make two reporter constructs: α-ENaC/CATl and α-ENaC/CATs. The α-ENaC/CATl and α-ENaC/CATs constructs used for transient transfection assays were constructed from a 4.9- or 1.4-kb DNA fragment of clone 38, respectively; the shorter representing a truncation of the longer DNA fragment (see Fig. 4), where 3.5 kb of the 5′-end was deleted. Both DNAs were ligated upstream of the CAT reporter gene in Promega's pCAT basic vector. These two DNA fragments contain an identical 3′ end, which corresponds to 156 bp upstream of the putative translation start site in the first exon of rat α-ENaC gene.(2Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) Plasmids were transiently transfected into Pa-4 cells by the lipofectAMINE™-mediated method as described previously (40Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In all experiments, Δ56FosdE-luciferase plasmid, whose expression level is unaffected by Raf/ERK activation, was included as an indicator plasmid to normalize transfection efficiency. The plasmid molar ratio and total amount of transfected DNA (2 μg) were kept constant by supplementing with the pCAT basic vector and/or pkRSPA.(44Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) Twenty-four h after transfection, the medium was changed, and cells were treated (when appropriate) and harvested 24 h thereafter. We have been using the rodent salivary gland as a model system to study the genomic response(s) leading to cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Recently, we have shown that changes in the morphology of the parotid salivary gland correlate with the activation of Raf-1 kinase (42Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To study the phenotypic consequences of Raf-1 activation in the rat parotid salivary gland, a parotid epithelial cell line (Pa-4) was stably transfected with a gene encoding a human Raf-1 kinase/estrogen receptor fusion protein (ΔRaf-1:ER). ΔRaf-1:ER responds to estradiol in a dose- and time-dependent manner (41Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S.

Furthermore, activation of ΔRaf-1:ER is known to be independent of the endogenous estrogen receptor (ER) since either ER agonists or antagonists activate the ΔRaf-1:ER protein (41Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Ramirez J.J.G. Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C.

Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles1997Google Scholar). Activation of ΔRaf-1:ER resulted in a number of morphological changes in Pa-4 cells (42Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reflecting the changes in mRNA expression. We compared these changes in mRNA expression between the parental (Pa-4) and ΔRaf-1:ER-transfected cell line (Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER) using the polymerase chain reaction-based method, mRNA differential display. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products from Pa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells revealed a ∼125-base pair fragment (B4) that was markedly decreased in Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells (data not shown). Sequence analysis indicated that B4 was identical to the 3′ terminus of the rat α-ENaC cDNA. To confirm the decrease of the α-ENaC message in Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells, a Northern analysis was performed on total RNA prepared from Pa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells using the B4 fragment as a probe (Fig. 1 A). In confirmation of the results from the mRNA differential display, a single band corresponding to the reported size of the α-ENaC message (∼3700 bases) (2Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) was detected in RNA from Pa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells (Fig. 1 A), whereas a dramatic decrease in signal was observed in ΔRaf-1:ER-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, 3rd and 4th lanes). Estradiol alone did not decrease the expression of α-ENaC in Pa-4 cells (Fig. 1 A, 1st and 2nd lanes), indicating that the down-regulation of α-ENaC mRNA is a consequence of ΔRaf-1:ER activity and not an ER-mediated event via the estrogen response element. Moreover, the basal α-ENaC expression in unstimulated Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells was already repressed in comparison to the α-ENaC level in parental Pa-4 cells. This was not surprising in that the Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cell line has already been shown to exhibit a low level of ΔRaf-1:ER kinase activity (42Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), probably due to an incomplete inhibition of the ΔRaf-1:ER protein in these stably transfected cells (see below). Thus it is possible that this remaining ΔRaf-1:ER activity is high enough to repress α-ENaC expression. To determine the relative amount of α-ENaC protein, a Western analysis using antibody against α-ENaC was performed. Consistent with the Northern analysis (Fig. 1 A), a significant decrease in the amount of α-ENaC protein was detected in Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER-cells (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). The amount of the translation factor eIF-2α in Pa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cell lysates was also determined (Fig. 1 B, lower panel) to demonstrate that the decrease in α-ENaC was not due to nonspecific down-regulation or protein degradation. The half-life of α-ENaC protein is reported to be relatively short at about 1 h (47Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Although we do not know if ΔRaf-1:ER activation directly affects ENaC function, it is likely that the reduced availability of both α-ENaC message and protein would lead to diminished sodium absorption across the parotid epithelium. The ΔRaf-1:ER protein has been reported to mimic the action of endogenous Raf-1 kinase (41Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Li D. Lin H.H. McMahon M. Ma H. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25062-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the low level of ΔRaf-1:ER kinase activity in Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells made it necessary for us to investigate whether activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK-signaling cascade by a pharmacological means would down-regulate α-ENaC in the parental cell. Since PKC activates Raf-1 kinase, we treated cells with a known PKC activator, TPA. A Northern analysis was performed on Pa-4 cells that were treated with TPA at intervals up to 12 h. A marked decrease in α-ENaC mRNA was observed within 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 2 A), implicating that the Raf-1 cascade down-regulates the α-ENaC gene. Although PKC activation with TPA induces ERK kinase activity in many cell types (48Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), we investigated whether TPA could activate ERK1/ERK2 in Pa-4 cells. A Western analysis of total protein from TPA-treated Pa-4 cells was performed with antibody that recognizes activated ERK2 and cross-reacts with activated ERK1. The kinetics of TPA-induced ERK activation were transient, as indicated by an increase in ERK phosphorylation within 5 min that declined to basal levels after 6 h. There was no change in the level of either ERK1 or ERK2 after TPA treatment, as indicated by an immunoblot probed with antibody that recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2. These data correlate well with the Northern analysis (Fig. 2 B) in which no further decrease in α-ENaC mRNA is observed between 6 to 12 h. These results suggest that TPA transiently activates the Raf/MEK/ERK-signaling module by demonstrating TPA-mediated transient activation of ERK1/2 in Pa-4 cells. We also compared the level of ERK activation between untreated ΔRaf-1:ER cells and TPA-treated Pa-4 cells to determine whether the sustained basal elevation of ΔRaf-1:ER kinase was sufficient to down-regulate α-ENaC. Fig. 2 C indicates that the basal level of activated ERK was elevated in ΔRaf-1:ER cells to a level comparable with that in TPA-stimulated Pa-4 cells. Although the level of activated ERK is slightly higher in TPA-treated Pa-4 cells, activation is transient. Therefore, it is conceivable that in ΔRaf-1:ER cells, the sustained elevation of activated ERK is sufficient to down-regulate α-ENaC mRNA expression. To further support this model, the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, was employed to co"
https://openalex.org/W2154166539,"To study mammary gland expression of the epithelium-restricted Ets factor, ESX, mouse cDNA and genomic sequences were cloned and a approximately 350 bp proximal promoter region with >80% mouse-human homology was identified that mediates ESX induction by serum, heregulin (HRG), or epidermal growth factor (EGF). ESX mRNA expression progressively increases during embryonic mouse development from day 7 and is detectable in virgin mammary glands; it shows little if any change during pregnancy, then declines to barely detectable levels after 3 days of lactation. Similarly, cultured HC11 cells from midpregnant mouse mammary epithelium show an increase in ESX expression upon reaching lactogenic competency (in the presence of EGF or HRG), with a decline to barely detectable levels upon exposure to lactogenic hormones that induce milk protein (beta-casein) expression. In contrast, involuting mouse and rat mammary glands show maximal ESX expression. High ESX levels are also seen in the involuting ventral prostate gland of rats. These findings, including the persistence of up-regulated ESX in fully regressed mammary glands, suggest that ESX expression can be induced by soluble growth factors and is maximally up-regulated in those partially committed epithelial cells destined to survive both the apoptotic and remodeling phases of glandular involution."

In this study, we demonstrate that the crtA-crtI intergenic region contains divergent promoters that initiate transcription 116 base pairs apart, based on primer extension analyses.

Like most species of anoxygenic (non-oxygen evolving) photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodobacter capsulatus represses synthesis of its photosynthetic apparatus under aerobic growth conditions (1Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Oxygen repression involves the regulation of photosynthesis gene expression, which is controlled by overlapping regulatory circuits (reviewed in Ref. 2Bauer C.E. Bird T.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Anaerobic activation requires a two-component system composed of a sensor histidine kinase (RegB) and a response regulator (RegA) to activate reaction center, light harvesting I, and light harvesting II structural genes that are encoded by the puh, puf, and puc operons, respectively (3Inoue K. Kouadio J.-L. Mosley C.S. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Mosley C.S. Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. J.

The aerobic repression circuit uses the repressor CrtJ to decrease aerobic expression of bacteriochlorophyll (bch) and carotenoid (crt) biosynthesis genes and of light harvesting II structural genes (puc) (6Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CrtJ-repressed promoters typically exhibit an Escherichia coli-like ς-70 sequence motif with one or two copies of a conserved CrtJ recognition palindrome TGTN12ACA in the −10 or −35 region (7Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Alberti M. Burke D.E. Hearst J.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E.

Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Regulation of Photosynthesis Gene Expression. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1221-1234Google Scholar). For example, the R. capsulatus bchCpromoter has two CrtJ palindromes spaced 8 bp1 apart, with one spanning the −10 and the other the −35 promoter recognition sequences. Binding of CrtJ to these sites is redox-dependent, with in vitro binding much tighter under oxidizing conditions than under reducing conditions (10Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in a companion study by Ponnampalamet al. (11Ponnampalam S.N. Elsen S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30757-30761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), repression of bchC involves cooperative interactions between CrtJ bound to adjacent palindromes. Consequently, mutations in either palindrome disrupt in vivoregulation by CrtJ (12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The spacing between the two bchCpalindromes is also critical, as demonstrated by the observation that +6- and +11-bp additions between the palindromes abolished CrtJ binding (11Ponnampalam S.N. Elsen S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30757-30761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A similar arrangement of CrtJ palindromes spanning the −35 and the −10 promoter regions is also found in the Rhodobacter sphaeroides bchC and puc promoters (13McGlynn P. Hunter C.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.K. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1146-1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in theRhodopseudomonas palustris pucB and pucEpromoters (15Tadros M.H. Katsiou E. Hoon M.A. Yurkova N. Ramji D.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This suggests that cooperative interactions between CrtJ bound to adjacent palindromes may be a highly conserved mechanism of repression. In addition to promoters that have two closely spaced palindromes, there are several other CrtJ regulated promoters that appear to contain only one palindrome in the −10 to −40 region. For example, the intergenic sequence between the divergently transcribed crtIand crtA genes from R. capsulatus contains two palindromes located 76 bp apart (distance calculated from the axis of dyad symmetry for each palindrome). One palindrome overlaps a potential −10 region of the crtA promoter, and the other overlaps a potential −35 region for the crtI promoter (8Alberti M. Burke D.E. Hearst J.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Regulation of Photosynthesis Gene Expression. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1083-1106Google Scholar). Inspection of the puc promoter region also indicates the presence of a single palindrome near the −35 promoter recognition sequence (16Nickens D.G. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4270-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a second putative CrtJ palindrome located 240 bp upstream. The presence of two distant CrtJ palindromes in the pucpromoter, and in the crtA-crtI intergenic region, is reminiscent of the gal, ara, or lacsystems, which require multiple binding sites to obtain full repression of gene expression (17Irani M.H. Orosz L. Adhya S. Cell. 1983; 32: 783-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Dunn T.M. Hahn S. Ogden S. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This raises the possibility that binding of CrtJ to distantly separated palindromes may be a requirement for full repressive activity of CrtJ in this second class of promoters. In this study, we used DNase I footprint analysis, gel mobility shift, and filter binding assays to demonstrate cooperative binding of CrtJ to the two separated palindromes in the puc and crtA-crtI promoter regions. We also demonstrated that cooperative interactions are required for efficient binding of CrtJin vitro and for efficient aerobic repression in vivo. The mechanism of cooperativity between distant sites will be discussed. The wild-type R. capsulatus strain SB1003 (20Yen H.C. Hu N.T. Marrs B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 619-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the crtJ-disrupted strain DB469 (21Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowlski J. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were grown at 34 °C in PYS medium (22Young D.A. Bauer C.E. Williams J.C. Marrs B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were grown under aerobic/dark or anaerobic photosynthetic conditions as described previously (22Young D.A. Bauer C.E. Williams J.C. Marrs B.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 mg/liter; spectinomycin, 100 mg/liter; and tetracycline, 10 mg/liter for E. coli; and kanamycin, 10 mg/liter; spectinomycin, 10 mg/liter; and tetracycline, 1 mg/liter forR. capsulatus. For the crtIexpression vector, a 2.7-kilobase SmaI-HindIII restriction fragment from pCrtI:Z (6Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the vector pPHU235 (24Hübner P. Willison J.C. Vignais P.M. Bickle T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut by ScaI-HindIII, creating the vector pES2. Amplification of a fragment containing only thecrtI palindrome was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pES2 as template, and using primers Ose25, 5′-CTC GAG TCT GGG TCC CTT GTA AT (which introduced a XhoI site, indicated in boldface letters, in the amplified fragment), and Ose26, 5′-AGC AAG CTT GGC TGC AGG TCG. The 1.5-kilobase amplified fragment was purified by using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and cloned into the pCR-Script SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene), creating the plasmid pES41. A 1.5-kilobaseXhoI-HindIII fragment from pES41 was then subcloned into XhoI-HindIII sites in pPHU235 to construct the plasmid pES42. Plasmids pDN12S and pDN13S, which contain defined puc:lacZ fusions (16Nickens D.G. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4270-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pPHU235-derived plasmids were mated into recipient strains as described by Nickens and Bauer (16Nickens D.G. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4270-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed from the cell culture as described by Miller (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and modified as described by Elsen et al. (26Elsen S. Richaud P. Colbeau A. Vignais P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7404-7412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CrtJ fused to an N-terminal tag of six histidine residues was overproduced using BL21(DE3)/pET28::CrtJ and purified as described by Ponnampalam and Bauer (10Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To reduce the amount of inclusion bodies formed, the cells were grown at 34 °C with a slow shaking (250 rpm) and induced when cultures reached an A 600 of 0.9, by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The purified protein was partitioned into 10-μl aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The final protein concentration, which was typically 1.6 mg/ml, was measured with the CrtJ extinction coefficient (ε180), which was determined using the A205/A280 method described by Scopes (27Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from a 600 ml culture of R. capsulatus SB1003 cells grown photosynthetically in PYS medium using the guanidinium thiocyanate-cesium chloride method of Kocabiyik (28Kocabiyik S. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 570-572PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications described by Kouadio (29Kouadio J.-L. Purification of Trans-acting Photosynthesis Gene Regulators from Rhodobacter capsulatus.Ph.D. thesis. Indiana University, 1997Google Scholar). For primer extension, the primers CrtA-F (5′-CGTCGAAACGGAACAGGCTGA) and CrtI-R (5′-ACAACGGCGCGACCCATACC) were commercially synthesized; these primers are designed to anneal the crtA and crtI transcripts, respectively. 32P labeling of the primers was performed as described by Jiang and Bauer (30Jiang Z.-Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5712-5719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer extension was carried out with 10 μg of total RNA per reaction, as previously reported by Kouadio (29Kouadio J.-L. Purification of Trans-acting Photosynthesis Gene Regulators from Rhodobacter capsulatus.Ph.D. thesis. Indiana University, 1997Google Scholar). A dideoxynucleotide sequencing ladder was obtained as described by the manufacturer (Sequenase sequencing kit, United States Biochemical) using the same labeled primers and the plasmid pCrtI:Z as a template (6Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to loading onto a 6% urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the reactions were heated at 90 °C for 5 min. Three probes were used for studying the effect of cooperative binding of CrtJ to thepucB or crtA/crtI promoter regions. Probes were prepared by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers that were 5′-end-labeled with 32P as described above. The amplified DNA segments were then purified by electrophoresis in a nondenaturating 5% polyacrylamide gel and recovered by electroelution. Amplification of the upstream (−279 to −296 bp) pucpalindrome utilized primers PucB-F3 (5′-CAATTCGACCTGAAAATTCC) and PucB-R2 (5′-CATCTTTGGGCGATTCCGGG), whereas amplification of the downstream palindrome (−39 to −56 bp) used primers PucB-F (5′-CCCGGAATCGCCCAAAGATG) and PucB-R3 (5′-AAGCTCTCTCGTTAAGTTC). For amplification of both upstream and downstream palindromes, primers PucB-F3 and PucB-R3 were utilized. Plasmid pLHIIZ (5Sganga M.W. Bauer C.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 945-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was first digested with EcoRI prior to use as a template for amplification of the puc promoter region. For amplification of the crtA palindrome, the primers CrtA-F and CrtI-R2 (5′-TGTCTCGCGACAAAACGTCTG) were used. Amplification of thecrtI palindrome used primers CrtA-F3 (5′-CTCAGACGTTTTGTCGCGAGACA) and CrtI-R. Amplification of both palindromes in the crtA-crtI intergenic region used primers CrtA-F and CrtI-R. The plasmid pCrtI:Z (6Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was used as a template for crtA-crtI promoter amplification, was digested with BamHI prior to amplification. Gel mobility assays were performed by first preparing 5 μl of 4× binding buffer (composed of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm DTT, 5 μl of dH2O, and 6 μl of different dilutions of purified CrtJ) to which 4 μl of the DNA substrate were added (composed of 4 fmol of32P-end labeled DNA probe and heparin as a nonspecific competitor at a 500-fold weight excess relative to the probe). Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, loaded on a native 4% Tris-glycine-EDTA-buffered polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed at room temperature. The polyacrylamide gel was then dried and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. PCR-amplified DNA segments of the puc promoter and of the crtA-crtI intergenic region that contained both palindromes, as described for the gel mobility shift assays, were used for DNase I footprint analysis. For selective labeling of DNA strands, one of the primers in the PCR was 5′32P-end-labeled prior to amplification. A 10-μl binding reaction mixture was first prepared containing 1 μl of DNA (22 fmol), 7 μl of H2O, and 2 μl of 5× footprint binding buffer composed of 125 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 250 mmpotassium acetate, 25 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm calcium chloride, 5 mm DTT, and 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction mixture was then added to a 10-μl solution of 1× footprint binding buffer containing various amounts of CrtJ. Digestion with DNase I and subsequent termination of the assay were then carried out as described previously (31Bird T.H. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A modified Maxam and Gilbert G + A chemical sequencing reaction was used for determining the location of DNase I protection (32Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were used to determine the fraction of purified CrtJ that was active in DNA binding (10Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as to determine the effective concentration for 50% response (EC50). For both assays, the binding reaction conditions were performed with the same volume and composition as that used for the gel mobility shift assays, with the exception of the absence of competitor and the addition of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the CrtJ dilution buffer. The binding assays involved a 30-min incubation of the 20-μl reaction mixtures at room temperature followed by filtering the mixture through 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) that had been presoaked in 1× binding buffer for at least 1 h at room temperature. Filters were then washed once with 1 ml of 1× binding buffer, air-dried in scintillation vials, and counted in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter in presence of 1 ml of Bio-Safe II biodegradable counting mixture (Research Products International Corp.). Nitrocellulose-filter-retention efficiencies, defined as the fraction of the total protein-DNA complexes retained on the filter, were calculated with 0.2–1 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA probe and varying amounts of CrtJ (from 0.02 to 90 pmol), and they ranged from 78 to 100%. To determine the percent of active protein, DNA excess assays contained 0.6 or 1 pmol of purified CrtJ incubated with varying amounts (from 0 to 1 pmol) of 32P-labeled DNA probes of thepuc promoter, containing either one or the two palindromes. The percentage of active protein was then calculated from the retention efficiencies of the filter and number of CrtJ binding sites as described in Ponnampalam and Bauer (10Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CrtJ purified using the modified expression system described above was typically 8% active. For EC50 calculation, the CrtJ DNA binding curves were drawn using curve fit values based on the ligand binding equation Cap *L n(K d + L n), with the GraFit program, version 3.03 (Erithacus Software Ltd.). We undertook an analysis of transcription start sites in the crtA-crtI intergenic region as a prelude to analysis of CrtJ binding to this region. Primer extension analysis using a crtI specific primer yielded a major product that corresponds to a G residue located 18 bp upstream of the start codon of crtI and two minor products located 9 and 10 nucleotides upstream (Fig. 1 A). Inspection of the sequence immediately upstream of the major primer extension product revealed a putative ς-70 type promoter on the basis of sequences located 10 (AATGCA) and 35 (TTGACG) bp upstream (Fig. 2 A). As indicated in Fig. 2, this region contains a single CrtJ binding sequence (TGTN12ACG) that overlaps the −35 promoter motif. Putative −10 (TATCAT) and −35 (TTGTAA) sequences can also be identified upstream from the weak start sites, with the CrtJ binding site overlapping the −35 region.Figure 2Features of the crtA-crtI and puc promoter sequences.

The region upstream from the major product contains −10 (AATATC) and −35 (ATTACA) promoter recognition sequences and a potential CrtJ binding palindrome (TGTN12ACA) that overlaps the −10 recognition sequence (Fig. 2 A). Inspection of the sequence upstream from the minor products did not reveal obvious −10 or −35 promoter recognition sequences (Fig. 2 A). If the upstream primer extension products do represent a transcription start site, this second crtA promoter is likely to be regulated by CrtJ because the CrtJ palindrome that spans the crtIpromoter also overlaps this promoter (Fig. 2 A). DNase I protection assays were performed on both strands of the crtA-crtIpromoter region to determine whether CrtJ binds to the palindromes that were identified by sequence analysis. The DNase I digestion patterns in Fig. 3 show that CrtJ protects the palindrome that spans the −10 region of the crtA promoter (best resolved with the top strand in Fig. 3 A), as well as the palindrome that spans the −35 region of the crtIpromoter (best resolved in Fig. 3 B). Several DNase I hypersensitive sites are present in each of the protected regions. We also undertook an analysis of CrtJ binding to the pucpromoter using similar techniques. Inspection of the sequence of this promoter region (Fig. 2 B) revealed the presence of two putative CrtJ palindromes, with one adjacent to the puc −35 motif (downstream palindrome) and the other one located 240 bp upstream (upstream palindrome). As showed by the DNase I digestion pattern generated with the top strand (Fig. 3 C), CrtJ protects a region extending from −274 to −308 bp that corresponds to the upstream CrtJ palindrome. DNase I protection patterns generated with the bottom strand (Fig. 3 D) exhibit CrtJ protection extending from −37 to −62 bp that corresponds to the downstream CrtJ palindrome. Several hypersensitive sites to DNase I digestion are also observed within these protected regions (Fig. 3, C and D). We next addressed whether cooperative interactions may occur among CrtJ bound to the palindrome sites located in thecrtA and crtI promoters or to the distantly separated puc binding sites, using gel retardation assays with probes that contained one or both of the relevant palindromes. As shown in Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–4,a complete shift of a DNA probe that contained both the crtAand crtI palindromes was observed with as little as 0.5 μg of CrtJ. In contrast, a DNA probe containing only thecrtA palindrome (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–8) or only thecrtI palindrome (lanes 9–12) required 2 μg of CrtJ to bind all the probe. (Note that the crtA and thecrtI probes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–12) are contaminated with another DNA fragment, amplified during the PCR step and co-purified with the specific probes. The absence of a shift with these contaminating DNA fragments indicates good specificity for CrtJ binding to the target DNA). Similar gel retardation assays were performed with DNA probes made from the puc promoter region. Using a probe containing both palindromes, we observed a complete shift with the lowest amount (0.35 μg) of CrtJ used (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–4). When more CrtJ was added, the shifted fragment exhibited even slower mobility, presumably caused by nonspecific binding of CrtJ or by the formation of highly ordered DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). When CrtJ was incubated with probes containing only the upstream (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–8) or downstream (Fig. 4 B, lanes 9–12) palindrome, a shift of the entire probe required 1.4 μg of purified CrtJ. To measure CrtJ-DNA binding affinities, we performed nitrocellulose filter binding assays with probes that contained one or both of the palindromic sites in the crtA-crtI and pucpromoter regions. For this analysis, the same probes that were used for the gel mobility shift assays were analyzed for filter retention with various amounts of CrtJ. The resulting binding curves (Fig. 5 A and B) indicate that probes that contained single palindromes produced EC50values 6–10-fold higher than for probes that contained two palindromes. When corrected for the percentage of active protein (see under “Materials and Methods”), the calculated EC50value for a probe with both the crtA and crtIpalindromes was 2.6 × 10−9m,versus 3.2 × 10−8 and 2.4 × 10−8m for probes that contained only thecrtA or crtI palindromes, respectively. For experiments that measured CrtJ binding to the puc promoter region, the calculated EC50 value for the probe containing both palindromes was 3.2 × 10−9m, compared with 1.6 × 10−8 and 2 × 10−8m for probes that contained only the upstream (−279 to −296) or downstream (−39 to −56) palindromes, respectively.

For analysis of puc expression, we used plasmid pDN13S, which has an extended 1051-bp puc promoter segment containing both palindromes, and plasmid pDN12S, which has a truncated 284-bp puc promoter segment containing only the downstream (−39 to −56) palindrome (Fig. 7 A) (16Nickens D.G. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4270-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When assayed for β-galactosidase activity in aerobically grown wild-type R. capsulatus cells (SB1003), we observed that cells harboring the construct with only one palindrome (pDN12S) have a significantly higher level of activity (144%) over cells that contain the construct that has two palindromes (pDN13S) (Fig. 7 B). This elevated activity observed with pDN12S is clearly a result of the inability of CrtJ to effectively repress puc expression, as the level of activity is similar to that observed with thecrtJ-disrupted strain DB469 carrying either pDN12S or pDN13S (Fig. 7 B). Two crtI:lacZ fusions were also constructed to assess the requirement for distantly separated CrtJ-binding sites in thecrtA-crtI intergenic region. Plasmid pES2 contains the entire crtA-crtI intergenic region, including both thecrtA and the crtI palindromes, whereas plasmid pES42 carries a truncated intergenic region in which thecrtA palindrome had been deleted (Fig. 7 C). As observed in Fig. 7 D, the wild-type cells harboring the construct containing only the crtI palindrome (pES42) had elevated aerobic β-galactosidase activity (133%) over cells that contained the plasmid that has both palindromes (pES2). This reflects the impairment of CrtJ to repress crtI expression if only one palindrome is present. Furthermore, when the crtApalindrome was deleted, no regulation of crtI expression by CrtJ was retained, as evidenced by similar β-galactosidase activities in SB1003 and the crtJ-disrupted strain DB469 carrying plasmid pES42 (Fig. 7 D). Thus, we conclude that the two CrtJ palindromes separated by 240 bp in the puc promoter region and by 76 bp in thecrtA-crtI intergenic region are required for efficient CrtJ-mediated repression of these genes in vivo. This study demonstrates that CrtJ binds to two palindromes that are located 76 bp apart in the crtA-crtI intergenic region and to two palindromes located 240 bp apart in the pucpromoter region. Efficient CrtJ repression of crtA, crtI,and puc expression involves cooperative interactions between CrtJ bound to these palindromes. Cooperative interaction has also been demonstrated for CrtJ repression of the bchC promoter, which has two closely spaced (neighboring) palindromes (10Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Ponnampalam S.N. Elsen S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30757-30761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, a common characteristic of DNA binding by CrtJ appears to be a requirement for two binding sites that are either closely spaced, as for the bchC promoter, or distant, as for the pucand the crtA and crtI promoters. Quantitative filter binding analyses indicate that CrtJ has similar affinities for the individual binding sites that are in the puc, crtA and crtI promoters, as demonstrated by EC50 values that range from 1.6 × 10−8to 3.2 × 10−8m. Surprisingly, CrtJ has the same affinity for the TGTN12ACA palindromes as for the variant TGTN12ACG that is present in thecrtI promoter (Fig. 6). These values are very similar to that reported for the upstream bchC palindrome (7.8 × 10−8m) by Ponnampalam et al. (11Ponnampalam S.N. Elsen S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30757-30761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the companion study. In contrast, CrtJ exhibits a significantly reduced affinity (>1 μm) for the downstreambchC palindrome (11Ponnampalam S.N. Elsen S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30757-30761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) despite the fact that this palindrome still exhibits a very good consensus sequence (Fig. 6). The only significant difference is that this sequence exhibits a substitution of an A for a T two nucleotides upstream from the ACA that is conserved in the other palindromes. This indicates that a T at this position may be critical for effective CrtJ binding. Compared with individual sites, the affinity of CrtJ for DNA fragments that contain the two puc palindromes, or both thecrtA and crtI palindromes, is 6–11-fold higher (3.2 × 10−9 and 2.6 × 10−9m, respectively). This increase of affinity is similar to the observed 26-fold increase in CrtJ binding to two palindromes in thebchC promoter region over a single binding site (11Ponnampalam S.N. Elsen S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30757-30761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Even though there must be some fundamental differences in the interactions among CrtJ bound to these two different classes of promoters (i.e. the potential involvement of DNA looping between distant palindromes versus direct interaction between adjacent palindromes), the relative binding affinities and level of repression are conserved. Our analysis of transcription start sites in the crtA-crtIintergenic region indicates that one of the CrtJ-binding sites overlaps a ς-70 type −35 motif for the crtI promoter. The other binding site overlaps the −10 motif for the crtA promoter. Thus, cooperative binding of CrtJ to these two palindromes provides a mechanism of coordinately repressing these divergent promoters. What is the significance of co-repressing the crtA and crtI promoters? Previous studies have postulated thatcrtI is the first of a two-gene operon that also containscrtB (7Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Leach F. Hearst J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 34Armstrong G.A. Cook D.N. Ma D. Alberti M. Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). crtI and crtB are known to code for phytoene dehydrogenase and phytoene synthase, respectively, which catalyze two of the earliest steps in carotenoid biosynthesis (35Giuliano G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8329-8338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the translational stop codon for crtA overlaps the translational start codon forbchI; thus, the transcripts initiating at thecrtA promoter should transcribe the downstreambchI gene (34Armstrong G.A. Cook D.N. Ma D. Alberti M. Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Young D.A. Rudzik M.B. Marrs B.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 213-218Crossref Google Scholar). bchI codes for a subunit of magnesium chelatase, an enzyme involved in inserting Mg2+into protoporphyrin IX forming the first intermediate in the bacteriochlorophyll branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway (34Armstrong G.A. Cook D.N. Ma D. Alberti M. Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 40Gibson L.C.D. Willows R.D. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, coordinate repression of the crtA and crtI promoters could influence the flow of metabolic intermediates into both carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways. Disruption of crtJ caused increased aerobic expression of bch and crt genes, but a residual level of anaerobic activation was still observed, suggesting that these genes are subject to aerobic repression by CrtJ and anaerobic activation by unknown factors (inducers) (6Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of thepuc operon is repressed by CrtJ under aerobic growth conditions and induced under anaerobic growth conditions by the two-component regulatory proteins, RegB and RegA (4Mosley C.S. Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7566-7573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sganga M.W. Bauer C.E.

Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria: Regulation of Photosynthesis Gene Expression. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 1221-1234Google Scholar). Recently, Du et al. (41Du S. Bird T.H. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18509-18513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) isolated a mutant version of RegA, called RegA*, and demonstrated that RegA* binds to the pucpromoter, protecting two regions extending from −52 to −69 and −73 to −80. Thus, RegA binds to a region of the puc promoter that partially overlaps the downstream binding site of CrtJ (from −37 to −62). Consequently, the two proteins may compete in vivofor their respective binding sites. Furthermore, deletion and mutational analyses of the bchC promoter region indicate that this promoter is activated under anaerobic conditions by acis-acting site (AT-rich region) located just upstream of the ς-70-like sequence of the promoter (12Ma D. Cook D.N. O'Brien D.A. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2037-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region overlaps thebchC upstream palindrome of CrtJ (10Ponnampalam S.N. Bauer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18391-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that, like the puc and bchC promoters, other crt and bch genes are controlled by CrtJ competing with a transcriptional activator for overlapping binding sites. As indicated above, cooperative interactions between CrtJ bound to widely separated sites on the DNA presumably involves the formation of a DNA loop (Fig. 8). Protein-mediated looped complexes are important regulatory elements in many systems. Examples include the regulation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression, site-specific recombination, and DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 42Schleif R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 199-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Different factors are known to facilitate the formation and stability of DNA-protein looped complexes. This includes the presence of intrinsically bent DNA sequences or the binding of proteins that bend DNA. For instance, integration host factor (IHF) (43Stenzel T.T. MacAllister T. Bastai D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), HU (44Aki T. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and cAMP receptor protein (45Hudson M.J. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Vossen K.M. Stickle D.F. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) can stabilize protein-mediated looped complexes. There is no direct evidence that cooperative binding by CrtJ to distant sites occurs via a DNA loop. However, there is one observation that favors a DNA looping in CrtJ-mediated repression of gene expression. Indeed IHF, which is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that induces a severe bend (>160°) in the DNA helix (47Rice P.A. Yang S.-W. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), has recently been shown to bind between the two CrtJ palindromes on thepuc promoter (16Nickens D.G. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4270-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence scanning has revealed putative IHF-binding sites in the crtA-crtI intergenic sequence (data not shown). Thus CrtJ-induced looped DNA could be stabilized by IHFin vivo. The possible involvement of IHF in the mechanism of CrtJ-mediated repression is currently under investigation. We thank Terry H.

To determine the effect of this aberrant expression of core 2 O-glycans on immune responses, we previously generated transgenic mice overexpressing core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT) in T cells, and demonstrated that T cell primary immune responses mediated through interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells are impaired in the transgenic mice (Tsuboi, S., and Fukuda, M. (1997)EMBO J. 16, 6364–6373). In this study, we determined whether overexpression of core 2 oligosaccharides on T cells leads to impaired humoral immune responses by B cells using the same transgenic mice. When T cells were activated, both T and B cells from the transgenic and control mice expressed an equivalent amount of CD40L and CD40, which are, respectively, the receptor and counter-receptor for the interaction between T and B cells. However, activated T cells from the transgenic mice induced B cell proliferation less efficiently than those from control mice, regardless of whether B cells were isolated from control or the transgenic mice. This suggests that overexpression of core 2 O-glycans on T cell surface glycoproteins renders T cell-B cell interaction inefficient. Moreover, in the transgenic mice both immunoglobulin isotype switching and germinal center formation were also impaired. Taken together, these results indicate that aberrant expression of core 2 O-glycans on T cell surface glycoproteins results in impaired humoral immune responses due to an impaired interaction between T and B cells.

Abnormalities in those cell surface carbohydrates are often associated with malignant transformation and other pathological conditions, including immunodeficiency (1Fukuda M.

Among the various cell surface carbohydrates, the biological function of mucin-type O-glycans, which are attached to serine or threonine residues on cell surface glycoproteins, is not well understood. There are, however, several reports suggesting thatO-glycans are involved in the modulation of cell adhesion processes. For example P- and L-selectins bind with higher affinity to sialyl LeX and sulfated sialyl LeX expressed in O-glycans than those expressed in N-glycans, possibly due to multivalency of O-glycans (5Laskey L.A.

In O-glycans of blood cells, various ligand carbohydrate structures can be formed only in a branched O-linked hexasaccharide, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→3(NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr, called a core 2 O-glycan. Core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT)1 is essential to form core 2 O-glycans (8Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol.

In T cell development, the expression of core 2 O-glycans is restricted to cortical thymocytes, and their expression is barely detectable in medullary thymocytes (10Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of core 2 O-glycan synthesis is apparently critical for apoptotic processes in T cell development (11Perrilo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In peripheral T cells, resting T cells express a simple tetrasaccharide, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→3(NeuNAcα2→6)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr. When T cells are activated by mitogens, the expression of C2GnT is induced, and as a result, O-glycans are converted to the core 2O-glycans, NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→3(NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr (12Piller F.

In these diseases, core 2 O-glycans are highly expressed on resting T cells, while they are not expressed in normal conditions. To examine the influences of aberrant expression of core 2O-glycans on the immune system, we have previously generated transgenic mice whose T cells overexpress core 2 O-glycans. We demonstrated that T cells from these transgenic mice exhibit reduced primary T cell immune responses, as assessed by delayed-type hypersensitivity, proliferation upon stimulation, and cytokine production (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that reduced immune responses of T cells are due to impaired interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The next important question is whether overexpression of core 2 O-glycans affects humoral immune responses. In this study, we address this question by examining humoral immune responses in the transgenic mice compared with those of control mice. We demonstrate that overexpression of core 2 O-glycans impairs humoral immune responses to thymus-dependent antigen. We suggest that this reduced B cell immune response is due to inhibition of the interaction between T and B cells (T-B interaction). Transgenic mice (Lck-mC2GnT) were established in the previous study (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transgene, mouse C2GnT, was cloned into pBluescript under the control of p56lckpromoter (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M.

Stable lines of mice were generated by breeding founders with FVB/N mice (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two founder mice were generated (Lck-mC2GnT-1 and -2), and all experiments were carried out using cells isolated from 6–8-week-old litter mates, which were generation 4 and 5. Sex- and age-matched littermates were used as wild-type controls. The results obtained from each founder were not designated, as no detectable difference in the results was noted using their offspring. To measure C2GnT activity, T cells were purified from spleens with Mouse T Cell Enrichment Column (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (22Binz H. Wigzell H. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resultant preparations were >95% pure T cells, as determined by flow cytometric analysis for αβ T cell receptor. B cells were purified from spleens by flow cytometric sorting. The resultant preparations were >99% positive for B220 by flow cytometric analysis. Purified T or B cells were homogenized in 0.1 ml of an extraction solution (0.4% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), and the assay was performed essentially as described using Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→p-nitrophenol as a substrate (9Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Similarly, UDP-Gal:β-GlcNAcβ-1,4-galactosyltransferase and UDP-Gal:α-GalNAcβ-1,3-galactosyltransferase were assayed usingp-nitrophenylglycosides (23Lee N. Wang W.-C. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

In all of these assays, resultant products were adsorbed to a disposable C18 cartridge (Waters, MA) and eluted by 70% methanol in water as described (9Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). T cells were purified from a pool of four spleens (from two males and two females) using the procedure described above. Whole cell lysates of purified T cells were prepared and blotted as described previously (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with the anti-CD43 monoclonal antibodies as described (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and with anti-CD44 (IM7, culture supernatant, 1:40 dilution; Ref. 25Hyman R. Lesley J. Schulte R. Trotter J. Cell Immunol. 1986; 101: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), anti-CD45RB (23G2, 10 μg/ml), and anti-CD2 (RM2–5, 0.5 μg/ml). The antibodies except for anti-CD44 were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). CD45ABCcDNA containing the complete coding region (26Thomas M.L. Reynolds P.J. Chain A. Ben-Neriah Y. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5360-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNAI (pcDNAI-CD45ABC). CHO cells stably expressing leukosialin (CHO-leu) and CHO cells stably expressing leukosialin and C2GnT (CHO-leu-C2) (27Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with pcDNAI-CD45ABC using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after the transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting analysis. A monoclonal antibody reactive to all isoforms of the CD45 (30-F11, 10 μg/ml; Ref. 28van Ewijk W. van Soest P.L. van den Engh G.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 2594-2604PubMed Google Scholar) and a CD45-exonB specific antibody (23G2, 10 μg/ml), purchased from PharMingen, were used. CD45ABCcDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Matthew Thomas (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Monodispersed cells (1 × 106) from mouse tissues were stained with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies (1 μg/ml) as described previously (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PE-conjugated anti-CD43 activation-associated isoform (1B11), FITC-conjugated anti-B220 (RA3–6B2), FITC-conjugated anti-αβ T cell receptor (H57–597) or anti-CD40 (HM40–3), and PE-conjugated anti-CD40 ligand (MR1) were purchased from PharMingen. Anti-mouse CD32/16 (PharMingen) was included in all incubations to block antibody binding to Fc receptors. Analyses were done with a FACSort flow cytometer using the CellQuest program (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). CD4+ T cells were purified from spleens with Mouse T Cell CD4 Subset Column Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (22Binz H. Wigzell H. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resultant preparations were >95% pure CD4+ T cells, as determined by flow cytometric analysis for CD4. Purified CD4+ T cells were activated for 6 h in 24-well plates coated with anti-CD3 (142C-11, 20 μg/ml) and mouse ICAM-1-IgG fusion protein (10 μg/ml) as described (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In parallel, purified T cells were activated for 6 h with PMA and ionomycin as described (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Activated T cells were subsequently harvested, washed, stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD40 ligand, and then analyzed by flow cytometer. Spleen cell suspension was prepared from a pool of spleens from eight mice (four males and four females). CD4+ T cells were isolated from half of a spleen cell suspension as described above. B cells were isolated from the other half of the cell suspension by a combination of treatment with antibodies to Thy-1.1, CD4, and CD8 (PharMingen), followed by rabbit complement (ICN, Irvine, CA) and incubation on plastic dishes to deplete adherent cells (29Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Stockbine L. Clifford K.N. Macduff B.M. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Fanslow W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The resultant preparations were >95% pure B cells, as determined by flow cytometric analysis with B220. For B cell proliferation assays, purified B cells (2 × 105 cells/well, 200 μl) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) for 72 h in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. In some experiments, the medium also contained 10 ng/ml IL-4 (PharMingen), 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma), or 5 μg/ml anti-CD40 (HM40–3, PharMingen). In parallel, purified B cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were co-cultured with non-activated or T cells activated for 6 h (1 × 105 cell/well) in the same medium as described above. The T cells were fixed with 0.4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, then washed and used to stimulate B cells (30Kawabe S. Naka T. Yoshida K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Immunity. 1994; 1: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) for the last 6 h of a 72-h culture period and then harvested onto a glass fiber filter. [3H]Thymidine uptake was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Mice were intraperitoneally immunized with 100 μg of KLH (Sigma) in complete Freund's adjuvant. Mouse anti-KLH IgM, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA levels in the serum were determined by an isotype-specific ELISA. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml KLH for 24 h. Plates were then washed and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Diluted serum samples were then added to wells, and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Anti-KLH IgM antibody titer was determined with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (PharMingen). The other antibody titers were determined using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, or IgA (PharMingen). ELISAs were developed by using 1-Step ABTS substrate (Pierce) for peroxidase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (PharMingen) for alkaline phosphatase (31Xu J. Foy T.M. Laman J.D. Elliott E.A.

Med. 1996; 183: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mice were immunized with KLH as described above. Spleen flat sections (5 μm thick), 7 days after the immunization, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The sections were incubated with antibody or lectin in a humidified box (30Kawabe S. Naka T. Yoshida K. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Immunity. 1994; 1: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The sections were suspended in 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 3% fetal calf serum, and stained with biotinylated peanut agglutinin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature (33Gillespie W. Paulson J.C. Kelm S. Pang M. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3801-3804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel sections were suspended in PBS supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum and stained with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgM (R6–60.2, PharMingen). Biotinylated peanut agglutinin and anti-mouse IgM were stained with PE-conjugated streptavidin (PharMingen). The slides were evaluated and photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. As shown previously, we have generated transgenic mice that express the mouse C2GnT gene under the control of the proximal promoter of p56lck. This promoter allowed increased activity of C2GnT in lymphoid tissues where T cells are present (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the previous results were obtained on a mixture of T and B lymphocytes, and we could not exclude the possibility that B lymphocytes also contained increased C2GnT activity in the transgenic mice. To determine whether only T cells contain increased C2GnT activity, T and B cells were purified from spleens, and glycosyltransferases were assayed in cell lysates of purified T and B cells. As shown in Table I, T cells derived from the transgenic mice (Lck-mC2GnT) contained C2GnT activity approximately 50 times higher than did T cells derived from control mice. In contrast, the activities of β-1,3-galactosyltransferase, which forms core 1 in O-glycans, and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, which formsN-acetyllactosamines, were almost equal in control and the transgenic mice (Table I). Moreover, no difference in C2GnT activities was found in B cells between the transgenic and control mice (Table I). These results indicate that C2GnT is specifically increased in T cells of the transgenic mice without an accompanying change in the activities of other glycosyltransferases.Table IGlycosyltransferase activities in purified T cells and B cellsControlLck-mC2GnTUDP-GlcNAc:Galβ1→3GalNAcβ-1,6-GlcNAc transferase (C2GnT)T cell2.1 ± 0.3116.9 ± 9.2B cell1.2 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.09UDP-Gal:GalNAcβ-1,3-Gal transferaseT cell0.051 ± 0.0020.042 ± 0.002B cell0.019 ± 0.0030.018 ± 0.005UDP-Gal:GlcNAcβ-1,4-Gal transferaseT cell14.0 ± 0.614.9 ± 1.2B cell6.6 ± 0.36.4 ± 0.7Glycosyltransferase activities (nmol/h/mg) in the cell extracts of T and B cells isolated from spleens were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (mean ±S.E.).

Open table in a new tab Glycosyltransferase activities (nmol/h/mg) in the cell extracts of T and B cells isolated from spleens were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (mean ±S.E.). In each assay, two spleens from one male and one female were tested. The activities in the cell extracts from three independent assays are shown. In the above experiments, as well as those that follow, we found that results obtained from two independently generated transgenic lines (Lck-mC2GnT-1 and -2) were practically identical. Therefore, we conclude that clonal variations play little or no role in determining the phenotype of either line. CD43 is one of the most abundant T cell surface glycoproteins. There are two distinct glycoforms of CD43: the 115-kDa form seen on resting T cells, which carries simple tetrasaccharides and can be detected by S7 antibody, and a 130-kDa glycoform seen on activated T cells, which carries branched hexasaccharides and can be detected by the 1B11 antibody (34Ellies L.G. Tomlinson Jones A. Williams M.J. Ziltener H.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that CD43 expressing the hexasaccharide was increased in the whole cell populations of the transgenic mice (20Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the population of T cells (αβ T cell receptor positive cells) displaying the CD43-hexasaccharide, which carries core 2 O-glycans, increased in both spleens and lymph nodes derived from the transgenic mice (Fig. 1). In contrast, the number of B cells, which are positive for B220 staining, was similar in control (49–52%) and the transgenic (47–50%) mice (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the results of Western blotting of T cell extracts. On the T cells from control mice, most of CD43 was the 115-kDa tetrasaccharide form, while on T cells from Lck-mC2GnT transgenic mice, most CD43 was the 130-kDa hexasaccharide form carrying core 2 O-glycans (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained for other O-glycosylated proteins such as CD44 and CD45RB. CD44 was detected as an 85-kDa protein on T cells from control mice, whereas T cells from the transgenic mice displayed CD44 as an 88-kDa band (Fig. 2 A). CD45RB is an isoform of CD45. Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody, 23G2, identified CD45RB as a 200-kDa band on T cells from control mice, whereas on T cells from the transgenic mice, this 200-kDa band was faint (Fig. 2 A). The antibody 23G2 reacts with a peptide portion that is heavily glycosylated with O-glycans (35Barclay A.N. Jackson D.I. Willis A.C. Williams A.F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Chui D. Ong C.J. Johnson P. Teh H.-S. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is likely that 23G2 cannot react efficiently with the same polypeptide when it is glycosylated with core 2 O-glycan containing oligosaccharides. In fact, the reactivity of 23G2 was weaker against CD45 expressed on CHO-leu·C2 cells, which express core 2O-glycans (27Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4473-4479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), than it was against the parent CHO cells, which do not express core 2 O-glycans (lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 2 B). In contrast, almost equal reactivity was observed when another antibody, 30F-11, which reacts with all isoforms of CD45 (28van Ewijk W. van Soest P.L. van den Engh G.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 2594-2604PubMed Google Scholar), was used (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, mouse C2GnT overexpression did not affect CD2, because CD2 does not contain O-glycans (Fig. 2 A). These results strongly suggest that overexpression of mouse C2GnT in Lck-mC2GnT transgenic mice causes these T cell surface glycoproteins to carry substantially more core 2 O-glycans than do glycoproteins derived from control mice. These observations are consistent with the results obtained by Western blotting of C2GnT-overexpressing cell lines (37Barran P. Fellinger W. Warren C.E. Dennis J.W. Ziltener H.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 121-136Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We then asked whether overexpression of core 2 O-glycans affects T-B interaction. To address this question, we first examined whether overexpression of core 2 O-glycans affects expression levels of CD40 ligand (CD40L), since T-B interaction is mainly mediated by CD40L-CD40 interaction (26Thomas M.L. Reynolds P.J. Chain A. Ben-Neriah Y. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5360-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Bierhuizen M.F.A. Maemura K. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 2497-2510PubMed Google Scholar). When T cells were incubated without activators, no CD40L expression was observed in either transgenic or control mice (Fig. 3 A, top panel). When T cells were activated for 6 h with anti-CD3 and mouse ICAM-1-IgG fusion protein, T cells from the transgenic mice expressed CD40L on the cell surface at a level equivalent to that of control mice (Fig. 3 A, middle panel, 13–17% and 13–15%, respectively). T cells activated with PMA and ionomycin from either the transgenic or control mice expressed similar amounts of CD40L as well (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, 64–69% and 63–69%, respectively). These results show that similar amounts of CD40L were induced on in vitro activated CD4+ T cells derived from the transgenic mice and control mice (Fig. 3 A). In addition, B cells purified from both the transgenic and control mice expressed comparable amounts of CD40 (Fig. 3 B). To further examine whether overexpression of core 2 O-glycans affects T-B interaction, we assayed T cell-dependent B cell proliferation in vitro. This assay is critical because CD40-CD40L interaction is too weak to be detected by adhesion (41Foy T.M. Aruffo A. Bajorath J. Buhlmann J.E. Noelle R.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 591-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). T cells were activated for 6 h with anti-mouse CD3 and a mouse ICAM-1-IgG fusion protein shown in Fig. 3 A. B cells from the transgenic mice (closed symbols) were cocultured with activated T cells from control mice (shown as C) or the transgenic mice (shown as Lck). B cell proliferation was induced more by activated T cells from wild-type mice than by those from the transgenic mice (shown as Lck). The proliferative responses of B cells from the transgenic mice were enhanced by addition of IL-4. However, T cells derived from the transgenic mice yielded a reduced proliferative response even in the presence of IL-4 (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, B cells derived from control mice were cocultured with T cells from the transgenic and control mice (open symbols in Fig. 4 A). T cells derived from the transgenic mice produced a reduced proliferative response of control B cells both in the absence and presence of IL-4 (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that T cells derived from the transgenic mice induced an impaired T-B interaction, regardless of whether the B cells were derived from w"

These rabbits presented high levels of bGH and insulin-like growth factor I in serum. In spite of chronic exposure to bGH, transgenic rabbits had similar body weight to controls. However, enlargement of the head and limbs and reduction of visceral fat were observed in these animals. They also showed marked hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, indicating that they developed insulin resistance. Furthermore, serious histopathological alterations, including marked fibrosis, were observed in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. These anatomical, metabolic, and histological alterations closely resemble those found in patients with acromegaly. Thus, transgenic rabbits overexpressing GH may be a good model of the human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1481454511,"In pancreatic beta-cells, stimulatory glucose concentrations increase cytosolic diadenosine polyphosphates ([ApnA]i) to concentrations sufficient to block ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. High-performance liquid chromatography and patch clamp techniques were used to study the metabolic pathways by which pancreatic beta-cells synthesize ApnA and the mechanism through which ApnA inhibit KATP channels. ApnA show a glucose- and time-dependent cytosolic concentration increase parallel, though 30- to 50-fold higher, to changes observed in adenine nucleotides. Other fuel secretagogues, leucine and 2-ketoisocaproate, raise [ApnA]i as efficiently as 22 mM glucose. Blockade of glycolysis or Krebs cycle decreases glucose-induced [ApnA]i. No significant increase in cytosolic ApnA concentrations is induced by nonnutrient secretagogues or nonmetabolizable nutrient secretagogues. Inorganic pyrophosphatase inhibition with sodium fluoride blocks 22 mM glucose-induced [ApnA]i increase. ApnA inhibition of KATP channel resembles that of ATP in efficacy, but shows clear functional differences. Unlike ATP, Ap4A does not restore channel activity after rundown. Furthermore, these compounds do not compete with each other for the same site. These features suggest a prominent role for Ap4A in beta-cell function, comparable to ATP. We conclude that nutrient metabolism through pyrophosphatase activation is necessary to induce ApnA synthesis, which in turn constitutes a new, ATP-independent, metabolic regulator of KATP channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2085550720,"Protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells. In a recent study we found that overexpression of PKCδ reduced the expression of the astrocytic marker glutamine synthetase (GS). In this study we explored the mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of PKCδ on the expression of glutamine synthetase. Using PKC chimeras we first examined the role of the catalytic and regulatory domains of PKCδ on the expression of glutamine synthetase. We found that cells stably transfected with chimeras between the regulatory domain of PKCδ and the catalytic domains of PKCα or ε inhibited the expression of GS, similar to the inhibition exerted by overexpression of PKCδ itself. In contrast, no significant effects were observed in cells transfected with the reciprocal PKC chimeras between the regulatory domains of PKCα or ε and the catalytic domain of PKCδ. PKCδ has been shown to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to various activators. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and platelet-derived growth factor occurred only in chimeras which contained the PKCδ regulatory domain. Cells transfected with a PKCδ mutant (PKCδ5), in which the five putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites were mutated to phenylalanine, showed markedly diminished tyrosine phosphorylation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and platelet-derived growth factor and normal levels of GS. Our results indicate that the regulatory domain of PKCδ mediates the inhibitory effect of this isoform on the expression of GS.

Protein kinase C (PKC)1is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine-threonine kinases that play important roles in the signal transduction and in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (1Nishizuka Y.

PKC is also the receptor for the potent tumor-promoting phorbol esters, which can substitute for DAG in PKC activation (5Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The “classical” cPKCs α, β1, β2, and γ are Ca2+-dependent and PMA-responsive. The “novel” nPKCs δ, ε, η, and θ are Ca2+-independent but PMA-responsive, whereas the atypical PKC isoforms ζ and λ do not depend on Ca2+ or respond to PMA. PKCδ, a member of the novel PKCs, has been associated with proliferation and differentiation of various cell types (6Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G.

The phosphorylation site(s) and the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in its activity and in its functional role are just beginning to be defined.

In the classical PKC isoforms the regulatory domain contains a Ca2+-binding domain, and in both the classical and novel PKC isoforms the regulatory domain contains a pseudosubstrate region near the N terminus that is thought to inhibit the activity of the catalytic domain (13Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar, 14Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 15Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 18: 207-208Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain also contains a pair of highly conserved zinc fingers that bind phorbol esters (16Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the approaches for dissecting the role of the regulatory and catalytic domains of different PKC isoforms is the use of PKC chimeras between the regulatory and catalytic domains of the different isoforms. Glutamine synthetase (GS) is an important enzyme in the conversion of the excitatory amino acid glutamate to glutamine (17Schousboe A. Westergaard N. Sonnewald U. Peterson S.B. Huang R. Peng L. Hertz I. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). GS has been used as an astrocytic marker, and its regulation has been studied especially with regard to cAMP (18Jackson M.J. Zielke H.R. Max S.R. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and glucocorticoids (19Gorovits R. Yakir A. Fox L.E. Vardimon L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested an important role for GS as a mediator of interactions between neurons and glial cells under pathological conditions (20Gorovits R. Avidan N. Avisar N. Shaked I. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the factors or mechanisms involved in the regulation of this enzyme has significant implications in understanding pathological processes in the central nervous system. Recently, we reported that overexpression of PKCδ in the C6 glial cell line reduced the expression of the astrocytic marker GS, whereas overexpression of PKCα and PKCε did not significantly affect the expression of this protein (21Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have now characterized the inhibitory effect of PKCδ on GS expression using chimeras between the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCδ, α, and ε. We found that the regulatory domain of PKCδ mediates its inhibitory effect on GS expression. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulatory domain of PKCδ is implicated in this inhibition. Monoclonal anti-glutamine synthetase antibody, monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody, and anti-PKCα, β, γ, δ, η, θ, ζ, and μ were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Protein A/G-Sepharose was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An affinity purified polyclonal anti-PKCε antibody against a polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 726–737 of PKCε was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sodium vanadate were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit antibody against GFAP was purchased from DAKO Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). The PKC chimeras were generated by exchanging the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα, δ, and ε as described by Acs et al. (22Acs P. Bogi C. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PKCα/δ refers to the chimera with the PKCα regulatory domain and the PKCδ catalytic domain, and PKCδ/α refers to the reciprocal chimera. The PKC cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian ε-epitope tagging mammalian expression vector MTH described in detail by Olah et al. (23Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The vector was attached to the end of the C-terminal 12-amino acid tag, originally derived from the C-terminal sequence of PKCε. The ε-tag or the overexpression did not affect the localization, translocation, or phorbol ester responsiveness of the wild type constructs relative to the respective endogenous isoforms (22Acs P.

Mouse PKCδ was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This plasmid served as our “master” vector for the site-directed mutagenesis, using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Conversion of tyrosine residues at sites 52, 155, and 565 into phenylalanine was performed as described (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The additional mutations of tyrosine residues at positions 64 and 187 to phenylalanine were introduced into the triple tyrosine-phenylalanine mutant of PKCδ. The following oligonucleotides served as primers for selection and mutagenesis. The selection primer CGCCTGCAGGTCGACCATATGGGAGAG was used to change back the formerly introduced ClaI restriction site (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in the pGEM-T vector in position 75 into the underlined SalI restriction site to facilitate selection. The primer ACGCCCACATCTTCGAAGGCCGTGTTATC was used to mutate the tyrosine residue at site 64 into phenylalanine (bold letters) and to create a BstBI restriction site (underlined) to facilitate the detection of mutant plasmids. The primer CTCAACAAGCAAGGCTTTAAATGCAGGCAATGC was used to mutate the tyrosine residue at site 187 into phenylalanine (bold letters) and to create a DraI restriction site (underlined) to facilitate the detection of the mutant plasmids. The mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing (Paragon Biotech Inc., Baltimore, MD). PKCδ and PKCδ5 were subcloned into a metallothionein promoter-driven eukaryotic expression vector (MTH). The vector sequence encodes a C-terminal PKC-ε derived 12-amino acid tag (εMTH) that is added to the expressed proteins (23Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). C6 cells of early passage (C6–30 cells) were used in this study. Conditions for growth and transfection were as described previously (21Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Experiments were routinely carried out on pools of transfected cells, but all the results were confirmed on two different individual clones for each of the different isoforms and chimeras. Preparation of lysates from cells and the analysis of GS and of PKC by Western blotting were performed as described previously (21Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]PDBu binding was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay (27Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates (4–60 μg of protein/assay) were incubated with 20 nm [3H]PDBu in the presence of phosphatidylserine. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 30 μm nonradioactive PDBu, was subtracted to give specific binding. Data represent triplicate determinations in each experiment. PKC activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into substrate in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 μm PMA as described previously (27Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of PKCδ was performed as described previously (22Acs P. Bogi C. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, C6 cells overexpressing PKCδ or PKCδ5 were serum-starved overnight and treated for 30 min with PMA (10 nm) or with PDGF (100 ng/ml). The samples were preabsorbed with 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (50%) for 10 min, and immunoprecipitation was performed using 4 μg/ml anti-PKCε antibody and 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose at 4 °C. Following washes, the pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Before SDS-PAGE, samples were centrifuged again as described above, and all of each supernatant was subjected to Western blotting. Membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-PKCδ antibody. Recently, we have reported that overexpression of PKCδ reduced the level of GS expression in C6 cells, whereas it did not affect the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP (21Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of PKCδ in this effect we utilized the two PKC activators PMA and bryostatin 1 because these two activators have been reported to differentially affect the activation and down-regulation of PKCδ in other cell types (26Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Szallasi Z. Du L. Levine R. Lewin N.E. Nguyen P.N. Williams M.D. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2105-2111PubMed Google Scholar). For these studies we used the C6–30 cells because they express low levels of GS and GFAP and can be differentiated to either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes (30Brodie C. Vernadakis A. Glia. 1991; 4: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with PMA (100 nm) for 24 h did not induce significant changes in the expression of GS, as described previously. In contrast, bryostatin 1 (100 nm) induced a marked decrease in the expression of GS (Fig. 1 A), whereas it did not affect the expression of GFAP (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, under these conditions 100 nm PMA induced down-regulation of all the major classical and novel PKC isoforms expressed in C6–30, whereas bryostatin 1 induced down-regulation of all these PKC isoforms except PKCδ. PKCζ and μ were not affected by either of the compounds. Similar down-regulation by PMA and bryostatin 1 was observed for PKCγ, η, and θ, which are weakly expressed in these cells (data not shown). As has been previously described for keratinocytes (31Szallasi Z. Denning M. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar), co-treatment of the C6 cells with PMA and bryostatin 1 protected PKCδ from down-regulation by PMA. Likewise, under these conditions GS expression was similar to that of bryostatin-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). The results suggest an inverse relation between the expression of PKCδ and GS. To further explore this point, we examined the effect of bryostatin on GS expression in cells already depleted of PKCδ. Cells were treated for 24 h with 100 nm PMA followed by treatment with bryostatin 1 for 48 h. In these cells, PKCδ remained down-regulated, and, correspondingly, bryostatin 1 did not reduce the expression of GS (Fig. 1 C). To further characterize the role of PKCδ in the inhibition of GS expression, we examined the relative contributions of the regulatory and catalytic domains of this isoform. For these studies, we used chimeras between the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKCα, δ and ε, combined at the highly conserved hinge region. The chimeras were engineered in a way that allowed similar construction of the wild type PKC isoforms, thus providing us with exact positive controls (22Acs P. Bogi C. Lorenzo P.S. Marquez A.M. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of the ε-tag on the different constructs allowed better detection on Western blots and provided a good epitope for immunoprecipitation. Cells were transfected with the different chimeras, PKC α/δ, δ/α, α/ε, ε/α, δ/ε, and ε/δ and with the PKC wild type isoforms PKCα/α, δ/δ, and ε/ε. To examine the level of protein expression, we analyzed by Western blotting three pooled cultures and five different overexpressing clones for each of the chimeras as well as for the vector controls. Fig. 2 illustrates a representative Western blot of C6 cells overexpressing the different PKC chimeras and the vector control. Using the previously described tagging system (23Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we were able to detect specifically the transfected PKC isoforms with the antibody against PKCε. The band corresponding to the endogenous PKCε can also be seen. To establish that the overexpressed PKC chimeras were functionally active we measured specific [3H]PDBu binding and kinase activity on cell lysates. All PKC chimeras exhibited increased [3H]PDBu binding and kinase activity as compared with the control cells transfected with the empty vector (Table I). Moreover, binding and kinase activity were further enhanced in cells treated for 24 h with 20 μm ZnCl2, an inducer of the metallothionein expression vector (data not shown).Table I[3H]PDBu binding and kinase activity of cells overexpressing different PKC chimerasPKC chimeras[3H]PDBu boundKinase activitypmol/mg protein% of controlM1.98 ± 0.09100PKCα/α6.21 ± 0.03251 ± 28PKCδ/δ5.67 ± 0.20231 ± 29PKCε/ε8.5 ± 0.12377 ± 32PKCα/δ7.78 ± 0.09396 ± 48PKCδ/α8.15 ± 1.02364 ± 41PKCε/δ6.23 ± 0.12238 ± 37PKCδ/ε6.23 ± 0.13254 ± 29Specific [3H]PDBu binding was determined using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean values ± S.E. of triplicate determinations of a single experiment.

Kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into substrates in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 μm PMA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values for the control and PKCδ/δ chimeras are expressed as pmol/min/μg protein, and the values for the other chimeras and for the control empty vector were further normalized based on their level of expression relative to the PKCδ/δ chimera. Open table in a new tab Specific [3H]PDBu binding was determined using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean values ± S.E. of triplicate determinations of a single experiment. Similar results were obtained in two experiments. Kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into substrates in the presence of 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 1 μm PMA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values for the control and PKCδ/δ chimeras are expressed as pmol/min/μg protein, and the values for the other chimeras and for the control empty vector were further normalized based on their level of expression relative to the PKCδ/δ chimera. The effect of the PKC chimeras on the level of GS was examined. In cells overexpressing PKCδ/δ, the level of GS was low as compared with control cells and similar to that reported previously for cells overexpressing wild type PKCδ. In contrast, the level of GS was unchanged in cells overexpressing PKCα/α and ε/ε (Fig. 3 A) or in cells overexpressing PKCα/ε and ε/α (data not shown). Similar to cells expressing PKCδ/δ, cells overexpressing the chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCδ, namely δ/α and δ/ε, also showed a reduced level of GS (Fig. 3 A). Cells expressing PKC δ/α showed a greater reduction in the level of GS than cells expressing PKCδ/ε. The effect of the regulatory domain of PKCδ was specific for GS because no differences were observed in the expression of the other astrocytic marker, GFAP (data not shown). In contrast to the chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCδ, chimeras containing just the catalytic domain of PKCδ did not have a significant effect on GS expression. Thus, cells expressing PKCα/δ and ε/δ expressed GS levels similar to those of cells expressing PKCα/α or PKCε/ε (Fig. 3 A). Treatment of the cells with 10 nm PMA, which induces activation of PKC without the marked down-regulation that occurs at 100 nm PMA, enhanced the response observed in untreated cells (Fig. 3 A). Thus, PMA further reduced the expression of GS in cells overexpressing PKC δ/δ or the chimeras δ/α and δ/ε, which contain the δ regulatory domain. Similar to what was observed in the vector control cells, transfectants expressing PKC α/α or ε/ε or chimeras that contain the δ catalytic domain showed a smaller decrease in GS expression presumably mediated by the endogenous PKCδ. Similar results were obtained in transfectants expressing PKC α/ε and ε/α (data not shown). We also examined the expression of GS in cells treated for 24 h with 20 μm ZnCl2. Under these conditions, cells overexpressing PKCδ/δ or chimeras containing the regulatory domain of PKCδ showed a larger decrease in GS expression as compared with PMA-treated cells, whereas cells expressing chimeras that contain the δ catalytic domain had levels of GS similar to those of the control vector cells (Fig. 3 B). The translocation and activation of PKCδ in response to PMA and physiological stimuli such as epidermal growth factor and PDGF have been shown to be associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of this isoform (10Li W.

Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the sites of phosphorylation and the role of this process in the activity and function of PKCδ are still unclear. We first examined which domain is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Cells overexpressing PKCδ/δ or the various chimeras containing either the regulatory or the catalytic domains of PKCδ were stimulated with PMA and PDGF. Following immunoprecipitation of PKCδ and Western blotting, membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or with anti-PKCδ antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 4, PKCδ/δ, PKCδ/α, and PKCδ/ε underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PMA. In contrast, no tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in cells overexpressing PKCα/δ or PKCε/δ, thus suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation in response to these stimuli occurred on the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Studies in vitro (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in vivo(12Li W. Li W. Chen X.H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) suggested five putative phosphorylation sites in PKCδ, one in the catalytic domain (Tyr565) and four in the regulatory domain (Tyr52, Tyr64, Tyr155, and Tyr187). Because four of the putative phosphorylation sites in PKCδ are located in the regulatory domain, we examined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in its inhibitory effect on GS expression. For these experiments we utilized a PKCδ mutant in which the five putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites were mutated to phenylalanine (δ5 mutant). Cells were transfected with PKCδ or PKCδ5, and the level of expression was determined using Western blot analysis. Using the previously described tagging system (23Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we were able to detect specifically the transfected PKC isoforms with the antibody against PKCε. Fig. 5 A illustrates a representative Western blot of C6 cells overexpressing PKCδ, PKCδ5, and the vector control. The levels of the overexpressed PKCδ and PKCδ5 in the transfected cells were about 7–9-fold higher than the endogenous PKCδ as determined using an anti-PKCδ specific antibody (data not shown). Cells overexpressing PKCδ or PKCδ5 showed an increased level of [3H]PDBu binding from 1.45 ± 0.04 pmol/mg protein in the vector control cells to 7.29 ± 0.21 pmol/mg protein in cells transfected with PKCδ and 8.82 ± 0.23 pmol/mg protein in cells transfected with PKCδ5. Although they had similar levels of [3H]PDBu binding, cells overexpressing PKCδ had an increased kinase activity of 465 ± 49% over the vector control cells, whereas cells overexpressing PKCδ5 showed an increase of only 87 ± 11% over control cells. The transfected PKCδ and δ5 displayed similar localization in untreated cells and translocated similarly to the membrane in response to PMA (data not shown). We first examined the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and PKCδ5 in response to PMA and PDGF. Cells were treated with either compound for 30 min, PKCδ was immunoprecipitated using the ε-tag specific antibody, and membranes were stained with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, PMA and PDGF induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ within 5–30 min. In contrast, these compounds induced negligible tyrosine phosphorylation of the PKCδ5 mutant. We then examined the level of GS in cells that were overexpressing PKCδ or PKCδ5 and were either untreated or treated with PMA (10 nm) or PDGF (100 ng/ml). PMA (10 nm) activates PKC without the marked down-regulation that occurs at a concentration of 100 nm. We found that cells overexpressing the PKCδ5 mutant displayed a slightly higher level of GS compared with the control vector cells and markedly higher levels compared with cells overexpressing PKCδ wild type. Treatment of cells overexpressing PKCδ with PMA (10 nm) or PDGF (100 ng/ml) induced a marked decrease in GS expression. In contrast, similar treatments of cells expressing the δ5 mutant did not exert a significant effect on GS expression (Fig. 5 C). Protein kinase C comprises a family of eleven closely related isoforms that are involved in the differentiation and proliferation of various cell types (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we have shown differential roles of specific PKC isoforms in the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells (21Brodie C. Kuperstein I. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specifically, PKCα and PKCδ inhibited astrocytic differentiation by reducing the expression of the astrocytic markers GFAP and GS, respectively. In the present study we have explored the mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of PKCδ on GS expression. We found that the regulatory domain of PKCδ is responsible for the inhibitory effect of this isoform on the expression of GS. Chimeras have been used to dissect the contribution of individual PKC domains to the specific functions of different PKC isoforms, and both the catalytic and the regulatory domains of PKC have been implicated in determining isoform-specific functions. For example, the catalytic domain of PKCβ was found to confer isoform-specific function in the differentiation of erythroleukemia cells (32Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the catalytic domain of PKCδ in reciprocal δ- and ε-chimeras mediated PMA-induced macrophage differentiation of mouse promyelocytes (33Wang Q.J. Acs P. Goodnight J. Giese T. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the regulatory domain of PKCε enhanced cell growth and induced colonies in soft agar in NIH 3T3 cells, and the catalytic domain played a role in determining the saturation density of cell growth (34Acs P. Wang Q.J. Bogi K. Marquez A.M. Lorenzo P.S. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28793-28799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that either the regulatory or the catalytic domain can confer isoform-specific effects and that this depends on the cell type, the specific PKC isoform and the specific function studied. PKCδ has been shown to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to various stimuli. In NIH 3T3 cells, PKCδ is tyrosine phosphorylated upon PMA and PDGF stimulation (10Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and in ras-transformed keratinocytes (37Smith H. Chang E.Y. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9112-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It appears that the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and the effect of this phosphorylation on the activity of PKCδ or on its function depend somewhat on the specific system. PKCδ contains 19 tyrosines located in both the regulatory and catalytic domains, and different tyrosines have been implicated as possible phosphorylation sites. Thus, Tyr187 has been shown to be phosphorylated in 32D and NIH 3T3 cells in response to PMA or PDGF stimulation (12Li W. Li W. Chen X.H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, a mutation in this tyrosine failed to alter either the activity of PKCδ or the ability of PKCδ to induce monocytic differentiation (12Li W. Li W. Chen X.H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In another study, Tyr52 was suggested to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ upon stimulation of the IgE receptor in RBL-2H3 cells but not upon stimulation with PMA (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found, similar to what has been recently described by Acs et al. in fibroblasts (34Acs P. Wang Q.J. Bogi K. Marquez A.M. Lorenzo P.S. Biro T. Szallasi Z. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28793-28799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was confined to the regulatory domain of this isoform, suggesting that the tyrosines phosphorylated in response to PMA and PDGF are located on this domain. The role of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in its inhibitory effect on GS expression was examined using a PKCδ mutant in which five putative sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were mutated to phenylalanine (δ5 mutant). This mutant was constructed based onin vitro assessment of the activity as tyrosine kinase substrates of the oligopeptides corresponding to the sequences around each of the 19 tyrosines in PKCδ (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well as on in vivo studies (12Li W. Li W. Chen X.H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the δ5 mutant had a markedly diminished tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PMA and PDGF, indicating that at least some of these tyrosines are functional phosphorylation sites in this system. In addition, the cells overexpressing the PKCδ5 mutant showed normal levels of GS as compared with cells overexpressing PKCδ. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ plays a role in the inhibitory effect exerted by this isoform on GS expression. We found that although treatment of cells overexpressing PKCδ5 with PMA induced a similar pattern of translocation to that of PKCδ, the kinase activity of these cells was significantly lower, at least as evaluated using myelin basic protein as a substrate. It is currently not clear what is the effect of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ on the activity of the enzyme toward its different substrates in this system. Different effects have been reported in different systems, suggesting changes in substrate specificity rather than simply in level of absolute activity (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y.

The astrocytic glutamine synthetase is an important enzyme in the removal of the toxic substances NH3 and glutamate and in the conversion of these substances into glutamine (39Battaglioti G. Martin D.L. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Changes in GS expression have been associated with human pathology (40Belin M.F. Didier-Bazes M. Akaoka H. Hardin-Pouzet H. Bernard A. Giraudon P. Glia. 1997; 21: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and GS has been reported to protect against neuronal degeneration following trauma or ischemia (20Gorovits R. Avidan N. Avisar N. Shaked I. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GS expression has been reported to be regulated by cAMP, glucocorticoids, and insulin (18Jackson M.J. Zielke H.R. Max S.R. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Gorovits R. Yakir A. Fox L.E. Vardimon L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Tholey G. Sena A.H. Ledig M. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1490-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GS mRNA is regulated by the glucocorticoid response element, NF-κB, and by contact with neuronal cultures (40Belin M.F. Didier-Bazes M. Akaoka H. Hardin-Pouzet H. Bernard A. Giraudon P. Glia. 1997; 21: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 42Berko-Flint Y. Levkovitz G. Vardimon L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Mearow K.M. Mill J.F. Freeze F. Glia. 1990; 3: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because GS has also been used as an astrocytic marker, understanding of its regulation provides important information on astrocytic differentiation as well as on pathological conditions in the central nervous system. Our results imply a negative role for PKCδ in GS expression, with a modulatory effect via tyrosine phosphorylation. A possible mechanism by which PKCδ reduces the expression of GS may be through the induction of c-Jun, which has been implicated in negative regulation of GS transcription (42Berko-Flint Y. Levkovitz G. Vardimon L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the regulatory but not the catalytic domain of PKCδ determines the inhibitory effect of this isoform on the expression of GS. Our findings further emphasize a potentially important role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in this system. It is currently not clear which tyrosine kinases are involved in this process; however, tyrosine kinases of the Src family have been implicated in both the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and the function of glial cells (28Bhat N.R. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Studies are currently underway to identify the specific tyrosine(s) involved in the phosphorylation of PKCδ in this system and the tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate it at these sites."

Nocardicin A (see 1 in Fig. 1) is the most biologically active of a series of monocyclic β-lactam antibiotics isolated from the fermentation broth of the actinomycete Nocardia uniformis subsp. tsuyamanesis (ATCC 21806) (1Aoki H.

Whole-cell incorporation experiments have shown 1 to be derived from the l-isomers of methionine, serine, and p-hydroxyphenylglycine (PHPG) (8), a degradation product of l-tyrosine. These are the most direct primary precursors of the homoseryl, β-lactam, and aryl portions of the antibiotic, respectively (7Townsend, C. A., and Salituro, G. M. (1984) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1631–1632Google Scholar, 8Townsend C.A. Brown A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 913-918Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Townsend C.A. Brown A.M. J. Am. Chem.

Ohsawa S. Aoki H. Imanaka H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 2007-2012Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In an important result, it was demonstrated that the simplest member of the nocardicin family, nocardicin G (7), is a direct biosynthetic precursor to nocardicin A (12Townsend C.A. Wilson B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 3320-3321Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With nocardicin G (7) positioned as the central intermediate in the pathway leading to nocardicin A (1), the skeleton of the antibiotic can be completed, in unspecified order, by amine oxidation and 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl side chain attachment (Fig. 2). The stereochemical course of side chain attachment was shown to be inversion through the incorporation of methionine stereospecifically deuterated at C-4 (13Townsend, C. A., Reeve, A. M., and Salituro, G. M. (1988) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1579–1581Google Scholar). This configurational outcome parallels the stereochemistry of addition of the 3-aminopropyl moiety derived from decarboxylatedS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 operative in the biosynthesis of the polyamines (14Golding B.T. Nassereddin I.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5817-5915Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Golding, B. T., and Nassereddin, I. K. (1985) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.

Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 116-122Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for AdoMet in nocardicin A biosynthesis in vivo. This postulate was borne out in preliminary cell-free studies in which an efficient, time-dependent conversion from nocardicin E (5) to nocardicin A in the presence of AdoMet was demonstrated (19Wilson B.A. Bantia S. Salituro G.M. Reeve A.M. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8238-8239Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Assuming the epimerization of the amino acid terminus (C-9′) of nocardicin A is a late step in the biosynthesis, the product of this transferase enzyme was expected to be isonocardicin A (L at C-9′). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that an epimerase capable of equilibrating the stereochemistry at C-9′ of nocardicin A was also present in the cell-free extract (19Wilson B.A. Bantia S. Salituro G.M. Reeve A.M. Townsend C.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 8238-8239Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The bioconversion of nocardicin E (5) to isonocardicin A in cell-free extracts lends support for pathway A (Fig. 2) to nocardicin A (1) in which the amine of nocardicin G (7) is oxidized to the oxime to form nocardicin E (5) and, in the penultimate step, the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl side chain is attached to the phenolic hydroxy group. The final step, in analogy to penicillin biosynthesis (20Roach P.L. Clifton I.J. Hensgens C.M.H. Shibata N. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1997; 387: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and demonstrated experimentally (see below), is then the epimerization of the amino acid terminus to thed-configuration. Although rare, the transfer of the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group from AdoMet to a nucleophilic acceptor is not unprecedented. It has been demonstrated in the biosynthesis of the X-base from Escherichia coli tRNAPhe (21Nishimura S. Taya Y. Kuchino Y. Ohashi Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 702-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the Y-base from yeast tRNAPhe (22Münch H.-J. Thiebe R.

(Bethesda). 1990; 93: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). AdoMet has also been shown (26Chen J.-Y.C. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11692-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be the donor of the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl unit in diphthamide, the post-translationally modified histidine of elongation factor 2. The only one of the enzymes responsible for this group transfer that has been purified (27Higuchi K. Kanazawa K. Nishizawa N.-K. Chino M. Mori S. Abadía J. Iron Nutrition in Soils and Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 29-35Crossref Google Scholar) is nicotianamine synthase, but this enzyme catalyzes a transformation distinct from the enzyme in the present work and has not been characterized kinetically or mechanistically. A 420-fold partial purification has been reported for discadenine synthase, but the final preparation contained many contaminating proteins (28Ihara M. Tanaka Y. Yanagisawa K. Taya Y. Nishimura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 135-140Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this work, the first purification to apparent homogeneity, kinetic characterization, and cloning of a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyltransferase from a bacterial source is reported. In the presence of AdoMet this enzyme catalyzes the transformation of the substrates nocardicin E, F, and G to the products isonocardicin A, B, and C, respectively. By using reverse genetic techniques, the gene encoding the transferase was cloned from N. uniformis DNA. Translation revealed a 32,389-Da protein containing three modestly conserved motifs characteristic of S-adenosylmethionine-binding sites (29Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem.

HPLC separations were carried out on a Waters 600 HPLC and 490 Programmable Multi-wavelength Detector equiped with a Vydac C4reversed phase column (250 × 10 mm; Heperia, CA). Seed medium (4Hosoda J. Konomi T. Tani N. Aoki H. Imanaka H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 2013-2020Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), 30 ml, was added to 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks that were outfitted with a cotton stopper and covered with aluminum foil. Fermentation medium (4Hosoda J. Konomi T. Tani N. Aoki H. Imanaka H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 2013-2020Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was prepared with the addition of 2 ml/liter of trace minerals (35Adye J. Mateles R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 86: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and aliquoted in 100-ml portions into 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Media were autoclaved at 20 atm/125 °C for 30 min. Seed flasks were inoculated from a spore suspension, introducing 100 μl into each of five flasks with a sterile pipette tip. The spore suspension was prepared from a natural variant of wild type N. uniformis that had been selected for high nocardicin A production. The seed flasks were maintained at 28 °C and 300 rpm in an incubator shaker. After 48 h, 5 ml of the cell suspension was used to initiate each fermentation flask. Growth continued for 48 h under the same conditions as for the seed flasks. N. uniformis subsp.tsuyamanesis (ATCC 21806), 1 liter of total fermentation volume, was harvested by centrifugation (9,200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cell paste was washed with sterile 0.9% NaCl, centrifuged as above, and suspended in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol (buffer P) in a 250-ml steel beaker (2 ml of buffer per g wet weight of cells). Cells were ruptured at 0 °C by ultrasonication (Bransonic, model W-225R) at 50% duty cycle, power level 7, for 5 min and centrifuged (16, 300 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was used directly as the cell-free extract. Nucleic acids were precipitated by slowly adding 5% (v/v) polyethyleneimine in buffer P to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v), stirring 20 min at 0 °C, and centrifuging as for the cell-free extract. Ammonium sulfate was added to the resulting solution in portions over 45 min to a final saturation of 60%. The extract was stirred for an additional 30 min and centrifuged as above. The protein pellets were redissolved in 30 ml of buffer P containing 0.05 mm EDTA (dialysis buffer) and dialyzed overnight versus 2 liters of the same. The dialyzed solution from above was diluted to 300 ml with dialysis buffer and loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a 5-ml column of AdoHcy-agarose. The column was washed with 25 ml of the same buffer and eluted with 50 ml of buffer P containing 1 mm AdoMet at the same flow rate. Subsequent chromatographic steps required the inclusion of 1 mm AdoMet in the buffer for activity to be retained. A 5-ml aliquot of the eluate from the AdoHcy column was loaded directly onto a 0.8-ml column of nocardicin A-agarose equilibrated in buffer P containing 1 mm AdoMet. After washing the column with 2 ml of the same buffer, it was eluted with 5 ml of buffer P containing 1 mm AdoMet, 1 mm nocardicin A, and 1 m NaCl. This solution of homogeneous protein was concentrated using two Centricon-30® concentrators to a final volume of about 1 ml. The combined concentrate was desalted on a prepacked column of Bio-Gel P6DG (10 ml) equilibrated in buffer P containing 1 mm AdoMet. A Varian 5020 microprocessor-controlled liquid chromatograph equipped with a 250 × 4.6 mm Spherex (Phenomenex) 5-μm C-18 reversed phase column was used for HPLC assays. Column effluent was monitored by UV spectroscopy at 270 nm on an ABI 1000S Diode Array detector interfaced with a Waters 745 Data Module recorder/integrator. Solvents were HPLC grade and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter prior to use. Water was deionized, distilled, and filtered. To 100 μl of protein solution in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube was added 2 μl of nocardicin E solution (2.9 mg/ml in distilled, dd H2O, final concentration 130 μm) and 8 μl of AdoMet solution (6.6 mg/ml in dd H2O, final concentration 1100 μm). After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, 10 μl of 1 n HCl was added to stop the reaction. If a precipitate was observed, the assay tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The mixture (100 μl) was injected onto the HPLC column which was eluted isocratically with 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, 15% acetonitrile at 1.0 ml/min. AdoMet eluted close to the solvent front, nocardicin A had at R = 5.9 min, and nocardicin E eluted after 8.5 min. Analyses were conducted by HPLC as described with assay time and protein concentration adjusted to produce less than 15% turnover of the substrate in question. If the required dilution produced a protein concentration below 0.1 mg/ml, the enzyme solution was diluted with buffer P containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in order to avoid dilution inactivation. All substrates were prepared as w/v solutions in H2O with the exception of AdoMet which was assessed spectrophotometrically. Assays were stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m HCl, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −78 °C until analyzed by HPLC. The amount of product produced in the enzymatic reaction (nanomole) was calculated by multiplying the numerical value obtained from the electronic integration by a factor that was determined from a calibration curve. Where nocardicin G was the substrate (and isonocardicin C was the product), the reaction was monitored at 230 nm using 0.05 mammonium acetate as the mobile phase. Commerical AdoMet was purified prior to use by preparative HPLC utilizing a Regis Val-U-Pak 10-μm C-18 column (1 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 0.2% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Under these conditions, AdoMet was eluted from the column, whereas the impurities AdoHcy and 5′-methylthioadenosine remained bound. The resulting solution of AdoMet was lyophilized. AdoHcy-agarose-purified transferase solution (5.0 ml) was incubated with nocardicin E (1 mm) and AdoMet (2 mm) at 37 °C for 18 h. The nocardicin product of the reaction was isolated by preparative HPLC (Phenomenex 10-μm ODS, 4 × 25 cm, 8 ml/min, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, 15% CH3CN; v/v) and lyophilized. The purified nocardicin was dissolved in GITC reaction solvent (49.6% H2O, 50% CH3CN, 0.4% Et3N) and derivatized with GITC (2 eq in CH3CN) at 37 °C for 30 min. The derivatized product was analyzed by HPLC (36Kinoshita T. Kasahara Y. Nimura N. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 210: 77-81Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). AdoHcy-agarose was made from 6-aminohexanoic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's directions. 6-Aminohexanoic acid agarose (5 ml of gel, 11.4 μmol of aminocaproate per ml) was washed with 500 ml of H2O and placed in a 50-ml beaker. AdoHcy (46 mg, about 119 μmol) was suspended in 2 ml of H2O and solubilized with 1 n HCl. After adjusting the pH above 2.0 with saturated NaHCO3, the AdoHcy solution was added to the gel suspension. Water-soluble carbodiimide (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide; 100 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added, and the mixture was swirled gently at room temperature to link the carboxylate of the solid support to the amine of AdoHcy. The pH was maintained between 4.5 and 6.0 for 1 h followed by incubation at room temperature overnight. The gel was washed with 500 ml each of water, 1 m NaCl, and water. The column was stored in the presence of 0.4% (w/v) NaN3 in distilled, deionized water at 4 °C until needed. Using ε259 = 15,300, it was calculated that 95 μmol of AdoHcy washed through; therefore, 24 μmol was attached for an efficiency of 20% and a ligand loading of 4.8 μmol/ml gel. N-Hydroxysuccinimide (310 mg, 2.7 mmol, 1.2 eq), bromoacetic acid (312 mg, 2.25 mmol, 1 eq), and dicylohexylcarbodiimide (510 mg, 2.5 mmol, 1.1 eq) were added to 20 ml of p-dioxane in a 50 ml round-bottomed flask. After 1 h at room temperature, the dicyclohexylurea was removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken up in CH2Cl2, filtered, and evaporated several times to ensure the dicyclohexylurea was removed. After drying under high vacuum for 2 h, the residue was crystallized from CH2Cl2/petroleum ether to yield 425 mg (80%) of active ester as white needles, which was used immediately. NMR (CDCl3) δ = 4.13 (s, 2H, CH2Br); 2.89 (s, 4H, ring). The stoichiometry for gel coupling was 66 μmol of amino groups per 1.5 mmol of active ester. About 300 mg of crystalline active ester was dissolved in 3 ml of p-dioxane. Following filtration, the solution was added to ω-aminohexyl-agarose (8.8 ml, 66.3 μmol of amino groups) pre-equilibrated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, to yield a total volume of 15 ml. After standing for 1 h at 4 °C, the gel was washed with 1 liter of 0.1 m NaCl, also at 4 °C. The washed gel was then equilibrated with 200 ml of 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 9.0 (NaOH). Nocardicin A (100 mg, 190 μmol) was dissolved in about 5 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.0, and added to the gel suspension. After incubating for 3 days at room temperature with gentle shaking, the gel was washed with 2 liters of 0.2 m NaCl at 4 °C. The washed gel was equilibrated with the bicarbonate buffer above (200 ml) and placed in a 50-ml filter flask. After degassing under vacuum, the suspension was reacted with 5 ml of 0.2 m β-mercaptoethanol in the same buffer. The suspension was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed with 1 liter of 0.2 m NaCl. Using ε272 = 16,320, it was calculated that 170 μmol of nocardicin A washed through; therefore, 20.5 μmol was attached for an efficiency of 11% (based on excess nocardicin A) and a ligand loading of 2.33 μmol/ml gel. The gel was stored in the presence of 0.04% (w/v) NaN3 in distilled, deionized water at 4 °C until needed. NAT from the nocardicin A-agarose column was purified further by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column. After pre-equilibration of the column with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, NAT was injected, and after a 5-min wash with the same solvent, was eluted with an acetonitrile:water gradient (0–60%, each component containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 30 min. NAT purified by nocardicin A-agarose column chromatography was treated with Lys-C endoproteinase as described by the supplier (Sigma). The resulting peptide fragments were separated by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column. After pre-equilibration with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, peptide fragments were eluted with an acetonitrile:water gradient (0–90%, each component containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 90 min. Peptide 1-23-22 was further purified by a second gradient (5–35%) over 60 min, and similarly peptide 1-30-40 was further purified with a gradient (10–40%) over 60 min. The purified peptides were sequenced. High molecular mass (≥50 kb) N. uniformis gDNA was prepared using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, large scale bacterial genomic DNA procedure described by Ausubel et al. (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). RNA was removed by an overnight incubation at 37 °C with DNase-free RNase A (final concentration 40 μg/ml). Amplification of the 5′ end of the NAT gene utilized one primer designed from the N-terminal sequence (1-30-40NQ) and two primers designed from the internal Lys-C peptide sequence (1-23-22CE and 1-23-22CD). Degeneracy of all three primers was minimized by taking advantage of the reported Nocardia codon preferences (40Coque J. Malumbres M. Martı́n J.F. Liras P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 91-96Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A typical 100-μl reaction in 1× cloned Pfu buffer contained 200 ng of N. uniformis gDNA, 250 nmol of each primer, 200 μmol of each dNTP, and 5% glycerol. The reaction mixture was overlaid with mineral oil, denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, and, upon the addition of 2.5 units of cloned Pfu polymerase, was subjected to 30 cycles (94 °C for 3 min and 72 °C for 1 min) and one cycle of (94 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 10 min) in an Eppendorf Microcycler (Fremont, CA). PCR products were separated on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The desired band was excised, cloned into SmaI-digested pBluescript II SK(−), and transformed into E. coli XL 1 Blue MRF′ cells. Recombinant pBluescript II SK(−) was purified and sequenced. A non-degenerate oligonucleotide derived from the PCR-amplified 5′ end of the gene encoding NAT (transferase oligonucleotide probe (TOP), TAC GAC CTG TTC TTC CTG) hybridized to a single 6.3-kb PstI fragment in 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride, 50 mmNaPO4, pH 6.8, 0.2% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution at 52 °C on a dried agarose gel (41Mather M.W.

Accordingly, 30 μg of N. uniformis gDNA was digested with 500 units of PstI at 37 °C for 12 h followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with an additional 100 units of enzyme. Using standard procedures, the digested DNA was precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 45 μl of dd H2O (39Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The digested DNA was resolved on a 0.6% agarose gel and the DNA between 6 and 9 kb was excised and isolated. The isolated PstI fragments were ligated intoPstI-digested, shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pBluescript II SK(−). The ligation product mixture was transformed into E. coli XL 1 BlueMRF′ cells and grown on LB agar containing 90 μg/ml ampicillin, overlaid with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. Recombinant colonies (200) were regrown on nitrocellulose filters and screened by hybridization with the end-labeled32P-TOP, as described above for the genomic digest. A single colony was isolated that contained a 6.3-kb insert, pSDB 05-152. Sequencing of PCR products was accomplished using Sequenase-2.0 DNA polymerase as described by U. S. Biochemical Corp. using either the appropriate PCR primer or universal primers. The DNA sequence of pSDB 05-152 was obtained by primer walking using automated fluorescent sequencing methods. Sequence data were edited and compiled in Sequencher™ (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) and analyzed with the GCG software package (Version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI).

Isolated CrtJ is known to bind to the palindrome TGTN12ACA, which is present in two copies in the bchC promoter, one of which spans the -35 and the other the -10 sigma-70 recognition sequences. In this study, we demonstrate that CrtJ binds to the two palindromic sites in the bchC promoter in a cooperative manner. The level of cooperativity of CrtJ binding to the -35 palindrome was shown to be 26-fold. A distance of 8 base pairs between the two palindromic sites was shown to be critical for cooperative binding, as evidenced by the disruption of binding that resulted when +6 and +11 base pairs were inserted between the palindromes."
https://openalex.org/W2159262455,"HIV infection is characterized by accelerated apoptosis and progressive loss of B cells. To see whether these abnormalities are related to the property of gp120 to act as a superantigen for VH3(+) B cells, we probed the temporal development of VH3(+) antibodies in HIV-1-infected subjects over a 7-year period. We found that VH3(+) antibodies specific for the gp120 superantigen binding site are deficient. Since VH3(+) antibodies impart protective responses to infectious agents, we quantified VH3(+) antibodies in serum samples from HIV-seropositive slow progressors and from patients who progressed to AIDS-related manifestations. We found that paucity in VH3(+) antibodies is a marker of rapid clinical decline. Remarkably, anti-gp160 VH3(+) antibodies showed a gradual decrease in progressors and, with time, varied depending on the viral load. We conclude that disease aggravation is associated with a decrease of the magnitude of the humoral response, that VH3(+) antibodies play an important role in protection, and that their underexpression may accelerate disease progression. We propose that vaccine preparations able to trigger VH3(+) antibodies might confer a better protection against HIV infection. This work also represents a novel mechanism of humoral deficiency resulting from the capacity of a viral antigen to affect an important subset of the B cell repertoire and to induce B cell death by apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1954980722,"Although the involvement of oxidative stress is well documented in the diabetic state, the individual active oxygen species generated have not been demonstrated in animal models of diabetes currently used. Since streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in animals still serves as an animal model of diabetes mellitus, but streptozotocin induces diabetes and generates oxidative stress per se, we decided to study whether aromatic hydroxylation reflecting hydroxyl radical attack was found in three animal models of diabetes mellitus without streptozotocin induction or in streptozotocin-induced diabetes only. For this purpose, we compared lipid peroxidation, aromatic hydroxylation of phenylalanine, glycoxidation in genetically determined diabetic mouse strains db/db and kk, and the diabetic BB rat to these parameters in the streptozotocin-treated rat. Kidney malondialdehyde concentrations, reflecting lipid peroxidation, pentosidine, and Nε-caboxymethyllysine concentrations, reflecting glycoxidation, were significantly elevated in all diabetic groups as compared to their nondiabetic mates. Aromatic hydroxylation was significantly elevated in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic state exclusively. We conclude that biochemical, pathophysiological, and treatment studies in the streptozotocin model of diabetes mellitus may be confounded by the presence of products, reactions, and tissue damage generated by aromatic hydroxylation reflecting hydroxyl radical attack. We suggest it is not the diabetic state but streptozotocin that generates the hydroxyl radical, as reflected by aromatic hydroxylation in this model.—Lubec, B., Hermon, M., Hoeger, H., Lubec, G.

https://openalex.org/W1843352359,"Overexpression of heat shock protein 70 kDa alters the susceptibility of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. We conducted experiments to study the regulation of expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in heat shock-treated T47-D cells, a human breast cancer cell line that expresses estrogen receptors. Cells exposed to heat shock at 44 degreesC displayed increased expression of heat shock protein 72 kDa (HSP-72), glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP-78), and GRP-94 in a time-dependent manner, as shown by [35S]methionine incorporation and Western blotting experiments. The maximal rate of synthesis occurred between 2 and 4 h after heat shock. Removal of external Ca2+ inhibited the synthesis of the heat shock-induced GRP-78 but not of HSP-72 and GRP-94, whereas treatment of cells with BAPTA (a Ca2+ chelator) inhibited HSP-72 and GRP-78. Treatment with H89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) blocked the heat shock-induced GRP-78 synthesis, whereas GF-109203X (a protein kinase C inhibitor) attenuated the heat shock-induced HSP-72 synthesis and completely blocked synthesis of GRP-78 but not of GRP-94. These results indicate that protein kinase C is involved in regulation of the heat shock-induced synthesis of HSP-72, whereas PKA and PKC are involved in the regulation of GRP-78 synthesis. Cells overexpressing HSP-72 and GRPs after heat shock displayed resistance against lethal temperature (47 degreesC for 50 min) -induced death, which was diminished after removal of external Ca2+ and treatment with GF-109203X. Heat shock increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a temperature- and heating duration-dependent fashion, and the increase was inhibited in the absence of external [Ca2+]i and significantly reduced by pretreatment with H89 and GF-109203X. The results suggest that different pathways are involved in the induction of synthesis of HSP-72, GRP-78, and GRP-94 by heat shock. It is highly likely that only HSP-72 and GRP-78 are involved in the process of cytoprotection from the thermal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2103340598,"The mouse Ms6-hm microsatellite consists of a tandem array of the pentamer d(CAGGG)n. This microsatellite is extremely hypervariable, showing a germ line mutation rate of 2.5%/gamete. The mechanism responsible for this instability is not known. The ability to form intrastrand structures is a conserved feature of many hypervariable sequences, and it has been suggested that the formation of such structures might account for instability by affecting DNA replication, repair, or recombination. Here we show that this microsatellite is able to form intrastrand structures as well. Under physiological conditions, the Ms6-hmmicrosatellite forms a hairpin as well as two different unusual intrastrand tetraplexes. The hairpin forms in the absence of monovalent cation and contains G·A, G·C, and G·G base pairs in a 1:1:1 ratio. In the presence of K+, a tetraplex is formed in which the adenines are unpaired and extrahelical, and the cytosines are involved in C·C pairs. In Na+, a tetraplex forms that contains C·C+ pairs, with the adenines being intrahelical and hydrogen-bonded to guanines. Tetraplex formation in the presence of Na+ requires both cytosines and adenines and might reflect the altered internal dimensions of this tetraplex, perhaps resulting from the ability of the C·C+ pairs to become intercalated in this sequence context. Our demonstration of the stabilization of tetraplexes by hydrogen bonding between adenines and guanines expands the hydrogen-bonding possibilities for tetraplexes and suggests that the category of sequences with tetraplex-forming potential may be larger than previously appreciated.

Long arrays of tandemly repeated sequences are common in eukaryotes and, in humans, make up ∼10% of the genome (1Willard H.F. Genome. 1989; 31: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These sequences show varying degrees of polymorphism, with some arrays being stable, whereas others show frequent intergenerational changes that involve the gain or loss of a large number of repeat units. The mouse microsatellite locus Ms6-hm on chromosome 4 is an example of a highly unstable tandem array (2Kelly R. Bulfield G. Collick A. Gibbs M. Jeffreys A.J. Genomics. 1989; 5: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This microsatellite, which contains repeats of the pentamer d(CAGGG), shows a high rate of both germ line and somatic mutations (3Kelly R. Gibbs M. Collick A. Jeffreys A.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 235-245Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with germ line mutation rates of 2.5%/gamete and the number of repeats ranging from 200 to >1000, making it one of the most unstable mouse loci thus far described (3Kelly R.

The mechanism responsible for this instability is not known, but is of wider interest since, in humans, unstable tandem arrays are responsible for a group of genetic diseases known as the triplet expansion disorders (4Ashley C.T.

Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Biotechnol. 1992; 3: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and as such, these blocks might play a role in promoting this process. These blocks do not form in the presence of cations such as Rb+, Cs+, Li+, or NH4+. They occur at the 3′-end of the G-rich strand and are template concentration-independent and strand-specific. They are abolished when guanines in the template are replaced with 7-deazaguanine, and the guanines in this sequence are completely protected from DMS1 modification in the presence of K+ (7Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

This suggested to us that the underlying structure responsible for this block might differ in some fundamental way from previously described tetraplexes. We show here that, in fact, the Ms6-hm microsatellite forms two different tetraplexes, one in the presence of K+ and a different one that is seen only in the presence of Na+. In addition, this microsatellite also forms an unusual hairpin in the absence of cations. Our observations expand the category of sequences we would expect to form tetraplexes and might be relevant in particular to a series of previously identified sequences with tetraplex-forming potential that contain adenines. These sequences include the telomeres of a number of eukaryotes (15Moyzis R.K. Buckingham J.M. Cram L.S. Dani M. Deaven L.L. Jones M.D. Meyne J. Ratliff R.L. Wu J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Successive tetrads form a hollow stem that is bounded by loops formed by the bases between the G-rich regions (Fig. 1, L1, L2, and L3). K+ ions are generally the most effective monovalent cations at stabilizing these structures. It is thought that this is due either to an optimal fit of K+ inside the stem of the tetraplexes such that the cation is able to coordinate the O6 atoms of guanines in adjacent tetrads (18Pinnavaia T.J.

We have recently demonstrated that the ability to block DNA synthesis in the presence of K+ is a diagnostic feature of intrastrand tetraplexes (11Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol.

We have not found ions other than K+ to be effective at producing a block to DNA synthesis in any of the other tetraplex-forming sequences that we have tested (7Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K.

Evol. 1997; 14: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), so our observation of the ability of Na+ to cause a block to DNA synthesis on templates containing the mouse Ms6-hm repeats (7Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was somewhat surprising. However, since the properties of the arrest sites are all consistent with tetraplex formation, our working hypothesis was that the structural basis of the blocks to DNA synthesis seen in this region was the formation of one or more intrastrand tetraplexes with unusual properties.Since the major sites of polymerase arrest occurred at the 3′-end of the repeat array (summarized graphically in Fig. 2; also see lanes markedWT in Fig. 8) (7Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we conclude that the major structure formed in the presence of both cations involves all eight repeats. A lesser amount of polymerase pausing is seen immediately 3′ of the fifth, sixth, and seventh repeats from the 5′-end in the presence of K+, but not Na+ (7Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These products represent DNA synthesis arrest occurring at tetraplexes involving fewer repeats. The fact that a template containing only five CAGGG repeats produces only one weak K+-dependent chain termination product and no Na+-dependent ones (data not shown) is consistent with this idea. In addition to the larger number of polymerase stops, the amount of K+-dependent polymerase pausing at the 3′-end of the repeat tract is greater than the amount of Na+-dependent pausing (seelanes marked WT in Fig. 8) (7Weitzmann M.N. Woodford K.J. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9517-9523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two explanations are possible: either CAGGG repeats form a single type of tetraplex with a higher stability in K+; or two types of tetraplex form, one in the presence of K+ and a different, somewhat less stable tetraplex in the presence of Na+.Figure 2Pattern of DNA synthesis arrest on the (CAGGG)8 template.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used DMS, CAA, and DEPC to analyze the structures formed by eight d(CAGGG) repeats as well as a variety of base-substituted variants of this sequence. DMS methylates the N7 of guanine, which is not involved in Watson-Crick base pairing (20Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8991) Google Scholar). Protection of guanines from this reagent is thus diagnostic of the formation of non-Watson-Crick base interactions. DMS also modifies adenines and cytosines, albeit to a lesser extent, with the rate of these reactions varying with the particular configuration of the base. Chloroacetaldehyde reacts with the N1 and N6 of adenine and the N3 and N4 of cytosine (21Leonard N.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 15: 125-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), positions involved in hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick A·T and G·C pairs, respectively. The first step in the reaction of CAA with DNA is believed to be the alkylation of the endocyclic nitrogen (21Leonard N.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 15: 125-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and N 6-substituted adenosines and N 4-substituted cytidines are reactive with CAA (22Barrio J.R. Secrist J.A.R. Leonard N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is thus feasible that cytosines that are hydrogen-bonded at N4 but not N3 and that adenines in which the N6 but not the N1 proton is involved in a hydrogen bond will also be reactive with CAA. DEPC decarboxylates adenines and, to a lesser extent, guanines (23Leonard N.J. McDonald J.J. Henderson R.E. Reichmann M.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3335-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This modification occurs at adenine N6 and N7 and guanine N7 and is seen most readily when these bases are unpaired or in an unusual conformation. In parallel with the chemical probing experiments, we examined the ability of these oligodeoxyribonucleotides to cause either Na+- or K+-dependent DNA synthesis arrest when used as templates for DNA polymerase under similar reaction conditions.The Mouse Ms6-hm Repeat Forms a Mixture of Different StructuresAn oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing eight copies of the mouse Ms6-hm repeat showed some level of DMS protection for certain guanines both in the absence of monovalent cation (or in the presence of Li+) and in the presence of K+ or Na+ (Fig. 3). Since unpaired guanines or guanines in Watson-Crick G·C pairs are not protected from DMS modification, this indicates that secondary structures involving non-Watson-Crick base interactions are formed under all of these conditions. The patterns of DMS protection are different in Li+, K+, and Na+ (Fig. 3, lanes markedL, K, and N), indicating that at least three different secondary structures are formed by the mouseMs6-hm repeat.Figure 3DMS modification of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing the (CAGGG)8tract.

The DMS-reactive bases are shown in boldface with the identity of the base and its position in the repeat tract indicated alongside. The black arrowindicates the DMS-hyperreactive guanine that is seen in the presence of K+ and is diagnostic of the formation of the K+tetraplex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Monovalent Cation-independent StructureIn the absence of monovalent cation or in the presence of Li+, there is partial protection of the third guanine in the first repeat and of the first and third guanines in the remaining repeats (Fig. 3). The third guanine in each repeat shows ∼50% of the DMS reactivity of the second guanine residue, whereas the first guanine is also protected, albeit to a lesser extent. Replacement of the C at position 41 with a T greatly reduces the amount of DMS protection (data not shown). Substitution of A7, A17, A27, and A37 with N 6-methyladenine, an adenine analog that contains a methyl group at N6, or nebularine, a purine base that lacks the N6 amino group, abolishes the partial DMS protection of the guanines (Fig. 4), indicating that hydrogen bonding of some or all of these adenines is involved in the structure responsible for this protection. These data are consistent with the formation of a hairpin in which the first guanine in each repeat is involved in a G·A pair, the second guanine is involved in a Watson-Crick G·C base pair, and the third guanine is hydrogen-bonded to the third guanine in a repeat on the opposite side of the hairpin (Fig. 5). In a G·G pair, each of these guanines acts as an N7 donor 50% of the time, thus accounting for the ∼50% reduction in DMS reactivity of these bases. A base pairing scheme in which guanines in the G·A pairs are obligatory N7 donors should afford their complete protection from DMS modification. Therefore, the partial protection of the first guanine in each repeat could result from either an oscillation between a G·A pair that involves guanine N7and one that does not or a mixture of the two types of base pairs. A G-syn·AH+-anti base pair is the only G·A pair involving the normal tautomeric forms of these bases in which guanine N7 participates in a hydrogen bond; however, this scheme requires that the adenine be protonated, and since we observed a similar pattern of DMS protection over the pH range 5.5–10, this finding is somewhat surprising. Possibilities for G·A pairing that do not involve guanine N7 include a G-anti·A-syn pair, a G-anti·A-anti pair, or a sheared G·A pair.Figure 4DMS modification of N6-methyladenine- or nebularine-substituted oligonucleotides.

The fact that no guanines in the repeat are reactive with DMS suggests that all the guanines are located within the stem of the tetraplex rather than the loops. Although no guanines within the repeat are DMS-reactive, there was a single DMS-hyperreactive guanine in the 3′-flanking region (Fig. 3, arrow) that was not seen in the presence of either Li+ or Na+. Hyperreactivity of this base would be consistent with its N7 atom being in a particularly exposed conformation, as it might be at the junction of the tetraplex and a region of single strandedness, and appears to be a common feature of K+-dependent tetraplexes. 2K. J. Woodford, M. N. Weitzmann, and K. Usdin, manuscript in preparation. This pattern of DMS modification was independent of pH over the range 5.5–10.The same pattern of DMS protection, including the hyperreactive guanine in the flanking region, was seen when A7, A17, A27, and A37 were substituted withN 6-methyladenine or nebularine (Fig. 4). Since nebularine cannot participate in hydrogen bonds, this observation would be consistent with the adenines being unpaired in the K+ tetraplex. The fact thatN 6-methyl-adenine substitution does not abolish the tetraplex supports this hypothesis. Moreover, since this analog contains a relatively bulky methyl group that would be difficult to accommodate within a tetraplex (24Lee J.S. Evans D.H. Morgan A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4305-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it suggests that the adenines might in fact be pointed away from the helix axis in an extrahelical position. All the adenines in the repeat were more extensively modified by DEPC than adenines outside the repeat or the same adenines in the presence of Li+ or in the absence of monovalent cation (Fig. 6). This hyperreactivity suggests that the adenines in the repeat are not simply unpaired, but may be particularly exposed to the solvent, consistent with the hypothesis that the adenines are extrahelical. No DEPC-reactive guanines were seen within the repeat, consistent with the DMS data. Replacement of A7 and A27 with the isosteric analog of adenine, 7-deazaadenine, has little effect on either the K+-dependent arrest of DNA synthesis or the pattern of K+-dependent DMS protection (data not shown). However, replacement of all adenines with 7-deazaadenine eliminates the K+-dependent arrests. This observation is not necessarily inconsistent with the interpretation that the adenines are unpaired since the presence of a carbon rather than a nitrogen at position 7 of 7-deazaadenine not only abolishes the ability of this analog to act as an N7 donor, but also produces an altered π-electron shell that can affect other interactions that may stabilize the tetraplex in other ways (25Seela F. Berg H. Rosemeyer H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Figure 6DEPC modification of the (CAGGG)8tract. An oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing theMs6-hm repeat was modified with DEPC as described under “Materials and Methods.” The lanes marked L, K, and N indicate the products for reactions carried out in the presence of Li+, K+, and Na+, respectively. Each repeat unit is indicated by abracket and numbered 1–8 starting from the 5′-end. The sequence of a representative repeat unit is shown alongsideunit 2. The reactive adenines seen in K+ and the reactive guanines seen in Na+ are shown in boldface with the identity of the base and its position in the repeat tract indicated alongside.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The adenines in the repeat were uniformly reactive with CAA in the presence of K+ at both high (Fig. 7), and low pH values. Given the DEPC hyperreactivity of the adenines, the CAA data are consistent with these bases being unpaired. At high pH, the cytosines are CAA-reactive (Fig. 7), but at low pH, they are not (data not shown). This suggests that the cytosines form pH-sensitive hydrogen bonds at low pH. Since the adenines are unpaired at all pH values and since G·C pairs or G·C·G·C tetrads are not favored by protonation, this suggests that the K+ tetraplex contains C·C+ pairs at low pH. The reason for the CAA reactivity of the cytosines at high pH is less clear-cut. One interpretation is that the cytosines are unpaired under these conditions. However, replacement of C6and C26 with thymines reduces the extent of polymerase arrest in the presence of K+ (Fig. 8, center panel). This would be consistent with a role of hydrogen bonding involving these cytosines even at higher pH values. Moreover, replacement of C6, C16, C26, and C36 with thymines enables the tract to block DNA polymerase as effectively as the unsubstituted repeat (Fig. 8, right panel). These results suggest that hydrogen bonds form between C6 and C16 and between C26 and C36. The C6-to-T6 and C26-to-T26substitutions would disrupt both C·C pairs, without providing significant compensating hydrogen bonding, whereas the substitution of all four cytosines in the stem would make the formation of hydrogen bonds between thymines possible and thus restore stability to the structure. In neutral C·C pairs, the N4 amino group of one cytosine is involved in a hydrogen bond with the N3 of the other cytosine, but since this base pair only involves a single hydrogen bond, it is likely that each cytosine acts as an N3 acceptor 50% of the time, with the lifetime of each conformation being shorter than the reaction time of the structure with CAA (26Boulard Y. Cognet J.A. Fazakerley G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The CAA reactivity of cytosines at pH values above neutral could thus be reconciled with the effect of thymine substitutions if it is assumed that the cytosines are involved in neutral C·C pairs in which each cytosine oscillates between a conformation in which it acts as an N3 donor and one in which it acts an N3acceptor. The cytosines would be vulnerable to CAA modification either when they are acting as N3 acceptors or during the transition from N3 acceptor to N3 donor. All the available data therefore lend support to a model for the K+ tetraplex shown in Fig. 9, in which all the guanines are involved in G4tetrads; the adenines are extrahelical; and C6, C16, C26, and C36are involved in neutral C·C pairs at non-acidic pH values and in hemiprotonated C·C+ pairs at low pH.Figure 7CAA modification of the (CAGGG)8tract.
