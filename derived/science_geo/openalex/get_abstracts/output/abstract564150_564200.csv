Using this information to guide the development and application of therapies in the clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from 29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expression) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly annotated human cancer cell lines and correlated with sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faithfully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in tumors, find that many of these associate with drug sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-based modeling uncovers combinations of alterations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning demonstrates the relative importance of different data types in predicting drug response.

Our analysis and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic options for selected cancer sub-populations. Cancers arise because of the acquisition of somatic alterations in their genomes that alter the function of key cancer genes (Stratton et al., 2009Stratton M.R. Campbell P.J. Futreal P.A. The cancer genome.Nature. 2009; 458: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar). A number of these alterations are implicated as determinants of treatment response in the clinic (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman P.B. Hauschild A. Robert C. Haanen J.B. Ascierto P. Larkin J. Dummer R.

Studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have generated comprehensive catalogs of the cancer genes involved in tumorigenesis across a broad range of cancer types (Lawrence et al., 2014Lawrence M.S.

The emerging landscape of oncogenic alterations in cancer points to a hierarchy of likely functional processes and pathways that may guide the future treatment of patients (Ciriello et al., 2013Ciriello G.

Clinical trials are complex and expensive, and pre-clinical data that helps stratify patients can dramatically increase the likelihood of success during clinical development (Cook et al., 2014Cook D. Brown D. Alexander R. March R. Morgan P. Satterthwaite G. Pangalos M.N. Lessons learned from the fate of AstraZeneca’s drug pipeline: a five-dimensional framework.Nat. Rev.

Thus, pre-clinical biological models that, as much as reasonably possible, capture both the molecular features of cancer and the diversity of therapeutic responses are a necessity. Human cancer cell lines are a facile experimental model and are widely used for drug development. Large-scale drug sensitivity screens in cancer cell lines have been used to identify clinically meaningful gene-drug interactions (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N.

In the past, such screens have labored under the limitation of an imperfect understanding of the landscape of cancer driver genes, but it is now possible to view drug sensitivity in such models through the lens of clinically relevant oncogenic alterations. Here, we analyzed somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and hypermethylation across a total of 11,289 tumor samples from 29 tumor types to define a clinically relevant catalog of recurrent mutated cancer genes, focal amplifications/deletions, and methylated gene promoters (Figure 1A; Tables S1A–S1D). These oncogenic alterations were investigated as possible predictors of differential drug sensitivity across 1,001 cancer cell lines (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1E) screened with 265 anti-cancer compounds (Figures 1D and S1; Table S1F). We have carried out an exploration of these data to determine (1) the extent to which cancer cell lines recapitulate oncogenic alterations in primary tumors, (2) which oncogenic alterations associate with drug sensitivity, (3) whether logic combinations of multiple alterations better explain drug sensitivity, and (4) the relative contribution of different molecular data types, either individually or in combination, in predicting drug response (Figure 1E).Figure S1Screened Compound Duplicates, Related to Figure 1Show full captionHistograms, scatter plots and Pearson correlation scores between IC50 profiles for 7 compounds screened in biological duplicates.

Superimposed to each scatter plot is a contingency table (and a corresponding Fisher exact test p-value) showing consistency of sensitive (IC50 ≤ maximal tested concentration) and resistant (IC50 > maximal tested concentration) cell lines across replicates. We built a comprehensive map of the oncogenic alterations in human tumors using data from TCGA, ICGC, and other studies (Figure 1A; Table S1C). The map consisted of (1) cancer genes (CGs) for which the mutation pattern in whole-exome sequencing (WES) data is consistent with positive selection, 2) focal recurrently aberrant copy number segments (RACSs) from SNP6 array profiles, and 3) hypermethylated informative 5′C-phosphate-G-3′ sites in gene promoters (iCpGs) from DNA methylation data, hereafter collectively referred to as “Cancer functional events” (CFEs). We identified CFEs by combining data across all tumors (pan-cancer), as well as for each cancer type (cancer specific) (Tables S2A, S2D, and S2H). The WES dataset consisted of somatic variant calls from 48 studies of matched tumor-normal samples, comprising 6,815 samples and spanning 28 cancer types (Tables S1A–S1D). CGs were detected per cancer type by combining the outputs of three algorithms: MutSigCV, OncodriveFM, and OncodriveCLUST (Lawrence et al., 2013Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Polak P. Kryukov G.V.

This identified 461 unique pan-cancer genes (Table S2A). We further added nine genes identified as putative tumor suppressors (Wong et al., 2014Wong C.C. Martincorena I. Rust A.G. Rashid M.

Genet. 2014; 46: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We mined the COSMIC database to identify likely driver mutations in 358 of the 470 CGs (Table S2B; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Most tumors harbored only a few driver mutations (median n = 2, range 0–64), consistent with previous reports (Kandoth et al., 2013Kandoth C. McLellan M.D. Vandin F. Ye K. Niu B. Lu C. Xie M.

RACSs were identified using ADMIRE for the analysis of 8,239 copy number arrays spanning 27 cancer types (van Dyk et al., 2013van Dyk E. Reinders M.J.T. Wessels L.F.A. A scale-space method for detecting recurrent DNA copy number changes with analytical false discovery rate control.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Table S1D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In total, 851 cancer-specific RACSs were gained (286 segments) or lost (565 segments), with a median of 19 RACSs per tumor type (Table S2D). The median number of genes within each RACS was 15 for amplified regions and one for deleted regions. The majority of known driver gene amplifications (e.g., EGFR, ERBB2, MET, and MYC) and homozygous deletions (e.g., CDKN2A, PTEN, and RB1) were captured, with 320 RACSs (38%) containing at least one known putative cancer driver gene, in addition to 531 RACSs (62%) without known driver genes. A smaller pan-cancer set (due to overlap in RACSs across cancer types) was constructed by pooling these results, comprising 425 RACSs (117 amplified and 308 deleted) (Tables S2D–S2F). iCpGs were identified using DNA methylation array data for 6,166 tumor samples spanning 21 cancer types (Table S1D). We defined 378 iCpGs based on a multimodal distribution of their methylation signal in at least one cancer type (Tables S2H and S2I). This also established a discretization threshold used to define such regions as hyper-methylated in the cell lines (Table S2J; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In total, our multidimensional analysis of >11,000 patient tumor samples identified 1,699 cancer-specific CFEs, which were further merged into 1,273 unique pan-cancer CFEs (Figure S2A). Next, we assessed the extent to which the mutational landscape of cancer cell lines captures that seen in primary tumors. We utilized a panel of 1,001 human cancer cell lines analyzed through WES (n = 1,001), copy number (n = 996), gene expression (n = 968), and DNA methylation (n = 957) (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines) (Figure 1B) and which we reclassified according to the TCGA tissue labels (Figure 2A; Tables S1A and S1E). Molecular alterations identified in cell lines were filtered using the CFEs identified in the primary tumor samples, providing a set of clinically relevant CFEs for the cell lines (Figure 1C). Of the 1,273 pan-cancer CFEs identified in patient tumors, 1,063 (84%) occurred in at least one cell line, and 1,002 (79%) occurred in at least three (Figure 2A). This concordance was greatest for the RACSs (100% of 425; Table S2G), followed by iCpGs (338 of 378, 89%; Table S2J) and CGs (300 of 470, 64%; Table S2C). When considering cancer-specific CFEs, concordance was highest for CFEs occurring in at least 5% of patients (median of 86% of CFEs covered across cancer types; Figure 2A; Data S1A). Coverage of CFEs varied by cancer type, and when we include infrequent CFEs (occurring in < 5% of patients), this concordance is markedly lower for the majority of cancer types (median coverage = 46%; Figure S2B). CFEs absent in cell lines are reported in Table S2K. The correlation between the frequency of CFEs in cell lines and patient tumors was high for the majority of the cancer types and for all three classes of CFEs (Figures 2B and S2C; Table S2L; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Using a simple nearest-neighbor classifier based on the presence of CFEs in cell lines and tumors across cancer types, we could correctly match the tissue of origin of cell lines to primary tumors (and vice versa) for 71% of the cases (27 out of 38 alteration profiles [randomly expected 1%]) (Figures S2D and S2E; Table S2M; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This percentage increased to 81% and 92% (randomly expected 2% and 5%), when considering the second and fifth nearest-neighbors, respectively (Figure S2E). The frequency of alterations in 13 canonical cancer-associated pathways was highly correlated between cell lines and tumors of the same cancer type (median R = 0.75 across all 13 pathways) (Figure 3A; Table S3A). A previous hierarchical classification of ∼3,000 tumors identified two major subclasses: M and C class (dominated by mutations and copy number alterations, respectively) (Ciriello et al., 2013Ciriello G. Miller M.L. Aksoy B.A. Senbabaoglu Y. Schultz N. Sander C. Emerging landscape of oncogenic signatures across human cancers.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). We expanded this analysis by including methylation data and by jointly analyzing cell lines and tumor samples. This integrated analysis of 3,673 samples (composed of 1,001 cell lines and 2,672 primary tumors for which all three data types were available and that were positive for at least one of the 1,250 CFEs [Tables S3B and S3C]) yielded four classes referred to as M, H, CD, and CA (Table S3D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Class M is enriched for CG mutations, class H for hypermethylation of iCpGs, and classes CD and CA for deleted and amplified RACSs, respectively (Figures 3B and S3; Tables S3E, S3F, and S3H; Data S1B). We observed a high concordance between the predominant class of CFEs in primary tumors and cell lines of the same tissue type (80% of cancer types, exceptions being GBM, KIRC, and PRAD) (Figure 3C; Table S3G; Data S1B). Taken together, these results show that a sufficiently large panel of cell lines is able to capture individual clinically relevant genomic alterations, in addition to pathway alterations and global signatures of driver events. To investigate how CFEs detected in primary tumors impact drug response, we first mapped these on our panel of cell lines (Figure 1C; Tables S2C, S2G, and S2J). Cell lines underwent extensive drug sensitivity profiling, screening 265 drugs across 990 cancer cell lines and generating 212,774 dose response curves (median number of screened cell lines per drug = 878, range = [366, 935]; Figure 1D). This is an expansion on previous pharmacogenomic datasets (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V.

The effect of each drug on cell number was used to model sensitivity as IC50 (drug concentration that reduces viability by 50%) or AUC (area under the dose-response curve) values (Tables S4A and S4B). Screened compounds included cytotoxics (n = 19) and targeted agents (n = 242) selected against 20 key pathways and cellular processes in cancer biology (Figure 1D; Table S1F). These 265 compounds include clinical drugs (n = 48), drugs currently in clinical development (n = 76), and experimental compounds (n = 141). We screened seven compounds as biological replicates and observed good correlation between replicate IC50 values with a median Pearson correlation (R) = 0.65 (0.78 for the compounds with most of IC50 values falling within the range of tested concentrations) and consistent classification of cell lines as sensitive or resistant to a compound (median Fisher’s exact test [FET] log10 p value = −26) (Figure S1). Cluster analysis based on AUC values confirmed that compounds with overlapping nominal targets or targeting the same process/pathway had similar activity profiles (Table S1G; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We used three distinct analytical frameworks to define the contribution of CFEs to the prediction of drug sensitivity (Figure 1E). ANOVA was used to identify single CFEs as markers of drug response. Logic models identified combinations of CFEs that improve the prediction of drug response. Lastly, we used machine-learning algorithms to assess the contribution of each molecular data type (CGs, RACS, iCpGs, and gene expression) in explaining variation in drug response. For consistency, all analyses used IC50 values. We carried out a pan-cancer, as well as a cancer-specific, analysis (for those 18 cancer types of sufficient sample size, n > 15 cell lines). For pan-cancer ANOVA, the set of CFEs included 267 CGs, 407 RACSs, and three gene fusions (BCR-ABL, EWSR1-FLI1, and EWSR1-X). Overall, for the 265 compounds, we identified 688 statistically significant interactions between unique CFE-drug pairs (p value < 10−3 at a false discovery rate [FDR] < 25%; Figure 4A), with 540 pan-cancer and 174 cancer-specific hits (Figure S4A; Table S4C). A subset of 262 CFE-drug pairs was additionally defined as large-effect interactions (Figure 4A). The effect size was quantified through Glass deltas (Δs) and Cohen’s D (CD) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).Figure S4ANOVA Result Summaries, Down-Sampled ANOVA Result Summaries, and ANOVA Validation Using CCLE and CTRP Datasets, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) The number of statistically significant CFE-drug interactions for each cancer type.(B) Example of ANOVA down-sampling analysis outcomes.

Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies. Comprehensive enumeration of sequence variation is necessary to identify functional alleles that provide important clues to disease pathophysiology, but large-scale sequencing does not support the idea that lower-frequency variants have a major role in predisposition to type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2466948651,"Dopaminergic projection axons from the midbrain to the striatum are crucial for motor control, as their degeneration in Parkinson disease results in profound movement deficits. Paradoxically, most recording methods report rapid phasic dopamine signalling (~100-ms bursts) in response to unpredicted rewards, with little evidence for movement-related signalling. The leading model posits that phasic signalling in striatum-targeting dopamine neurons drives reward-based learning, whereas slow variations in firing (tens of seconds to minutes) in these same neurons bias animals towards or away from movement. However, current methods have provided little evidence to support or refute this model. Here, using new optical recording methods, we report the discovery of rapid phasic signalling in striatum-targeting dopaminergic axons that is associated with, and capable of triggering, locomotion in mice. Axons expressing these signals were largely distinct from those that responded to unexpected rewards. These results suggest that dopaminergic neuromodulation can differentially impact motor control and reward learning with sub-second precision, and indicate that both precise signal timing and neuronal subtype are important parameters to consider in the treatment of dopamine-related disorders."

We demonstrate the wide applicability of W-4PiSMSN across diverse research fields by imaging complex molecular architectures ranging from bacteriophages to nuclear pores, cilia, and synaptonemal complexes in large 3D cellular volumes. Major advances in cell biology are tightly linked to innovations in microscopy. The development of fluorescence microscopy, for example, enabled sub-cellular localization of specifically labeled proteins of interest (Lichtman and Conchello, 2005Lichtman J.W. Conchello J.-A. Fluorescence microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). However, the wave nature of light restricts the resolution of conventional light microscopy to ∼200 nm, making details of subcellular structures and protein assemblies unresolvable (Hell, 2007Hell S.W. Far-field optical nanoscopy.Science. 2007; 316: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). The advent of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, or nanoscopy, techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) (Hell and Wichmann, 1994Hell S.W. Wichmann J. Breaking the diffraction resolution limit by stimulated emission: stimulated-emission-depletion fluorescence microscopy.Opt. Lett. 1994; 19: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar) and single-molecule switching nanoscopy (SMSN) (Betzig et al., 2006Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S.

These methods are now maturing and offering the opportunity to observe biological phenomena never before seen (Chojnacki et al., 2012Chojnacki J. Staudt T. Glass B. Bingen P. Engelhardt J. Anders M.

Zhong G. Zhuang X. Actin, spectrin, and associated proteins form a periodic cytoskeletal structure in axons.Science. 2013; 339: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Nanoscopy techniques share a common principle: they spatially separate unresolvable fluorescent molecules by independently switching their emission “on” and “off” (Hell, 2007Hell S.W. Far-field optical nanoscopy.Science. 2007; 316: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). In particular, SMSN methods such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) use a stochastic approach where only a small subset of fluorescent molecules is switched on at any particular moment in time while the majority remains in a non-fluorescent “dark” or “off” state (Gould et al., 2012aGould T.J. Hess S.T. Bewersdorf J. Optical nanoscopy: from acquisition to analysis.Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2012; 14: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Super-resolved images are reconstructed from the positions of thousands to millions of single molecules that have been recorded in thousands of camera frames. This imaging strategy was initially applied to single-objective microscopes in two dimensions (2D) (Betzig et al., 2006Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S.

USA. 2009; 106: 2995-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). While these instruments achieve 20- to 40-nm resolution in the focal plane (lateral, x-y), the resolution in the depth direction (axial, z) is typically limited to only 50–80 nm. The resolution can, however, be further improved by using a dual-objective “4Pi” detection geometry (Bewersdorf et al., 2006Bewersdorf J. Schmidt R. Hell S.W. Comparison of I5M and 4Pi-microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 222: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using two objectives doubles the detection efficiency (Xu et al., 2012Xu K. Babcock H.P. Zhuang X. Dual-objective STORM reveals three-dimensional filament organization in the actin cytoskeleton.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and thus improves the localization precision ∼1.4-fold in all three dimensions. Additionally, employing two objectives in a 4Pi geometry allows the creation of a single-molecule emission interference pattern at the detector leading to an ∼7-fold improvement in axial localization precision over single-objective approaches as demonstrated using interferometric PALM (iPALM) (Shtengel et al., 2009Shtengel G.

This improved resolution enabled, for example, the generation of anatomical maps of focal adhesions at ∼10-nm axial resolution (Case et al., 2015Case L.B. Baird M.A. Shtengel G. Campbell S.L.

However, this method was initially restricted to samples of ∼250 nm in thickness (Shtengel et al., 2009Shtengel G. Galbraith J.A. Galbraith C.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Gillette J.M. Manley S. Sougrat R. Waterman C.M. Kanchanawong P. Davidson M.W. et al.Interferometric fluorescent super-resolution microscopy resolves 3D cellular ultrastructure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lang T. Hell S.W. Egner A. Two-color nanoscopy of three-dimensional volumes by 4Pi detection of stochastically switched fluorophores.Nat.

Superresolution fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial nucleoids reveals their spatial range, limits, and membrane interaction.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4994-5010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the typical thickness of a mammalian cell is 5–10 μm, this has limited optical microscopy at the ∼10-nm isotropic resolution scale to thin sub-volumes of cells, thus precluding the ability to image organelles that can extend over several microns throughout the whole cell. Here, we present a new implementation of iPALM/4Pi-SMSN, termed whole-cell 4Pi single-molecule switching nanoscopy (W-4PiSMSN), which extends the imaging capabilities of this technology to whole cells without compromising resolution. W-4PiSMSN allows volumetric reconstruction with 10- to 20-nm isotropic resolution of ∼10-μm-thick samples, a 10- to 40-fold improvement in sample thickness over previous iPALM/4Pi-SMSN implementations (Aquino et al., 2011Aquino D.

USA. 2009; 106: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Our approach permits ultra-high resolution 3D imaging of virtually any subcellular structure. To demonstrate this, we image the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), bacteriophages, mitochondria, nuclear pore complexes, primary cilia, Golgi-apparatus-associated COPI vesicles, and mouse spermatocyte synaptonemal complexes. By these examples, we show that W-4PiSMSN opens the door to address cell biological questions that were previously unanswerable. To realize a system that achieves 10- to 20-nm 3D resolution across the thickness of entire mammalian cells, we expanded on previous iPALM and 4Pi-SMSN developments (Aquino et al., 2011Aquino D. Schönle A. Geisler C. Middendorff C.V. Wurm C.A. Okamura Y. Lang T. Hell S.W. Egner A. Two-color nanoscopy of three-dimensional volumes by 4Pi detection of stochastically switched fluorophores.Nat.

In these systems, fluorescence emission is collected by two opposing objective lenses and combined to interfere (Aquino et al., 2011Aquino D. Schönle A. Geisler C. Middendorff C.V. Wurm C.A.

USA. 2009; 106: 3125-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Depending on the axial position of a molecule, the light will interfere constructively or destructively, as indicated by the brightness of the molecule’s image on the detector. However, molecules at axial positions that differ by multiples of half the wavelength of light lead to the same interference pattern and cause ambiguity in determining their axial positions. This localization ambiguity leads to scrambled images that contain axially shifted image artifacts, known as ghost images, in samples thicker than ∼250 nm. This can be avoided by using not only the brightness but also the z-position-dependent shape of the single-molecule images to determine a molecule’s axial position. To address this, a higher-moment based analysis (Aquino et al., 2011Aquino D. Schönle A. Geisler C. Middendorff C.V. Wurm C.A. Okamura Y. Lang T. Hell S.W. Egner A. Two-color nanoscopy of three-dimensional volumes by 4Pi detection of stochastically switched fluorophores.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and analysis of the point-spread function (PSF) eccentricity in a hyperbolic mirrors-modified system (Brown et al., 2011Brown T.A. Tkachuk A.N. Shtengel G. Kopek B.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Hess H.F. Clayton D.A. Superresolution fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial nucleoids reveals their spatial range, limits, and membrane interaction.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4994-5010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were developed, which extended the image volume thickness to 700–1,000 nm. However, these methods pose significant drawbacks such as poor localization density because of the highly selective computational processes focusing on subtle features of PSFs. The methods are also susceptible to sample-induced optical aberrations, which change the PSF shape when imaging biological structures deeper in the sample (Burke et al., 2015Burke D. Patton B.

As a result, applications have been restricted to thin structures close to the coverslip (Case et al., 2015Case L.B. Baird M.A. Shtengel G. Campbell S.L. Hess H.F. Davidson M.W. Waterman C.M.

Nanoscale architecture of integrin-based cell adhesions.Nature. 2010; 468: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). To enable 4Pi-SMSN to probe deeper into the cell and extend the application of this technology to larger cellular features, we have developed W-4PiSMSN. First, expanding on the optical design by Aquino et al., 2011Aquino D. Schönle A. Geisler C. Middendorff C.V. Wurm C.A. Okamura Y. Lang T. Hell S.W. Egner A. Two-color nanoscopy of three-dimensional volumes by 4Pi detection of stochastically switched fluorophores.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, we included deformable mirrors in both arms of the 4Pi-interferometric cavity (Figure 1A; Figure S1). We use these mirrors to correct for imperfections in the instrument beam path and optimize the PSF quality for samples with various thicknesses (Supplemental Information; Figure S2). Deformable mirrors also allow us to compensate for sample-induced aberration modes, such as spherical aberrations (Burke et al., 2015Burke D. Patton B. Huang F. Bewersdorf J. Booth M.J. Adaptive optics correction of specimen-induced aberrations in single-molecule switching microscopy.Optica. 2015; 2: 177Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Gould et al., 2012bGould T.J. Burke D. Bewersdorf J. Booth M.J. Adaptive optics enables 3D STED microscopy in aberrating specimens.Opt. Express. 2012; 20: 20998-21009Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), which vary from sample to sample and with depth. Additionally, we can use these mirrors to introduce astigmatism in both interference arms without adding further complexity to the system (Supplemental Information). Thus, the deformable mirrors enable compromise-free, reproducible PSFs in a depth- and sample-independent manner.Figure S1W-4PiSMSN Setup and System Characterization, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Simplified system diagram of W-4PiSMSN.(B) Localization results of W-4PiSMSN of a fluorescent bead imaged with 50 nm steps over an axial range of 1.2 μm.

Second, building on an earlier approach by Brown et al., 2011Brown T.A. Tkachuk A.N. Shtengel G. Kopek B.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Hess H.F. Clayton D.A. Superresolution fluorescence imaging of mitochondrial nucleoids reveals their spatial range, limits, and membrane interaction.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4994-5010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, we developed an analysis method that combines information from (1) the 4Pi-PSF’s interference phase, which allows for precise axial localization but does not distinguish between different interference peaks, and (2) the eccentricity of the astigmatic 4Pi-PSF, which narrows axial localizations down to individual interference peaks but in itself does not offer the precision of 4Pi interference. Our new analysis algorithm interprets the large number of molecules imaged in each time and z-depth window as an ensemble measurement of the concurrent state of the W-4PiSMSN system (Supplemental Information; Figure S3A) and determines the relationship between the eccentricity of the astigmatic PSF and the interference phase of the 4Pi-PSF. Then the axial positions of all corresponding molecules can be assigned with high precision and unambiguously using a monotonic metric designed to describe the overall shape of the PSF and maintain its monotonicity in the presence of moderate amounts of aberrations (Supplemental Information; Figure S3B). Since this analysis is performed for well-defined temporal and axial data subsets, we have generalized it to identify and correct for drift (from both the system and the sample) over the course of imaging. Our method is robust against aberrations and improves the reliability and efficiency of axial position assignment as it automatically adapts to changes in the shape and interference pattern of the 4Pi-PSF. To demonstrate the resolution capabilities of our new system, we first imaged the ER. ER membranes were stained using anti-GFP antibodies to the overexpressed transmembrane protein, mEmerald-Sec61β, in COS-7 cells. We visualized the ER as a connected network of hollow tubes with 60–100 nm diameters (Figures 1B and 1C; Movie S1). Both horizontal and vertical cross-sections reveal the 3D membrane contour that was previously resolvable only with electron tomography (Frey and Mannella, 2000Frey T.G. Mannella C.A. The internal structure of mitochondria.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This high 3D resolution is quantitatively supported by a Fourier Shell Correlation value of 22 nm (Figure S4) (Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2013Nieuwenhuizen R.P.J. Lidke K.A. Bates M. Puig D.L. Grünwald D. Stallinga S. Rieger B. Measuring image resolution in optical nanoscopy.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). To test our approach on even smaller structures, we imaged antibody-labeled microtubules in COS-7 cells, a gold standard in SMSN (Figures 1D–1H). Without any detectable imaging artifacts, W-4PiSMSN resolves this 25-nm microtubule filament, which appears in all orientations as a hollow core coated with antibodies (Figures 1E–1H). In addition, the dataset features a high localization density of ∼5.5 localization events per 10 × 10 nm2 of surface area. Displaying the localization events by their radial distance from the tubule axis shows a Gaussian peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16–24 nm (Figure S4). Considering that the use of primary and secondary antibodies adds uncertainty to the actual position of the imaged dye molecules, we conclude that the 3D resolution of our instrument is well below 20 nm (FWHM). To demonstrate our approach on another challenging target, we imaged T7 bacteriophages. They feature an icosahedral-shaped capsid of ∼60-nm diameter, which has only been visible by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques before (Hu et al., 2013Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage t7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We non-specifically labeled proteins on the surface of purified T7 phages using an Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester, which reacts with primary amines, and mounted the phages on a coverslip (Figure S5). Image slices of a single phage in the x-y, y-z, and x-z directions show a hollow center in all orientations. To further refine the details of the detected phage structures, we adapted the tomogram-averaging approach originally developed for cryo-EM (Briggs, 2013Briggs J.A.G. Structural biology in situ--the potential of subtomogram averaging.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2013; 23: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, Broeken et al., 2015Broeken J. Johnson H.

Fluoresc. 2015; 3: 014003Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By combining 115 T7 images, our averaged reconstruction reveals the icosahedral shape of the T7 phages (Figures 1I–1L; Figure S4). As presented in Figures 1J–1L, a slice perpendicular to the major axis shows the expected pentagonal shape while a slice parallel to the major axis reveals a hexagonal shape. Our approach, however, has yet to clearly resolve the ∼23-nm tail and fiber structures of the T7 phage (Hu et al., 2013Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage t7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This is likely due to either incomplete labeling of the surface proteins or the flexibility of these structures. Nonetheless, our W-4PiSMSN system has enabled the visualization of the ultrastructure of bacteriophages using light microscopy. We tested the two-color imaging capability of W-4PiSMSN by imaging microtubules and mitochondria in a COS-7 cell immunolabeled with Alexa Fluor 647 and Cy3B, respectively. Our reconstructions show microtubules running in close proximity ∼10–20 nm from the mitochondria top and bottom surfaces (Figures 2A–2C; Movie S2; Figure S5). Our system decouples axial localization from the PSF shape, the latter being susceptible to depth-dependent distortions caused by sample-induced optical aberrations (Liu et al., 2013Liu S.

https://openalex.org/W2470926071,"Clouds substantially affect Earth's energy budget by reflecting solar radiation back to space and by restricting emission of thermal radiation to space. They are perhaps the largest uncertainty in our understanding of climate change, owing to disagreement among climate models and observational datasets over what cloud changes have occurred during recent decades and will occur in response to global warming. This is because observational systems originally designed for monitoring weather have lacked sufficient stability to detect cloud changes reliably over decades unless they have been corrected to remove artefacts. Here we show that several independent, empirically corrected satellite records exhibit large-scale patterns of cloud change between the 1980s and the 2000s that are similar to those produced by model simulations of climate with recent historical external radiative forcing. Observed and simulated cloud change patterns are consistent with poleward retreat of mid-latitude storm tracks, expansion of subtropical dry zones, and increasing height of the highest cloud tops at all latitudes. The primary drivers of these cloud changes appear to be increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and a recovery from volcanic radiative cooling. These results indicate that the cloud changes most consistently predicted by global climate models are currently occurring in nature."

Axons in the mammalian CNS fail to regenerate after injury. Here we show that if the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is increased by visual stimulation or using chemogenetics, their axons regenerate. We also show that if enhancement of neural activity is combined with elevation of the cell-growth-promoting pathway involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RGC axons regenerate long distances and re-innervate the brain. Analysis of genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth can be target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets incorrect for their function. Moreover, these regenerated connections were successful in partially rescuing a subset of visual behaviors. Our findings indicate that combining neural activity with activation of mTOR can serve as powerful tool for enhancing axon regeneration, and they highlight the remarkable capacity of CNS neurons to re-establish accurate circuit connections in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2465435645,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, has been treated with targeted therapies. However, the mechanisms of differential responses and resistance of CRCs to targeted therapies are not well understood. In this study, we found that genetic alterations of FBW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in CRCs, contribute to resistance to targeted therapies. CRC cells containing FBW7-inactivating mutations are insensitive to clinically used multi-kinase inhibitors of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, including regorafenib and sorafenib. In contrast, sensitivity to these agents is not affected by oncogenic mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA or p53. These cells are defective in apoptosis owing to blocked degradation of Mcl-1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein. Deleting FBW7 in FBW7-wild-type CRC cells abolishes Mcl-1 degradation and recapitulates the in vitro and in vivo drug-resistance phenotypes of FBW7-mutant cells. CRC cells selected for regorafenib resistance have progressive enrichment of pre-existing FBW7 hotspot mutations, and are cross-resistant to other targeted drugs that induce Mcl-1 degradation. Furthermore, a selective Mcl-1 inhibitor restores regorafenib sensitivity in CRC cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance. Together, our results demonstrate FBW7 mutational status as a key genetic determinant of CRC response to targeted therapies, and Mcl-1 as an attractive therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2472352469,"Phosphoinositides (PtdIns) control fundamental cell processes, and inherited defects of PtdIns kinases or phosphatases cause severe human diseases, including Lowe syndrome due to mutations in OCRL, which encodes a PtdIns(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase. Here we unveil a lysosomal response to the arrival of autophagosomal cargo in which OCRL plays a key part. We identify mitochondrial DNA and TLR9 as the cargo and the receptor that triggers and mediates, respectively, this response. This lysosome-cargo response is required to sustain the autophagic flux and involves a local increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2 that is confined in space and time by OCRL. Depleting or inhibiting OCRL leads to an accumulation of lysosomal PtdIns(4,5)P2, an inhibitor of the calcium channel mucolipin-1 that controls autophagosome–lysosome fusion. Hence, autophagosomes accumulate in OCRL-depleted cells and in the kidneys of Lowe syndrome patients. Importantly, boosting the activity of mucolipin-1 with selective agonists restores the autophagic flux in cells from Lowe syndrome patients. De Leo et al. identify a lysosomal response to autophagic cargo during lysosome–autophagosome fusion that involves TLR9 activation and OCRL recruitment, and leads to a regulated local increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is necessary for a normal autophagic flux."

We delineate a topological model in which NE openings are critical for AL uptake that nevertheless occurs without compromising the permeability barrier of the NE. We finally show that this unanticipated mode of pore insertion is developmentally regulated and operates prior to gastrulation. In eukaryotes, the double membranous nuclear envelope (NE) encloses the nucleoplasm and separates it from the cytoplasm. The inner nuclear membrane (INM) provides contact with chromatin and the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The two bilayers are fused at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that form aqueous channels through which regulated transport of macromolecules occurs. NPCs consist of multiple copies of ∼30 different nucleoporins (Nups) that are organized into biochemically distinct sub-complexes (Figures S1A, S1A′, and S1B). Two such modules, the inner ring complex (also called Nup93 complex) and the Y-complex (also called Nup107 complex) constitute the NPC scaffold that is symmetric across the NE plane. FG-Nups (containing phenylalanine-glycine rich intrinsically disordered protein domains) dock onto the scaffold. They constitute the permeability barrier and interact with translocating cargo complexes. Some of them (e.g., Nup214/88, Nup358 [RanBP2], and Nup153) introduce asymmetry by specifically binding to the cytoplasmic or nuclear face of the NPC, respectively (reviewed in Grossman et al., 2012Grossman E. Medalia O. Zwerger M. Functional architecture of the nuclear pore complex.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 557-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B). Obviously, the sheer size and compositional complexity of NPCs renders its assembly and membrane insertion a very intricate task. Two distinct NPC assembly pathways that are temporally separated during the cell cycle have been described. First, during interphase, NPCs are assembled de novo onto an enclosed NE (D’Angelo et al., 2006D’Angelo M.A. Anderson D.J. Richard E. Hetzer M.W. Nuclear pores form de novo from both sides of the nuclear envelope.Science. 2006; 312: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interphase assembly occurs ubiquitously throughout eukaryotes and strictly requires the fusion of the INM and ONM by a mechanism that is only partially understood (Doucet and Hetzer, 2010Doucet C.M. Hetzer M.W. Nuclear pore biogenesis into an intact nuclear envelope.Chromosoma. 2010; 119: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, no membrane fusion is required for NPC assembly at mitotic exit. This so-called postmitotic assembly mode is restricted to eukaryotes that disassemble their NPCs during mitosis into soluble sub-complexes after phosphorylation by mitotic kinases (Laurell et al., 2011Laurell E. Beck K. Krupina K. Theerthagiri G. Bodenmiller B. Horvath P. Aebersold R. Antonin W. Kutay U. Phosphorylation of Nup98 by multiple kinases is crucial for NPC disassembly during mitotic entry.Cell. 2011; 144: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In anaphase, de-phosphorylation of Nups is thought to trigger the ordered re-assembly onto the separated chromatids before or while membranes enclose daughter nuclei (Doucet et al., 2010Doucet C.M.

Both insertion mechanisms rely on the stepwise recruitment of pre-assembled sub-complexes. An insertion of pre-assembled NPCs into the NE has (to the best of our knowledge) not yet been described. NPCs not only reside within the NE but are also found in stacked cytoplasmic membranes termed annulate lamellae (AL) that are a subdomain of the ER (Figure S1C) (Cordes et al., 1996Cordes V.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Based on two-dimensional (2D) transmission electron micrographs these membrane stacks have been perceived as parallel membrane sheets decorated with NPCs (hereafter called AL-NPCs) that morphologically appear similar to their counterparts on the nuclear envelope (NE-NPCs) (Kessel, 1983Kessel R.G. The structure and function of annulate lamellae: porous cytoplasmic and intranuclear membranes.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 82: 181-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). AL appear in some but not all transformed cell lines (Cordes et al., 1996Cordes V.C. Reidenbach S. Franke W.W.

Strong P.A. Ultrastructural observations on human oocytes fertilized in vitro.Fertil. Steril. 1974; 25: 11-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A role of AL as a storage compartment for maternally deposited Nups that can be made available for meiosis and the rapid cell cycles during early embryogenesis has been suggested (Lénárt and Ellenberg, 2003Lénárt P.

Despite these fundamental and long-standing pretensions the function of AL remains elusive and controversial, primarily for two reasons: (1) it has been difficult to conceive how the insertion of parallel stacked membrane sheets containing pre-assembled and possibly pre-oriented NPCs is topologically possible; and (2) direct experimental evidence for a contribution of AL-NPCs to the pool of NE-NPCs has never been obtained. On the contrary a previous study in Drosophila embryos has detected large soluble pools of transport channel Nups and concluded that NPC insertion likely proceeds from soluble cytosolic Nups (Onischenko et al., 2004Onischenko E.A. Gubanova N.V. Kieselbach T. Kiseleva E.V. Hallberg E. Annulate lamellae play only a minor role in the storage of excess nucleoporins in Drosophila embryos.Traffic. 2004; 5: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we address the function of AL in the physiological context of the Drosophila blastoderm embryo that is rich in AL, while it undergoes a series of 13 synchronized mitoses in a syncytium (Figure S2A). Subsequently, the plasma membranes enclose the cortically aligned somatic nuclei in the extended 14th interphase, forming the first epithelial cell layer before the embryo initiates gastrulation (Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993Schejter E.D. Wieschaus E. Functional elements of the cytoskeleton in the early Drosophila embryo.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 67-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This occurs concomitantly with the broad onset of transcriptional activity on the zygotic genome, a major developmental transition present in all metazoan (Newport and Kirschner, 1982Newport J. Kirschner M. A major developmental transition in early Xenopus embryos: II. Control of the onset of transcription.Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In the syncytial blastoderm, cell-cycle progression is very rapid, with interphase durations of ∼10 min during the early cell cycles. At least in mammalian cells, de novo NPC interphase assembly has been described to proceed with markedly slower kinetics (Dultz and Ellenberg, 2010Dultz E. Ellenberg J. Live imaging of single nuclear pores reveals unique assembly kinetics and mechanism in interphase.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that NPC assembly into a closed NE in Drosophila embryos might occur by a different, faster mechanism. By tracking NPCs in living embryos, we demonstrate direct uptake of AL-NPCs into the NE, as the ER feeds nuclear expansion. We derive a topological model that explains how the INM becomes continuous with inserting membrane sheets from the ER. We conclude that AL insertion to the NE is a previously unanticipated mode of NPC insertion that relies on pre-assembled, yet immature NPC scaffolds and operates prior to gastrulation. To investigate whether AL-NPCs contribute to the pool of NE-NPCs, we conducted live-imaging experiments in Drosophila blastoderm embryos before formation of the first somatic cell layer (Figure S2A). During this stage of development, AL are abundant and thus could potentially serve as a reservoir for NE-NPCs. To track NPCs throughout early embryogenesis, we expressed functional GFP or RFP fusions of Nup107 (Katsani et al., 2008Katsani K.R. Karess R.E. Dostatni N. Doye V. In vivo dynamics of Drosophila nuclear envelope components.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3652-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to image scaffold Nups and injected sub-critical concentrations of the fluorescently labeled lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to label FG-Nups. In interphase, GFP::Nup107 localized to the NE and to prominent foci throughout the cytoplasm (Figure 1A), similar to structures that were previously characterized as AL (Cordes et al., 1996Cordes V.C.

Gubanova N.V. Kiseleva E.V. Hallberg E. Cdk1 and okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases control assembly of nuclear pore complexes in Drosophila embryos.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5152-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As expected these foci also stained positive for transport channel Nups (Figures 1D–1D″) and always localized to membranes (Figures S2C–S2E″). To further confirm that these foci are morphologically identical to AL, we performed correlative light and electron microscopy. RFP::Nup107 fluorescence was strongly enriched along the NE and at AL (Figures 1B–1B″, S2B, and S2B′). We conclude that fluorescence imaging in life embryos is well-suited to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of annulate lamellae. Image quantification revealed a 2.5- to 3-fold increase in nuclear surface during interphases, indicating a considerable uptake of ER membranes within a few minutes (Figures 1A, 1A′, and 1C). Thus, the surface area of the nucleus just before division is more than twice as large as the combined surfaces of the two daughter nuclei after division. This finding implies an excess of nucleoporins with respect to the available nuclear surface after mitosis. Both NE-NPCs and AL-NPCs disassemble during mitosis (Cordes et al., 1996Cordes V.C.

Dynamics of the nuclear envelope and of nuclear pore complexes during mitosis in the Drosophila embryo.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 34: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar). This leaves a fenestrated NE that, unlike in vertebrates, stays throughout mitosis around the separating sister chromatids and the mitotic spindle, except at centrosomes (Movie S1). Simultaneous with NE-NPC re-assembly at the daughter nuclei in late mitosis, AL-NPCs appeared first at membranes at the spindle (Figures S2C–S2C″; Movie S1), consistent with the idea of excess nucleoporins at late mitosis/early interphase. To address if AL-NPCs contribute to the NE-NPC pool during the following interphase, we first determined if NE-NPC density decreases during nuclear surface expansion. We quantified the mean fluorescence intensities of GFP::Nup107 at the NE and found that it stayed almost constant (Figure 1C). As a consequence, NPCs have to insert constantly into the NE as its surface increases. Conversely, AL-NPCs were highly abundant in early but not late interphase (Figures 1A and 1A′). We therefore investigated their fate during interphase progression by tracking AL-NPCs in living embryos and found that they insert into the NE (Figures 1D–1G and S2E–S2E″; Movies S2 and S3), along ER membranes (Figures S2E–S2E″; Movie S3). To directly confirm the transfer of Nups from the observed cytoplasmic foci to the NE, we imaged embryos expressing photo-convertible Seh1-EosFP. After photo-conversion of a fluorescent spot close to a nucleus, the signal remained locally constrained for ∼100 s before it laterally resolved into the proximal NE over roughly the same time frame (Figures 1F–1F″ and 1G; Movie S4), suggesting a critical event prior to lateral diffusion. We conclude that AL-NPCs insert into the NE during blastoderm interphases. Previous EM-based morphometry suggested that the total number of AL-NPCs stays constant in the syncytial blastoderm, i.e., during the first 90 min of Drosophila embryogenesis (Onischenko et al., 2004Onischenko E.A. Gubanova N.V. Kieselbach T. Kiseleva E.V. Hallberg E. Annulate lamellae play only a minor role in the storage of excess nucleoporins in Drosophila embryos.Traffic. 2004; 5: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, if AL-NPCs considerably contribute to the pool of NE-NPCs by inserting into the NE while it expands, their number should decrease at least temporarily on much shorter timescales, namely during the ∼10 min of each interphase. Indeed, we found that AL-NPCs diminished as interphases progressed (Figure 1H). This reduction was particularly strong in the first half of interphase, when the rate of nuclear growth and thus NPC insertion was highest (Figure 1C). To estimate if the reduction of AL-NPC number reflects NPC redistribution from AL to the NE, we measured the respective GFP::Nup107 fluorescence levels at both compartments in three dimensions over time. For all quantified nuclei, the integrated NE fluorescence intensities of GFP::Nup107 increased between 70% and 100% within the first quarter of interphase, while inversely intensities at AL strongly decreased, mirroring AL disappearance (Figure 1I). This supports a scenario in which the pool of NE-NPCs is predominantly fed by integration of AL-NPCs. Alternatively, AL could disassemble and soluble Nups could add to pore formation at the growing NE from the cytoplasm. Yet this is unlikely since the GFP::Nup107 background intensity in the cytoplasm remained constant as AL disassembled (Figure 1I). We conclude that our data rather support a scenario in which pre-assembled NPCs insert from AL into the NE. There are, however, major impediments that challenge the notion that intact NPC can insert into the NE: first, NPCs have an inherent compositional directionality across the NE plane (Figure S1B). If AL-NPCs were identical to NE-NPCs, they would be assembled asymmetrically in the absence of a nuclear compartment providing a directionality cue. They also had to be inserted into the NE in the correct orientation. Second, the integration of NPC-containing ER sheets into an intact NE poses striking topological obstacles. In particular, how an AL membrane sheet can become continuous with the INM of a sealed, intact NE is far from obvious. How is AL-NPC insertion thus possible? The asymmetry of NPCs derives from sets of FG-Nups that are found exclusively either at the nucleoplasmic or cytoplasmic side of the NPC, in contrast to the symmetrically embedded scaffold Nups of the inner ring and Y-complexes (Figures S1A and S1B). We therefore explored if NPC composition was preserved in AL. We subjected blastoderm embryos to subcellular fractionation and comparatively analyzed fractions enriched for nuclei, microsomal membranes containing AL (devoid of the NE) and soluble cytosolic proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry (Figures S3A–S3D″, S4A, and S4B). We found that AL-NPCs contain the full set of NPC scaffold components, namely all the members of the inner ring and Y-complexes (Figures 2A and S4B). In contrast, their levels were low or undetectable in the cytosol, with the exception of Sec13, a known member of the cytosolic coatomer complex (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A and S4B). These data further support the above-proposed scenario in which soluble pools of scaffold Nups cannot significantly contribute to the maintenance of NE-NPC number during interphase (see also Figure 1I).Figure 2AL-NPCs Resemble Pore ScaffoldsShow full caption(A) Composition of NE-NPCs and AL-NPCs.

Notably, the presence of Nup98 in AL-NPCs, a protein that is the essential constituent of the NPC permeability barrier (Hülsmann et al., 2012Hülsmann B.B. Labokha A.A. Görlich D. The permeability of reconstituted nuclear pores provides direct evidence for the selective phase model.Cell. 2012; 150: 738-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggests that NPCs are impermeable for larger molecules at all times. In contrast, the members of the Nup62/58/54 and Nup214/88 (the latter called Mbo in flies) complexes as well as the nuclear basket components Tpr (called Mtor in flies) and Nup153 were absent in AL-NPCs (Figures 2A–2D and S4B). Instead, the Nup214/88 and Nup62/58/54 complexes were highly abundant in the cytosol (Figures 2A, 2B, and S4B), in agreement with previous biochemical results that identified certain FG-Nups to be predominantly soluble and excluded from ER-membranes (Onischenko et al., 2004Onischenko E.A. Gubanova N.V. Kieselbach T. Kiseleva E.V. Hallberg E. Annulate lamellae play only a minor role in the storage of excess nucleoporins in Drosophila embryos.Traffic. 2004; 5: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One might thus surmise that NPC assembly is completed after insertion into the NE by recruiting soluble Nups from the cytosol in order to establish directionality and transport competence. Indeed, the nuclear accumulation of nls::GFP was delayed as compared to the burst phase of AL-NPC insertion (Figures S3E and S3F). We conclude that AL-NPCs are pore scaffolds devoid of most FG-Nups and all nuclear basket components. With the exception of Nup358, Nups that asymmetrically distribute across the NE-plane in NE-NPCs are absent from AL-NPCs (Figures 2E and 2E′). To address how AL-NPC insertion is topologically possible, we sought to identify putative steps of AL insertion by ultrastructural analysis. We first analyzed sections through staged blastoderm embryos by transmission electron microscopy after high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution. AL were apparent in the cytoplasm throughout the embryo as interconnected stacks of membranes containing NPCs (Figures S5A, S6A, and S6B–S6B″). AL that were close to the NE and thus potentially could engage in an insertion event, often appeared continuous with the NE (Figures 3A, 3B , S5B″, and S5C′). Strikingly, as evident in multiple sections, these AL-NE fusion sites often were adjacent to apparent openings within the NE (Figures 3A and 3B). At the edges of these openings, the INM and ONM were seen to be fused in the electron micrographs, emphasizing that the gaps are not sample preparation artifacts (Figures 3A and 3B). We used correlative light and electron microscopy as described above and recorded an electron tomogram at a site where a fluorescent spot of RFP::Nup107 close to the NE indicated a potentially ongoing insertion event (Figures 3C, 3C′, and S5B–S5B″). Although the observed membrane topology in this region was complex, it clearly showed the critical features: a patch of AL engaged with the NE in direct proximity to NE openings. In conclusion, the unanticipated discovery of NE openings offers a topological explanation for how the INM becomes continuous with AL (see below).Figure S6Annulate Lamellae Occur throu"
https://openalex.org/W2465346849,"The ability to shift between repetitive and goal-directed actions is a hallmark of cognitive control. Previous studies have reported that adaptive shifts in behavior are accompanied by changes of neural activity in frontal cortex. However, neural and behavioral adaptations can occur at multiple time scales, and their relationship remains poorly defined. Here we developed an adaptive sensorimotor decision-making task for head-fixed mice, requiring them to shift flexibly between multiple auditory-motor mappings. Two-photon calcium imaging of secondary motor cortex (M2) revealed different ensemble activity states for each mapping. When adapting to a conditional mapping, transitions in ensemble activity were abrupt and occurred before the recovery of behavioral performance. By contrast, gradual and delayed transitions accompanied shifts toward repetitive responding. These results demonstrate distinct ensemble signatures associated with the start versus end of sensory-guided behavior and suggest that M2 leads in engaging goal-directed response strategies that require sensorimotor associations."

More generally, our data identify a novel molecular mechanism for preventing premature activation of axon guidance receptors. The guidance of axons to their synaptic targets is an important event during neural circuit development. Axon guidance cues are also implicated in processes such as neuronal migration and polarization, neurite growth and pruning, and synaptogenesis (Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011Kolodkin A.L.

Cell surface receptors at the leading tips of growing neurites or migrating cells function to detect axon guidance cues and to elicit a cellular response. Different families of guidance receptors have been identified, but our understanding of how these receptors signal or how their activity is regulated is very incomplete. For example, receptor pre-clustering prior to ligand binding may be important for the spatial and temporal regulation of signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms by which receptor activation is achieved and ligand-independent activation avoided are for many systems still obscure (Atanasova and Whitty, 2012Atanasova M. Whitty A. Understanding cytokine and growth factor receptor activation mechanisms.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 502-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Semaphorins form the largest family of secreted and membrane-anchored axon guidance cues and generally require plexins as cell surface receptors in neurons (Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011Kolodkin A.L.

Plexins are large type 1 transmembrane proteins comprising typically ten domains in their extracellular segment, a single membrane spanning region that is predicted to be helical and a conserved, cytoplasmic region that contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain with a Rho GTPase-binding domain insert (Figure 1A). Plexins are subdivided into four classes (A to D) based on sequence similarity. Class A plexins (PlxnAs) are the best-characterized and act as neuronal receptors for secreted class 3 (Sema3s), as well as transmembrane class 5 and class 6 (Sema5s and Sema6s) semaphorins (Pasterkamp, 2012Pasterkamp R.J. Getting neural circuits into shape with semaphorins.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The largest portion of plexin ectodomain structurally characterized to date, PlxnA21-4, comprises the ligand-binding sema domain, followed by a PSI, IPT, and a second PSI domain (Janssen et al., 2010Janssen B.J.C. Robinson R.A. Pérez-Brangulí F. Bell C.H. Mitchell K.J. Siebold C. Jones E.Y.

These 2:2 semaphorin–plexin complexes indicate a bivalent binding mode is required to activate plexins, a mechanism supported by in solution and cell-based assays (Janssen et al., 2010Janssen B.J.C.

Sema3s require neuropilins to cross-brace the Sema3–PlxnA complex, but the generic, 2:2 plexin–semaphorin interaction, mediated by the sema domains of both binding partners, is conserved (Janssen et al., 2012Janssen B.J.C. Malinauskas T. Weir G.A. Cader M.Z. Siebold C. Jones E.Y. Neuropilins lock secreted semaphorins onto plexins in a ternary signaling complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dimerization of the plexin cytoplasmic region is a pre-requisite for activation (Wang et al., 2012Wang Y. He H. Srivastava N. Vikarunnessa S. Chen Y.B. Jiang J. Cowan C.W. Zhang X. Plexins are GTPase-activating proteins for Rap and are activated by induced dimerization.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5 (ra6–ra6)Google Scholar) and crystal structures of engineered cytoplasmic region dimers support a model in which the bivalent binding of the semaphorin ligand to two plexin ectodomains drives the juxtaposition of their cytoplasmic regions with consequent dimerization and activation (Wang et al., 2013Wang Y. Pascoe H.G. Brautigam C.A. He H. Zhang X. Structural basis for activation and non-canonical catalysis of the Rap GTPase activating protein domain of plexin.eLife. 2013; 2 (e01279–e01279)Google Scholar). Interestingly, functional and fluorescent light microscopy analyses have also suggested that the PlxnA ectodomain plays an essential role in autoinhibition of signaling prior to semaphorin binding (Takahashi and Strittmatter, 2001Takahashi T. Strittmatter S.M. Plexina1 autoinhibition by the plexin sema domain.Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Marita et al., 2015Marita M. Wang Y.

J. 2015; 109: 1937-1945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To establish how semaphorin binding is coupled to cytoplasmic domain dimerization and how the PlxnA ectodomain provides autoinhibition pre-ligand binding, structural data are required on the full extracellular PlxnA segment. In this study, we first detail a distinctive ring-like architecture that is common to the full-length (ten domain) extracellular segments of PlxnA1, PlxnA2, and PlxnA4. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) confirms this ring-like structure as the predominant form (alongside a minor twisted-open, chair-like conformation). Our crystal structures also reveal an intriguing intermolecular “head-to-stalk” interaction common to all PlxnAs. We confirm this interface mediates PlxnA–PlxnA interactions and occurs pre-semaphorin binding using structure-guided mutagenesis, biophysical assays, and fluorescence microscopy-based live cell imaging. Functional assays (i.e., COS-7 cell-based and dentate gyrus [DG] granule cell growth cone collapse experiments) confirm that intermolecular cis-interactions of the PlxnA ectodomains impose pre-signaling autoinhibition. Based on these results, we propose that, before signaling, PlxnAs exist as pre-formed dimers in which the association between the ring-like PlxnA ectodomains maintains a separation of their cytoplasmic domains. This “outside-together-inside-apart” mechanism keeps PlxnA signaling in check in the absence of ligands while, possibly, allowing co-localization of receptors to facilitate rapid signaling in response to ligand binding. We determined crystal structures of the full extracellular segments of mouse PlxnA1, PlxnA2, and PlxnA4 from eight crystal forms providing a total of 13 independent structures that range in maximum resolution from 4 to 10 Å (Figures 1 and S1; Table S1). The 4 Å dataset was obtained by dehydrating crystals of PlxnA11-10 that diffracted otherwise at best to 6 Å resolution (see Experimental Procedures). Structure determination of the full extracellular segments was aided by the available structures of PlxnA21-4 (Janssen et al., 2010Janssen B.J.C. Robinson R.A. Pérez-Brangulí F. Bell C.H. Mitchell K.J. Siebold C. Jones E.Y. Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin signalling.Nature. 2010; 467: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (PDB: 3OKT), PlxnA21-2 (Nogi et al., 2010Nogi T. Yasui N. Mihara E. Matsunaga Y. Noda M. Yamashita N. Toyofuku T. Uchiyama S. Goshima Y. Kumanogoh A. Takagi J. Structural basis for semaphorin signalling through the plexin receptor.Nature. 2010; 467: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (PDB: 3AL9), and additional higher resolution crystal structures that we determined of portions of PlxnA1 and PlxnA2; that is, PlxnA24-5 to 1.36 Å resolution and PlxnA17-10 to 2.2 Å resolution (Figure 1B). In five out of 13 full extracellular structures all ten domains are resolved whereas in the other eight structures some of the C-terminal domains were not modeled due to fragmentary or absent electron density. This indicates that some flexibility is present in the extracellular segment of plexins. In the crystal structure of PlxnA1-full ectodomain, the sema domain (domain 1, “head”) together with domains 2–9 (“stalk”) lie in a 230 Å long curve that forms a ring-like conformation (Figures 1A and S1A). All consecutive domains are arranged in a beads-on-a-string-like fashion, with short interdomain linkers (up to two residues) and extensive interfaces (buried surface area ranging from 716 to 1,172 Å2), each interdomain interface having a small hydrophobic core. These substantial domain–domain interactions likely contribute to conservation of the overall curved ring-like structure among the different PlxnA members and crystal forms. Some flexibility in the stalk is evident on comparison of the 13 different structures and contributes to the ring diameter ranging from 84 Å to 99 Å (Figures 1C and S1A). The interface between PSI3 and IPT3 (domains 6 and 7) differs markedly from those of PSI1-IPT1 and PSI2-IPT2, imposing a more acute angle on the relative arrangement of these two domains, and thus reducing the ring circumference (Figure S1B). The ring is closed only in the 4 Å structure of PlxnA11-10, by interactions between the sema domain and domain IPT5 (domain 9). This relative compaction can, most likely, be attributed to the dehydration procedure applied to generate this crystal form. In all other structures, the plexin extracellular domains associate only via the consecutive domain-domain interactions. Thus, contrary to previous speculations on plexin ectodomain structure (Antipenko et al., 2003Antipenko A. Himanen J.-P. van Leyen K. Nardi-Dei V. Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Rajashankar K.R. Lu M.

Plexina1 autoinhibition by the plexin sema domain.Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), in the unliganded state the sema domain does not make any intramolecular interactions with the remainder of the plexin other than to the directly ajoining PSI1 domain. The membrane proximal domain IPT6 (domain 10) is positioned perpendicular to the ring formed by domains 1 to 9, and the IPT6 C terminus points away from the plane of the ring. This out-of-the-ring orientation of IPT6 is observed in all five PlxnA ectodomain structures for which the electron density is sufficiently well ordered to allow IPT6 to be resolved. The same relative domain orientation recurs in the structure of PlxnA17-10. Possibly this distinctive orientation is stabilized by a loop (1,175–1,184) extending from IPT6 that provides hydrophobic interactions with three residues in domain IPT5, Trp1055, Ile1057, and Tyr1145 (Figures 1B and S1C), which are conserved across the A class Plxns. In the full-length plexin, the linker between IPT6 and the transmembrane helix is predicted to be short (6 residues for PlxnA1), and thus, for this conformation, the plexin extracellular segment is most likely positioned close to the membrane with its ring parallel to the cell surface. To assess the possible conformations of PlxnA full extracellular segments when removed from the constraints of crystal packing, we analyzed the structure of PlxnA11-10 with negative stain EM (Figures 2 and S2). In the electron micrographs, PlxnA11-10 is monomeric (Figure S2A). Assessed by eye, the majority of PlxnA11-10 molecules appeared to orient with the flat face of the ring lying on the grid in a conformation resembling the crystal structures, though a proportion adopted a twisted-open conformation (Figure S2A). In agreement with this initial assessment, the class averages of PlxnA11-10 sorted into two categories: “ring-like” or “chair-like” (twisted-open) conformations (Figures 2, S2B, and S2C). The ring-like species, which includes 66.0% of the particles, essentially matches the PlxnA1-10 crystal structures. A bulky feature at one end of the ring is readily identifiable as the sema domain (flat or sideways orientations on the grid resulting in a disk-like or bulb-like projection, respectively). From the sema domain onward, the stalk region extends in a range of curved conformations, resulting, as in the crystal structures, in some variation in ring circumference. A second species, which includes 30.5% of the particles, can be identified by its distinct chair-like conformation. The N-terminal half of the stalk region curves out from the sema domain as in the ring-like structures, but the C-terminal half appears twisted by a 180° flip so that it curves away rather than completing the ring. No clear class averages could be generated for the remaining 3.5% of the particles. The PlxnA1-10 crystal structures could be fitted to the class averages by assuming two flexion points, one between domains 1 and 2 (sema–PSI1) and another at the domain 5–domain 6 (IPT3–PSI3) junction (see Figure S2 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The excellent agreement between the class averages and projections of the structural models generated by rotations around these two potential flexion points reinforces the notion that the ten domain extracellular segments of PlxnAs have relatively limited flexibility (Figures 2 and S2C). Our results indicate that PlxnA ectodomains exist in only two alternative conformations with limited interdomain flexibility: the preferred, ring-like conformation as observed in crystal structures and the less frequent, chair-like conformation. All our PlxnA full ectodomain crystal structures have an intermolecular plexin–plexin interface in common (Figures 3 and S3A). This interface is formed by blades 1–3 of the sema domain of one plexin molecule and the outer side of domains 4-5 (PSI2-IPT2) from the ring of a second plexin (Figure 3A). In the 4 Å PlxnA11-10 structure, the interface has a buried surface area of 1,303 Å2 (355 Å2 between sema–PSI2 and 1,008 Å2 between sema–IPT2) and a complementary electrostatic charge distribution (Figure 3B). The residues in this interface are conserved among vertebrate PlxnAs but much less among all plexins (Figure 3B), suggesting that this plexin–plexin interaction may be an important functional feature of PlxnAs. This finding raises the possibility that PlxnA molecules on the same cell surface can interact in cis in a “head-to-stalk” manner using the sema–PSI2-IPT2 intermolecular interface to form dimers or small oligomeric clusters. A simple model-building exercise confirmed this possibility (Figures 3C and S3B). Taking into account the tilt of 50 degrees between the rings of two interacting PlxnAs, and the flexibility in the stalk region, PlxnA dimers can be accommodated on the cell surface (Figure 3C), but arrays incorporating more than three molecules clash with the plasma membrane in the absence of substantial membrane curvature (Figure S3B). Thus, our structural data raise the possibility that the ring-like PlxnA ectodomains exist as “head-to-stalk” dimers on the cell surface. Intermolecular interaction between full plexin ectodomains has been shown previously by us for PlxnA2 (Janssen et al., 2010Janssen B.J.C. Robinson R.A. Pérez-Brangulí F. Bell C.H. Mitchell K.J. Siebold C. Jones E.Y. Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin signalling.Nature. 2010; 467: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and by others for PlxnC1 (Liu et al., 2010Liu H. Juo Z.S. Shim A.H.-R. Focia P.J. Chen X. Garcia K.C. He X. Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin recognition and viral mimicry from Sema7A and A39R complexes with PlexinC1.Cell. 2010; 142: 749-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but the basis for this association remained unclear. In light of our PlxnA ectodomain structures, we set out to assess whether PlxnAs in solution interact via the sema–PSI2-IPT2 interface. The relatively low resolution of our full-length ectodomain structures mean that the residue-to-residue level details of the interface interactions must be interpreted with caution; we therefore chose to test the sema–PSI2-IPT2 interface by introducing glycosylation sites rather than simple point mutations. We first found that disrupting the sema–PSI2-IPT2 interface by inserting a bulky, N-linked glycan onto either the sema domain (PlxnA11-10 F145N/L147S) or the PSI2 domain (PlxnA11-10 F693N/E695S) can block the PlxnA1–PlxnA1 interaction using multi-angle light scattering (MALS) experiments coupled to size-exclusion chromatography (Figure S4). We then used analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) sedimentation velocity experiments to demonstrate that in solution PlxnA11-10 exists in heterogeneous states encompassing monomers up to tetramers arising from intermolecular sema–IPT2-PSI2 interactions (Figure 4A). At a high concentration of 28.1 μM (4 mg/ml), PlxnA11-10 gave four distinct peaks with sedimentation coefficients corresponding to monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer species, respectively (Figure 4AI). When the concentration was decreased to 7.0 μM (1 mg/ml), the population of PlxnA11-10 dimer and higher order oligomers decreased, and most of the PlxnA11-10 remained monomeric (consistent with the monomeric PlxnA11-10 seen at concentrations of 7 to 33 nM in the EM studies; Figure S2 and Experimental Procedures). The discrete shape of the peaks is indicative of relatively slow exchange between the monomeric and oligomeric states, and the sedimentation coefficients predicted by the structural models for the different oligomeric states fall within the spectrum of each peak. There was no evidence of plexin oligomerization states larger than a tetramer, consistent with the relatively weak intermolecular interactions of PlxnA11-10 being insufficient to build up large oligomers. In order to assess directly the contribution of sema–IPT2-PSI2 interactions, we also analyzed the behavior of PlxnA11-10 F693N/E695S during AUC. This putative interaction-blocking mutant showed one major sedimentation coefficient peak corresponding to the monomer species at both 28.1 μM and 7.0 μM (Figure 4AII). We then undertook surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding equilibrium experiments to probe the sema–IPT2-PSI2 interface and determine the affinity of interaction. We engineered two separate segments consisting of the PlxnA2 sema-PSI1 domains (PlxnA21-2) and the PSI2-IPT2 domains (PlxnA24-5); each segment encompasses one side of the putative “head-to-stalk” intermolecular interface. We found that PlxnA21-2 and PlxnA24-5 associated with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 20.9 ± 0.38 μM (Figure 4BI). The introduction of glycosylation by mutation F690N/E692S in PlxnA24-5 completely abrogated the interaction with PlxnA21-2 (Figure 4BII), consistent with our MALS and AUC results for the equivalent mutation in PlxnA11-10 (PlxnA11-10 F693N/E695S). Taken together, the results of our in solution assays point to a head-to-stalk mode of interaction between receptor ectodomains that is common to all PlxnAs. We next sought information on the oligomeric state of PlxnAs at the cell surface. Our first experiments, using localization microscopy, suggested that PlxnAs form only dimers or small oligomers (Figure S5A). As the size of these structures was too close to the resolution limit (∼50 nm) of localization microscopy, we turned to Förster resonance energy transfer measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM), a method suited to measure transient and low-affinity interactions (Padilla-Parra et al., 2008Padilla-Parra S.

Fluorescent proteins mTFP1 and mVenus were fused to the PlxnA2 extracellular-transmembrane segment via a RTLEVLFQGP linker to provide the FRET donor (PlxnA2-mTFP1) and acceptor (PlxnA2-mVenus), respectively. The linker was designed to allow FRET to occur if PlxnA2-mTFP1 and mPlxnA2-mVenus interact via the sema–IPT2-PSI2 interface, or through ligand binding (Figure S5BI). For each FLIM image of a live COS-7 cell, intermolecular interactions were quantified by the mean fluorescence lifetime, 〈τ〉, and the fraction of interacting donor, fD, on a pixel-by-pixel basis (Figure S5BII; see also Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Padilla-Parra et al., 2015Padilla-Parra S. Audugé N. Tramier M. Coppey-Moisan M. Time-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy: a quantitative method to follow transient protein-protein interactions in living cells.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2015; 2015: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Average mean lifetime (〈τ〉¯) and average fraction of interacting donors (fD¯) were calculated from these pixel-by-pixel distributions (Figure 5). To exclude potential artifacts due to protein overexpression, we only analyzed cells expressing similar PlxnA levels (assessed by fluorescence intensity). The ratio between FRET donor-fused PlxnAs and acceptor-fused PlxnAs did not correlate with the level of FRET (i.e., extent of PlxnA–PlxnA interactions) (Figure S5BII). A representative cell expressing PlxnA2-mTFP1 alone (no-FRET) has a 〈τ〉¯ of 2.73 ns and an fD¯ of 0.05 (Figure 5AI). In contrast, a cell co-expressing PlxnA2-mTFP1 and PlxnA2-mVenus shows a 〈τ〉¯ of 2.61 ns and an fD¯ of 0.11, indicating FRET is occurring (Figure 5AII). A cell co-expressing the putative interaction-inhibiting mutants PlxnA2 F690N/E692S-mTFP1 and PlxnA2 F690N/E692S-mVenus exhibits much reduced FRET, with a longer 〈τ〉¯ (2.65 ns) and a lower fD¯ (0.07) (Figure 5AIV). These results demonstrate that the sema–PSI2-IPT2 interface indeed mediates PlxnAs cis-interactions at the cell surface (for a sample size of >52 cells, p < 0.001; Figures 5BI, 5BII, and 5BIV). After Sema6A stimulation, a representative cell co-expressing PlxnA2-mTFP1 and PlxnA2-mVenus showed a 〈τ〉¯ of 2.55 ns and an fD¯ of 0.16 (Figure 5AIII). Similarly, a cell co-expressing PlxnA2 F690N/E692S-mTFP1 and PlxnA2 F690N/E692S-mVenus showed a level of FRET as high as the wild-type PlxnA2 (〈τ〉¯ = 2.54 ns and fD¯ = 0.16) (Figure 5AV). These results (identical values of fD¯ = 0.16 ± 0.03 for >52 cells; Figures 5BIII and 5BV) point to increased dimerization of both wild-type and mutant PlxnA2s on ligand binding. In sum, our fluorescent microscopy-based experiments show compelling evidence for PlxnA cis-interactions mediated by the sema–PSI2-IPT2 interface occurring on the cell s"

Here we describe the engineering of an organotypic colon cancer model by recellularization of a native human matrix that contains cell-populated mucosa and an intact muscularis mucosa layer. This ex vivo system recapitulates the pathophysiological progression from APC-mutant neoplasia to submucosal invasive tumor. We used it to perform a Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis screen to identify genes that cooperate with mutant APC in driving invasive neoplasia. We identified 38 candidate invasion-driver genes, 17 of which, including TCF7L2, TWIST2, MSH2, DCC, EPHB1 and EPHB2 have been previously implicated in colorectal cancer progression. Six invasion-driver genes that have not, to our knowledge, been previously described were validated in vitro using cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays and ex vivo using recellularized human colon. These results demonstrate the utility of our organoid model for studying cancer biology."

Birdsong is an elaborate, temporally precise, and stereotyped vocal behavior controlled by a network of forebrain and brainstem nuclei. An influential idea is that song premotor neurons in a forebrain nucleus (HVC) form a synaptic chain that dictates song timing in a top-down manner. Here we combine physiological, dynamical, and computational methods to show that song timing is not generated solely by a mechanism localized to HVC but instead is the product of a distributed and recurrent synaptic network spanning the forebrain and brainstem, of which HVC is a component."

We report the crystal structure of a pistol ribozyme termed env25, which adopts a compact tertiary architecture stabilized by an embedded pseudoknot fold. The G-U cleavage site adopts a splayed-apart conformation with in-line alignment of the modeled 2'-O of G for attack on the adjacent to-be-cleaved P-O5' bond. Highly conserved residues G40 (N1 position) and A32 (N3 and 2'-OH positions) are aligned to act as a general base and a general acid, respectively, to accelerate cleavage chemistry, with their roles confirmed by cleavage assays on variants, and an increased pKa of 4.7 for A32. Our structure of the pistol ribozyme defined how the overall and local topologies dictate the in-line alignment at the G-U cleavage site, with cleavage assays on variants revealing key residues that participate in acid-base-catalyzed cleavage chemistry."

The aim of this study was to assess and interpret sexual dimorphisms for three major adverse pregnancy outcomes which affect the health of the neonate, child and potentially adult.Retrospective population-based study of 574,358 South Australian singleton live births during 1981-2011. The incidence of three major adverse pregnancy outcomes [preterm birth (PTB), pregnancy induced hypertensive disorders (PIHD) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)] in relation to fetal sex was compared according to traditional and fetus-at-risk (FAR) approaches.The traditional approach showed male predominance for PTB [20-24 weeks: Relative Risk (RR) M/F 1.351, 95%-CI 1.274-1.445], spontaneous PTB [25-29 weeks: RR M/F 1.118, 95%-CI 1.044-1.197%], GDM [RR M/F 1.042, 95%-CI 1.011-1.074], overall PIHD [RR M/F 1.053, 95%-CI 1.034-1.072] and PIHD with term birth [RR M/F 1.074, 95%-CI 1.044-1.105]. The FAR approach showed that males were at increased risk for PTB [20-24 weeks: RR M/F 1.273, 95%-CI 1.087-1.490], for spontaneous PTB [25-29 weeks: RR M/F 1.269, 95%-CI 1.143-1.410] and PIHD with term birth [RR M/F 1.074, 95%-CI 1.044-1.105%]. The traditional approach demonstrated female predominance for iatrogenic PTB [25-29 weeks: RR M/F 0.857, 95%-CI 0.780-0.941] and PIHD associated with PTB [25-29 weeks: RR M/F 0.686, 95%-CI 0.581-0.811]. The FAR approach showed that females were at increased risk for PIHD with PTB [25-29 weeks: RR M/F 0.779, 95%-CI 0.648-0.937].This study confirms the presence of sexual dimorphisms and presents a coherent framework based on two analytical approaches to assess and interpret the sexual dimorphisms for major adverse pregnancy outcomes. The mechanisms by which these occur remain elusive, but sex differences in placental gene expression and function are likely to play a key role. Further research on sex differences in placental function and maternal adaptation to pregnancy is required to delineate the causal molecular mechanisms in sex-specific pregnancy outcome. Identifying these mechanisms may inform fetal sex specific tailored antenatal and neonatal care."
https://openalex.org/W2473802421,"Evolution of RNA aptamers that act allosterically by recognizing and stabilizing specific conformations, including active, inactive, and ligand-specific conformations of the GPCR β2-adrenergic receptor, bound to pharmacologically distinct ligands. G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands function by stabilizing multiple, functionally distinct receptor conformations. This property underlies the ability of 'biased agonists' to activate specific subsets of a given receptor's signaling profile. However, stabilizing distinct active GPCR conformations to enable structural characterization of mechanisms underlying GPCR activation remains difficult. These challenges have accentuated the need for receptor tools that allosterically stabilize and regulate receptor function through unique, previously unappreciated mechanisms. Here, using a highly diverse RNA library combined with advanced selection strategies involving state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, we identify RNA aptamers that bind a prototypical GPCR, the β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR). Using biochemical, pharmacological, and biophysical approaches, we demonstrate that these aptamers bind with nanomolar affinity at defined surfaces of the receptor, allosterically stabilizing active, inactive, and ligand-specific receptor conformations. The discovery of RNA aptamers as allosteric GPCR modulators significantly expands the diversity of ligands available to study the structural and functional regulation of GPCRs."

They further show that knockdown of Sin3a in developing mouse brain results in reduced cortical neurogenesis, altered neuronal identity and aberrant cortical projections, identifying this MeCP2-interacting protein as a key regulator of cortical development. Numerous genes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but their dysfunction is often poorly characterized. Here we identified dominant mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional repressor and MeCP2 interactor switch-insensitive 3 family member A (SIN3A; chromosome 15q24.2) in individuals who, in addition to mild intellectual disability and ASD, share striking features, including facial dysmorphisms, microcephaly and short stature. This phenotype is highly related to that of individuals with atypical 15q24 microdeletions, linking SIN3A to this microdeletion syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed subtle abnormalities, including corpus callosum hypoplasia and ventriculomegaly. Intriguingly, in vivo functional knockdown of Sin3a led to reduced cortical neurogenesis, altered neuronal identity and aberrant corticocortical projections in the developing mouse brain. Together, our data establish that haploinsufficiency of SIN3A is associated with mild syndromic intellectual disability and that SIN3A can be considered to be a key transcriptional regulator of cortical brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2461252756,"MUC13 is a transmembrane mucin glycoprotein that is over produced by many cancers, although its functions are not fully understood. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a key transcription factor promoting cancer cell survival, but therapeutically targeting this pathway has proved difficult because NF-κB has pleiotropic functions. Here, we report that MUC13 prevents colorectal cancer cell death by promoting two distinct pathways of NF-kB activation, consequently upregulating BCL-XL. MUC13 promoted tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation by interacting with TNFR1 and the E3 ligase, cIAP1, to increase ubiquitination of RIPK1. MUC13 also promoted genotoxin-induced NF-κB activation by increasing phosphorylation of ATM and SUMOylation of NF-κB essential modulator. Moreover, elevated expression of cytoplasmic MUC13 and NF-κB correlated with colorectal cancer progression and metastases. Our demonstration that MUC13 enhances NF-κB signaling in response to both TNF and DNA-damaging agents provides a new molecular target for specific inhibition of NF-κB activation. As proof of principle, silencing MUC13 sensitized colorectal cancer cells to killing by cytotoxic drugs and inflammatory signals and abolished chemotherapy-induced enrichment of CD133+ CD44+ cancer stem cells, slowed xenograft growth in mice, and synergized with 5-fluourouracil to induce tumor regression. Therefore, these data indicate that combining chemotherapy and MUC13 antagonism could improve the treatment of metastatic cancers."

Flashes are episodic, lasting ∼20 s, and may be unitary or repeated at ∼minute intervals at the same sites. Analysis of flash amplitudes suggests they represent the quantal product of one or more polyribosomes, while inter-flash intervals appear random, suggesting they arise from a stochastic process. Surprisingly, glutamate-induced translation is dependent on Arc open reading frame. Combined observations support a model in which stalled ribosomes are reactivated to rapidly generate Arc protein."

Here we show that at this synapse in the somatosensory cortex of 2- to 3-week-old rats and mice, postsynaptic, not presynaptic NMDARs are required for LTD induction. First, we find no evidence for functional NMDARs in L4 neuron axons using two-photon laser scanning microscopy and two-photon glutamate uncaging.

Here we show that following TGF-β-mediated EMT, sustained TGF-β treatment leads to proteolytic degradation of Dab2 by cathepsin B (CTSB), loss of the mesenchymal phenotype and induction of autophagy. CTSB inhibition or expression of a CTSB-resistant Dab2 mutant maintains Dab2 expression and shifts long-term TGF-β-treated cells from autophagy to apoptosis. We further show that Dab2 interacts with Beclin-1 to promote casein-kinase-2-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin-1, preventing Beclin-1–Vps34 interaction and subsequent autophagosome assembly. Thus, CTSB-mediated degradation of Dab2 allows Beclin-1–Vps34 induction of autophagy, whereas sustained Dab2 expression prevents autophagy and promotes apoptosis by stabilizing the pro-apoptotic Bim protein. In vivo studies suggest that Dab2-mediated regulation of autophagy modulates chemotherapeutic resistance and tumour metastasis. Jiang et al. show that Disabled-2 (Dab2) regulates the switch between autophagy and apoptosis in TGB-β-treated cells, through regulation of the Beclin-1–Vps34 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2474276627,"Background Poor nutritional status is associated with progression and advanced disease in patients with cancer. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) may represent a simple method of assessing host immunonutritional status. This study was designed to investigate the prognostic value of the PNI for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods A training cohort of 1,168 patients with non-metastatic NPC from two institutions was retrospectively analyzed. The optimal PNI cutoff value for DMFS was identified using the online tool “Cutoff Finder”. DMFS was analyzed using stratified and adjusted analysis. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed to balance baseline characteristics between the high and low PNI groups. Subsequently, the prognostic value of the PNI for DMFS was validated in an external validation cohort of 756 patients with NPC. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was calculated to compare the discriminatory ability of different prognostic scores. Results The optimal PNI cutoff value was determined to be 51. Low PNI was significantly associated with poorer DMFS than high PNI in univariate analysis (P<0.001) as well as multivariate analysis (P<0.001) before propensity score matching. In subgroup analyses, PNI could also stratify different risks of distant metastases. Propensity score-matched analyses confirmed the prognostic value of PNI, excluding other interpretations and selection bias. In the external validation cohort, patients with high PNI also had significantly lower risk of distant metastases than those with low PNI (Hazards Ratios, 0.487; P<0.001). The PNI consistently showed a higher AUC value at 1-year (0.780), 3-year (0.793) and 5-year (0.812) in comparison with other prognostic scores. Conclusion PNI, an inexpensive and easily assessable inflammatory index, could aid clinicians in developing individualized treatment and follow-up strategies for patients with non-metastatic NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2460753863,"Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical event in metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Rho/ROCKs signaling has a pivotal role in orchestrating actin cytoskeleton, leading to EMT and cancer invasion. However, the underlying mechanisms for ROCKs activation are not fully understood. Here, we identified FOXM1D, a novel isoform of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) that has a pivotal role in ROCKs activation by directly interacting with coiled-coil region of ROCK2. FOXM1D overexpression significantly polymerizes actin assembly and impairs E-cadherin expression, resulting in EMT and metastasis in xenograft mouse model and knockdown of FOXM1D has the opposite effect. Moreover, a high FOXM1D level correlates closely with clinical CRC metastasis. FOXM1D-induced ROCKs activation could be abrogated by the ROCKs inhibitors Y-27632 and fasudil. These observations indicate that the FOXM1D–ROCK2 interaction is crucial for Rho/ROCKs signaling and provide novel insight into actin cytoskeleton regulation and therapeutic potential for CRC metastasis."

Formation of biofilms on the membrane surface is the suggested cause, yet little is known of the composition or dynamics of the microbial community responsible. To gain an insight into this important question, we applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with a curated taxonomy and fluorescent in situ hybridization to monitor the community of a pilot-scale MBR carrying out enhanced biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal with municipal wastewater. In order to track the dynamics of the fouling process, we concurrently investigated the communities of the biofilm, MBR bulk sludge, and the conventional activated sludge system used to seed the MBR system over several weeks from start-up. As the biofilm matured the initially abundant betaproteobacterial genera Limnohabitans, Hydrogenophaga and Malikia were succeeded by filamentous Chloroflexi and Gordonia as the abundant species. This study indicates that, although putative pioneer species appear, the biofilm became increasingly similar to the bulk community with time. This suggests that the microbial population in bulk water will largely determine the community structure of the mature biofilm."

In total, 50% of the subjects were assigned randomly to the development dataset and 50% were assigned to the validation dataset. Clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were assessed at the biennial health check. Data on osteoporotic fractures during the follow-up period were identified by ICD-10 codes and the nationwide database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Results During the follow-up period, 19,840 osteoporotic fractures were reported (4,889 in men and 14,951 in women) in the development dataset. The assessment tool called the Korean Fracture Risk Score (KFRS) is comprised of a set of nine variables, including age, body mass index, recent fragility fracture, current smoking, high alcohol intake, lack of regular exercise, recent use of oral glucocorticoid, rheumatoid arthritis, and other causes of secondary osteoporosis. The KFRS predicted osteoporotic fractures over the 7 years. This score was validated using an independent dataset. A close relationship with overall fracture rate was observed when we compared the mean predicted scores after applying the KFRS with the observed risks after 7 years within each 10th of predicted risk. Conclusion We developed a Korean specific prediction model for osteoporotic fractures. The KFRS was able to predict risk of fracture in the primary population without bone mineral density testing and is therefore suitable for use in both clinical setting and self-assessment.

https://openalex.org/W2464206660,"Capsicum chlorosis virus (CaCV) is an emerging pathogen of capsicum, tomato and peanut crops in Australia and South-East Asia. Commercial capsicum cultivars with CaCV resistance are not yet available, but CaCV resistance identified in Capsicum chinense is being introgressed into commercial Bell capsicum. However, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms leading to the resistance response to CaCV infection is limited. Therefore, transcriptome and expression profiling data provide an important resource to better understand CaCV resistance mechanisms.We assembled capsicum transcriptomes and analysed gene expression using Illumina HiSeq platform combined with a tag-based digital gene expression system. Total RNA extracted from CaCV/mock inoculated CaCV resistant (R) and susceptible (S) capsicum at the time point when R line showed a strong hypersensitive response to CaCV infection was used in transcriptome assembly. Gene expression profiles of R and S capsicum in CaCV- and buffer-inoculated conditions were compared. None of the genes were differentially expressed (DE) between R and S cultivars when mock-inoculated, while 2484 genes were DE when inoculated with CaCV. Functional classification revealed that the most highly up-regulated DE genes in R capsicum included pathogenesis-related genes, cell death-associated genes, genes associated with hormone-mediated signalling pathways and genes encoding enzymes involved in synthesis of defense-related secondary metabolites. We selected 15 genes to confirm DE expression levels by real-time quantitative PCR.DE transcript profiling data provided comprehensive gene expression information to gain an understanding of the underlying CaCV resistance mechanisms. Further, we identified candidate CaCV resistance genes in the CaCV-resistant C. annuum x C. chinense breeding line. This knowledge will be useful in future for fine mapping of the CaCV resistance locus and potential genetic engineering of resistance into CaCV-susceptible crops."
https://openalex.org/W2470860799,"The bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria 85–10 (Xcv) translocates about 30 type-3 effector proteins (T3Es) into pepper plants (Capsicum annuum) to suppress plant immune responses. Among them is XopB which interferes with PTI, ETI and sugar-mediated defence responses, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and direct targets are unknown so far. Here, we examined the XopB-mediated suppression of plant defence responses in more detail. Infection of susceptible pepper plants with Xcv lacking xopB resulted in delayed symptom development compared to Xcv wild type infection concomitant with an increased formation of salicylic acid (SA) and expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Expression of xopB in Arabidopsis thaliana promoted the growth of the virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 strain. This was paralleled by a decreased SA-pool and a lower induction of SA-dependent PR gene expression. The expression pattern of early flg22-responsive marker genes indicated that MAPK signalling was not altered in the presence of XopB. However, XopB inhibited the flg22-triggered burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, the transcript accumulation of AtOXI1, a ROS-dependent marker gene, was reduced in xopB-expressing Arabidopsis plants as well as callose deposition. The lower ROS production correlated with a low level of basal and flg22-triggered expression of apoplastic peroxidases and the NADPH oxidase RBOHD. Conversely, deletion of xopB in Xcv caused a higher production of ROS in leaves of susceptible pepper plants. Together our results demonstrate that XopB modulates ROS responses and might thereby compromise plant defence."
https://openalex.org/W2468488368,"Background The aim of this study is to identify independent pre-transplant cancer risk factors after kidney transplantation and to assess the utility of G-chart analysis for clinical process control. This may contribute to the improvement of cancer surveillance processes in individual transplant centers. Patients and Methods 1655 patients after kidney transplantation at our institution with a total of 9,425 person-years of follow-up were compared retrospectively to the general German population using site-specific standardized-incidence-ratios (SIRs) of observed malignancies. Risk-adjusted multivariable Cox regression was used to identify independent pre-transplant cancer risk factors. G-chart analysis was applied to determine relevant differences in the frequency of cancer occurrences. Results Cancer incidence rates were almost three times higher as compared to the matched general population (SIR = 2.75; 95%-CI: 2.33–3.21). Significantly increased SIRs were observed for renal cell carcinoma (SIR = 22.46), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (SIR = 8.36), prostate cancer (SIR = 2.22), bladder cancer (SIR = 3.24), thyroid cancer (SIR = 10.13) and melanoma (SIR = 3.08). Independent pre-transplant risk factors for cancer-free survival were age <52.3 years (p = 0.007, Hazard ratio (HR): 0.82), age >62.6 years (p = 0.001, HR: 1.29), polycystic kidney disease other than autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (p = 0.001, HR: 0.68), high body mass index in kg/m2 (p<0.001, HR: 1.04), ADPKD (p = 0.008, HR: 1.26) and diabetic nephropathy (p = 0.004, HR = 1.51). G-chart analysis identified relevant changes in the detection rates of cancer during aftercare with no significant relation to identified risk factors for cancer-free survival (p<0.05). Conclusions Risk-adapted cancer surveillance combined with prospective G-chart analysis likely improves cancer surveillance schemes by adapting processes to identified risk factors and by using G-chart alarm signals to trigger Kaizen events and audits for root-cause analysis of relevant detection rate changes. Further, comparative G-chart analysis would enable benchmarking of cancer surveillance processes between centers."

https://openalex.org/W2471068052,"The Profile of Music Perception Skills (PROMS) is a recently developed measure of perceptual music skills which has been shown to have promising psychometric properties. In this paper we extend the evaluation of its brief version to three kinds of validity using an individual difference approach. The brief PROMS displays good discriminant validity with working memory, given that it does not correlate with backward digit span (r = .04). Moreover, it shows promising criterion validity (association with musical training (r = .45), musicianship status (r = .48), and self-rated musical talent (r = .51)). Finally, its convergent validity, i.e. relation to an unrelated measure of music perception skills, was assessed by correlating the brief PROMS to harmonic closure judgment accuracy. Two independent samples point to good convergent validity of the brief PROMS (r = .36; r = .40). The same association is still significant in one of the samples when including self-reported music skill in a partial correlation (rpartial = .30; rpartial = .17). Overall, the results show that the brief version of the PROMS displays a very good pattern of construct validity. Especially its tuning subtest stands out as a valuable part for music skill evaluations in Western samples. We conclude by briefly discussing the choice faced by music cognition researchers between different musical aptitude measures of which the brief PROMS is a well evaluated example."
https://openalex.org/W2460314305,"Bcl-xL proteins undergo dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on Ser49 and Ser62 residues during mitosis. The expression of Bcl-xL(S49A), (S62A) and dual (S49/62A) phosphorylation mutants in tumor cells lead to severe mitotic defects associated with multipolar spindle, chromosome lagging and bridging, and micro-, bi- and multi-nucleated cells. Because the above observations were made in tumor cells which already display genomic instability, we now address the question: will similar effects occur in normal human diploid cells? We studied normal human diploid BJ foreskin fibroblast cells expressing Bcl-xL (wild type), (S49A), (S49D), (S62A), (S62D) and the dual-site (S49/62A) and (S49/62D) mutants. Cells expressing S49 and/or S62 phosphorylation mutants showed reduced kinetics of cell population doubling. These effects on cell population doubling kinetics correlated with early outbreak of senescence with no impact on the cell death rate. Senescent cells displayed typical senescence-associated phenotypes including high-level of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, tumor suppressor p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 activation as well as γH2A.X-associated nuclear chromatin foci. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and Giemsa-banded karyotypes revealed that the expression of Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutants in normal diploid BJ cells provoked chromosome instability and aneuploidy. These findings suggest that dynamic Bcl-xL(S49) and (S62) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles are important in the maintenance of chromosome integrity during mitosis in normal cells. They could impact future strategies aiming to develop and identify compounds that could target not only the anti-apoptotic domain of Bcl-xL protein, but also its mitotic domain for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2461308742,"Here, we report the results of a large-scale PCR survey on the prevalence and diversity of adenoviruses (AdVs) in samples collected randomly from free-living reptiles. On the territories of the Guadarrama Mountains National Park in Central Spain and of the Chafarinas Islands in North Africa, cloacal swabs were taken from 318 specimens of eight native species representing five squamate reptilian families. The healthy-looking animals had been captured temporarily for physiological and ethological examinations, after which they were released. We found 22 AdV-positive samples in representatives of three species, all from Central Spain. Sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed the existence of three hitherto unknown AdVs in 11 Carpetane rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni), nine Iberian worm lizards (Blanus cinereus), and two Iberian green lizards (Lacerta schreiberi), respectively. Phylogeny inference showed every novel putative virus to be a member of the genus Atadenovirus. This is the very first description of the occurrence of AdVs in amphisbaenian and lacertid hosts. Unlike all squamate atadenoviruses examined previously, two of the novel putative AdVs had A+T rich DNA, a feature generally deemed to mirror previous host switch events. Our results shed new light on the diversity and evolution of atadenoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2464082196,"Language acquisition is based on our knowledge about the world and forms through multiple sensory-motor interactions with the environment. We link the properties of individual experience formed at different stages of ontogeny with the phased development of sensory modalities and with the acquisition of words describing the appropriate forms of sensitivity. To test whether early-formed experience related to skin sensations, olfaction and taste differs from later-formed experience related to vision and hearing, we asked Russian-speaking participants to categorize or to assess the pleasantness of experience mentally reactivated by sense-related adjectives found in common dictionaries. It was found that categorizing adjectives in relation to vision, hearing and skin sensations took longer than categorizing adjectives in relation to olfaction and taste. In addition, experience described by adjectives predominantly related to vision, hearing and skin sensations took more time for the pleasantness judgment and generated less intense emotions than that described by adjectives predominantly related to olfaction and taste. Interestingly the dynamics of skin resistance corresponded to the intensity and pleasantness of reported emotions. We also found that sense-related experience described by early-acquired adjectives took less time for the pleasantness judgment and generated more intense and more positive emotions than that described by later-acquired adjectives. Correlations were found between the time of the pleasantness judgment of experience, intensity and pleasantness of reported emotions, age of acquisition, frequency, imageability and length of sense-related adjectives. All in all these findings support the hypothesis that early-formed experience is less differentiated than later-formed experience."

Because of national interest in the “graying” of the biomedical workforce, we examine aging and funding within the pool of NIH-funded investigators and applicants, particularly in the growing field of stem cell research. We provide evidence of a maturing and more competitive stem cell workforce and discuss policy implications. The biomedical research workforce is aging. This well-known fact has been discussed by NIH leadership (https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/03/25/age-of-investigator/ and https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/02/13/age-distribution-of-nih-principal-investigators-and-medical-school-faculty/), members of Congress (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/opinion/young-brilliant-and-underfunded.html?_r=2), and extensively within extramural research communities throughout the United States (Butz, 2004Butz W.P. Will the scientific and technical workforce meet the requirements of the federal government?. RAND Office of Science and Technology Policy, Santa Monica, CA2004Google Scholar, DeLong, 2004DeLong D.W.

Auerbach D.I. JAMA. 2000; 283: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Management experts have spent the past few decades discussing the aging U.S. workforce and important topics such as the critical role of knowledge transfer (Calo, 2008Calo T.J. Public Pers. Manage. 2008; 37: 403-416Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Rappaport et al., 2003Rappaport A. Bancroft E. Okum L. Journal of Organizational Excellence. 2003; 23: 55-66Crossref Google Scholar). While national discussions take place on the aging and funding of the entire biomedical research workforce, we know little about trends within subspecialties. To help understand broad overarching themes, as well as more specialized area trends, we focus on NIH investigators in general and those engaged specifically in stem cell research (see Supplemental Information for detailed explanations of criteria for our analysis). Our preliminary analysis suggests that the collective aging of the NIH-funded independent investigator workforce is not solely the product of any policy or mechanism. Rather, it is an accumulation of multiple factors including a shift in perceptions, expectations, and the general structure of the extramural workforce, as well as global macroeconomic factors. Based on a comparison of the ratio of award to applicants by age group, we find no clear evidence that the NIH-funded independent investigator workforce is aging solely because of competitiveness in a limited resource market. While the funding and purchasing power of NIH research grants have fluctuated over time for all NIH-funded research, the proportion or rate of applicants funded during times of limited resources (e.g., post-2003) is relatively similar in older applicants compared to younger ones. Table 1 (All Researchers) and Figure 1 (All Researchers) highlight this fact. While age and experience may be correlated, Mincer, 1974Mincer J.A. Age and experience profiles of earnings.in: Mincer J.A. Schooling, Experience, and Earnings. Columbia University Press, 1974: 64-82Google Scholar showed that experience influences income and returns to education more than age. The same might be true for other sources of income, particularly funding for one’s research. If age does imply more experience, as funding restricts, we would expect to see a higher proportion of older established investigators funded. We do not see this, which could imply that experience is not highly correlated with age, that experience is more of a predictor of scientific funding than age, or that specific policies focused on early-stage investigators is mitigating some of the effect, among other possible reasons.Table 1NIH Funding Rates for Independent Investigators (R01-Equivalent) by Type of Research and Age Group, 1980–2014Age Group198019902000200520102014Stem Cell Researchers<35——ˆˆˆˆ35–39——100.017.418.421.640–44——100.030.716.718.345–49——100.036.917.117.650–54——100.023.218.413.755–59——ˆ28.617.613.460–64——ˆ23.326.513.965–69——ˆˆ16.320.970+——ˆˆˆ18.1TOTAL——100.028.917.816.5All Researchers<3546.129.728.024.222.319.235–3948.729.934.424.627.324.840–4448.833.135.626.025.923.645–4950.934.237.628.525.222.950–5452.432.439.428.327.623.755–5953.734.438.428.527.324.560–6445.034.736.926.929.025.165–6951.331.136.125.925.723.070+ˆ33.330.926.422.422.6TOTAL49.032.336.627.226.523.7(ˆ), not reported due to small cell size.

For NIH overall, funding rates were relatively similar among age groups during the period we examined. However, the number of both awardees and applicants grew at a faster rate in older age groups than in younger age groups between 2005 and 2014. Stem cell research is a relatively new field within the almost century-long history of NIH-funded scientific research. In stem cell research, NIH R01-equivalent investigator applicants who were aged 60 to 64 grew by almost 5-fold (469.8%) between 2005 and 2014, with awardees increasing by more than 2-fold during that time period (240.0% growth, Figure 1). For all of NIH, the growth in investigator applicants between 2005 and 2014 for the same age group was 39.9% (with 30.4% growth in awardees Figure 1). Applicant growth rates for both stem cell and all research over the same period was greatest for those aged 70 plus (554.5% and 110.1% respectively, Figure 1). While the growth in applicants was fastest in the older age groups, the NIH-funded stem cell research workforce also saw growth in the number of principal investigators under age 50 between 2005 and 2014. The number of investigators funded grew by 80.4% for those aged 40–44 and 32.8% for those aged 45–49 (Figure 1). The number of all NIH R01-equivalent awardees during that same period shrunk by 9.5% for those aged 40–44 and by 22.2% for those aged 45 to 49 (Figure 1). In the 1980s, more individuals under the age of 40 applied for an R01-equivalent award than today, and, over the years, the number of awardees and applicants under age 40 has decreased (Figure S1B). For investigators under age 40, gender differences in both application and award exist over time. Fewer male investigators under age 40 apply now for R01-equivalent grants compared to the 1980s and 1990s (Figure S1B) and, in tandem, are receiving fewer awards. Women under age 40, however, have increased their applications since 1980 and the number awarded has remained relatively stable. For stem cell researchers, the field is relatively new and the number of independent investigators under age 40 grew during the period from 2000 to 2010 (Figure S1A). The number of applicants under 40 declined between 2010 and 2014 for both men and women. However, the number of awardees increased slightly during that time period for women, while declining slightly for men. Along with a major expansion of the stem cell research workforce over the past few decades, there has been a decrease in funding rates (Table 1). As the field grew and expanded, competition increased. In 2000, NIH funded all stem cell research applications submitted. By 2005, the NIH funded only about one-third of all proposed stem cell research projects, and, by 2014, it funded only one-sixth of proposals. The funding rates for stem cell researchers today are more competitive than the entire NIH research workforce pool where in 2014 NIH funded around one in four R01-equivalent investigators overall (Table 1)."
https://openalex.org/W2467523820,"An experience oriented-convergence improved gravitational search algorithm (ECGSA) based on two new modifications, searching through the best experiments and using of a dynamic gravitational damping coefficient (α), is introduced in this paper. ECGSA saves its best fitness function evaluations and uses those as the agents' positions in searching process. In this way, the optimal found trajectories are retained and the search starts from these trajectories, which allow the algorithm to avoid the local optimums. Also, the agents can move faster in search space to obtain better exploration during the first stage of the searching process and they can converge rapidly to the optimal solution at the final stage of the search process by means of the proposed dynamic gravitational damping coefficient. The performance of ECGSA has been evaluated by applying it to eight standard benchmark functions along with six complicated composite test functions. It is also applied to adaptive beamforming problem as a practical issue to improve the weight vectors computed by minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming technique. The results of implementation of the proposed algorithm are compared with some well-known heuristic methods and verified the proposed method in both reaching to optimal solutions and robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2470590065,"The effects of spiramycin on adipogenesis and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity were investigated. Potential mechanisms contributing to these effects were elucidated. The inhibitory effect of spiramycin on adipocyte differentiation was assessed using 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, in which several parameters involved in AMPK signal pathways and lipid metabolism were examined. To further investigate the pharmacological effects of spiramycin in vivo, we examined several obesity-related parameters in HFD-induced obese mice. Spiramycin significantly inhibited preadipocyte differentiation by attenuating intracellular lipid accumulation. Spiramycin also reduced the expression of adipogenic master regulators (PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP1c) and their downstream target genes (FAS, aP2, and GLUT4) in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, AMPK phosphorylation was increased by spiramycin treatment in 3T3-L1 cells during early differentiation. Notably, HFD-induced obese mice administered spiramycin showed substantial decreases in body weight gain, serum leptin levels, adipose tissue mass, and hepatic lipid accumulation. Moreover, the decreased levels of GPT and GOT in the serum indicated that spiramycin attenuated hepatic injury caused by HFD. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that spiramycin effectively attenuates HFD-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis by inhibiting adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2463961791,"A new HA/ZrO2-based porous bioceramic artificial vertebral body (AVB), carried a recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2)/chitosan slow-release hydrogel was prepared to repair vertebral bone defect in beagles. An ionic cross-linking was used to prepare the chitosan hydrogel (CS gel) as the rhBMP-2 slow-release carrier. The vertebral body defects were implanted with the rhBMP-2-loaded AVB in group A, or a non-drug-loaded AVB in group B, or autologous iliac in group C. The encapsulation rate of rhBMP-2 in rhBMP-2-loaded CS gel was 91.88±1.53%, with a drug load of 39.84±2.34 ng/mg. At 6, 12, 24 weeks postoperatively, radiography showed that the bone calluses gradually increased with time in group A, where the artificial vertebral body had completely fused with host-bone at 24 weeks after surgery. In group C, an apparent bone remodeling was occurred in the early stages, and the graft-bone and host-bone had also fused completely at 24 weeks postoperatively. In group B, fusion occurred less than in groups A and C. At 24 weeks after surgery, micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) revealed that the volume of newly-formed bone in group A was significantly more than in group B (p<0.05). At 24 weeks after surgery, ultra-compressive strengths of the operated segments were 14.03±1.66 MPa in group A, 8.62±1.24 MPa in group B, and 13.78±1.43 MPa in group C. Groups A and C were both significantly higher than group B (p < 0.05). At 24 weeks postoperatively, the hard tissue sections showed that the AVB of group A had tightly fused with host bone, and that pores of the AVB had been filled with abundant nearly mature bone, and that the new bone structured similarly to a trabecular framework, which was similar to that in group C. In contrast, implant fusion of the AVB in group B was not as apparent as group A. In conclusion, the novel HA/ZrO2-based porous bioceramic AVB carried the rhBMP-2-loaded CS gel can promote the repair of bony defect, and induce bone tissue to grow into the pores, which may replace iliac bone grafts as commonly applied in clinical practice."

https://openalex.org/W2467728088,"Background Exenatide’s effects on glucose metabolism have been studied extensively in diabetes but not in pre-diabetes. Objective We examined the chronic effects of exenatide alone on glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic canines. Design and Methods After 10 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD), adult dogs received one injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 18.5 mg/kg). After induction of pre-diabetes, while maintained on HFD, animals were randomized to receive either exenatide (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) for 12 weeks. β-Cell function was calculated from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT, expressed as the acute insulin response, AIRG), the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, insulinogenic index) and the graded-hyperglycemic clamp (clamp insulinogenic index). Whole-body insulin sensitivity was assessed by the IVGTT. At the end of the study, pancreatic islets were isolated to assess β-cell function in vitro. Results OGTT: STZ caused an increase in glycemia at 120 min by 22.0% (interquartile range, IQR, 31.5%) (P = 0.011). IVGTT: This protocol also showed a reduction in glucose tolerance by 48.8% (IQR, 36.9%) (P = 0.002). AIRG decreased by 54.0% (IQR, 40.7%) (P = 0.010), leading to mild fasting hyperglycemia (P = 0.039). Exenatide, compared with placebo, decreased body weight (P<0.001) without altering food intake, fasting glycemia, insulinemia, glycated hemoglobin A1c, or glucose tolerance. Exenatide, compared with placebo, increased both OGTT- (P = 0.040) and clamp-based insulinogenic indexes (P = 0.016), improved insulin secretion in vitro (P = 0.041), but had no noticeable effect on insulin sensitivity (P = 0.405). Conclusions In pre-diabetic canines, 12-week exenatide treatment improved β-cell function but not glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. These findings demonstrate partial beneficial metabolic effects of exenatide alone on an animal model of pre-diabetes."
