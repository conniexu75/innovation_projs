https://openalex.org/W2036733217,"We report the production of matter-wave solitons in an ultracold lithium-7 gas. The effective interaction between atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate is tuned with a Feshbach resonance from repulsive to attractive before release in a one-dimensional optical waveguide. Propagation of the soliton without dispersion over a macroscopic distance of 1.1 millimeter is observed. A simple theoretical model explains the stability region of the soliton. These matter-wave solitons open possibilities for future applications in coherent atom optics, atom interferometry, and atom transport."

We show that VDR also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA), which is hepatotoxic and a potential enteric carcinogen. VDR is an order of magnitude more sensitive to LCA and its metabolites than are other nuclear receptors. Activation of VDR by LCA or vitamin D induced expression in vivo of CYP3A, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that detoxifies LCA in the liver and intestine. These studies offer a mechanism that may explain the proposed protective effects of vitamin D and its receptor against colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2065238464,"Reversible electrochemical injection of discrete numbers of electrons into sterically stabilized silicon nanocrystals (NCs) (∼2 to 4 nanometers in diameter) was observed by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in N , N ′-dimethylformamide and acetonitrile. The electrochemical gap between the onset of electron injection and hole injection—related to the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals—grew with decreasing nanocrystal size, and the DPV peak potentials above the onset for electron injection roughly correspond to expected Coulomb blockade or quantized double-layer charging energies. Electron transfer reactions between positively and negatively charged nanocrystals (or between charged nanocrystals and molecular redox-active coreactants) occurred that led to electron and hole annihilation, producing visible light. The electrogenerated chemiluminescence spectra exhibited a peak maximum at 640 nanometers, a significant red shift from the photoluminescence maximum (420 nanometers) of the same silicon NC solution. These results demonstrate that the chemical stability of silicon NCs could enable their use as redox-active macromolecular species with the combined optical and charging properties of semiconductor quantum dots."

We present a model that offers an explanation of social network searchability in terms of recognizable personal identities: sets of characteristics measured along a number of social dimensions. Our model defines a class of searchable networks and a method for searching them that may be applicable to many network search problems, including the location of data files in peer-to-peer networks, pages on the World Wide Web, and information in distributed databases."
https://openalex.org/W2166293484,"RNA silencing is a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism that is operational in plants and animals. Here, we show that flock house virus (FHV) is both an initiator and a target of RNA silencing in Drosophila host cells and that FHV infection requires suppression of RNA silencing by an FHV-encoded protein, B2. These findings establish RNA silencing as an adaptive antiviral defense in animal cells. B2 also inhibits RNA silencing in transgenic plants, providing evidence for a conserved RNA silencing pathway in the plant and animal kingdoms."
https://openalex.org/W2143641256,"The crystal structure of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase holoenzyme (α 2 ββ′ωσ A ) complexed with a fork-junction promoter DNA fragment has been determined by fitting high-resolution x-ray structures of individual components into a 6.5-angstrom resolution map. The DNA lies across one face of the holoenzyme, completely outside the RNA polymerase active site channel. All sequence-specific contacts with core promoter elements are mediated by the σ subunit. A universally conserved tryptophan is ideally positioned to stack on the exposed face of the base pair at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble. Universally conserved basic residues of the σ subunit provide critical contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone and play a role in directing the melted DNA template strand into the RNA polymerase active site. The structure explains how holoenzyme recognizes promoters containing variably spaced –10 and –35 elements and provides the basis for models of the closed and open promoter complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2073865971,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been found to have roles in a great variety of processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromosome replication, RNA processing and modification, messenger RNA stability and translation, and even protein degradation and translocation. Recent studies indicate that ncRNAs are far more abundant and important than initially imagined. These findings raise several fundamental questions: How many ncRNAs are encoded by a genome? Given the absence of a diagnostic open reading frame, how can these genes be identified? How can all the functions of ncRNAs be elucidated?"
https://openalex.org/W1989380134,"The crystal structure of the initiating form of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase, containing core RNA polymerase (alpha2betabeta'omega) and the promoter specificity sigma subunit, has been determined at 4 angstrom resolution. Important structural features of the RNA polymerase and their roles in positioning sigma within the initiation complex are delineated, as well as the role played by sigma in modulating the opening of the RNA polymerase active-site channel. The two carboxyl-terminal domains of sigma are separated by 45 angstroms on the surface of the RNA polymerase, but are linked by an extended loop. The loop winds near the RNA polymerase active site, where it may play a role in initiating nucleotide substrate binding, and out through the RNA exit channel. The advancing RNA transcript must displace the loop, leading to abortive initiation and ultimately to sigma release."
https://openalex.org/W2160177582,"Genomes are databases sensitive to invasion by viruses. In recent years, a defense mechanism has been discovered, which turns out to be conserved among eukaryotes. The system can be compared to the immune system in several ways: It has specificity against foreign elements and the ability to amplify and raise a massive response against an invading nucleic acid. The latter property is beginning to be understood at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2115678473,"Double-stranded RNA can now be used in a wide variety of eukaryotes to suppress the expression of virtually any gene, allowing the rapid analysis of that gene's function, a technique known as RNA interference. But how cells use the information in double-stranded RNA to suppress gene expression and why they contain the machinery to do so remain the subjects of intense scrutiny. Current evidence suggests that RNA interference and other “RNA silencing” phenomena reflect an elaborate cellular apparatus that eliminates abundant but defective messenger RNAs and defends against molecular parasites such as transposons and viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1969603232,"PYRIN-containing Apaf1-like proteins (PYPAFs) are members of the nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (NBS/LRR) family of signal transduction proteins. We report here that PYPAF7 is a novel PYPAF protein that activates inflammatory signaling pathways. The expression of PYPAF7 is highly restricted to immune cells, and its gene maps to chromosome 19q13.4, a locus that contains a cluster of genes encoding numerous PYPAF family members. Co-expression of PYPAF7 with ASC results in the recruitment of PYPAF7 to distinct cytoplasmic loci and a potent synergistic activation of NF-κB. To identify other proteins involved in PYPAF7 and ASC signaling pathways, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid screen and identified pro-caspase-1 as a binding partner of ASC. Co-expression of PYPAF7 and ASC results in the synergistic activation of caspase-1 and a corresponding increase in secretion of interleukin-1β. In addition, PYPAF1 induces caspase-1-dependent cytokine processing when co-expressed with ASC.

Each family member contains an N-terminal protein-protein interaction domain that mediates assembly with a downstream signaling partner, a central NBS domain that regulates activation of the signaling complex, and a C-terminal LRR domain that likely functions as a binding site for specific upstream regulators. CARD4 (Nod1), Nod2 (CARD15), and CARD12 (Ipaf/Clan) are NBS/LRR family members that contain an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a protein-protein interaction domain that belongs to the death domain-fold superfamily (1Bertin J.

CARD12 also plays a role in inflammatory signaling by binding to and activating caspase-1, a CARD-containing caspase that processes pro-interleukin-1β and pro-interleukin-18 into biologically active cytokines. The upstream signals that regulate the assembly and activation of these NBS/LRR signaling complexes are not understood presently. We recently identified the PYRIN domain as a novel protein-protein interaction domain that shares homology with pyrin, a protein that causes the rare inflammatory disorder called familial Mediterranean fever (12Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1273-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the PYRIN domain is found at the N terminus of numerous NBS/LRR family members instead of a CARD domain. Because of the structural similarity to the apoptosis protein Apaf1, we have named these proteins PYPAFs forPYRIN-containing Apaf1-like proteins. Thus far, eight members of this NBS/LRR subfamily have been identified, including PYPAF1 (cryopyrin/NALP3), PYPAF2 (NBS1/NALP2), PYPAF3, PYPAF4 (PAN2/NALP4), PYPAF5, PYPAF6, MATER (PYPAF8), and CARD7 (NAC/DEFCAP/NALP1) (12Bertin J.

This domain likely mediates homotypic interactions between PYRIN-containing proteins, resulting in the formation of a complex that participates in signal transduction. Indeed, PYPAF1 was shown recently to assemble with the PYRIN-containing protein ASC and activate NF-κB signaling (18Manji G. Wang L. Geddes B. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M.

A role for PYPAF family members in inflammatory signaling is indicated by the recent finding that mutations within PYPAF1 are associated with Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, two genetically determined immune disorders that are similar to familial Mediterranean fever (19Hoffman H.M. Mueller J.L. Broide D.H. Wanderer A.A. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). We report here that PYPAF7 is a novel PYRIN-containing NBS/LRR protein that is recruited by ASC to distinct cytoplasmic loci. Co-expression of PYPAF7 and ASC results in the synergistic activation of NF-κB and caspase-1-dependent cytokine processing. These findings identify PYPAF7 as a novel regulator of inflammatory signal transduction pathways. Plasmids expressing either full-length PYPAF7 (PYPAF7-FL, residues 1–1061, accession number AY095146) or a PYPAF7 truncation mutant lacking the PYRIN domain (PYPAF7ΔPYRIN, residues 89–1061) with a C-terminal FLAG epitope were constructed using pCI (Promega).

Plasmids expressing mouse pro-IL-1β with a C-terminal FLAG epitope or human pro-caspase-1 with a C-terminal Myc epitope were constructed using pCI.

Total RNA from cells in culture was extracted (Qiagen), and expression profiles were determined by real time quantitative PCR analysis (Taqman™). In brief, an oligonucleotide probe (5′-TCCGCAGGAAATTCCGGCTCATG-3′) was designed to anneal to PYPAF7 between two PCR primers (forward, 5′-CCCAGGAAACCTACAGGGACTA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGCGCATTGCGGTCTT-3′). The probe was then fluorescently labeled with FAM (reporter dye) on the 5′-end and TAMRA (quencher dye) on the 3′-end. Probe and PCR primers designed for β2microglobulin were described previously (18Manji G. Wang L. Geddes B. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M. Briskin M. Jurman M. Cao J.

PCR reactions were performed on cDNAs from specific cell types using primers and probes for both PYPAF7 and β2 microglobulin genes. Fluorescent emissions generated during the PCR reaction were measured using a Sequence Detector 7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The expression level of PYPAF7 was normalized to the expression of β2 microglobulin for each sample. NF-κB and mammalian two-hybrid assays were described previously (22Wang L. Guo Y.

For mammalian two-hybrid assays, 293T cells were transfected with pCMV/AD and pCMV/BD plasmids, pFR-Luc firefly reporter (Stratagene), and pRL-TK Renilla reporter (Promega). For NF-κB assays, 293T cells were transfected with pNF-κB luciferase reporter (Stratagene), pRL-TK Renillareporter, and indicated expression plasmids. Cells were harvested, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). 293T cells were transfected in poly(d-lysine)-coated glass chamber slides (BioCoat, BD Labware) with plasmids expressing HA-tagged ASC and either FLAG-tagged PYPAF7 or PYPAF7ΔPYRIN using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and blocked in a buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated with the following primary and secondary antibodies: rabbit anti-HA polyclonal Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), Alexa-350 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and Alexa-598 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Images were generated as described previously (23Bertin J. Wang L. Guo Y. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J-L. Srinivasula S.M. Merriam S. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

COS-7L cells (Invitrogen) were co-transfected in 12-well (22-mm) plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) with plasmids encoding mouse pro-IL-1β and indicated expression plasmids (total DNA, 1.04 μg). Supernatants were collected 24 h after transfection and subjected to ELISA for mouse IL-1β according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems). The caspase-1 inhibitor z-WEHD-FMK was added to cells following transfection at a final concentration of 100 μm(R&D Systems). We searched the High Throughout Genome (HTG) data base of genomic sequences using the TBLASTN and GENESCAN programs and identified a novel PYPAF family member, which was designated PYPAF7 (Fig. 1A). PYPAF7 maps to chromosome 19q13.4, a locus that contains a cluster of genes that encode PYPAF family members including PYPAF2, PYPAF3, PYPAF4, PYPAF6, and MATER.2 A 3.8-kilobase cDNA corresponding to the predicted gene was isolated and found to encode a protein of 1061 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 120 kDa. A BLAST search of the protein data base revealed a tripartite domain structure consisting of an N-terminal PYRIN domain (residues 13–87), a central NBS domain (residues 212–528), and a C-terminal domain (residues 712–1061) comprised of at least 12 LRR motifs (Fig.1B). The NBS domain belongs to the NACHT subfamily of NTPases and contains seven signature motifs including the P-loop (residues 217–224, Fig. 1B) (24Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 223-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The PYRIN domain of PYPAF7 shares significant sequence similarity with the PYRIN domains of other PYRIN-containing proteins, including PYPAF1 (45% identity) and pyrin (33% identity) (Fig. 1C). Northern blot analysis using a multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH) showed PYPAF7 expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (data not shown). Little or no expression was detected in 75 other tissue and cancer cell lines, indicating a role for this protein in inflammatory signaling. To determine the cells that express PYPAF7, peripheral blood leukocytes were fractionated into distinct cell populations. Real time quantitative PCR analysis showed PYPAF7 to be expressed predominantly in eosinophils and granulocytes, with some expression in monocytes (Fig. 2).FIG. 2Expression of PYPAF7 mRNA.

We therefore performed cellular co-localization studies to examine interactions between PYPAF7 and ASC. FLAG-tagged PYPAF7 and HA-tagged ASC were co-expressed in cells and detected using a mixture of anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. When expressed alone, PYPAF7 (PYPAF7-FL) showed a broad cytoplasmic distribution that excluded the nucleus (Fig.3A). As observed previously, ASC localized to cytoplasmic punctate structures when expressed alone (data not shown) (26Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, when the two proteins were co-expressed, PYPAF7-FL was found to co-localize with ASC (Fig. 3, B–D). We also examined the ability of a PYPAF7 mutant lacking the N-terminal PYRIN domain (PYPAF7ΔPYRIN) to be recruited to the ASC punctate structures. When expressed alone, PYPAF7ΔPYRIN showed a broad cytoplasmic distribution similar to that of PYPAF7-FL (Fig. 3E). However, PYPAF7ΔPYRIN failed to associate with the ASC punctate structures, demonstrating that the PYRIN domain of PYPAF7 is necessary for recruitment (Fig. 3, F–H). We have been unable to detect an interaction between PYPAF7 and ASC by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments when both proteins are overexpressed in cells. Our inability to detect an interaction may be because of the relative insolubility of PYPAF7/ASC complexes that form in the cell when these proteins are co-expressed. Alternatively, the interaction between PYPAF7 and ASC may be transient, thereby precluding its detection by immunoprecipitation analysis. Nonetheless, the co-localization of PYPAF7 with ASC to cytoplasmic loci is required for the synergistic activation of NF-κB and caspase-1-dependent cytokine processing (see below). We next examined whether PYPAF7 and ASC participate in NF-κB signaling pathways using a luciferase reporter plasmid. Expression of PYPAF7 alone in cells failed to activate NF-κB at all protein levels examined (Fig. 4B, lane 3 and data not shown). In contrast, NF-κB was activated when high levels of ASC were expressed in cells (data not shown) (18Manji G. Wang L. Geddes B. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M. Briskin M. Jurman M. Cao J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 11570-11575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, when ASC was expressed at low protein levels that did not activate NF-κB, co-expression with increasing amounts of PYPAF7 resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in NF-κB activity (Fig. 4A). The N-terminal PYRIN domain of PYPAF7 was essential for NF-κB signaling because deletion of this domain (PYPAF7ΔPYRIN) eliminated the synergistic induction of NF-κB activity (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4 and 6). Immunoblot analysis revealed that ASC protein levels were not increased when co-expressed with PYPAF7, demonstrating that the activation of NF-κB was not caused by increased levels of ASC (Fig. 4B, upper panels). NF-κB signaling occurred through the IKK complex because dominant-negative versions of IKKγ and IKK2 blocked the ability of PYPAF7 to synergistically activate NF-κB (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). These data demonstrate that PYPAF7 is an activator of NF-κB signaling when co-expressed with ASC. ASC is comprised of an N-terminal PYRIN domain and a C-terminal CARD domain (26Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Ayukawa K. Sarvotham H. Kishino T. Niikawa N. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Higuchi T. Sagara J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33835-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The presence of a CARD domain in ASC suggests that a CARD-containing protein may be involved in PYPAF7 and ASC signaling. To identify CARD domains that interact with the CARD of ASC, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and screened for binding to the CARD domains of 22 family members (Fig.5A). The CARD domain of ASC was found to interact selectively with the CARD domain of pro-caspase-1, resulting in a 24-fold activation of luciferase activity (Fig. 5A). The CARD domain of CARD12 also interacted with the CARD domain of ASC as observed previously (Fig. 5A) (4Geddes B.J. Wang L. Huang W-J. Lavellee M. Manji G.A. Brown M. Jurman M. Cao J. Morgenstern J. Merriam S. Glucksmann M.A. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The PYRIN domain of ASC failed to interact with the CARD domain of pro-caspase-1, indicating that the CARD domain of ASC is both necessary and sufficient for binding (Fig. 5A). In addition, immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged ASC coprecipitated T7-tagged pro-caspase-1 (Fig. 5B). The amount of pro-caspase-1 that associates with ASC is low considering the high level of ASC that is expressed in the cell lysate. A difficulty in quantitatively coprecipitating proteins that associate with ASC has been reported in several studies (18Manji G. Wang L. Geddes B. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A. Mak S. Lora J.M.

Shelden E. Wadhwa A. Gumucio D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39320-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in cells, ASC self-associates via CARD-CARD and PYRIN-PYRIN interactions and forms insoluble aggregates. We speculate that the low levels of pro-caspase-1 found to associate with ASC are caused by the relative insolubility of ASC/pro-caspase-1 complexes that form in the cell when both proteins are overexpressed. Alternatively, the interaction between ASC and pro-caspase-1 may be transient and/or weak. Taken together, the mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation interaction studies suggest that ASC binds to pro-caspase-1 through its C-terminal CARD domain. Our finding that ASC interacts with pro-caspase-1 prompted us to examine whether PYPAF7 and ASC also play a role in caspase activation. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β, resulting in the release of IL-1β from cells. To measure the activation of pro-caspase-1, a transient transfection assay was used in which plasmids expressing pro-caspase-1 and mouse pro-IL-1β were transfected into COS-7L cells with plasmids encoding ASC and PYPAF7. In this assay, the amount of murine IL-1β released into the culture medium 1 day after transfection correlated with the amount of intracellular caspase-1 activity (27Lee S.H. Stehlik C. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We first examined whether ASC functions as an activator of pro-caspase-1. Co-expression of ASC and pro-caspase-1 resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the levels of secreted IL-1β (Fig. 6A). The induction of cytokine production by ASC was caspase-1-dependent because little or no IL-β was produced in the absence of plasmid encoding pro-caspase-1 (Fig.6A, lane 9). Moreover, ASC was unable to induce cytokine production when co-expressed with a caspase-1 active site mutant (C285A) that is unable to be processed and activated (Fig.6A, lane 8) (5Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Tnani M. Razmara M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We next examined whether PYPAF7 plays a role in pro-caspase-1 activation. When ASC was expressed at protein levels that resulted in low levels of caspase activity, co-expression with PYPAF7 resulted in a synergistic activation of pro-caspase-1 and a corresponding increase in IL-1β production (Fig.6B, compare lanes 5 and 6). The N-terminal PYRIN domain of PYPAF7 was essential for pro-caspase-1 activation because deletion of this domain (PYPAF7ΔPYRIN) eliminated the synergistic production of IL-1β (Fig. 6B, comparelanes 6 and 7). Immunoblot analysis revealed that PYPAF7ΔPYRIN was expressed at levels similar to that of PYPAF7, indicating that loss of function was not caused by reduced protein levels (data not shown). PYPAF7 and ASC were unable to synergistically induce cytokine expression when co-expressed with a caspase-1 active site mutant (C285A) (Fig. 6C, lane 4). Moreover, addition of a caspase-1 inhibitor (z-WEHD) blocked the ability of PYPAF7 and ASC to induce the secretion of IL-1β (Fig. 6C, lane 3). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PYPAF7 and ASC synergistically activate pro-caspase-1. We also examined whether another member of the PYPAF family, PYPAF1, functions as an activator of pro-caspase-1. Co-expression of PYPAF1 with ASC resulted in the activation of pro-caspase-1 and a corresponding increase in IL-1β production (Fig.7A, compare lanes 5and 6). The N-terminal PYRIN domain of PYPAF1 was essential for pro-caspase-1 activation because deletion of this domain (PYPAF1ΔPYRIN) eliminated the synergistic production of IL-1β (Fig.7A, compare lanes 6 and 7). Immunoblot analysis revealed that PYPAF1ΔPYRIN was expressed at levels similar to that of PYPAF1, indicating that loss of function was not caused by reduced protein levels (data not shown). The increase in IL-1β production was dependent on functional pro-caspase-1 (Fig.7B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, PYPAF1 is also an activator of pro-caspase-1 when co-expressed with ASC. In conclusion, we have identified PYPAF7 as a novel PYPAF family member. Our finding that PYPAF7 is recruited to ASC punctate structures in the cytoplasm of cells suggests that these two proteins assemble together into a complex that mediates signal transduction. The PYRIN domain of PYPAF7 is required for its recruitment, suggesting that this domain mediates the assembly of a signaling complex comprised of PYPAF7 and ASC. The restricted expression of PYPAF7 to peripheral blood leukocytes indicates a role for this PYPAF family member in inflammatory signaling. Our data suggest that PYPAF7 and ASC participate in the activation of NF-κB and pro-caspase-1. Activation of ASC and pro-caspase-1 by PYPAF7 may occur through an induced-proximity mechanism analogous to the activation of caspase-9 by Apaf1 (28Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). After submission of this manuscript, Srinivasula et al. (30Srinivasula S.M. Poyet J-L. Razmara M. Datta P. Zhang Z-J. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press): 277Google Scholar) published a similar finding that ASC binds to and activates pro-caspase-1. Consistent with our observations, the C-terminal CARD domain of ASC was found to mediate interactions with both overexpressed and endogenous caspase-1. Both pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 require cleavage by caspase-1 to generate active cytokines (29Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). PYPAF7 may therefore play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity by regulating the production of IL-1 and IL-18 by immune cells. PYPAF1 was also found to activate pro-caspase-1 when co-expressed with ASC, suggesting an analogous role for this protein in the production of IL-1 and IL-18. Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome may therefore be associated with aberrant regulation of NF-κB and caspase-1-dependent cytokine processing. In addition to PYPAF7 and PYPAF1, CARD12 has also been identified as an upstream regulator of caspase-1 (4Geddes B.J. Wang L. Huang W-J. Lavellee M. Manji G.A. Brown M. Jurman M. Cao J.

Reed J.C. Genomics. 2001; 75: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These NBS/LRR family members likely function as intracellular receptor-like molecules that mediate signal transduction in response to distinct upstream stimuli. Alternatively, these proteins may respond to similar stimuli in distinct cell types. It remains to be determined whether other PYPAF family members also coordinate the activation of NF-κB and caspase-1. ASC recently has been identified as a signaling partner of CARD7 and pyrin (13Martinon F. Hofmann H. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 118-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Richards N. Schaner P. Diaz A. Stuckey J. Shelden E. Wadhwa A. Gumucio D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39320-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).2 Our findings on PYPAF7 and PYPAF1 signaling suggest that CARD7 and pyrin may also regulate the activation of NF-κB and pro-caspase-1 through binding to ASC. ASC may therefore function as a critical adaptor protein that links PYRIN-containing proteins to downstream signaling pathways. The findings presented here suggest a role for PYPAF7 in the transduction of pro-inflammatory signals to the activation of NF-κB and pro-caspase-1."

This extraordinary turnover is associated with an iridium anomaly (up to 285 parts per trillion, with an average maximum of 141 parts per trillion) and a fern spore spike, suggesting that a bolide impact was the cause. Eastern North American dinosaurian diversity reached a stable maximum less than 100,000 years after the boundary, marking the establishment of dinosaur-dominated communities that prevailed for the next 135 million years."

However, delivery of large biotherapeutic molecules (i.e.peptides, proteins, or nucleic acids) with immunoliposomes is often hampered by an inefficient cytosolic release of entrapped macromolecules after target cell binding and subsequent endocytosis of immunoliposomes. To enhance cytosolic drug delivery from immunoliposomes present inside endosomes, a pH-dependent fusogenic peptide (diINF-7) resembling the NH2-terminal domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin HA-2 subunit was used. Functional characterization of this dimeric peptide showed its ability to induce fusion between liposome membranes and leakage of liposome-entrapped compounds when exposed to low pH. In a second series of experiments, diINF-7 peptides were encapsulated in immunoliposomes to enhance the endosomal escape of diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA), which inhibits protein synthesis when delivered into the cytosol of target cells. Immunoliposomes targeted to the internalizing epidermal growth factor receptor on the surface of ovarian carcinoma cells (OVCAR-3) and containing encapsulated DTA did not show any cytotoxicity toward OVCAR-3 cells. Cytotoxicity was only observed when diINF-7 peptides and DTA were co-encapsulated in the immunoliposomes.

Many biotherapeutic agents (e.g. peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids) act at sites in the cytosol or nucleus that are difficult to reach due to poor membrane permeation characteristics. Therefore, these biotherapeutic agents rely on drug carriers that allow cytosolic delivery of these agents into diseased cells. One attractive strategy to obtain cytosolic delivery is the development of fusion-competent antibody-directed liposomes (immunoliposomes) that, after receptor binding, can fuse with the plasma-membrane of target cells or, after endocytosis of liposomes, with the endosomal membranes. This membrane fusion process should result in cytosolic access of liposome-entrapped drug molecules. Such fusion-competent liposomes can be obtained by disassembling enveloped viruses, isolating their fusion-promoting components, and reassembling these into vesicles to obtain so-called virosomes (1Scheule R.K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Stegmann T. Morselt H.W. Booy F.P. van Breemen J.F. Scherphof G. Wilschut J.

Another, more refined approach involves the use of synthetic peptides designed to resemble the putative fusion peptide of viruses (5Plank C. Zauner W. Wagner E. Adv. Drug. Del. Rev. 1998; 34: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Pecheur E.I. Sainte-Marie J. Bienven Hoekstra D. J. Membr.

Rev. 1999; 38: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that destabilization of endosomal membranes is less damaging than plasma membrane destabilization. The latter may result in cytotoxicity through eradication of the electrochemical potential generated by the asymmetric distribution of ions across the plasma membrane. Therefore, drug delivery into the cytosol of target cells via endosomal escape is the preferred route. It is expected that fusion and/or membrane-destabilizing mechanisms that allow endosomal escape of liposome-entrapped therapeutic macromolecules will increase the therapeutic availability at the intracellular target site and, consequently, the therapeutic efficacy of liposomal drug formulations. Many viral fusion peptides have been identified. Their mechanistic and structural role in the fusion process occurring between the envelopes of viruses and membranes of host cells has been extensively studied, both with intact viral fusion proteins and with synthetic analogs of the fusion protein domains. One of the best characterized viral fusion peptides is the NH2-terminal domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin subunit HA-2 (9Mechtler K. Wagner E. New J. Chem. 1997; 21: 105-111Google Scholar, 10Oberhauser B. Plank C. Wagner E. Akhtar S. Delivery Strategies for Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). Recently, the membrane structure of the NH2-terminal fusion domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin and the low pH-induced conformational change has been resolved by NMR (11Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that synthetic analogs of the hemagglutinin fusion domain attached to a hydrophilic sequence inserted into liposomal bilayers in an “inverted V” conformation both at neutral (pH 7.4) and acidic pH (pH 5.0) with residue 12 located at the bilayer surface. At pH 5.0, at which the peptide is rendered fusogenic, the COOH-terminal side of the V-shaped peptide undergoes a conformational change, resulting in the formation of short 310-helix, that allows steeper insertion of the fusion peptide into the bilayer. This steeper insertion is thought to cause membrane destabilization. Studies with synthetic peptides resembling the native sequence of the influenza virus NH2-terminal domain of the HA-2 subunit have clearly demonstrated that such peptides are able to destabilize both model membranes (such as liposomes) and natural membranes in a pH-dependent manner. Fusion peptide-induced lipid mixing and aqueous content mixing between liposomes have been demonstrated, indicating that the peptide analogues have fusogenic capacities (12Matsumoto T. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 79: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,13Düzgünes N. Shavnin S.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 128: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Influenza virus-derived fusion peptides have been used to enhance the endosomal escape of oligonucleotides (14Pichon C. Freulon I. Midoux P. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Roche A.C.

Surprisingly, despite the wealth of reports on the use of liposomes to functionally characterize fusogenic peptides, only one study reported on the utility of these peptides in enhancing cytosolic delivery of liposome-entrapped drugs (18Baru M. Nahum O. Jaaro H. Sha'anani J. Nur I. J. Drug Target. 1998; 6: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this paper, the possibility to utilize co-encapsulation of pH-dependent fusion peptides into liposomal drug formulations as a means to obtain endosomal escape of liposome-entrapped drug molecules and release of these molecules into the cytosol of tumor cells was studied. For this purpose, a dimeric peptide (diINF-7) resembling the NH2-terminal domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin was synthesized. A previous study demonstrated that the use of a dimer is preferred, since dimerization resulted in a strongly increased destabilizing activity toward liposomal bilayers and erythrocytes (10Oberhauser B. Plank C. Wagner E. Akhtar S. Delivery Strategies for Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). First, the membrane-destabilizing and fusogenic capacity of diINF-7 either in free form or encapsulated in liposomes was demonstrated by using liposomes as model membranes. Next, the capacity of these peptides to induce endosomal escape of immunoliposome-entrapped bioactive molecules was demonstrated by measuring cytosolic delivery of diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA)1 as a model compound. Co-encapsulation of diINF-7 into DTA-containing immunoliposomes resulted in drastically increased cytotoxicity toward ovarian carcinoma cells, indicating that this peptide can be used to obtain cytosolic delivery of liposome-entrapped drugs with poor membrane permeation capacities.

The peptide was washed three times with ether and subsequently dried under a stream of argon followed by high vacuum. Subsequently, the peptide was dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and freeze-dried. Lyophilized peptide was stored at −20 °C. Purity and identity of the peptide were confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters 486; Millipore Corp.), amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The presence of a cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus resulted in dimerization of the INF-7 peptide by disulfide bond formation.

Four milligrams of dialyzed DT was nicked with trypsin (1 μg/ml in HBS) for 30 min at room temperature, after which the trypsin was inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 μg/ml final concentration).

Fractions of 5 ml were collected and analyzed for the presence of DTA by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Fractions containing DTA were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against two 1-liter changes of HBS containing 0.1 m2,2′-dihydroxyethyl disulfide to reversibly block the free sulfhydryl groups. The concentration of DTA was determined spectrometrically,versus appropriate blanks, using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.5 liters × g − × cm−1. The biological activity of DTA to inhibit protein synthesis was determined with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitrotranslation system (Promega, Madison, WI) (23Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lipids used for all liposome preparations were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 (v/v) ratio) and stored at −20 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Egg PC and CHOL (30 μmol of lipid) dissolved in the organic solvent were mixed at a molar ratio of 2:1 in a round bottom flask. When indicated, 0.1 mol % (relative to PL) of the lipidic fluorescence probe DiD, 10 mol % PyrPC (relative to PL), or varying amounts of PEG2000-DSPE were added to the lipid mixture prior to solvent evaporation using a rotary evaporator device. The formed lipid films were further dried under a stream of nitrogen for at least 1 h to remove traces of organic solvent. Lipid films were hydrated with 1-ml solutions of HBS, calcein (90 mm), diINF-7 (500 μg/ml in HBS), DTA (250 μg/ml in HBS), or combinations of the latter two substances. Hydration of lipids was facilitated by shaking the flasks in the presence of glass beads. The formed liposomes were subsequently extruded through polycarbonate filters with pore sizes varying from 0.05 to 0.6 μm using a hand extruder from Avanti Polar Lipids. Nonentrapped material was removed from liposomes by centrifugation steps (two 45-min steps at 100,000 × g; 4 °C). Pelleted liposomes were resuspended in 1 ml of HBS. The phospholipid concentration of liposome formulations was determined by the colorimetric method of Fiske and Subbarow (24Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The amount of encapsulated protein (DTA and diINF-7) was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) after disruption of the liposomes with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. For targeting purposes, conjugates of mAb 425-PEG2000-DSPE were transferred to liposomes essentially as described by Ishida et al. (25Ishida T. Iden D.L. Allen T.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In short, 2.5 mg of mAb 425 was modified with an 8-fold molar excess of SATA to randomly introduce thiol groups. SATA-modified mAb 425 was deacetylated and allowed to react with micelles containing PEG2000-DSPE and maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE at a 4:1 molar ratio. One micromole of liposomes was incubated with 425-PEG-DSPE micelles corresponding to an amount of 30 μg of conjugated protein for 90 min at 40 °C to allow transfer of mAb 425-PEG2000-DSPE to the liposomes. Purification of liposomes was performed on a Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Biosciences). With this technique, ∼70% of targeting ligands could be reproducibly transferred into preformed liposomes. OVCAR-3 cells grown to a confluent monolayer were detached from culture flasks by incubating the cells for 5 min at 37 °C with trypsin/EDTA solutions from Invitrogen. Detached OVCAR-3 cells (2 × 105 cells) were incubated with DiD-labeled liposomes in a final volume of 300 μl of culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed with immunofluorescence buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) by two centrifugation steps (5 min at 750 × g) and resuspended into 500 μl of immunofluorescence buffer before being analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton & Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis, cells that were incubated with liposomes were washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline before fixation with 2% (v/v) of formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells that were adhered to chamber slides were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and overlaid with cover slides that were sealed with nail polish. Cells were analyzed on a Leica TCS-SP confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a 488-nm argon, 568-nm krypton, and 647-nm HeNe laser. CD measurements were performed with a dual-beam DSM 1000 CD spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). The subtractive double-grating monochromator was equipped with a fixed disk, holographic gratings (2400 lines/mm, blaze wavelength 230 nm), and 1.24-mm slits. Cuvettes with a path length of 1 mm were used, and the peptide concentration was 100 μg/ml. CD spectra were recorded from 250 to 200 nm at 25 °C. Each measurement was the average of six repeated scans (step resolution 1 nm, 1 s each step) from which the corresponding background spectrum was subtracted. Quantitative prediction of the helical content was accomplished by fitting CD data with the Hennessey-Johnson algorithm (26Hennessey J.P.J. Johnson W.C.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), by the program CDNN in “simple spectra” configuration (27Böhm, G. (1997) CDNN CD Spectra Deconvolution Software, Version 2.1Google Scholar), using a protein data base with known secondary structure as the basis set. Liposomes composed of EPC and CHOL (molar ratio of 2:1) and with increasing amounts of PEG2000-DSPE (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mol %) were added to a cuvette at a concentration of 300 or 1000 μm in a final volume of 1.5 ml of HBS. Immediately after the addition of diINF-7 (lipid/peptide molar ratio of 50), peptide-induced aggregation of liposomes at the indicated pH values was determined by measuring the increase in optical density of the liposome dispersion with a spectrophotometer at 500 nm over a period of 8–12 min at room temperature. A serial dilution (1:5) of free or liposome-encapsulated diINF-7 peptide was prepared in a 96-well microtiter plate by transferring 20 μl of the initial peptide solution (50 μg/ml for free peptide and 0.3 μg/ml for liposome-entrapped peptide) from one well to the next well containing 80 μl of HBS. Calcein-containing liposomes were added to each well at a final concentration of 40 μm. After a 60-min incubation at room temperature, samples were analyzed for fluorescence with an LS50B fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) set at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Calcein leakage was expressed relative to the difference in the fluorescence of calcein liposomes incubated in the absence of diINF-7 peptide (0% leakage) and the fluorescence of calcein liposomes that had been disrupted with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (100% leakage). The effect of Triton X-100 on calcein fluorescence intensity was negligible at the tested concentration (28Memoli A. Palermiti L.G. Travagli V. Alhaique F. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 627-632Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Memoli A. Palermiti L.G. Travagli V. Alhaique F. J. Pharmacol. Biomed. Anal. 1994; 12: 307-312Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). diINF-7-induced lipid mixing was monitored with the pyrene excimer assay developed by Galla and Hartmann (30Galla H.J. Hartmann W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1980; 27: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Liposomes (5 μm) labeled with 10 mol % PyrPC (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were mixed in a total volume of 1.4 ml of HBS with a 20-fold molar excess of nonlabeled donor liposomes in a cuvette kept at 37 °C. diINF-7 peptide was added at the amounts indicated, and after a 2-min equilibration period, the pH of the medium in the cuvette was lowered to 5.2 by adding one-twentieth volume of fusion buffer (0.1 m Mes, 0.1 macetic acid, pH 4.1). Fusion was continuously monitored at 37 °C by measuring the decrease in PyrPC excimer fluorescence with an LS50B fluorimeter set at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm while the cuvette contents were continuously stirred. The decrease of fluorescence was expressed relative to the difference in the initial fluorescence and the excimer fluorescence at infinite dilution, which was obtained by disrupting the liposomes with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (final concentration). The occurrence of diINF-7-induced intermixing of liposome-entrapped solutes was determined with a fluorescent assay based on quenching of calcein with bivalent metal ions (31Kendall D.A. MacDonald R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13892-13895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unilamellar liposomes of 150 nm in size containing calcein (0.8 mm) and CuSO4 (1 mm) in HBS were admixed at a concentration of 50 μm with a 5-fold molar excess of liposomes containing 20 mm EDTA in a stirred cuvette kept at a temperature of 37 °C. diINF-7 was added at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The pH of the buffer was lowered to 5.2 by adding one-twentieth volume of fusion buffer. Aqueous contents mixing and/or leakage were continuously monitored at 37 °C by measuring the increase in calcein fluorescence with a fluorimeter set at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. To be able to determine the contribution of both leakage and aqueous content mixing to the total increase in calcein fluorescence, one-twentieth volume of 1 mmCuSO4 was added to the external medium during the fusion process. OVCAR-3 cells were plated in 96-well cell culture plates at 5 × 103 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Culture medium was removed by decanting the plates, and cells were overlaid with 100 μl of fresh culture medium. To the first well of each column 100 μl of liposome formulation was added at a final lipid concentration of 1 mm (corresponding to 0.5 μg/ml of DTA). 2-Fold serial dilutions of liposome formulations were prepared by transferring 100 μl of the first well in a column to the next and so forth. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, liposomes were removed from the cells by decanting the plates, and cells were washed with 100 μl/well of fresh culture medium and overlaid with 100 μl of fresh culture medium before incubation was continued. Forty-eight hours after the addition of liposome formulations, cell viability was assessed with the colorimetric XTT assay as previously described (32Arigita C. Zuidam N.J. Crommelin D.J. Hennink W.E. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1999; 16: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of diINF-7 is presented in TableI. Compared with the native sequence of the NH2-terminal domain of the influenza virus HA-2 subunit, diINF-7 differs in only two amino acids; glycine at position 4 and alanine at position 7 have been substituted by glutamic acid residues. These substitutions favor the pH dependence of the fusogenic activity of the peptide. Since fusogenic activity is thought to be directly correlated with α-helix formation of the peptide (6Pecheur E.I. Sainte-Marie J. Bienven Hoekstra D. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,33Düzgünes N. Gambale F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Wharton S.A. Martin S.R.

Biol. 2000; 17: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the secondary structure of diINF-7 was determined by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry at both pH 7.4 and pH 5.2 in the presence or absence of detergent-solubilized phospholipids. Since Subbaraoet al. (36Subbarao N.K. Parente R.A. Szoka F.C.J. Nadasdi L. Pongracz K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2964-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) showed that interpretation of CD spectra below 222 nm in the presence of phospholipid vesicles is ambiguous due to liposome scattering, we used mixed micelles of phospholipids and detergent to determine the effect of a hydrophobic environment on the helical content of the peptide. The CD spectrum (Fig.1) of the free peptide at pH 5.2 shows minima at 208 and 222 nm, typical of a highly α-helical structure; in contrast, at neutral pH, the diINF-7 peptide is primarily randomly coiled (Fig. 1A and Table II). Interestingly, the presence of detergent-solubilized phospholipids can also induce α-helix formation of diINF-7 (Fig. 1B and Table II).Table IAmino acid sequences of fusion peptidesPeptideSequenceInf HA-2GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDGWYG—–diINF-7GLFEAIEGFIENGWEGMIDGWYGCGLFEAIEGFIENGWEGMIDGWYGCINF HA-2, amino-terminal sequence of Influenza virus X-31 (H3N2) hemagglutinin subunit HA-2; diINF-7, peptide analogue resembling Inf HA-2 dimerized at the COOH terminus by disulfide bond formation between COOH-terminal cysteine residues.

These findings led to the identification of a novel family of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that provides a direct link between Gα12/13 and Rho stimulation. Recent observations suggest that many cellular responses elicited by Gαq and its coupled receptors also require the functional activity of Rho. However, available evidence suggests that Gαq may act on pathways downstream from Rho rather than by promoting Rho activation. These seemingly conflicting observations and the recent development of sensitive assays to assess the in vivo levels of active Rho prompted us to ask whether Gαq and its coupled receptors can stimulate endogenous Rho. Here we show that the expression of activated forms of Gαq and the stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors or chimeric Gαq molecules that respond to Gi-linked receptors can promote a robust activation of endogenous Rho in HEK-293T cells. Interestingly, this response was not prevented by molecules interfering with the ability of Gα13 to stimulate its linked RhoGEFs, together suggesting the existence of a novel molecular mechanism by which Gαq and the large family of Gq-coupled receptors can regulate the activity of Rho and its downstream signaling pathways.

They owe their name to their extensively studied interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins (α, β, and γ subunits), which undergo conformational changes that lead to the exchange of GDP for GTP bound to the α subunit upon receptor activation. Consequently, GTP-bound Gα subunits of the Gαi, Gαs, Gαq, and Gα12 family and free Gβγ subunits stimulate a variety of effector molecules thereby activating or inhibiting key second messenger-generating systems (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that many cellular responses elicited by activation of heterotrimeric G proteins are not mediated by classical second messengers, but they involve not yet fully understood molecular mechanisms that result in the activation of small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras and Rho families. For example, it was observed that activated forms of Gα12 and Gα13 promote stress fiber formation, the assembly focal adhesions, the transcriptional activation of the serum responsive factor, and cellular transformation through Rho-dependent pathways without affecting conventional second messengers (2Buhl A.M.

These observations prompted the study of the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Gα12/13 activate Rho. In this regard, recent work has revealed that a novel family of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho, which includes p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, can provide a direct link between Gα12/13 proteins and Rho activation (5Hart M.J.

Recent evidence suggests that cell surface receptors linked to the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins can also activate signaling routes that are dependent on the functional activity of Rho. For example, it was observed that Gαq and its coupled receptors stimulate the transcriptional activity of the serum response factor and that molecules inhibiting Rho can prevent this response (3Fromm C.

However, activation of the SRE can be provoked by other members of the Rho family of GTPases such as Rac and Cdc42, which limits the specificity of this experimental approach (8Hill C.S. Wynne J.

We provide evidence that in HEK-293T cells the stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors as well as the expression of activated forms of Gαq and chimeric Gαqmolecules engineered to be stimulated by Gi-coupled receptors can promote a robust activation of endogenous Rho. Moreover, activation of Rho-dependent pathways by Gq-coupled receptors and a GTPase-deficient Gαq was not prevented by molecules interfering with the ability of Gα13 to stimulate its linked RhoGEFs, thus suggesting the existence of a novel mechanism by which cell surface receptors that transduce signals through Gq can regulate the activity of Rho.

Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and after serum starvation for 24 h cells were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated with GST-rhotekin-RBD previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed four times with lysis buffer, and associated GTP-bound forms of Rho were released with protein loading buffer and revealed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (26C4)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) using goat anti-mouse (Cappel) IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Antibodies against Gαq/11 (C-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Gα12/13 rabbit polyclonal serum was described previously (3Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S., Xu, N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against AU1 and HA epitopes were purchased form COVANCE. Whereas m1 receptors are typical of those coupled through G proteins of the Gq family to phospholipase-C activation, m2 is known to couple through Gi to a number of effector pathways including the inhibition of adenylyl cyclases. Thus, we used the expression of these muscarinic receptor subtypes as a model system to examine whether Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors can stimulate Rho in HEK-293T cells. For these experiments, cells transfected with m1 and m2 receptors were stimulated with the cholinergic agonist carbachol, and cellular lysates were incubated with GST fusion protein including the RBD of rhotekin previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The levels of the GTP-bound form of Rho associated with GST-rhotekin-RBD were quantified by Western blot analysis using an anti-Rho antibody. As shown in Fig.1, a detailed time course analysis of Rho stimulation by carbachol revealed the rapid and potent activation of Rho in m1-transfected cells, which was demonstrable as soon as 30 s after agonist addition and was attenuated within 10 min but remained above basal levels for at least 1 h (data not shown). In contrast, activation of m2 receptors did not result in Rho activation, although it stimulated ERK2 as potently as when elicited by m1 receptors, as previously reported (17Crespo P., Xu, N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), which served as an internal control. Thus, in HEK-293T cells Gq- but not Gi-coupled receptors can provoke a remarkable activation of Rho. To begin exploring whether Gq itself can activate Rho, we first asked whether in HEK-293T cells activated forms of Gαqcan stimulate expression from a reporter plasmid containing a mutated SRE that eliminated the ternary complex factor-binding site and that has been shown to be potently activated by Rho (8Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2A, the constitutively active GTPase-deficient form Gαq (Gαq-QL) activated this mutant SRE potently. Similar results were observed using activated forms of Gα11, Gα14, and Gα16 (data not shown). Under identical conditions, activated forms of Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαs or overexpression of Gβγ subunits did not induce a significant stimulation of the mutant SRE (Fig. 2, upper panel and data not shown), whereas activated forms of Gα12 and Gα13provoked a remarkable response. These observations indicated that the ability to stimulate SRE in HEK-293T cells is specific for members of the Gαq and Gα12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins. To explore whether Rho mediates this effect, we took advantage of the finding that the botulinum toxin C3 ADP-ribosylates Rho, thus preventing its activation (18Aktories K. Hall A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 415-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2A, co-transfection with a C3 toxin expression plasmid abolished the stimulation of CAT activity by the activated G protein α subunits and abolished the transcriptional response provoked by m1 receptors but did not affect the SRE stimulation by an active Cdc42, which was used as a control (see below), together suggesting that Gq-coupled receptors and activated forms of Gαq can stimulate Rho-dependent pathways in HEK-293T cells. In line with these results, cells expressing active forms of Gαq and Gα11 displayed an increased level of Rho in the GTP-bound form, albeit to a lesser extent than that provoked by Gα13, without affecting the level of expression of Rho (Fig. 2, lower panel). Because persistent expression of activated Gα subunits may promote secondary effects on intracellular signaling pathways, we took advantage of the finding that Gq/Gi chimeras, in which a C-terminal region of Gαq is replaced by the corresponding region of Gαi, can be stimulated by Gi-coupled receptors and are able to transmit Gq-mediated signaling pathways (15Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Thus, upon co-expression of this Gq/Gi chimera with a Gi-coupled receptor, such as an m2 receptor, on-and-off Gq-mediated signaling can now be controlled by agonist addition. As a control, we also designed a similar G13/Gi chimera in which the C-terminal 5 amino acids of Gα13 were replaced by the corresponding sequences of Gαi. Expression of these proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Initially, we examined the ability of these chimeric G proteins to stimulate the transcriptional activation of the SRE-containing reporter plasmid. Activation of m2 receptors with carbachol did not activate the SRE (4Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27118-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but transcription from the SRE was potently increased by m1 receptor stimulation (Fig.3A). Exposure to carbachol of cells co-expressing m2 receptors with either the Gq/Gi or G13/Gi chimera caused a remarkable SRE activation (Fig. 3, upper panel), whereas the overexpression of Gαi2 did not affect the SRE activity (not shown). The ability to stimulate SRE-dependent transcription was abolished by co-transfection with C3 toxin, suggesting that these chimeric G proteins can stimulate Rho-dependent pathways. We then used this system to investigate whether Gαq and Gα13 can stimulate Rho. As shown in Fig. 3, lower panel, stimulation with carbachol did not activate Rho in m2-expressing cells alone or when co-expressed with Gαi2. However, in cells expressing either the Gq/Gior G13/Gi chimera, m2 receptor stimulation resulted in Rho activation. Together, these results indicate that both the Gq and G12/13 classes of heterotrimeric G proteins can link their coupled cell surface receptors to the stimulation of signaling pathways, resulting in the activation of Rho. The functional activity of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family is tightly regulated in vivo by proteins that control the GDP/GTP-bound state. Whereas GEFs promote the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus activating Rho proteins (19Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), GTPase-activating proteins increase the low intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of small GTPases and are negative modulators. Many GEFs for Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been identified. They all share a 250-amino acid stretch of significant sequence similarity with Dbl, termed the Dbl homology domain, which is adjacent to a pleckstrin-homology domain (20Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and is responsible for nucleotide exchange activity toward GTPases of the Rho family (21Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). One closely related family of RhoGEFs that includes p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, also exhibits an area of homology to a family of proteins known as regulators ofG protein signaling (5Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 6Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T.

Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that this RGS domain provides a structural feature by which G proteins of the Gα12 family can bind and activate these RhoGEFs, thereby stimulating Rho (5Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 6Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J.

Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). There is limited information, however, describing how RhoGEFs mediate the activation of Rho by Gαq. For example, in a recent study Gαq was found to co-immunoprecipitate with a RhoGEF known as Lbc/Brx under low detergent conditions, but this interaction did not result in Rho activation in vivo (10Sagi S.A. Seasholtz T.M. Kobiashvili M. Wilson B.A. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using a FLAG-tagged Lbc/Brx (16Rubino D. Driggers P. Arbit D. Kemp L. Miller B. Coso O. Pagliai K. Gray K. Gutkind S. Segars J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we did not detect any specific binding to Gαq using standard immunoprecipitation techniques (data not shown) similar to that observed by others using the full-length AKAP-Lbc/Brx (11Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, we next focused our attention on the RGS-containing family of RhoGEFs. To address the possibility that PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115RhoGEF may associate with Gαq, we co-transfected expression plasmids for AU1-tagged forms of these RhoGEFs or GFP (control) together with activated forms of Gα13 (Gα13QL) and Gαq (GαqQL). The efficient expression of the transfected constructs was revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig.4A and see below). As shown in Fig. 4A, PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115RhoGEF effectively co-immunoprecipitated with Gα13QL. Instead, we detected only a limited but reproducible association with the activated form of Gαq. Because the N-terminal RGS domains of these RhoGEFs are required for the physical interaction of Gα13 with these RhoGEFs, we then explored the molecular determinants of this association with Gαq using truncated forms of PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115RhoGEF lacking N-terminal or C-terminal regions as well as their isolated RGS domains. As shown in Fig. 4B, the isolated RGS domains of these RhoGEFs were sufficient to bind Gα13, and deletion of the N-terminal domains abolished the ability of these RhoGEFs to bind Gα13. In contrast, the RGS domains of these RhoGEFs did not bind Gαq, and the removal of the N-terminal domains enhanced the binding ability of PDZ-RhoGEF and p115RhoGEF. Thus, these RhoGEFs may interact physically with Gαq using distinct molecular mechanisms from those by which they interact with Gα13. Because we cannot rule out the possibility that Gqand its coupled receptors may cause the direct or indirect activation of G12 and G13, we took advantage of the observation that the RGS domains of PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115RhoGEF can effectively bind Gα13 but not Gαq to ask whether the overexpression of these RGSs can affect the transcriptional response elicited downstream from Gq. As expected, expression of these RGS domains abolished the ability of Gα13 to stimulate the SRE without affecting the effect of Rho (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the RGS domains did not affect the activation of SRE by Gαq or m1, which further supports the emerging notion that Gαq can stimulate Rho by a distinct mechanism that is independent of the functional activity of the G12/13 family of heterotrimeric G proteins. Together, our study indicates that receptors transmitting signals through Gq can promote Rho activation, thereby initiating the activity of intracellular pathways controlled by Rho. Similarly, we have recently observed that Gαq and Gq-coupled receptors can potently stimulate the Rho-related GTPase Rac1. 2J.-M. Servitja, H. Chikumi, J. Vázquez-Prado, H. Miyazaki, and J. S. Gutkind, unpublished observation. The molecular mechanism by which Gαq stimulates these Rho GTPases, however, is yet to be fully defined. In this regard, neither the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters promoted Rho activation alone or in combination with agents elevating intracellular levels of calcium nor the blockade of PKCs by a variety of PKC inhibitors affected the ability of Gq-coupled receptors to stimulate Rho (data not shown). Current genomic efforts have now revealed the existence of a large number of RhoGEFs. Among them, those RhoGEFs containing an RGS domain represent good candidates to mediate Gαq function as they do for Gα12 and Gα13. Indeed, we noticed that Gαq may interact with these RhoGEFs, albeit to a very limited extent, and in contrast to Gα12/13 removal of the N-terminal region that includes the RGS domain may enhance the association of these GEFs with Gαq. However, the isolated Dbl-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) or C-terminal domains did not bind Gαq (data not shown), suggesting that this association may require both regions, and was diminished by the presence of an intact N terminus. Whether the interaction between Gαq and this family of RhoGEFs has functional consequences or whether other members of the extended family of RhoGEFs can mediate the activation of Rho by Gαq is under current investigation. The finding that G proteins of the Gq family can promote the activation of Rho may explain some of the remarkable biological effects of Gq and its coupled receptors, such as the ability to regulate gene expression, hypertrophy, and normal and cancerous growth (23Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which can only be partially explained by the activation of second messenger-generating systems. Furthermore, receptors coupled to Gq often are overexpressed in a variety of tumors where they are activated by ligands in an autocrine fashion (25Heasley L.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1563-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because persistent activation of Rho often has been linked to aberrant cell growth, the ability to stimulate Rho now provides a likely mechanism by which Gq-coupled receptors may participate in tumor progression. In turn, these findings suggest that Rho and its downstream signaling molecules can be considered suitable molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer as well as in many other disease states that involve the persistent activation of receptors linked to Gq.

Two of these genes, which are defective in the pallid and muted mutant mouse strains, encode small, coiled-coil-forming proteins that display no homology to each other or to any known protein. We report that these two proteins, pallidin and muted, are components of a novel protein complex. We raised antibodies that allow for detection of pallidin from a wide variety of mammalian cells. Endogenous pallidin was distributed in both soluble and peripheral membrane protein fractions. Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity analyses indicated that the bulk of cytosolic pallidin is a component of an asymmetric protein complex with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa. We named this complex BLOC-1 (for biogenesis oflysosome-related organelles complex 1). Steady-state pallidin protein levels were reduced in fibroblasts derived from muted and reduced pigmentation mice, suggesting that the genes defective in these two mutant strains could encode components of BLOC-1 that are required for pallidin stability. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments using an antibody to muted confirmed that this protein is a subunit of BLOC-1. Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that pallidin is capable of self-association through a region that contains its two coiled-coil forming domains. Unlike AP-3-deficient pearl fibroblasts, which display defects in intracellular zinc storage, zinc distribution was not noticeably affected in pallid or muted fibroblasts. Interestingly, immunofluorescence and in vitro binding experiments demonstrated that pallidin/BLOC-1 is able to associate with actin filaments. We propose that BLOC-1 mediates the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles by a mechanism that may involve self-assembly and interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.

Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Blott E.J. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Examples of lysosome-related organelles are melanosomes, platelet-dense granules, neutrophil azurophil granules, and lytic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. The functions of these organelles vary widely (1Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blott E.J. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), from synthesis and storage of melanin (melanosomes) and regulation of platelet aggregation (platelet-dense granules) to killing of invading bacteria (neutrophil azurophil granules) and virus-infected and tumor cells (lytic granules). How are these organelles formed? One alternative is that a given lysosome-related organelle is actually the lysosome of a particular cell type, in which expression of cell type-specific proteins with lysosomal targeting information provides the organelle with functional properties different from, or in addition to, the degradative role of conventional lysosomes. This appears to be the case for lytic granules and the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment (1Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, other lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes and platelet-dense granules, are known to co-exist with conventional lysosomes in the same cell (3Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 4Rendu F. Brohard-Bohn B. Platelets. 2001; 12: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Hence, sorting mechanisms must exist that ensure proper segregation of components of these organelles from those of lysosomes. Some clues on the nature of the cellular machinery that mediates the biogenesis of melanosomes and platelet-dense granules (and, presumably, of other lysosome-related organelles) have arisen from the study of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). HPS defines a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by reduced pigmentation and prolonged bleeding due to defective melanosomes and platelet-dense granules, respectively (for a recent review, see Ref. 5Huizing M. Anikster Y. Gahl W.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In humans, four forms of the disease, named HPS-1, -2, -3, and -4, have been associated with mutations in HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, and HPS4, respectively (6Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H., Ho, L.

Of these genes, onlyAP3B1 encodes a protein of known function; this protein is the β3A subunit of the AP-3 sorting complex, which mediates signal-dependent trafficking of integral membrane proteins (e.g. the LAMPs) to organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system (for a recent review, see Ref. 10Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In mice, at least 15 non-allelic mutant strains display HPS-like combinations of hypopigmentation and platelet-dense granule deficiency (11Swank R.T. Novak E.K. McGarry M.P. Rusiniak M.E. Feng L.

ThePldn gene product, pallidin, was shown to interact with syntaxin 13 (18), a member of the syntaxin family of integral membrane proteins involved in membrane fusion (for a recent review on the physiological significance of this interaction, see Ref. 20Falcón-Pérez J.M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Pigm. Cell Res. 2002; 15: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). No other biochemical or functional properties of pallidin have been described. In this work, we have characterized the endogenous pallidin protein from mammalian tissues and cultured cells. We found that pallidin exists in soluble and membrane-associated forms and that the soluble form is a component of a large protein complex, which we named BLOC-1 (for biogenesis of lysosome-relatedorganelles complex 1). We identified muted as another subunit of BLOC-1, and we obtained evidence suggesting that pallidin is capable of self-association. We also observed that intracellular zinc distribution in fibroblasts is less sensitive to BLOC-1 deficiency than to AP-3 deficiency. Finally, we found that pallidin/BLOC-1 can interact with actin filaments in vitroand in transfected cells. The plasmids pGST-PA, pGST-PAN, and pGST-PAC were generated by PCR amplification of cDNA segments encoding human pallidin residues 1–172 (full length), 1–62, and 62–172, respectively, followed by in-frame cloning into EcoRI-SalI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The same DNA inserts were subcloned into a modified version of the pET-30a(+) vector (kindly provided by Dr. Markus Boehm, National Institutes of Health) to generate histidine-tagged versions of the pallidin fragments, and into the yeast two-hybrid vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424 (CLONTECH) to generate in-frame fusions with Gal4 binding and activation domains, respectively. The plasmid pGST-MU was obtained by PCR amplification of the complete open reading frame of human muted (GenBankTMaccession number AF426434) followed by cloning into theEcoRI-SalI sites of pGEX-5X-1. The corresponding pHIS-MU, pGBT-MU, and pGAD-MU fusion constructs were derived by subcloning into pET-30a(+) (Novagen), pGBT9, and pGAD424, respectively. The mammalian expression plasmid pMYC-PA was generated by PCR engineering (to fuse the Myc epitope at the amino terminus of full-length human pallidin) followed by cloning into the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids coding for ARF1Q71L fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and for GGA3 residues 1–313 fused to the Gal4 activation domain have been described before (21Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST or histidine-tagged fusion proteins were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-(DE3)-RP (Stratagene). GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified from expressing bacteria by using glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant histidine-tagged proteins, rHis-PA, rHis-PAC, and rHis-MU, were purified on TALON® Superflow resin (CLONTECH). All recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 0.1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, except for rHis-PA and rHis-PAC, which were dialyzed against 0.1 mNa2CO3, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 9.5, to prevent protein aggregation. The anti-pallidin antiserum was raised in rabbits using purified GST-PA as the immunogen. The affinity-purified antibodies anti-PA, anti-PAC, and anti-PAN were generated by affinity chromatography using as ligands purified rHis-PA, rHis-PAC, and GST-PAN, respectively, coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). The anti-PAN antibody was subsequently immunoadsorbed, using GST coupled to Affi-Gel 15. Rabbit anti-muted antiserum was raised using purified GST-MU as the immunogen and affinity-purified using rHis-MU coupled to Affi-Gel 15.

Whole-cell extracts of cells grown on monolayers were obtained by mild trypsin treatment (to detach cells) followed by washing with ice-cold PBS and subsequent heating at 95 °C in the presence of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Detergent extracts from mouse tissues were prepared at 0–4 °C by sonication of minced organs in the presence of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. Frozen bovine tissues obtained from PelFreez (Rogers, AR) were homogenized using a blender (5 × 5 s) in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 5 mg/liter aprotinin, and 1 mg/liter pepstatin A). HeLa cells were homogenized in buffer A containing protease inhibitor mixture by 15–20 passages through a 25-gauge needle. Crude extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for at least 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were further centrifuged for 90 min at 120,000 × g to prepare cytosol (supernatant) and microsomal membranes (pellet). For actin-binding assays, cytosol from M1 cells was prepared as above except for the use of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) instead of buffer A. For membrane extraction experiments, HeLa microsomal membranes were resuspended with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer in buffer C (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitor mixture and no additive (control) or either 0.8 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 11, or 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Resuspended membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 90 min at 120,000 × g. Final supernatants and pellets were diluted to an equal volume with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed at 4 °C on a calibrated Superose 6 column (1 × 60 cm) connected to a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with buffer D (0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture). Bovine liver cytosol (0.2 ml) was applied to the column and eluted with buffer D at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Calibration of the column was performed using blue dextran (to determine exclusion volume) and the following protein standards from Sigma (Stokes radii in parentheses): bovine thyroglobulin (85 Å), horse spleen apoferritin (61 Å), BSA (36 Å), carbonic anhydrase (24 Å), and horse heart cytochromec (17 Å). Sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out by ultracentrifugation on a linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient (12 ml) prepared in buffer D. Bovine liver cytosol was diluted with an equal volume of water prior to loading on top of the gradient (sample size, 0.2 ml). Samples were centrifuged on a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 39,000 rpm for 13 h at 4 °C. Fractions (∼0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by immunoblotting. The following protein standards (Sigma) were used (Svedberg coefficients in parentheses): horse spleen apoferritin (16.5 S), bovine catalase (11.3 S), BSA (4.6 S), and chicken ovalbumin (3.6 S). Molecular mass and frictional ratio (f/f 0) values were calculated from Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients assuming a partial specific volume of 0.72–0.75 cm3/g, as described (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments were carried out as described previously (25Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 7.2.1-7.2.21Google Scholar). Non-denaturing immunoprecipitations included one washing step using 0.1% (w/v) SDS, as described previously (25Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 7.2.1-7.2.21Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as in a previous paper (22Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (CLONTECH) was transformed by following the lithium acetate method (26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double transformants were selected in SD minimal medium (0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Sigma) and 2% (w/v) glucose, pH 5.5) supplemented with appropriate auxotrophic requirements except for leucine and tryptophan. At least two colonies of each double transformant were suspended in water at an absorbance of 0.4 at 600 nm. The resulting cell suspensions (5 μl) were spotted onto SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (control) or lacking also histidine and/or adenine, in the absence or presence of 5 mm 3AT. Cells were incubated at 30 °C for up to 3 days and monitored for growth by visual inspection. Binding of proteins to F-actin was assayed using the Non-muscle Actin Binding Protein Biochem Kit from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Briefly, purified actin was polymerized following the instructions provided. M1 cytosol prepared in buffer B was diluted with 2 volumes of buffer E (4.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.18 mm CaCl2) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 90 min at 100,000 × g to remove any potential aggregates. The resulting supernatant was incubated with F-actin in buffer E, or with buffer E alone, for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, each incubated sample (50 μl) was layered on top of 0.2 ml of cushion buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and centrifuged at room temperature for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The resulting pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were grown on glass coverslips to 50–80% confluence and fixed using 2.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS. In some experiments, cells were transfected with expression plasmids using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) about 24 h before fixation. All staining procedures were performed at room temperature. To detect Myc-PA, fixed cells were first incubated for 1 h with anti-Myc antibody diluted in buffer F (PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 0.1% (w/v) BSA), washed in PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG diluted in the same buffer. To stain actin filaments, fixed cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (Molecular Probes) diluted in buffer F. To detect intracellular zinc store sites, either fixed or unfixed cells were incubated for 1 h with 25 μm zinquin ethyl ester (Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Stained samples were washed extensively with PBS and mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescence microscopy was carried out on either Leica DMR or Leica TCS SP MP microscopes (Leica, Germany), as indicated in the legends to Figs. 7and 8.Figure 8Association of pallidin with F-actin.A–D, HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with a plasmid encoding a Myc epitope-tagged form of human pallidin, Myc-PA. About 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (A andC) and, simultaneously, with Alexa-488-conjugated phalloidin (B and D). Serial images of Cy3 and Alexa 488 fluorescence were acquired on a Leica TCS SP MP confocal microscope using a z-section thickness of about 0.4 μm. Aand B correspond to an optical section just above the cell nucleus, whereas C and D correspond to another section of the same cell that includes the basal plasma membrane attached to the glass surface. Notice the extensive co-localization of Myc-PA and actin filaments in A and B(arrows), which is less evident in the lower section containing long actin stress fibers (C and D). Control experiments (not shown) corroborated the lack of optical cross-over between Cy3 and Alexa 488 fluorescence under these conditions, and confirmed that the perinuclear actin filament network shown in B was not an artifact of pallidin overexpression as it was also present in untransfected cells. E, binding of F-actin in vitro. Cytosol from M1 cells was incubated with (+) or without (−) polymerized non-muscle actin (F-actin) and subsequently ultracentrifuged on top of a glycerol cushion to sediment actin filaments and associated proteins. The resulting pellets, as well as an aliquot of the cytosol (1/3 total control), were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to pallidin (anti-PA), the α subunit of AP-2, or HSP70. Notice the presence of pallidin in pellets containing F-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We raised a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a recombinant GST fusion protein that composed the complete polypeptide chain predicted from the major transcript of the human PLDN gene (172 amino acid residues; GenBankTM accession number AF080470). The crude antiserum was affinity-purified using as ligands a recombinant histidine-tagged form of pallidin, rHis-PA (to generate the anti-PA antibody), or recombinant proteins bearing pallidin residues 1–62 and 62–172 (to generate anti-PAN and anti-PACantibodies, respectively). By immunoblotting, the three purified antibodies recognized rHis-PA as well as a polypeptide that was deemed to represent endogenous pallidin as it was present in wild-type mouse fibroblast extracts but absent from pallid fibroblast extracts (Fig.1 A). In addition, the antiserum allowed us to detect endogenous pallidin by immunoprecipitation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B, HeLa cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine were lysed in the presence of non-ionic detergent and subjected to a first immunoprecipitation step using either anti-pallidin or control preimmune sera. Following extensive washing, an aliquot from each immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Several radiolabeled protein bands were found in anti-pallidin immunoprecipitates that were not present in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, arrows). To identify unambiguously which of these bands represented endogenous pallidin, the remaining aliquot of each immunoprecipitate was subjected to denaturation followed by a second immunoprecipitation (recapture) step using either preimmune or anti-pallidin sera. This procedure resulted in the isolation of a single radiolabeled polypeptide that was immunoprecipitated by anti-pallidin under both non-denaturing and denaturing conditions (Fig. 1 B, right panel). As expected, the pallidin polypeptide was not recovered from control samples in which anti-pallidin was replaced by preimmune serum at either immunoprecipitation step (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Similar results were obtained using the affinity-purified anti-PA antibody (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobilities of mouse and human pallidin corresponded to polypeptides of ∼23 and ∼24 kDa, respectively (notice in Fig. 1 A the slight difference in mobility between the pallidin proteins from mouse fibroblasts and human HeLa cells). These molecular mass values are larger than those calculated from the predicted amino acid sequences of mouse and human pallidin (∼19.7 kDa). Nevertheless, the specificity controls shown in Fig. 1 strongly argue that the endogenous proteins detected by our antibodies represent bona fide mouse and human pallidin. Although alternatively spliced versions of pallidin mRNA have been identified and predicted to encode putative truncated forms of pallidin (18Huang L. Kuo Y.-M. Gitschier J. Nat.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates the production of cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins by a variety of cell types and tissues. We show here that TGF-β stimulates murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to synthesize FBLN-5 transcript and protein through a Smad3-independent pathway. Overexpression of FBLN-5 in 3T3-L1 cells increased DNA synthesis and enhanced basal and TGF-β-stimulated activation of ERK1/ERK2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). FBLN-5 overexpression also augmented the tumorigenicity of human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells by increasing their DNA synthesis, migration toward fibronectin, and invasion through synthetic basement membranes. In stark contrast, FBLN-5 expression was down-regulated in the majority of metastatic human malignancies, particularly in cancers of the kidney, breast, ovary, and colon. Unlike its proliferative response in fibroblasts, FBLN-5 overexpression in mink lung Mv1Lu epithelial cells resulted in an antiproliferative response, reducing their DNA synthesis and cyclin A expression. Moreover, FBLN-5 synergizes with TGF-β in stimulating AP-1 activity in Mv1Lu cells, an effect that was abrogated by overexpression of dominant-negative versions of either MKK1 or p38 MAPKα. Accordingly, both the stimulation and duration of ERK1/ERK2 and p38 MAPK by TGF-β was enhanced in Mv1Lu cells expressing FBLN-5. Our findings identify FBLN-5 as a novel TGF-β-inducible target gene that regulates cell growth and motility in a context-specific manner and affects protein kinase activation by TGF-β. Our findings also indicate that aberrant FBLN-5 expression likely contributes to tumor development in humans.

Inactivation of the FBLN-5 gene in mice produces profound elastinopathy in the skin, lung, and vasculature (4Nakamura T. Lozano P.R. Ikeda Y. Iwanaga Y. Hinek A. Minamisawa S. Cheng C.F. Kobuke K.

Despite these recent advances, many questions regarding the role of FBLN-5 in mammalian biology remain to be answered, particularly (i) what are the signaling systems/molecules that regulate FBLN-5 expression, (ii) what are the effects of FBLN-5 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and (iii) what are the signaling systems/molecules stimulated by FBLN-5. Through the use of expression proteomics, we show here that FBLN-5 is a novel TGF-β-inducible protein that regulated proliferation in a context-specific manner. Moreover, FBLN-5 expression enhanced the tumorigenicity of human fibrosarcoma cells and is altered dramatically during carcinogenesis, particularly in cancers of the kidney, breast, ovary, and colon. Finally, by enhancing activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, FBLN-5 expression synergizes with TGF-β in stimulating AP-1 activity in mink lung epithelial cells. Taken together, our findings have identified FBLN-5 as a novel gene target of TGF-β and provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the consequences of FBLN-5 expression on normal and abnormal cells. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was kindly provided by R & D Systems. The cDNA constructs encoding dominant-negative versions of FLAG-tagged Smad3/3A (pMX-Smad3/3A-IRES-GFP) and hemagglutinin-tagged MKK1 (pMCL-MKK1–8E) were generously provided by Drs. Xeudong Liu (University of Colorado) and Natalie Ahn (University of Colorado), respectively. The FLAG-tagged dominant-negative p38 MAPKα (pcDNA3-p38 MAPKα(KM)) and AP-1-luciferase (pAP-1-luciferase; Stratagene) plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Yi Qun Xiao (National Jewish Medical and Research Center), whereas the cyclin A-luciferase construct (pCAL2-luciferase) was generously supplied by Dr. Rik Derynck (University of California at San Francisco). Human dermal microvascular HMEC-1 endothelial cells were kindly provided by Drs. Edwin Ames, Thomas Lawley, and Francisco Candal (Centers for Disease Control). All additional supplies or reagents were routinely available. Full-length human and murine FBLN-5 cDNAs were PCR-amplified from expressed sequence tags H17726 andAW106432, respectively. The resulting PCR fragments were engineered to contain unique HindIII (N terminus) and SacII (C terminus) restriction sites for subcloning into the corresponding sites in pcDNA3.1/Myc-His B vector (Invitrogen) to C-terminally tag FBLN-5 with Myc and His6 tags. A retroviral FBLN-5 vector was synthesized by PCR amplifying the full-length Myc-His-tagged murine FBLN-5 cDNA using oligonucleotides containing XhoI (N terminus) andEcoRI (C terminus) restriction sites. Afterward, the resulting PCR product was ligated into identical sites located immediately upstream of the IRES in the bicistronic retroviral vector, pMSCV-IRES-GFP (11Ghaffari S., Wu, H. Gerlach M. Han Y. Lodish H.F. Daley G.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13186-13190Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of the FBLN-5 cDNA inserts were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 377A DNA sequencing machine. Murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were plated onto 10-cm dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Upon reaching ∼90% confluency, the cells were washed extensively in PBS and serum-starved in DMEM for 12 h at 37 °C. The quiescent 3T3-L1 cells were then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 for 12 h at 37 °C. Afterward, naı̈ve and TGF-β-CDM were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and concentrated by acetone precipitation prior to fractionation through 15% SDS-PAGE. The secreted proteins were visualized by silver staining and autoradiography of the dried gel. A differentially expressed ∼60-kDa protein that was evident in TGF-β-CDM was excised from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion as described previously (12Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were sprayed from nanoelectrospray needles supplied by Protana A/S (Odense, Denmark) and analyzed on a Micromass q-Tof mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) essentially as described earlier (13Kalume D.E. Stenflo J. Czerwiec E. Hambe B. Furie B.C. Furie B. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and analysis were performed on a Mass Lynx Windows NT PC data system. The quiescent 3T3-L1 cells and human dermal microvascular HMEC-1 endothelial cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 as above. Afterward, total RNA was isolated using the RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Test), and 10 μg was subsequently fractionated through 1.2% agarose, formaldehyde gels. After immobilizing to nylon membrane, the RNA was probed with a 32P-labeled human FBLN-5 cDNA probe (nucleotides 887–1437) for 60 min at 68 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed for 45 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS, followed by 45 min of washing at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS prior to visualization of the FBLN-5 mRNA by autoradiography. Tissue-specific expression of FBLN-5 mRNA in humans and mice was monitored by hybridizing human and murine multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) and a murine embryonic Northern blot (CLONTECH) to 32P-labeled species-specific FBLN-5 cDNA probes (human, nucleotides 887–1437; murine, 1056–1579). The procedures for hybridizing, washing, and visualizing FBLN-5 mRNA were identical to those above. Phoenix retroviral packaging cells (Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University) were cultured on 10-cm plates and transiently transfected at 70% confluency by overnight exposure to calcium phosphate precipitate containing 10 μg of pCL-Eco (14Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 10 μg of either pMSCV-IRES-GFP or pMSCV-FBLN-5-IRES-GFP. The transfectants were fed with fresh medium the following morning, and retroviral supernatants were collected 48 h later. Murine 3T3-L1 cells, human HT1080 fibrosarcoma (15Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and mink lung Mv1Lu cells epithelial cells (16Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were infected overnight with 5 ml of either control (i.e. pMSCV-IRES-GFP) or FBLN-5 retroviral supernates in the presence of 4 μg/ml of Polybrene. The cells were analyzed at 48 h for GFP expression on a FACSVantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson), and the highest 10% of GFP-expressing cells were expanded to generate stable populations that were ∼70% GFP-positive. These initial populations were subjected to a second round of GFP sorting on a MoFlo cell sorter (Cytomation), which yielded stable populations of control or FBLN-5-expressing cells with equivalent GFP levels at a positivity rate of ≥90%. These stable populations of 3T3-L1, HT1080, and Mv1Lu cells were used to analyze the effects of FBLN-5 on cell growth, motility, and invasion, as well as reporter gene expression and protein kinase activation. To detect inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, GFP- or FBLN-5-expressing cells were cultured onto 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells/well in complete DMEM supplemented with various concentrations of TGF-β1 (0–5 ng/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. During the final 4 h of stimulation, newly synthesized DNA was radiolabeled by adding [3H]thymidine to the culture medium. Afterward, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and subsequently solubilized in 0.5n NaOH prior to scintillation counting to determine radionucleotide incorporation into DNA. To detect stimulatory effects on DNA synthesis, GFP- or FBLN-5-expressing cells were also cultured onto 96-well plates at a density of 5,000–10,000 cells/well and were then incubated overnight in complete DMEM. The next day, the cells were washed twice in PBS and placed in serum-free DMEM with or without TGF-β1 as above. Cellular DNA was radiolabeled by the addition of [3H]thymidine during the final 12 h of stimulation and subsequently prepared for scintillation counting as above. The data are the means ± S.E. of five independent experiments presented as the percentages of [3H]thymidine incorporation normalized to untreated GFP-expressing cells. The effects of tumorigenesis on FBLN-5 expression were examined by hybridizing a 32P-radiolabeled full-length human FBLN-5 cDNA probe to a matched human normal/tumor cDNA array according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). FBLN-5 expression in normal and malignant human tissues was subsequently visualized by autoradiography. cDNA arrays were subsequently hybridized with a32P-labeled ubiquitin cDNA probe provided by the manufacturer. The expression of FBLN-5 was normalized to that of ubiquitin, and the ratio of FBLN-5 expression between individual pairs of normal and tumor tissue was determined. A ratio of ≥2 or ≤0.5 was considered significant. The effects of FBLN-5 on the motility and invasiveness of HT1080 cells were determined using a modified Boyden chamber assay essentially as described (17Edlund M. Miyamoto T. Sikes R.A. Ogle R. Laurie G.W. Farach-Carson M.C. Otey C.A. Zhau H.E. Chung L.W. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar,18Qing J. Maher V.M. Tran H. Argraves W.S. Dunstan R.W. McCormick J.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the underside of a porous membrane (8-μm pore, 24-well format; Becton Dickinson) was coated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 50 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen). Afterward, the fibronectin mixtures were removed and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (SFM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Dissociated GFP-expressing (i.e. control) or FBLN-5-expressing HT1080 cells were washed twice in serum-free media, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and subsequently cultured for 18–24 h at 37 °C in the upper chambers at a density of 100,000 cells/well. Afterward, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and immediately fixed for 10 min in 95% ethanol. After fixation, the cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed with a cotton swab, whereas those remaining in the lower chamber were stained with crystal violet. The effects of FBLN-5 on the invasiveness of HT1080 cells were determined similarly, except that GFP- or FBLN-5-expressing HT1080 cells were cultured onto Matrigel-coated membranes (Becton Dickinson). Approximately 48 h after plating, the cells migrating through the synthetic basement membranes were fixed and stained with crystal violet as above. The number of migrating or invading HT1080 cells was determined through three independent measures, all giving similar results: (i) manual counting under a light microscope, (ii) automated counting using the IPLab Spectrum Software package (Scanalytics Inc.), and (iii) extraction of crystal violet dye by incubating the membranes in 10% acetic acid, followed by spectrophotometry at 590 nm. The data are the means ± S.E. of nine independent experiments presented as the percentage of migration or invasion relative to GFP-expressing HT1080 cells. GFP- or FBLN-5-expressing Mv1Lu cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 22,500 cells/well for pCAL2-luciferase or at 45,000 cells/well for pAP-1-luciferase. The cells were transiently transfected the following day by overnight exposure to FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) liposomes containing 350 ng/well of total DNA comprised of 200 ng of either pCAL2-luciferase or pAP-1-luciferase, 0–100 ng of either pcDNA3-p38 MAPKα(KM) or pMCL-MKK1–8E, and 50 ng of pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH), which was used to control for differences in transfection efficiencies. The following morning the cells were washed twice in PBS and were incubated for 18 h in serum-free DMEM with or without TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for AP-1-luciferase assays or for 48 h in DMEM, 1% FBS with or without TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for cyclin A-luciferase assays. Afterward, the luciferase and β-gal activities contained in detergent-solubilized cell extracts were determined. Unless otherwise indicated, the data are the mean luciferase activities ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments normalized to untreated GFP-expressing cells. GFP- or FBLN-5-expressing cells were cultured onto 6-cm dishes. Upon reaching ∼90% confluency, the cells were washed twice in PBS and were serum-starved in DMEM for 60 min prior to stimulation with TGF-β1 for 0–24 h at 37 °C. Afterward, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 350 μl of buffer H, 1% Triton X-100 (19Schiemann W.P. Pfeifer W.M. Levi E. Kadin M.E. Lodish H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the resulting whole cell extracts were clarified by microcentrifugation. The stimulation of protein kinase activities was determined by fractionating 15–25 μg/lane of clarified whole cell extract through 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferring them electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Afterward, the membrane was probed with a 1:500–1:1000 dilution of either anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-phospho-p38 MAPK polyclonal antibodies (New England Biolabs), and the resulting immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The differences in protein loading were monitored by reprobing stripped membranes with a 1:1000 dilution of either anti-ERK1 or anti-p38 MAPK polyclonal antibodies. The immunocomplexes were visualized as above. Alternatively, human 293T cells were cultured on 10-cm plates and transiently transfected at ∼80% confluency by overnight exposure to FuGENE 6 liposomes containing 30 μg/plate of either pcDNA3.1/Myc-His or pcDNA3.1/FBLN-5/Myc-His. The ensuing morning the cells were washed twice in PBS and cultured in serum-free DMEM (6 ml) for 24–48 h at 37 °C. Afterward, control (i.e. empty vector transfectants) or FBLN-5-CDM was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Aliquots (1 ml) of control or FBLN-5-CDM were then used to stimulate quiescent 3T3-L1 cells cultured on 6-well plates for 0–30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the activation ERK1/2 by CDM was assessed by immunoblot analysis as described above. To identify secretory proteins whose expression are regulated by TGF-β, the proteins present in naı̈ve and TGF-β-CDM of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were concentrated and fractionated through SDS-PAGE. Differentially expressed proteins regulated by TGF-β were excised and subjected to in situtrypsinization prior to identification by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 1, a ∼60-kDa protein was prominent in TGF-β-CDM but not in naı̈ve CDM. Sequencing of a single peptide by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis returned an amino acid sequence of NH2-YPGAYYIFQIK-COOH, corresponding to residues 374–384 of murine FBLN-5. FBLN-5 is a recently identified 448-amino acid member of the Fibulin family (9Kowal R.C. Richardson J.A. Miano J.M. Olson E.N. Circ.

Like other Fibulins, FBLN-5 contains multiple calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like repeats (i.e.six) and a globular C-terminal domain; it also contains an integrin-binding RGD motif that binds αvβ3, αvβ5, and α9β1integrins (4Nakamura T. Lozano P.R. Ikeda Y. Iwanaga Y. Hinek A. Minamisawa S. Cheng C.F. Kobuke K. Dalton N. Takada Y. Tashiro K. Ross Jr J. Honjo T. Chien K.R.

Mice deficient in FBLN-5 expression are viable but exhibit pronounced abnormalities of the skin, lung, and vasculature resulting from profound elastic fiber disorganization (i.e. elastinopathy). Thus, FBLN-5 regulates organogenesis and, like other Fibulins, is widely expressed in throughout human and murine tissues (Fig.2, A and B, and Refs. 9Kowal R.C. Richardson J.A. Miano J.M. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1166-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and 10Nakamura T. Ruiz-Lozano P. Lindner V. Yabe D. Taniwaki M. Furukawa Y. Kobuke K. Tashiro K., Lu, Z. Andon N.L. Schaub R.

Not surprisingly, we found that FBLN-5 expression is induced significantly during embryogenesis (Fig. 2C). To confirm that FBLN-5 expression was induced by TGF-β and to establish the mechanism for this effect, we performed Northern blot analysis on total RNA prepared from TGF-β-treated 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with TGF-β stimulated the synthesis of FBLN-5 transcript in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Thus, FBLN-5 is indeed a novel gene target for TGF-β in 3T3-L1 cells. The biological actions of TGF-β are mediated primarily through its stimulation of a relatively simple signaling system that at its core is comprised of three TGF-β receptors, types I, II, and III, and three latent transcription factors, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (20Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 21Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). To determine whether TGF-β-mediated induction of FBLN-5 expression was Smad2/3-dependent, we infected 3T3-L1 cells with control (i.e. GFP) or dominant-negative Smad3/3A retrovirus (pMX-Smad3/3A-IRES-GFP) (16Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and cells expressing GFP were isolated by flow cytometry to establish stable polyclonal populations of control and Smad3/3A-expressing 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3B, stable expression of dominant-negative Smad3/3A in 3T3-L1 cells significantly inhibited their synthesis of DNA as compared with control 3T3-L1 cells. The ability of Smad3/3A to reduce 3T3-L1 cell DNA synthesis in the absence of serum or growth factors implicates autocrine TGF-β signaling as a mediator of 3T3-L1 cell growth. Accordingly, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with TGF-β significantly stimulated their synthesis of DNA in a dose-dependent manner; this response to TGF-β was completely abrogated by overexpression of dominant-negative Smad3/3A in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig.3B). In contrast, overexpression of dominant-negative Smad3/3A failed to inhibit the ability of TGF-β to stimulate FBLN-5 expression in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these findings establish FBLN-5 as a novel TGF-β-inducible gene target whose expression when stimulated by TGF-β proceeds through a Smad2/3-independent pathway. In addition to mediating endothelial cell adhesion (10Nakamura T. Ruiz-Lozano P. Lindner V. Yabe D. Taniwaki M. Furukawa Y. Kobuke K. Tashiro K., Lu, Z. Andon N.L. Schaub R. Matsumori A. Sasayama S.

The addition of EDTA to a calcium-saturated serine racemase evokes a profound conformational change, as monitored by both fluorescence and circular dichroism techniques. Fluorescence titration allowed us to calculate a binding constant for calcium of 6.2 μm. Reagents that react with sulfhydryl groups, such as cystamine, were potent inhibitors of SR, in a clear reflection that one or more cysteine residues are important for enzyme activity. Additionally, 16 serine analogues were tested as a putative SR substrate or inhibitors. Significant inhibition was only observed forl-Ser-O-sulfate, l-cycloserine, andl-cysteine. Finally, activation of brain SR as a result of the changes in calcium concentration was studied in primary astrocytes. Treatment of astrocytes with the calcium ionophore A23187, as well as with compounds that augment the intracellular calcium levels such as glutamate or kainate led to an increase in the amount ofd-serine present in the extracellular medium.

These protoplasmic astrocytes typically ensheath synapses, strongly suggesting a role for d-serine in synaptic transmission. Serine racemase is highly enriched in the brain and co-localizes with d-serine according to immunohistochemical analysis (6Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Additionally, d-serine is concentrated in regions enriched inN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)1 receptors (i.e. highest in the forebrain), whereas the levels of the previously identified NMDA receptor coactivator, glycine, are lowest in this region (7Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 8Schell M.J. Brady R.O. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, recent reports have also identifiedd-serine in neuronal cells, such a pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and neurons in the nucleus of the trapezoid body (9Yasuda E., Ma, N. Semba R. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 299: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The initial observation of Kleckner and Dingledine (10Kleckner N.W. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar) thatd-serine could substitute for glycine in terms of NMDA receptor coactivation when transfected in Xenopus oocytes was followed by its confirmation in cultured neurons (11Wroblewski J.T. Fadda E. Mazzetta J. Lazarewicz J.W. Costa E. Neuropharmacology. 1989; 28: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Paudice P. Gemignani A. Raiteri M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2934-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NMDA receptor channel activity can be potentiated by concentrations as low as 6.5–10.0 μmd-serine (13Matsui T. Sekiguchi M. Hashimoto A. Tomita U. Nishikawa T. Wada K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Galli A. Franchi-Micheli S. Mori F. Luzzi S. Zilleti L. Neuropharmacology. 1990; 29: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, support for the role of d-serine as a neuromodulator is strengthened by the fact that both glutamate and agonists of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, such as kainate, promote the release of d-serine from astrocytes (7Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Additionally, selective degradation of extracellular d-serine using exogenously added amino acid oxidase greatly attenuates NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, as monitored by the increase in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase activity or cGMP levels (15Mothet J.P. Parent A.T. Wolosker H. Brady R.O., Jr. Linden D.J. Ferris C.D. Rogawski M.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Inspection of the murine (6Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and human (16De Miranda J. Santoro A. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) serine racemase cDNA reveals an overall sequence identity of 88%. In addition, putative homologs of serine racemase with previously unknown function are also found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana (6Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The PLP-binding region of serine racemase is located in the N-terminal region of the protein and displays significant homology to other members of the PLP family, such as the enzymes of the serine/threonine dehydratase family (6Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 16De Miranda J. Santoro A. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, recombinant mouse serine racemase isolated from mammalian cells fused to glutathione S-transferase has been used to show that l-serine O-sulfate is a nonnatural substrate and inhibitor, which is able to transform its racemase activity into that of an eliminase (17Panizzutti R., De Miranda J. Ribeiro C.S. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since the eliminase reaction toward the alternative substrate is 500 times faster than its natural reaction, detection of the presence of serine racemase in cultures can become greatly improved (17Panizzutti R., De Miranda J. Ribeiro C.S. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We report herein the characterization of recombinant brain serine racemase expressed in E. coli in large quantities. The recombinant enzyme was active only in the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and manganese. The binding of calcium to the enzyme results in major conformational changes. Finally, we demonstrate that both glutamate- and A23187 ionophore-induced calcium entrance in astrocytes also lead to the activation of the serine racemase with a concomitant increase in the detected extracellular concentration ofd-Ser. Ultrapure l-serine was purchased from NovaBiochem (Switzerland). d-Serine,l-cysteine, guanidineacetic acid,O-methyl-dl-serine, cystamine dihydrochloride, β-chloro-l-alanine, and amino acid oxidase from porcine kidney were from Sigma. l-Serine,l-serine-O-benzyl, l-serine methyl ester, l-serine-O-sulfate, andl-serine-O-acetate were from Bachem (Switzerland). R(−)-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid,d-cycloserine, and l-2-aminobutyric acid were from Fluka. l-Cycloserine, l-homoserine, benzyloxyacetaldehyde diethyl acetal, and acetamide were from Aldrich.l-Threonine and phosphorous trichloride were from Merck. Horseradish peroxidase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.45CaCl2 was purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Anti-serine racemase antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The plasmid encoding the cDNA of mouse serine racemase was a generous gift from Dr. S. H. Snyder (Department of Neurosciences, Johns Hopkins University). Two oligonucleotides were used to amplify the cDNA: 5′-AGGCAGCAGAGACATATGTGTG-3′ and 5′-TCTTGTCTAGATTAAACAGAAA-3′, where novelNdeI and XbaI sites were introduced at the initiation Met residue and at the stop codons, respectively (underlined sequences). The amplified fragment of DNA (∼1,030 bp) was subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) and confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The pGEM-T-SR plasmid was double-digested withNdeI plus XbaI, and the excised fragment of DNA was ligated into the corresponding sites of the poly-His-pCWori vector (18Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). BL21 (DE3)-competent cells (Novagen) were transformed with the pCWori-SR vector and an overnight 50-ml culture was used to inoculate each of three 2.8-liter flasks containing 1.5 liters of 2× YT medium. Typically, 6 liters of cell culture were grown at a time in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1.0 and induced by the addition of 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The four flasks of E. coli cultures were then grown at 30 °C at 240 rpm for 16–20 h before the cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen in plastic bags as thin films and stored at −80 °C. Construction of a recombinant SR with a removable tag was performed using the oligonucleotide 5′-ATTAATCTGGTTCCGCGTGGATTCGCTCAGTACTG-3′ that includes a novel Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Phe-Ala sequence that can be cleaved by thrombin. This oligonucleotide was used to amplify the 5′-end of the cDNA. The frozen cell paste was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Mops, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm pepstatin) plus 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. The cells were lysed by sonication (three cycles of 3 min at medium potency on ice) and centrifuged in a SS34 rotor (Sorvall) for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. All the purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Since the pCWori used to express the recombinant SR has a hexahistidine tag translated in frame at the amino end of the coding region (18Rodriguez-Crespo I. Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11462-11467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), purification of the protein was initially performed by affinity chromatography. The clear cellular supernatant was then passed through Whatman filter paper before loading on a 5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A followed by another 25 ml of buffer A plus 30 mm imidazole. The protein was subsequently eluted with buffer A plus 200 mm imidazole. The yellow fractions were collected, 0.5 mm pyridoxal phosphate was added, and they were extensively dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium carbonate, pH 8.5, 5 mm NaCl. After dialysis, the samples were lyophilized and then resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Mops, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT and loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR column equilibrated in the same buffer. Aliquots of ∼200 μl were injected each time, and the column was run at 1 ml/min. The fractions eluting at ∼11–13 ml, which corresponded to both dimers and tetramers of SR (see below), were collected and pooled. We discarded fractions eluting at larger volumes due to the contamination with smaller fragments. The pooled fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −20 °C. When the removal of the recombinant tag by thrombin was required, this additional step was introduced between the affinity column and the gel filtration column in order to remove any traces of thrombin that might be present in the latter purification step. Identical elution profiles were obtained in the Superdex 200 HR column in the absence or presence of the hexa-His tag. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using either a 0.1-cm path length cell for the far UV measurements or a 1-cm path length cell for the near UV and visible measurements, in all cases at 25 °C. The temperature in the cuvette was regulated with a Neslab RT-11 circulating water bath. The protein concentration was 0.1–0.5 mg/ml. The buffer used was 50 mm ammonium carbonate, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT. A minimum of five spectra were accumulated for each sample, and the contribution of the buffer was always subtracted. The resultant spectra were smoothed using J715 noise reduction software. The values of mean residue molar ellipticities [Θ] (degrees × cm2 × dmol−1) were calculated on the basis of an average M r value of 110 per residue. Deconvolution of the circular dichroism data was performed according to the convex constraint analysis method (19Perczel A. Hollosi M. Tusnady G. Fasman G.D. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which relies on an algorithm that calculates the contribution of the secondary structure elements that give rise to the original spectral curve without referring to spectra from model systems. Thermal denaturing curves of recombinant SR in the presence of either 1 mm calcium or 1 mm EDTA were recorded at 1 °C/min using a 1.78 nm solution of pure SR in 20 mm Tris, 20 mm Mops, pH 7.8, 20 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT. Ellipticity in millidegrees was measured at 220 nm. The temperature of the CD cuvette was regulated by a Neslab RT-11 water bath that was computer-controlled. Fluorescence studies were carried out on a SLM Aminco 8000C spectrofluorimeter, fit with a 450-W xenon arc, using 4-nm slits for both excitation and emission beams. A 0.4-cm excitation path length and a 1-cm emission path length quartz cell was used. In all cases, the protein concentration was 0.05–0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Mops, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl buffer. The temperature in the cuvette, 25 °C, was maintained by a circulating water bath. Excitation was performed at 275 or 295 nm, and emission spectra were measured over a range of 280–450 nm. The contribution of the background (buffer) was subtracted in every case, and the spectra were then corrected for the instrument response according to the program software. The binding constant for calcium was obtained from the x intercept of a double reciprocal plot of (F − F 0)/(F t − F 0) versus the calcium concentration, where F is the fluorescence signal 320 nm at a certain calcium concentration, F t is the fluorescence signal at 320 nm in the presence of saturating concentrations of calcium, and F 0 is the fluorescence signal in the absence of calcium. Aliquots of 100 μl of ∼2 mg/ml of recombinant racemase were injected into a GP 250 plus fast protein liquid chromatography system equipped with two P-500 pumps and a Superdex HR200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Separation was performed at 25 °C, and protein detection was performed at 280 nm. The flow rate was kept at 1 ml/min, and the buffer consisted of 20 mmMops, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Ca2+. The column void volume was determined with dextran blue, and the total volume was determined with potassium ferricyanide. The column was calibrated with proteins from a gel filtration kit (Sigma), including thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa). The calibration curve was obtained by plotting the (v e −v 0)/(v t −v 0) ratio against the log of the molecular mass, where v e is the elution volume of the protein,v 0 is the void volume of the column, andv t is the total bed volume of the column. A routine colorimetric assay with 200 μl of total sample was used with l-serine as a substrate, coupling the appearance of d-serine to commerciald-amino acid oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, plus the peroxidase substrate o-phenylenediamine. Thed-serine that was produced during the incubation period was degraded by d-amino acid oxidase, which specifically targets d-amino acids generating α-keto acid, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide was quantified using horseradish peroxidase and o-phenylenediamine, which turns yellow upon oxidation. The activity of serine racemase was determined in the presence of 20 mm Mops, pH 8.1, 10 μl of purified enzyme (5 μg approximately), 10 mml-Ser, 0.03 mm DTT, 5 μm PLP, 50 μg/mlo-phenylenediamine, 1 nm FAD, 0.2 mg/mld-amino acid oxidase, and 0.01 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase. The reactions (200-μl final volume) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h before measuring the absorbance at 411 nm with a Beckman DU-7 spectrophotometer. The d-serine present in a given sample was determined by correlating the absorbance at 411 nm with d-serine calibration curves. d-Serine measurements were not influenced by the concentration ofl-isomers present in the sample. Since standard commerciall-serine preparations contain trace amounts ofd-serine, it was necessary to purchase ultrapurel-serine from Bachem Inc. (Switzerland) to achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. Once optimized, this three-enzyme assay was able to detect d-serine formed in an unknown 100-μl sample in a linear range from 50 μm to 1 mm (up to 0.1 μmol total of d-serine). Since it is possible that certain serine analogues are capable of being substrates for d-amino acid oxidase (causing an artificial increase in signal), as well as potential inhibitors ofd-amino acid oxidase or horseradish peroxidase (causing an artificial decrease in signal), appropriate controls were in place to identify and, subsequently, account for these effects. Inhibition curves were fitted to a sigmoidal curve using the equation, y=a/(1+exp(−(x−x0)/b))Equation 1 where y represents the percentage SR activity, andx is the inhibitor concentration. Every inhibition curve was systematically repeated a minimum of three times, with the error bars indicating one S.D. Additionally, we used an HPLC assay when the concentrations ofd-serine to be determined were below the 100 μm range. Derivatization of d-serine andl-serine mixtures was performed with Marfey reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-5-l-alanine amide) (Pierce) as previously described (20Martinez del Pozo A. Merola M. Ueno H. Manning J.M. Tanizawa K. Nishimura K. Soda K. Ringe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17784-17789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, 50 μl of the problem sample were mixed with 20 μl of a 1.0 m solution of sodium bicarbonate. Then 200 μl of Marfey reagent (1% solution in acetone) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 1 h in a block heater. The mixture was subsequently cooled down, and 10 μl of 2 m HCl were added. Separation of the d-serine from l-serine was performed using a C-18 Kromasil 100 column (15.0 × 0,46 cm) isocratically using methanol as the eluent in a 0.02 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) plus methanol (80:20) (21Szokan G. Mezo G. Hudecz F. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 444: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The absorbance was monitored at 340 nm with a Beckman detector module 166. Calibration curves were constructed after injection of known amounts of l- andd-serine. 1-Amino-2-hydroxyethane phosphonic acid was synthesized according to the method described by Lejczak and co-workers (22Lejczak, B., Kafarski, P., Soroka, M., and Mastalerz, P. (1984)Synthesis 577–580Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Acetamide (1.18 g, 20 mmol) was mixed with glacial acetic acid (3 ml) before cooling to 0 °C. To the stirring solution was added acetyl chloride (710 μl, 10 mmol) dropwise over a period of 5 min, causing the formation of a white precipitate. Benzyloxyacetaldehyde diethyl acetal (2.02 ml, 10.5 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight. Phosphorous trichloride (970 μl, 10 mmol) was added to the red reaction before refluxing for 1.5 h. The solution was cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. The dark syrup was dissolved in concentrated HCl (30 ml), refluxed for 7 h, and evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The resultant residue was taken up in water (50 ml) and treated with activated charcoal before concentrating to about 3 ml. It was then passed through a Dowex 50W X8, 200-mesh column, eluting with water. The ninhydrine-positive fractions were combined and concentrated to <0.5 ml, and the product was subsequently precipitated with absolute ethanol. Filtering yielded ∼50 mg of pure product as confirmed by the proton NMR and mass spectra. We tested the binding of radioactive calcium to serine racemase both in dot-blot and in a sample that was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE. In either case, the nitrocellulose membrane containing 0.5 nmol of SR (SDS-PAGE sample) or 2 nmol of SR (dot-blot sample) was washed for 5 min with 2 mm EGTA followed by three 5-min washes with 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2. Afterward, the membranes were incubated for 15 min with 6 μm45CaCl2 (3,000 mCi/mmol) in the same buffer. The excess of 45CaCl2 was removed with two 30-s washes in 500 ml of distilled water. The membranes were subsequently allowed to dry, and they were used to expose photographic film for 8–12 h at −80 °C. Cortical astrocytes were derived from 24-h Wistar rats and cultured in serum-containing medium as described before (23Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For all of the experimental determinations performed, the serum-containing medium was removed, and cells were transferred to a chemically defined, serum-free medium consisting of BME basal medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml transferrin, 20 nm progesterone, 50 μm putrescine, 30 nm sodium selenite, and 10 mml-Ser of the highest purity available. The absence of Ser in the commercial media was strictly necessary in order to avoid high levels of contaminating d-Ser. pCWori is known to be a suitable vector for the recombinant expression of proteins in E. coli with prosthetic groups bound. Unlike vectors with strong promoters, such as the T7 promoter of pET plasmids, recombinant expression of proteins in pCWori leads to a steady and constant synthesis of the desired polypeptide that typically allows the E. coli machinery to keep up with other cellular functions, such as the formation and insertion of protein cofactors. In the present work, cloning of the SR gene into pCWori, transformation of BL21 E. coli cells with pCWori-SR, and growth of cells at 30 °C resulted in expression of functional SR as determined by activity assays. Expression of the protein with the polyhistidine tag yielded 3–6 mg of purified protein from 6 liters of culture. Purification using the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column provided protein that was ∼75% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). Improvement of the purity of the serine racemase preparations was obtained after lyophilization of the dialyzed sample (in order to remove the imidazole) followed by the loading of the protein onto a gel filtration column. This second purification step yielded an homogenous protein preparation as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). The faint larger bands that could be observed in the gel reflected the presence of dimers and tetramers of the protein that resist the denaturing conditions, since they reacted with anti-SR antibodies. In this regard, aging of the enzyme led to the progressive increase in the relative ratio of these bands. We developed a colorimetric activity assay for murine serine racemase based on the transformation of l-serine intod-serine, which was then used as a substrate ofd-amino acid oxidase with the concomitant release of hydrogen peroxide. Detection of H2O2 was performed with peroxidase and o-phenylenediamine as substrate, which displays a defined yellow absorbance at 411 nm when it becomes oxidized. Analysis of the purified serine racemase activity using Michaelis-Menten kinetics rendered a K m value of 4.8 mm when l-serine was used as a substrate (Fig. 1 B). The V max of SR, as determined by this colorimetric assay, was ∼112 nmol·mg−1·min−1 at 37 °C. These results agree with previous data reported for tissue-purified and recombinant protein obtained from mammalian cells (5Wolosker H. Sheth K.N. Takahashi M. Mothet J.P. Brady R.O., Jr. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 17Panizzutti R., De Miranda J. Ribeiro C.S. Engelender S. Wolosker H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Incubation of recombinant SR with EDTA, a chelator of divalent cations, almost abrogates the synthesis ofd-serine (Fig.2 A), whereas the incubation of the purified enzyme with both calcium and manganese results in an increase in the activity levels to 134 and 153%, respectively. This increase in the SR activity levels was also studied in the presence of other divalent cations; Fe2+ and Ni2+ had a very limited effect, whereas Mg2+ was capable of augmenting the activity to 112%. The addition of Zn2+ to the activity assay, on the other hand, led to lower activity levels (Fig.2 A). The existence of racemase activity in the recombinant enzyme in the absence of any added divalent cation very likely reflects a certain degree of saturation with cations that are present during the protein expression inside E. coli or during the purification process. These results not only indicate that SR is regulated by the presence of divalent cations but also provide direct evidence that chelation of any of these cations bound during the protein expression and purification prevents the enzyme from synthesizingd-serine. Since SR is known to be sensitive to the presence of oxidized glutathione (5Wolosker H. Sheth K.N. Takahashi M. Mothet J.P. Brady R.O., Jr. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. N"

The prominent membrane localization of PLCδ1PH-GFP was paralleled with high affinity binding to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) as well as to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-containing lipid vesicles or nitrocellulose membrane strips.

The N-terminal ligand binding domain of the type I InsP3 receptor also failed to localize to the plasma membrane despite its 5-fold higher affinity to InsP3 than the PH domains. By using a chimeric approach and cassette mutagenesis, the C-terminal α-helix and the short loop between the β6–β7 sheets of the PLCδ1PH domain, in addition to its InsP3-binding region, were identified as critical components for membrane localization in intact cells. These data indicate that binding to the inositol phosphate head group is necessary but may not be sufficient for membrane localization of the PLCδ1PH-GFP fusion protein, and motifs located within the C-terminal half of the PH domain provide auxiliary contacts with additional membrane components.

PI(4,5)P2 is also phosphorylated by class I PI 3-kinases to form PI(3,4,5)P3, which controls membrane recruitment and the functions of several important signaling proteins (3Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 itself is a regulator of a great variety of target molecules, including ion channels (4Zhang H., He, C. Yan X. Mirshaki T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Czirjak G. Pethö G.L. Spät A. Enyedi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and several proteins that regulate actin polymerization and the cytoskeleton (see Ref. 6Janmey P.A. Xian W. Flanagan L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), providing a link between the plasma membrane and the cortical cytoskeleton (7Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 has been implicated in several forms of membrane remodeling events, including the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (8Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), clathrin-mediated endocytosis (9Jost M. Simpson F. Kavran J.M. Lemmon M.A. Schmid S.L.

Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) (also see Ref. 13Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar for a review). Such diverse functions must rely upon interaction of the lipid with a large number of regulatory molecules. Most proteins that bind PI(4,5)P2 contain a sequence composed of basic residues that provide electrostatic interaction with the phosphate groups of the inositol ring (6Janmey P.A. Xian W. Flanagan L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent advances revealing the three-dimensional structures of several protein motifs that bind phosphoinositides offer a deeper insight into their molecular recognition (14Hurley J.H. Meyer T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One of the first protein modules capable of binding membrane PI(4,5)P2 was identified in pleckstrin, the major protein kinase C substrate in platelets (15Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains have since been described in a large number of signaling proteins, and they show remarkable specificity in recognizing various forms of inositides. It is generally believed that at least one of the functions of PH domains is to provide proper localization of proteins via interactions with inositol phospholipids. However, some PH domains have also been shown to bind proteins (16Tsukada S. Simon M. Witte O. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Yao L. Suzuki H. Ozawa K. Deng J. Lehel C. Fukamachi H. Anderson W.B. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their protein binding together with lipid binding may act in concert to regulate the localization and/or the function of those proteins. In addition to PH domains, additional motifs, such as FYVE domains (19Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,20Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. deBeer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the PX domains (21Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), have been shown to bind phosphoinositides, namely the lipid product of the class III PI 3-kinases.Because recognition of inositol lipids by PH domains is based on the specific interaction of key surface residues with the phosphate groups of the inositide head group (23Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that many (although not all) PH domains also bind to the soluble inositol phosphate counterpart of their lipid binding partner, a feature that is widely utilized to study their binding properties (24Fukuda M. Kojima T. Kabayama H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30303-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is also known that hydrophobic interactions also contribute to the membrane localization of PH domains (25Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In the case of several PH domains it is not quite clear whether membrane localization via lipid binding or binding to soluble inositol phosphates is more important for their regulation. For example, the membrane localization of PLCδ1 via its PH domain and hence its activity is regulated by InsP3 levels (26Garcia P. Gupta R. Shah S. Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Scarlata S. Petrova V. McLaughlin S. Rebecchi M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16228-16234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Rapid and large InsP3 increases can translocate a PLCδ1PH-GFP fusion protein from the membrane to the cytosol (27Hiroshe K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 28van Der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Also, the PH domain of the InsP4-binding protein, GAP1IP4BP, is believed to be the target of InsP4 (29Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), but it also anchors the protein to the membrane via phosphoinositide binding (30Cozier G.E. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T.H. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to investigate the question of whether binding to the inositol phosphate head group (such as to InsP3) or to the lipid, PI(4,5)P2, is sufficient to localize a PH domain to the cell membrane. While creating protein domains with high InsP3 binding affinity, we also explored the possibility whether such molecules could be used as research tools to alter Ca2+ signaling by sequestering InsP3.Here we used the PH domains of PLCδ1 and the recently cloned PLC-like protein, p130, as well as the InsP3 binding domain of the type I InsP3 receptor to demonstrate that high affinity binding to InsP3 or even to PI(4,5)P2 is not sufficient to recruit these proteins to the plasma membrane. We also propose that regions other than those participating in recognition of the inositide head group are important for the membrane recruitment of the PLCδ1 PH domain and perhaps of other similar protein modules.DISCUSSIONThere is increasing interest to understand the principles that govern regulation of many cellular functions by the highly compartmentalized changes in the levels of inositol phospholipids. An important aspect of this research is the characterization of structural features of the protein modules that interact with the inositide head group of inositides in the membrane. Several recent studies have analyzed the structural basis of the specific recognition of 3-phosphorylated inositides by PH domains and have pointed to the significance of the short variable loops between the β1–β2 and β3–β4 strands of such domains (46Ferguson K.M.

Cronin T. Klarlund J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 385-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Similarly, the structural features determining the binding of FYVE domains (19Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20Kutateladze T.G. Ogburn K.D. Watson W.T. deBeer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 48Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and PX domains to PI(3)P have been recently revealed (21Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 49Hiroaki H. Ago T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To test specificity and compare relative affinities, it is convenient to analyze the binding properties of PH and other protein domains using soluble inositol phosphates and inositol lipids in vitro. However, it is equally important to test these interactions within the intact cell, because it is not possible to mimic in the test tube the exact conditions that prevail at cellular membranes.Our interest in characterizing PH domains is originated from the need to understand and evaluate their usefulness in imaging inositide dynamics in living cells (31Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The interpretation of the results of such imaging studies clearly depends on the molecular recognition properties of the protein domains. Several data suggest that various inositide binding domains interact only with a certain subset of the inositide pools (31Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The restricted recognition of PI(4,5)P2 by the PLCδ1PH-GFP only within the plasma membrane prompted us to investigate other related PH domains for their PI(4,5)P2 recognition properties. The PH domain of the p130 protein was one of our choices due to its similarity to PLCδ1PH. The p130 protein has been originally described as an InsP3-binding protein that was purified on an InsP3 affinity matrix (42Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Hirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6518-6525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent cloning of the protein revealed that it is a PLC homologue lacking PLC enzymatic activity and showing the greatest similarity to the yeast protein PLC1, the Drosophila NorpA, and mammalian PLCδ (50Kanematsu T. Yoshimura K. Hidaka K. Takeuchi H. Katan M. Hirata M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2731-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly to PLCδ1, p130 possesses a PH domain that is responsible for the ability of the protein to bind InsP3. Interestingly, despite its InsP3binding, the GFP-tagged p130 protein was found not to localize to membranes (51Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V.V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and although wild-type p130 was reported to be associated with membranes when expressed in COS-7 cells, this association was not mediated by the PH domain (52Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Hirata M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, consistent with its InsP3 binding, the ability of p130 to bind the second messenger InsP3 has been demonstrated in intact cells because its overexpression altered both Ca2+signaling and InsP3 metabolism (51Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V.V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The physiological function of this protein is still unknown, but it has been speculated that it might be important as a buffer of InsP3 (51Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V.V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The present study clearly showed that InsP3 binding even with high affinity, such as that of the type I InsP3receptor, is not sufficient to localize a protein to the membranes of intact cells through simple binding to the head group of PI(4,5P)2. However, these experiments also show that even binding to the lipid PI(4,5)P2 does not necessarily lead to membrane association. The small difference found between the PI(4,5)P2-binding properties of isolated p130PH and PLCδ1PH in vitro does not easily explain the striking difference between the abilities of the two domains to localize to the plasma membrane. The PH domain of PLCδ4was found to associate with cellular membranes with binding to PI(4,5)P2 containing liposomes similar to that of p130PH-GFP. 2S. B. Lee, P. Varnai, and T. Balla, unpublished observations. Our data obtained with chimeras constructed from the PH domains of PLCδ1 and p130 showed that the regions primarily responsible for InsP3 binding (localized within the N-terminal half of the PH domain) are to some extent interchangeable between the two PH domains, consistent with their almost identical InsP3 binding affinities. It is the C-terminal half of the PLCδ1 PH domain that seems to contain additional feature(s) that are needed for membrane localization. Within this half of the molecule, we were able to identify the short loop between the β6–β7 strands of PLCδ1PH as a sequence that aides membrane localization. However, the surprising loss of membrane localization of the PLCδ1PH when containing the C-terminal helix of p130 also indicates important contributions from the helical tail. Further attempts to pinpoint single amino acids that determine membrane localization failed to produce conclusive results.It is not clear at present how the C-terminal helix could affect membrane localization. However, it has been reported that binding of PLCδ1PH to PI(4,5)P2-containing lipid vesicles (but not to soluble Ins(1,4,5)P3) was increased by Ca2+ when the C-terminally adjacent EF-hand motifs were added to the PH domain (53Yamamoto T. Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Allen V. Yagisawa H. Kikkawa U. Watanabe Y. Nakasima A. Katan M. Hirata M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This indicates a conformational change that affects lipid binding and that is initiated via the C-terminal sequences. It has also been reported that a point mutation within the PH domain of PLCδ1 greatly increased the catalytic activity of the enzyme (54Bromann P.A. Boetticher E.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16240-16246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), further suggesting a reciprocal communication between the various domains of the PLCδ1protein. It is also possible that a putative interacting protein contributes to the membrane localization of the PLCδ1PH domain. Further studies will be needed to clarify these questions and to identify a possible protein-binding partner. Several PH domains have been shown to bind βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (16Tsukada S. Simon M. Witte O. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,18Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) including several PLC isoforms and even PLCδ1PH itself (55Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 56Barr A.J. Ali H. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Smrcka A.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the few cases where their sites of interaction were mapped, the determinants to bind inositides and those with βγ subunits did not completely overlap, the latter mostly being found toward the C-terminal end of the PH domain (56Barr A.J. Ali H. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Smrcka A.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 57Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a recent detailed study (58Carman C.V. Barak L.S. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Onorato J.J. Kennedy S.P. Caron M.G. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) localized some key residues important for βγ binding of GRK2 to the C-terminal helix of its PH domain. Therefore, βγ subunits are possible candidates to interact with PLCδ1PH to aid its membrane localization. However, overexpression of a construct containing the βγ-binding region of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (59Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) to sequester βγ-subunits did not significantly affect the membrane localization of PLCδ1PH-GFP. 3T. Balla, unpublished observations. In a recent study, the p130PH-GFP fusion protein (but not the full-length p130-GFP) was found to localize to the membranes in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (51Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V.V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The p130PH domain used in those studies was fused to the C terminus of GFP as opposed to our initial construct in which it was in the N terminus of GFP. This prompted us to create the same GFP-p130PH protein that was used in the studies of Takeuchi et al. (51Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V.V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and to use additional cells types, including Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, to test the distribution of the protein. None of the p130PH domain constructs showed membrane localization in our studies in any of the cells tested, and we have no explanation for the discrepancy between our findings and those of Takeuchi et al. (51Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V.V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that the lack of membrane localization in our experiments was observed with the same construct that showed InsP3 as well as PI(4,5)P2 binding comparable with those observed with PLCδ1PH-GFP.Finally, our results also demonstrate that it is possible to use isolated protein domains to manipulate the level of inositol phosphates within intact cells with clearly detectable consequences on Ca2+ signaling. Such an approach has been reported recently (60Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41343-41349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and will be very useful for the analysis of InsP3-mediated signaling and to give estimates on the free InsP3 levels that are present in intact cells. These data also point to the importance of InsP3 buffering inside the cells and may explain why the estimated InsP3concentrations (based on total mass measurements) have been found so high (even in resting cells) that they would saturate the InsP3 receptor (61Bradford P.G. Rubin R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15644-15647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these novel tools to manipulate InsP3 changes could add to our understanding on the physiology of this second messenger.In summary, using the PH domains of PLCδ1 and the p130 protein, as well as the InsP3 binding domain of the type I InsP3 receptor, we demonstrate that binding to the inositol phosphate head group of PI(4,5)P2 by the PLCδ1 PH domain is necessary but may not be sufficient to localize this protein to cellular membranes. Additional regions within the C-terminal half of the PH domain, namely the loop between the β6 and β7 sheets and the C-terminal α-helix, are needed for this function. Exploration of the structural features that determine PH domain interaction with InsP3, PI(4,5)P2, and with the intact cell membrane could yield valuable information on the regulation of the PLCδ enzymes and help to facilitate the development of strategies for selective inhibition of various inositide-based regulatory processes. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2),1 a minor phospholipid component of the plasma membrane, is a key regulator of several cellular processes. PI(4,5)P2 is a precursor of important second messengers, such as the diffusible InsP3, which regulates Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, and the protein kinase C activator, diacylglycerol (1Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 34: 661-665Crossref Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 is also phosphorylated by class I PI 3-kinases to form PI(3,4,5)P3, which controls membrane recruitment and the functions of several important signaling proteins (3Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 itself is a regulator of a great variety of target molecules, including ion channels (4Zhang H., He, C. Yan X. Mirshaki T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Czirjak G. Pethö G.L. Spät A. Enyedi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and several proteins that regulate actin polymerization and the cytoskeleton (see Ref. 6Janmey P.A. Xian W. Flanagan L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), providing a link between the plasma membrane and the cortical cytoskeleton (7Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 has been implicated in several forms of membrane remodeling events, including the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (8Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K.

Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar for a review). Such diverse functions must rely upon interaction of the lipid with a large number of regulatory molecules. Most proteins that bind PI(4,5)P2 contain a sequence composed of basic residues that provide electrostatic interaction with the phosphate groups of the inositol ring (6Janmey P.A. Xian W. Flanagan L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent advances revealing the three-dimensional structures of several protein motifs that bind phosphoinositides offer a deeper insight into their molecular recognition (14Hurley J.H. Meyer T. Curr.

One of the first protein modules capable of binding membrane PI(4,5)P2 was identified in pleckstrin, the major protein kinase C substrate in platelets (15Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains have since been described in a large number of signaling proteins, and they show remarkable specificity in recognizing various forms of inositides. It is generally believed that at least one of the functions of PH domains is to provide proper localization of proteins via interactions with inositol phospholipids. However, some PH domains have also been shown to bind proteins (16Tsukada S. Simon M. Witte O. Katz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11"
https://openalex.org/W2170150820,"A novel mouse macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 2 (mMGL2) was identified by BLAST analysis of expressed sequence tags. The sequence of mMGL2 is highly homologous to the mMGL, which should now be called mMGL1. The open reading frame of mMGL2 contains a sequence corresponding to a type II transmembrane protein with 332 amino acids having a single extracellular C-type lectin domain. The 3′-untranslated region included long terminal repeats of mouse early transposon. The Mgl2 gene was cloned from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library and sequenced. The gene spans 7,136 base pairs and consists of 10 exons, which is similar to the genomic organization of mMGL1. The reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis indicates that mMGL2 is expressed in cell lines and normal mouse tissues in a macrophage-restricted manner, also very similar to that of mMGL1. The mMGL2 mRNA was also detected in mMGL1-positive cells, which were sorted from thioglycollate-induced peritoneal cells with a mMGL1-specific monoclonal antibody, LOM-8.7. The soluble recombinant proteins of mMGL2 exhibited carbohydrate specificity for α- and β-GalNAc-conjugated soluble polyacrylamides, whereas mMGL1 preferentially bound Lewis X-conjugated soluble polyacrylamides in solid phase assays. These two lectins may function cooperatively as recognition and endocytic molecules on macrophages and related cells.

They are found in the lymphoid organs, liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, serous cavities, bones, synovia, and skin. Resident MØs mediate clearance of senescent or apoptotic cells, produce and secrete cytokines, are involved in hemopoiesis and bone resorption, transport and present antigens, and regulate neuroendocrine processes. Activated MØs are recruited to sites of infection, tissue injury, inflammation, and neoplasia and play crucial roles in tissue repair and pathogenesis (1Lewis C. McGee J.O.D. The Macrophage: The Natural Immune System. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-413Google Scholar).The distribution and functional heterogeneity of MØs derive in part from their specialized plasma membrane receptors (2Feizi T. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cell surface markers such as F4/80, sialoadhesin, MØ mannose receptor and scavenger receptor type A have significantly contributed to the current understanding of MØ ontogeny and function (3McKnight A.J. Gordon S. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 271-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in comparison to other immune cells such as B and T lymphocytes, relatively few MØ-restricted cell surface molecules have been identified. The physiological and pathological roles of these putative markers remain unknown.Protein-carbohydrate interactions serve a variety of functions in the immune system. A number of lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins) mediate both pathogen recognition and cell-to-cell interactions using structurally related carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). One of the most diversified families of these CRDs is Ca2+-dependent and termed C-type CRDs (4Linehan S.A. Martinez-Pomares L. Gordon S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). MØs and related cells such as dendritic cells are known to express several subfamilies of C-type lectins: type 1 multilectins such as MØ mannose receptor and lectins having type II transmembrane configurations such as MØ galactose-type (known previously as galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific) C-type lectin (MGL).

Little is known regarding the expression of selectins, another subfamily of C-type lectins, in MØs and related cells.Previously, MGL was cloned from rats, mice, and humans and characterized. The lectin from mice was shown to have specific affinity for highly branched N-linked carbohydrate chains with terminal β-galactosyl groups and glycopeptides carrying three consecutive α-GalNAc-Ser/Thr (Tn-antigens) (12Yamamoto K. Ishida C. Shinohara Y. Hasegawa Y. Konami Y. Osawa T. Irimura T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8159-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A human MGL was also shown to have affinity for glycopeptides carrying three consecutive Tn-antigens (13Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance revealed that affinity of recombinant hMGL for immobilized glycopeptides increased in parallel with the number of GalNAc residues (14Iida S. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. J. Biol.

Tn-antigen was known as a marker of malignant cells, and MGL was shown to play a role as a recognition molecule on MØs for tumor cells (15Sakamaki T. Imai Y. Irimura T. J.

Previously, MGL was believed to have a single gene. Southern blotting analysis supported this notion. However, in this report, we describe the properties of another novel MØ galactose-type C-type lectin, mMGL2. As an obvious consequence, the previous mMGL must now be called mMGL1. These lectins are highly homologous to each other except in their cytoplasmic domains and CRDs. We found that mMGL2 has a distinct carbohydrate specificity from mMGL1. These lectins seem to be expressed on the same cells and therefore seem to function cooperatively.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found a novel MØ C-type lectin, mMGL2, and characterized its genomic structure, expression patterns, and carbohydrate specificity. The Mgl2 gene spans 7136 bp and consists of 10 exons, which is a similar genomic organization to that of the Mgl gene now renamed the Mgl1 gene. We reported that the Mgl1 gene linked to Trp53 and is located 1.8 ± 1.2 cM distal to D11Mit5 and 1.8 ± 1.2 cM proximal to Htt on mouse chromosome 11. Using a panel of DNA samples from two parental mice, C3H/HeJ-gld and (C3H/HeJ-gld × Mus spretus) F1 were digested with various restriction endonucleases and hybridized with a mMGL1 cDNA probe to determine the restriction fragment length polymorphism and to allow haplotype analyses (29Tsuiji M. Fujimori M. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Irimura T. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor genes (Asgr1 andAsgr2) were also known to be linked to Trp53(32Blackburn C.C. Griffith J. Morahan G. Genomics. 1995; 26: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We found BAC clones, which included these two C-type lectins. These results indicate that the highly homologous Mgl2 gene is linked within about 50 kb. Their homology and close genomic localization indicate that the original gene was duplicated recently. The human MGL (HML-2) gene was mapped in chromosome 17p and linked to ASGR1 and ASGR2.These results show that there is a cluster of type 2 C-type lectin genes on mouse chromosome 11 and on human 17p12–13. Likewise, the natural killer gene complex resided on mouse chromosome 6 and on human 12p (33Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 34Brown M.G. Fulmek S. Matsumoto K. Cho R. Lyons P.A. Levy E.R. Scalzo A.A. Yokoyama W.M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Although there was a high degree of sequence homology between mMGL1 and mMGL2, the sequences corresponding to cytoplasmic and CRD showed differences, suggesting that cytoplasmic tail associations and the carbohydrate recognitions are unique between mMGL1 and mMGL2. We showed that recombinant mMGL1 bound soluble polyacrylamides containing Lex oligosaccharides. mMGL2 had affinity with polyacrylamides containing α- or β-GalNAc. It has been believed that C-type lectins contain a peptide segment that corresponds to the carbohydrate binding specificity within the CRD and that the sequence in Gal and GalNAc-binding lectins, such as ASGRs, is QPD. In contrast, the sequence in mannose-, fucose-, and GlcNAc specific lectins, such as serum mannose-binding proteins, was EPN. The sequence in both mMGL1 and -2 was QPD. However, it was obvious from our results that their fine specificities depended on other amino acids in the CRD (Figs. 6 and8). Some of the amino acid residues important in the carbohydrate recognitions were conserved in mMGL1, mMGL2, hMGL, RHL-1 and -2, mASGR-1, and hASGR-1. Crystallographic determination of the structure of human ASGR-1 revealed amino acid residues important in sugar binding (35Meier M. Bider M.D. Malashkevich V.N. Spiess M. Burkhard P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rat hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor was subjected to site-directed mutation. As a result, the pH dependence of ligand binding was shown to be mediated by His-256, Asp-266, and Arg-270 (36Wragg S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35400-35406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because these residues are also conserved in mMGL1 and -2, they should also be responsible for their pH dependence (Fig. 8). Amino acid residues responsible for the differential carbohydrate specificity between mMGL1 and -2 and other members of the C-type lectin family and the phylogeny of these lectins (Fig. 8) are yet to be elucidated.There is a possibility that mMGL1 and -2 form heterooligomers. These lectins are known to form trimeric structures through the interactions of the neck domain in a similar manner to that of ASGRs. ASGRs are abundantly expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatic parenchymal cells (37Collins J.C. Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Braun J.R. Willnow T.E. Ishibashi S. Ashwell G. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Its primary role is the removal and degradation of desialylated glycoproteins from circulation. High affinity binding requires the receptor to be assembled as a heterooligomer consisting of two highly homologous subunits, termed hepatic lectin 1 and 2 (39Bider M.D. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Experiments with recombinant rat hepatic lectins suggested that the binding properties of the major subunit (RHL-1) and the minor subunit (RHL-2/-3) were optimized for different ligands (40Ruiz N.I. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of mMGL1 and -2, the recombinant form corresponding to each one showed affinity with different carbohydrates, indicating that heterooligomer formation was not required for their carbohydrate recognition. However, these lectins were likely to be expressed on the same cells at the single cell level and cooperatively functioned to recognize and uptake extracellular molecules.mMGL1-positive cells are abundant in connective tissues throughout the body (19Mizuochi S. Akimoto Y. Imai Y. Hirano H. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). mMGL1 was shown to be expressed on the surfaces of bone marrow-derived immature dendritic cells (21Denda-Nagai K. Kubota N. Tsuiji M. Kamata M. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). hMGL is also shown to be expressed on monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells and monocyte-derived immature MØs in humans (41Higashi N. Morikawa A Fujioka K Fujita Y. Sano Y. Miyata-Takeuchi M. Suzuki N. Irimura T. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have shown that mMGL1-positive cells migrate from dermis to regional lymph nodes during the sensitization phase of contact hypersensitivity (42Sato K. Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6835-6844PubMed Google Scholar). The migration was initiated by cytokine-mediated release of mMGL1-positive cells from dermis (42Sato K. Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6835-6844PubMed Google Scholar, 43Chun K.H. Imai Y. Higashi N. Irimura T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar, 44Chun K.H. Imai Y. Higashi N. Irimura T. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells homed to the boundary of the T-cell area in the regional lymph nodes, and the prevention of migration seemed to interfere with sensitization. Involvement of coordinated functions of mMGL1 and -2 in such pathogenic processes should be the most important subject of future investigations. Macrophages (MØs)1 and related cells are widely distributed throughout the body, displaying a morphological and functional diversity. They are found in the lymphoid organs, liver, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, serous cavities, bones, synovia, and skin.

Genomics. 1997; 42: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Although there was a high degree of sequence homology between mMGL1 and mMGL2, the sequences corresponding to cytoplasmic and CRD showed differences, suggesting that cytoplasmic tail associations and the carbohydrate recognitions are unique between mMGL1 and mMGL2. We showed that recombinant mMGL1 bound soluble polyacrylamides containing Lex oligosaccharides. mMGL2 had affinity with polyacrylamides containing α- or β-GalNAc. It has been believed that C-type lectins contain a peptide segment that corresponds to the carbohydrate binding specificity within the CRD and that the sequence in Gal and GalNAc-binding lectins, such as ASGRs, is QPD. In contrast, the sequence in mannose-, fucose-, and GlcNAc specific lectins, such as serum mannose-binding proteins, was EPN. The sequence in both mMGL1 and -2 was QPD. However, it was obvious from our results that their fine specificities depended on other amino acids in the CRD (Figs. 6 and8). Some of the amino acid residues important in the carbohydrate recognitions were conserved in mMGL1, mMGL2, hMGL, RHL-1 and -2, mASGR-1, and hASGR-1. Crystallographic determination of the structure of human ASGR-1 revealed amino acid residues important in sugar binding (35Meier M. Bider M.D. Malashkevich V.N. Spiess M. Burkhard P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, rat hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor was subjected to site-directed mutation. As a result, the pH dependence of ligand binding was shown to be mediated by His-256, Asp-266, and Arg-270 (36Wragg S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35400-35406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because these residues are also conserved in mMGL1 and -2, they should also be responsible for their pH dependence (Fig. 8). Amino acid residues responsible for the differential carbohydrate specificity between mMGL1 and -2 and other members of the C-type lectin family and the phylogeny of these lectins (Fig. 8) are yet to be elucidated.There is a possibility that mMGL1 and -2 form heterooligomers. These lectins are known to form trimeric structures through the interactions of the neck domain in a similar manner to that of ASGRs. ASGRs are abundantly expressed on the sinusoidal surface of hepatic parenchymal cells (37Collins J.C. Stockert R.J. Morell A.G.

High affinity binding requires the receptor to be assembled as a heterooligomer consisting of two highly homologous subunits, termed hepatic lectin 1 and 2 (39Bider M.D. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Experiments with recombinant rat hepatic lectins suggested that the binding properties of the major subunit (RHL-1) and the minor subunit (RHL-2/-3) were optimized for different ligands (40Ruiz N.I. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of mMGL1 and -2, the recombinant form corresponding to each one showed affinity with different carbohydrates, indicating that heterooligomer formation was not required for their carbohydrate recognition. However, these lectins were likely to be expressed on the same cells at the single cell level and cooperatively functioned to recognize and uptake extracellular molecules.mMGL1-positive cells are abundant in connective tissues throughout the body (19Mizuochi S. Akimoto Y. Imai Y. Hirano H. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). mMGL1 was shown to be expressed on the surfaces of bone marrow-derived immature dendritic cells (21Denda-Nagai K. Kubota N. Tsuiji M. Kamata M. Irimura T.

We have shown that mMGL1-positive cells migrate from dermis to regional lymph nodes during the sensitization phase of contact hypersensitivity (42Sato K. Imai Y. Irimura T. J.

The cells homed to the boundary of the T-cell area in the regional lymph nodes, and the prevention of migration seemed to interfere with sensitization. Involvement of coordinated functions of mMGL1 and -2 in such pathogenic processes should be the most important subject of future investigations. In the present study, we found a novel MØ C-type lectin, mMGL2, and characterized its genomic structure, expression patterns, and carbohydrate specificity. The Mgl2 gene spans 7136 bp and consists of 10 exons, which is a similar genomic organization to that of the Mgl gene now renamed the Mgl1 gene. We reported that the Mgl1 gene linked to Trp53 and is located 1.8 ± 1.2 cM distal to D11Mit5 and 1.8 ± 1.2 cM proximal to Htt on mouse chromosome 11. Using a panel of DNA samples from two parental mice, C3H/HeJ-gld and (C3H/HeJ-gld × Mus spretus) F1 were digested with various restriction endonucleases and hybridized with a mMGL1 cDNA probe to determine the restriction fragment length polymorphism and to allow haplotype analyses (29Tsuiji M. Fujimori M. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Irimura T. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor genes (Asgr1 andAsgr2) were also known to be linked to Trp53(32Blackburn C.C. Griffith J. Morahan G. Genomics. 1995; 26: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We found BAC clones, which included these two C-type lectins. These results indicate that the highly homologous Mgl2 gene is linked within about 50 kb. Their homology and close genomic localization indicate that the original gene was duplicated recently. The human MGL (HML-2) gene was mapped in chromosome 17p and linked to ASGR1 and ASGR2.These results show that there is a cluster of type 2 C-type lectin genes on mouse chromosome 11 and on human 17p12–13. Likewise, the natural killer gene complex resided on mouse chromosome 6 and on human 12p (33Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2155924717,"Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a novel protein of unknown function with a higher binding affinity for the mutant form of Huntington's disease protein huntingtin. Here we report that HAP1 interacts with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), a mammalian homologue of yeast vacuolar protein sorting protein Vps27p involved in the endosome-to-lysosome trafficking. This novel interaction was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length Hrs as bait, and confirmed byin vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion analysis reveals that the association of HAP1 with Hrs is mediated via a coiled-coil interaction between the central coiled-coil domains of both proteins. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies show that HAP1 co-localizes with Hrs on early endosomes. Like Hrs, overexpression of HAP1 causes the formation of enlarged early endosomes, and inhibits the degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor receptors. Whereas overexpression of HAP1 does not affect either constitutive or ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis, it potently blocks the trafficking of endocytosed epidermal growth factor receptors from early endosomes to late endosomes. These findings implicate, for the first time, the involvement of HAP1 in the regulation of vesicular trafficking from early endosomes to the late endocytic compartments.

A search for huntingtin-interacting proteins has led to the identification of a novel protein called huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) (3Li X.J., Li, S.H. Sharp A.H.

HAP1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of both wild type and mutant huntingtin. The binding affinity of HAP1 to huntingtin is enhanced by the increasing length of the polyglutamine stretch, implying a possible role for HAP1 in the pathogenesis of HD. The amino acid sequence of HAP1 exhibits no homology to any known protein in the data base, and virtually nothing is known about the cellular function of HAP1. Biochemically, HAP1 has been shown to interact with p150 glued , a dynactin subunit that participates in microtubule-based transport (4Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Colomer V. Tokito M.K. Lanahan A.

Electron microscopic studies reveal that HAP1 is associated with many types of membranous organelles, including endosomes, tubulovesicular structures, and synaptic vesicles (8Gutekunst C.A., Li, S.H., Yi, H.

Based on these observations, it has been speculated that HAP1 may have a role in vesicular trafficking and/or organelle transport (4Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Colomer V. Tokito M.K. Lanahan A.

In the present study, we identify a novel interaction between HAP1 and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), an early endosome-associated phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and signal transduction (10Komada M.

Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Hrs appears to be a mammalian homologue of Vps27p, a yeast protein required for vesicular trafficking from a prevacuolar/endosomal compartment to Golgi and vacuole (18Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies reveal that mutant mice with Hrs null mutation or a Hrs C-terminal deletion are embryonic lethal, perhaps as a result of defective vesicular trafficking and/or signaling (17Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, Hrs null mutant mice contain abnormally enlarged early endosomes that are reminiscent of the exaggerated “class E” compartment in the yeast vps27 mutant, suggesting an analogous role for Hrs in vesicular trafficking through mammalian endosomes. In support of this role, our previous work demonstrates that Hrs regulates the trafficking of EGF receptors from early endosomes to lysosomes via its interaction with sorting nexin 1, a mammalian homologue of yeast Vps5p that binds to the lysosomal targeting region of the EGF receptor (20Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Very recently, it was reported that elimination of Drosophila Hrs expression impairs the ability of endosomal membranes to invaginate and form internal vesicles of the multivesicular body, and causes enhanced tyrosine kinase signaling as a result of failure to degrade activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR (21Lloyd T.E. Atkinson R., Wu, M.N. Zhou Y. Pennetta G. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that HAP1 associates with Hrs bothin vitro and in vivo, and define the structural requirement underlying this novel interaction. Moreover, we show that HAP1 co-localizes with Hrs on early endosomes, and provide evidence supporting a role for HAP1 in the regulation of vesicular trafficking from early endosomes to late endocytic compartments. Our findings, together with the observation that mutant huntingtin binds differently than wild-type huntingtin to HAP1, suggest that the aberrant interaction between mutant huntingtin and HAP1 may cause abnormalities in the endocytic trafficking pathway, leading to neurodegeneration in HD. A bait plasmid, pPC97-Hrs, was constructed by subcloning the entire open reading frame of rat Hrs (23Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W., Li, Y. Chin L. Li L. J.

Positive clones were selected on 3-aminotriazole-containing medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, and confirmed by a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. Prey plasmids from positive clones were rescued and re-transformed into fresh yeast cells with the Hrs bait or various control baits to confirm the specificity of the interaction. The primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-Hrs (23Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W., Li, Y. Chin L. Li L. J.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used for immunoblotting, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Texas Red-, and CY5-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for immunofluorescence microscopy. An HAP1-A cDNA in pBluescript was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Gillian Bates (24Bertaux F. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Lehrach H. Bates G.P. Wanker E.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to subclone the DNA fragments encoding full-length or truncated forms of Hrs and HAP1 into the following vectors: the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-5x-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pET28c (Novagen) for the production of GST- and His6-tagged fusion proteins, and the mammalian expression vector pEGFP and pCHA for transfection into HeLa cells. The deletion mutants encoded by the truncated forms of Hrs and HAP1 are indicated in Fig. 2. HAP1ΔH, an HAP1-A fragment lacking the Hrs-binding domain, was generated by deletion of amino acid residues 261–368. GST- or His6-tagged fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 cells as previously described (26Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were affinity purified by using the glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). His6-tagged proteins were purified using the His·Bind Resin and Buffer kit (Novagen). Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of protein bands following SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Rat brain extracts were prepared by homogenizing the brains in a homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, plus protease inhibitors including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm bestatin). Triton X-100 was added to the homogenates to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the Triton X-100 extracts of rat brain. For binding experiments, brain extracts (100 μl) were incubated with various GST-Hrs or GST-HAP1 fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Equal amounts of GST or various GST-HAP1 fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with soluble His6-tagged Hrs in the phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 1 h under gentle rocking. After extensive washes, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To detect endogenous HAP1·Hrs complexes, rat brain extracts (1 ml) were subjected to immunoprecipitation by mouse anti-HAP1 or control mouse IgG, as described previously (27Li Y. Chin L.S. Weigel C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40824-40833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. PC12 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and differentiated with nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) for 48 h. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated Hrs and HAP1 expression constructs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described (26Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Confluent PC12 cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was homogenized in 1 ml of ICT buffer (78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 8.37 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0) plus 250 mm sucrose (20Chin L.-S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). After a 5-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g, the supernatant was placed on a 5–20% linear Opti-prep (Nycomed) gradient formed in ICT buffer containing 42 mm sucrose, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 h at 125,000 × g in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). Following centrifugation, the gradient was harvested into 300-μl fractions using an Auto Densi-Flow gradient harvester (Labconco). Equal volumes of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by sequential immunoblotting for HAP1, Hrs, and organelle markers. For measurement of transferrin or EGF endocytosis, pEGFP-HAP1-transfected HeLa cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h, then treated with 100 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin at 37 °C for 30 min, or with 3 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated EGF in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for direct fluorescence visualization. For measurement of EGF trafficking after internalization, pEGFP-HAP1-transfected HeLa cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h and then treated with 3 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated EGF in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed three times with HeLa medium to remove extracellular Texas Red-conjugated EGF and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. 70% confluent HeLa cells on 150-mm plates were transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of pAlterMAX-EGFR (29Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher M.L., Jr. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V.W. Band H. J. Biol.

Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were split onto two 150-mm plates and incubated for another 20 h. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h and then incubated in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml EGF for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors). Equal amounts (500 μg) of protein from each lysate were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody 528 or mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody 1005 and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The intensity of the EGFR band (180 kDa) was quantified using MCID M4 software (Imaging Research Inc.). To identify novel binding partners of Hrs, we used the full-length rat Hrs as bait to screen a two-hybrid rat hippocampal/cortical cDNA library. One of the positive clones, clone C24, encodes the middle portion of HAP1 (Fig.1 A). HAP1 was first identified as a novel huntingtin-associated protein with two alternatively spliced isoforms, HAP1-A and HAP1-B (3Li X.J., Li, S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora F.C., Jr. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). HAP1 contains three putative coiled-coil domains, H1, H2, and H3, followed by a huntingtin-binding region (4Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Colomer V. Tokito M.K. Lanahan A. Worley P. Holzbaur E.L. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although HAP1 was initially reported as a brain-specific protein (3Li X.J., Li, S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora F.C., Jr. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), EST data base searches reveal the presence of HAP1 mRNAs in many non-neuronal tissues and cells, including mammary organ, melanocyte, retina, kidney, and lymph node. The broad distribution of HAP1 suggests that HAP1 may have a more general function than previously proposed. The specificity of the Hrs-HAP1 interaction was confirmed by yeast re-transformation experiments, in which the HAP1 clone interacts only with Hrs but not with irrelevant baits such as SNAP-25 or synaptophysin (data not shown). To verify the interaction between Hrs and HAP1 detected in the yeast two-hybrid screens, we performed in vitro binding assays using recombinant Hrs and HAP1 proteins. GST or GST-Hrs immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with a His6-tagged HAP1 fusion protein generated from the HAP1 two-hybrid clone C24. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the His tag. The result shows that HAP1 binds selectively to GST-Hrs but not to the GST control, indicating a direct and specific interaction between recombinant Hrs and HAP1 (Fig. 1 B). To further determine whether Hrs was able to bind endogenous HAP1, pull-down assays were performed by incubation of rat brain Triton X-100 extracts with GST or GST-Hrs immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the GST-Hrs fusion protein, but not the GST control, was able to pull down endogenous HAP1-A and HAP1-B from the brain extracts. To determine whether Hrs associates with HAP1 in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments, using an anti-HAP1 antibody to precipitate HAP1 and its associated proteins from rat brain Triton X-100 extracts. Hrs was detected in the immunocomplexes precipitated by the anti-HAP1 antibody, demonstrating an in vivo association of Hrs with HAP1-A and HAP1-B (Fig.1 D). In contrast, neither HAP1 nor Hrs was precipitated by control IgG, confirming the specificity of Hrs and HAP1 co-immunoprecipitation detected by the anti-HAP1 antibody. The Hrs-interacting clone (C24) isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen encodes residues 246–425 of HAP1 (Fig. 1 A), indicating that the N- (residues 1–245) and C-terminal (residues 426–599 of HAP1-A or 426–629 of HAP1-B) regions are dispensable for the association of HAP1 with Hrs. Because the HAP1-coding region of clone C24 contains two predicted coiled-coil domains, H2 (residues 262–305) and H3 (residues 328–370), and the huntingtin-binding domain HB (residues 371–420), we sought to further map the Hrs-binding domain of HAP1 by deletion analysis. A series of HAP1 deletion mutants were generated as GST fusion proteins and their interactions with recombinant Hrs were analyzed in the in vitro binding assays (Fig.2 A). Only the fusion proteins (HAP1Δ1 and HAP1Δ2) containing both coiled-coil domains H2 and H3 of HAP1 were capable of binding Hrs, whereas neither of these two domains alone (HAP1Δ4 or HAP1Δ5) was sufficient for interacting with Hrs. Furthermore, the huntingtin-binding domain HB (HAP1Δ6) was not involved in binding Hrs. The same results were obtained when we used pull-down assays to analyze the ability of these GST-HAP1 deletion mutants to bind endogenous Hrs from brain extracts (data not shown). These data indicate that Hrs and huntingtin associate with different regions of HAP1, however, the simultaneous binding of Hrs and huntingtin to HAP1 was not yet examined. To delineate the minimal structural requirement for Hrs to bind HAP1, we performed similar deletion analysis by examining the interaction of various Hrs deletion mutants with endogenous HAP1 in brain extracts (Fig. 2 B). A Hrs central region (residues 225–541) consisting of both H1 and H2 coiled-coil domains and the proline-rich linker was found to be responsible for binding HAP1, whereas the N-terminal VHS and FYVE domains and the C-terminal proline-rich domain of Hrs were not involved. Furthermore, neither the H2 domain nor the H1 domain with the proline-rich linker were able to bind HAP1, suggesting that multiple sites and/or a complex folded structure of the Hrs central region (residues 225–541) were involved in the interaction with HAP1. To provide additional evidence for an in vivo association of Hrs with HAP1, we first compared the intracellular localization of endogenous Hrs and HAP1 in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3,A and B, Hrs and HAP1 both exhibit a punctate staining pattern, which was consistent with previous reports (4Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Colomer V. Tokito M.K. Lanahan A. Worley P. Holzbaur E.L. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 23Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W., Li, Y. Chin L. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous staining of the same cells with anti-Hrs and anti-HAP1 antibodies revealed a substantial overlap between Hrs and HAP1 immunoreactivity, particularly in the neuritic processes, including the tip of neurites (compare Fig. 3, A and B). These staining data indicate that at least a subpopulation of HAP1 co-localizes with Hrs in PC12 cells. We then examined the intracellular distribution of HAP1 and Hrs in HeLa cells transfected with the N-terminal HA- or GFP-tagged full-length Hrs and HAP1-A. The N-terminal HA or GFP tags did not affect the protein localization, because the staining pattern of the tagged HAP1 or Hrs was identical to that of the untagged protein (data not shown). In agreement with previous studies (20Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we observed that recombinant Hrs, when expressed at high levels in cells, causes the formation of enlarged vesicular structures (data not shown). Interestingly, when transfected alone at high expression levels, recombinant HAP1 also led to formation of enlarged vesicular structures (Fig.4, A and D). In cells co-expressing Hrs and HAP1, we found that a significant population of vesicular structures, both small and large in size, contains both Hrs and HAP1 proteins (Fig. 3,C–F). These results indicate that HAP1 and Hrs also co-localize in transfected HeLa cells, further supporting anin vivo association between these two proteins. It is well established that Hrs is primarily localized to early endosomes and overexpression of Hrs results in the formation of exaggerated early endosomes (20Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 30Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The co-localization of HAP1 with Hrs (Fig. 3) thus gives the first hint that the HAP1-positive vesicular structures may be early endosomes. Formation of enlarged structures in the cytoplasm upon transfection of recombinant HAP1 has been observed previously (8Gutekunst C.A., Li, S.H., Yi, H. Ferrante R.J., Li, X.J. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7674-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, these HAP1-positive structures were interpreted as the cytoplasmic inclusions based on the observation that these structures were not labeled by markers for various organelles, namely, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, late endosomes, and lysosomes. Because these studies did not use any markers for early endosomes, one could not rule out the possibility that these HAP1-positive structures may represent early endosomes. Interestingly, these HAP1-positive structures were remarkably similar in appearance to the enlarged early endosomes observed in cells transfected with Hrs or a GTPase-deficient mutant form of Rab5, Rab5Q79L (31Raiborg C.

In this study, we show that deletion of the C-terminal 147 amino acids (HERGΔ147) abolished IKr, whereas a larger, 159-amino acid deletion (HERGΔ159) identified in an LQT2 kindred did generate IKr, albeit with reduced amplitude compared with the wild type. The 12 amino acids present in HERGΔ147 and absent in HERGΔ159 include a potential endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal, RGR, which when mutated to LGL (HERGΔ147-LGL) restored IKr. Streptavidin selection of biotin-labeled surface proteins showed good expression of wild-type and HERGΔ159 at the cell surface and low expression of HERGΔ147-LGL and HERGΔ147. Additionally, a 100-amino acid peptide spanning the RGR triplet can rescue the defect in HERGΔ147 when co-expressed as an ER-targeted minigene. Failure of HERG trafficking is known to cause LQT2, and this identified a molecular mechanism underlying this defect.

The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of HERG has been reported to profoundly affect the rate of HERG deactivation (3Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen.

The function of the large intracellular C terminus has not yet been elucidated, although we have demonstrated that it contains regions essential to IKr function (7Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In particular, we identified a 104-amino acid region at the intracytoplasmic C terminus, which is crucial for IKr recapitulation. More recently, mutations in patients with the congenital LQTS have been mapped to this region (8Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Well studied examples include cystic fibrosis, diabetes insipidus, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Membrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); misfolded and incompletely assembled proteins are common side products of ER protein synthesis, and a quality control mechanism recognizes such defects and results in their retention. If the defect cannot be corrected by an ER-associated chaperone, the protein is retrotranslocated to the cytosol and targeted for the degradative pathway (reviewed in Ref. 14Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). One recently identified ER retention signal is the amino acid triplet RXR where “X ” can be any amino acid, although a large neutral or positively charged amino acid is preferred (15Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Here we identify an RXR motif in the C terminus of HERG, which when exposed by mutation results in reduced cell surface trafficking.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported (7Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that the C-terminal residues of HERG are crucial for IKr recapitulation. A severely truncated HERG mutant in which the C terminus was deleted entirely (HERGΔC) does not generate IKr, although its membrane-spanning domains including the pore region are intact. However, IKr can be reconstituted by ligating 104 amino acids from within the distal C-terminal domain in-frame to HERGΔC, generating a construct we termed HERGΔC+104. Thus, an obvious question raised by these data was whether small truncations of the C terminus would similarly disrupt IKr. Indeed, a HERG mutant missing the C-terminal 147 amino acids of HERG did not generate IKr (Fig. 4). An apparent paradox arose, however, when we found that an LQTS mutant missing the C-terminal 159 amino acids generated robust IKr(Fig. 2). This paradox was resolved by identifying the consensus ER retention signal (RGR) at positions 1005–1007. Mutation of this triplet to LGL resulted in rescue of IKr, consistent with the idea that the HERGΔ147 mutant is retained in the ER by a quality control mechanism that does not act upon the HERGΔ159 mutant because it has lost the RGR triplet (Figs. 1, 2, and 5). The cell surface protein biotinylation experiments strongly support this concept (Fig.3). It is interesting to note that HERGΔ159 seems to be expressed at higher levels than the other HERG proteins. Thus, it is possible that its lack of the 12 amino acids (which include the RXR) stabilizes this particular mutant. As a corollary, proteins containing this dodecapeptide may quickly be degraded by intracellular proteases and consequently have less opportunity to reach the plasma membrane. We recognize that there does not seem to be a big difference in membrane expression when comparing HERGΔ147and HERGΔ147−LGL. At present, we cannot fully explain why HERGΔ147 is completely nonfunctional, whereas HERGΔ147-LGL regains function, although this may be because of increased stability of the latter mutant.At least in our transient transfection assay, the distal C terminus is not absolutely required for IKr function. Thus, when the RGR residues are missing (HERGΔ159) or mutated (HERGΔ147−LGL), IKr is regenerated. Taken together, the present and previous findings indicate that the wt configuration of the HERG distal C-terminal domain serves to mask a retrograde signal, which is exposed and activated when this domain is mutated. Our previous results showing that ligation of the terminal 104 amino acids to the C-terminal truncation rescues IKrindicate that this 104-amino acid domain likely also includes a yet-to-be-defined forward trafficking domain.In this context, it is interesting to note that a human LQT2 mutation, R1014X, results in a deletion of 146 amino acids,i.e. 1 amino acid less than in our Δ147 mutation, and three others, G1031fs/24, G1036fs/82, and P1101fs, map within the 147-amino acid domain under investigation in this study (8Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Vincent G.M. Keating M.T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Thus, it is possible that these mutations (and others) result in an ER-trapping phenotype similar to what we observe for HERGΔ147.Our results using the RXR-spanning, ER-targeted decoy peptides indicate that similar approaches may eventually lead to gene-based methods designed to correct RXR-mediated membrane protein trafficking defects. Although RXR-including peptides would be expected to interfere with many physiologically required RXR quality control checkpoints, structural information about the HERG/ER quality control interface may eventually lead to specific inhibitors and therefore our results constitute an important proof-of-concept. Because the C-terminal KDEL sequence targets the expressed peptides to the ER (21Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), these results indirectly support the notion that the effects observed are ER-mediated.One well studied example of prevention of protein function by a trafficking defect is the common ΔF508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transport regulator (CTFR) (22Qu B.H. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ΔF508, which causes defective protein folding and retention in the ER, can also be rescued by removal of RXR signals contained in the intracytoplasmic loops of CFTR, allowing the protein to escape the ER and function at the cell surface (23Chang X.B. Cui L. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Aleksandrov A.A. Mengos A. Riordan J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been described for the KATP channel, which is composed of two subunits, Kir6.2 and SUR. Although the two wild-type subunits need to be co-expressed in order to reach the plasma membrane (24Clement J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), C-terminally truncated Kir6.2 molecules are able to generate SUR-independent currents (25Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Both Kir6.2 and SUR contain the sequence RKR, which cause ER retention when fused to proteins normally localized to the plasma membrane and prevents surface expression of tetrameric Kir6.2 channels and SUR1 monomers (15Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was identified for the L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit, which is retained in the ER unless the β3 subunit is present to antagonize this retention (26Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The interaction site of the α subunit with the β subunit has been localized to the I-II interdomain linker; even though this region includes two RXR motifs, in vitro studies suggest that these are actually not the mediators of ER retention of the α1 subunit.Failure of trafficking is a mechanism increasingly recognized in mutant voltage-gated cardiac ion channels, although previous studies have not identified sequence motifs resulting in these changes. LQT2 mutations resulting in HERG trafficking defects have been described previously (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol.

Taglialatela M. Brown A.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2327-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Two of these mutations, N629Q and N598Q, affect consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (27Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol.(Lond.). 1999; 515: 41-48Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two other mutations, Y611H and V822M, are also incompletely glycosylated (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This may mean either that posttranslational processing of HERG is an important determinant for plasma membrane expression or else that incomplete glycosylation is diagnostic of a trafficking defect. The N470D mutation also results in intracellular retention, but it can be rescued by growth at a lower temperature as well as by culture in low concentrations of E-4031, a drug known to be an IKr blocker (11Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Aydar and Palmer (31Aydar E. Palmer C. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that a deletion of 215 or 163 amino acids from the HERG C terminus had no effect on channel activity in oocytes. This finding is consistent with our results, because the Δ215 and Δ163 deletions are comparable with our Δ159 deletion in that they are missing the RXR at position 1005–1007. A mutation (T587M) in the C terminus of KCNQ1 is known to prevent trafficking of this cardiac K+ channel and cause a form of the LQT1-associated LQTS (32Yamashita F. Horie M. Kubota T. Yoshida H. Yumoto Y. Kobori A. Ninomiya T. Kono Y. Haruna T. Tsuji K. Washizuka T. Takano M. Otani H. Sasayama S. Aizawa Y. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 197-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been shown that a mutation in an extracellular loop region of the cardiac sodium channel, SCN5A, causes a defect in membrane localization and is the underlying mechanism for the Brugada syndrome (12Baroudi G. Pouliot V. Denjoy I. Guicheney P. Shrier A. Chahine M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E78-E83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, cardiac ion channel diseases can arise from mistrafficking. Although multiple molecular lesions doubtless underlie these functional defects, we have now identified ER retention, by exposure of a specific peptide motif, as one underlying mechanism. IKr, an important component of the delayed rectifier K+ current, is required for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. The human Ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG,1 KCNH2) encodes the α-subunit responsible for the current and mutations of the gene that causes chromosome 7-linked long QT syndrome (LQTS) (1Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar), a cardiac disorder that causes sudden death from tachyarrhythmias (2Roden D.M. Spooner P.M. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 1664-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of HERG has been reported to profoundly affect the rate of HERG deactivation (3Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 4Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stuhmer W. Pongs O. Ludwig J. J.

Physiol. 2000; 115: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The function of the large intracellular C terminus has not yet been elucidated, although we have demonstrated that it contains regions essential to IKr function (7Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In particular, we identified a 104-amino acid region at the intracytoplasmic C terminus, which is crucial for IKr recapitulation. More recently, mutations in patients with the congenital LQTS have been mapped to this region (8Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Vincent G.M. Keating M.T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Failure of cell surface expression has now been identified as a mechanism of ion channel dysfunction in human familial arrhythmia syndromes, including LQTS and the Brugada syndrome, although specific molecular mechanisms underlying mistrafficking in these settings have not been reported (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q.M.

Res. 2001; 88: E78-E83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defective trafficking of membrane proteins result in a variety of other human diseases (reviewed in Ref. 13Thomas P.J., Qu, B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Well studied examples include cystic fibrosis, diabetes insipidus, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Membrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); misfolded and incompletely assembled proteins are common side products of ER protein synthesis, and a quality control mechanism recognizes such defects and results in their retention. If the defect cannot be corrected by an ER-associated chaperone, the protein is retrotranslocated to the cytosol and targeted for the degradative pathway (reviewed in Ref. 14Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). One recently identified ER retention signal is the amino acid triplet RXR where “X ” can be any amino acid, although a large neutral or positively charged amino acid is preferred (15Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Here we identify an RXR motif in the C terminus of HERG, which when exposed by mutation results in reduced cell surface trafficking. DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported (7Kupershmidt S. Snyders D.J. Raes A. Roden D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27231-27235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that the C-terminal residues of HERG are crucial for IKr recapitulation. A severely truncated HERG mutant in which the C terminus was deleted entirely (HERGΔC) does not generate IKr, although its membrane-spanning domains including the pore region are intact. However, IKr can be reconstituted by ligating 104 amino acids from within the distal C-terminal domain in-frame to HERGΔC, generating a construct we termed HERGΔC+104. Thus, an obvious question raised by these data was whether small truncations of the C terminus would similarly disrupt IKr. Indeed, a HERG mutant missing the C-terminal 147 amino acids of HERG did not generate IKr (Fig. 4). An apparent paradox arose, however, when we found that an LQTS mutant missing the C-terminal 159 amino acids generated robust IKr(Fig. 2). This paradox was resolved by identifying the consensus ER retention signal (RGR) at positions 1005–1007. Mutation of this triplet to LGL resulted in rescue of IKr, consistent with the idea that the HERGΔ147 mutant is retained in the ER by a quality control mechanism that does not act upon the HERGΔ159 mutant because it has lost the RGR triplet (Figs. 1, 2, and 5). The cell surface protein biotinylation experiments strongly support this concept (Fig.3). It is interesting to note that HERGΔ159 seems to be expressed at higher levels than the other HERG proteins. Thus, it is possible that its lack of the 12 amino acids (which include the RXR) stabilizes this particular mutant. As a corollary, proteins containing this dodecapeptide may quickly be degraded by intracellular proteases and consequently have less opportunity to reach the plasma membrane. We recognize that there does not seem to be a big difference in membrane expression when comparing HERGΔ147and HERGΔ147−LGL. At present, we cannot fully explain why HERGΔ147 is completely nonfunctional, whereas HERGΔ147-LGL regains function, although this may be because of increased stability of the latter mutant.At least in our transient transfection assay, the distal C terminus is not absolutely required for IKr function. Thus, when the RGR residues are missing (HERGΔ159) or mutated (HERGΔ147−LGL), IKr is regenerated. Taken together, the present and previous findings indicate that the wt configuration of the HERG distal C-terminal domain serves to mask a retrograde signal, which is exposed and activated when this domain is mutated. Our previous results showing that ligation of the terminal 104 amino acids to the C-terminal truncation rescues IKrindicate that this 104-amino acid domain likely also includes a yet-to-be-defined forward trafficking domain.In this context, it is interesting to note that a human LQT2 mutation, R1014X, results in a deletion of 146 amino acids,i.e. 1 amino acid less than in our Δ147 mutation, and three others, G1031fs/24, G1036fs/82, and P1101fs, map within the 147-amino acid domain under investigation in this study (8Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Vincent G.M. Keating M.T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Thus, it is possible that these mutations (and others) result in an ER-trapping phenotype similar to what we observe for HERGΔ147.Our results using the RXR-spanning, ER-targeted decoy peptides indicate that similar approaches may eventually lead to gene-based methods designed to correct RXR-mediated membrane protein trafficking defects. Although RXR-including peptides would be expected to interfere with many physiologically required RXR quality control checkpoints, structural information about the HERG/ER quality control interface may eventually lead to specific inhibitors and therefore our results constitute an important proof-of-concept. Because the C-terminal KDEL sequence targets the expressed peptides to the ER (21Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

ΔF508, which causes defective protein folding and retention in the ER, can also be rescued by removal of RXR signals contained in the intracytoplasmic loops of CFTR, allowing the protein to escape the ER and function at the cell surface (23Chang X.B.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), C-terminally truncated Kir6.2 molecules are able to generate SUR-independent currents (25Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Both Kir6.2 and SUR contain the sequence RKR, which cause ER retention when fused to proteins normally localized to the plasma membrane and prevents surface expression of tetrameric Kir6.2 channels and SUR1 monomers (15Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was identified for the L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunit, which is retained in the ER unless the β3 subunit is present to antagonize this retention (26Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The interaction site of the α subunit with the β subunit has been localized to the I-II interdomain linker; even though this region includes two RXR motifs, in vitro studies suggest that these are actually not the mediators of ER retention of the α1 subunit. Failure of trafficking is a mechanism increasingly recognized in mutant voltage-gated cardiac ion channels, although previous studies have not identified sequence motifs resulting in these changes. LQT2 mutations resulting in HERG trafficking defects have been described previously (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol.

Two of these mutations, N629Q and N598Q, affect consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (27Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol.(Lond.). 1999; 515: 41-48Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two other mutations, Y611H and V822M, are also incompletely glycosylated (9Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This may mean either that posttranslational processing of HERG is an important determinant for plasma membrane expression or else that incomplete glycosylation is diagnostic of a trafficking defect. The N470D mutation also results in intracellular retention, but it can be rescued by growth at a lower temperature as well as by culture in low concentrations of E-4031, a drug known to be an IKr blocker (11Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Aydar and Palmer (31Aydar E. Palmer C. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that a deletion of 215 or 163 amino acids from the HERG C terminus had no effect on channel activity in oocytes. This finding is consistent with our results, because the Δ215 and Δ163 deletions are comparable with our Δ159 deletion in that they are missing the RXR at position 1005–1007. A mutation (T587M) in the C terminus of KCNQ1 is known to prevent trafficking of this cardiac K+ channel and cause a form of the LQT1-associated LQTS (32Yamashita F. Horie M. Kubota T. Yoshida H. Yumoto Y. Kobori A. Ninomiya T. Kono Y. Haruna T. Tsuji K. Washizuka T. Takano M. Otani H. Sasayama S. Aizawa Y. J. Mol.

Similarly, it has been shown that a mutation in an extracellular loop region of the cardiac sodium channel, SCN5A, causes a defect in membrane localization and is the underlying mechanism for the Brugada syndrome (12Baroudi G. Pouliot V. Denjoy I. Guicheney P. Shrier A. Chahine M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E78-E83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, cardiac ion channel diseases can arise from mistrafficking. Although multiple molecular lesions doubtless underlie these functional defects, we have now identified ER retention, by exposure of a specific peptide motif, as one underlying mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2103288036,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a multifunctional cytokine, which induces proliferation or death in a cell type-dependent manner. We previously showed that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2) and Traf5double-deficient (double knockout (DKO)) mice were highly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death. By functional cloning to rescue DKO MEFs from TNF-induced cell death, we have identified a novel gene,Bsac. BSAC is composed of N-terminal basic, SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS), and coiled-coil domains. BSAC is a nuclear protein, and overexpression of BSAC potently activates promoters containing A + T-rich sequences named CArG boxes. Domain mapping analysis revealed that both N-terminal basic and C-terminal proline-rich sequence are required for the transcriptional activity. Overexpression of BSAC in DKO MEFs partially inhibited TNF-induced cell death by suppressing activation of caspases. Interestingly, inhibition of TNF-induced cell death was not observed in DKO MEFs transfected with either N-terminal or C-terminal deletion mutant of BSAC, revealing an intimate correlation between transcriptional activity and antiapoptotic function. Recently, a human homologue of BSAC named MAL/MKL1(megakaryocytic acuteleukemia/megakaryoblasticleukemia-1) was identified as a fusion transcript generated by t(1,22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Collectively, BSAC is a novel transcriptional activator with antiapoptotic function, which may be involved in the leukemogenesis.

Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of this process causes various pathological disorders such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and malignant tumors (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6204) Google Scholar). Among various stimuli inducing apoptosis, two death receptors, Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 receptor 1, have been extensively characterized. Upon ligand binding, these receptors activate an initiator caspase, caspase-8, via recruitment of TNF receptor 1-associated death domain protein and/or Fas-associated death domain protein, which in turn activates downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7, finally resulting in apoptosis (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) emerged as signal transducers for members of the TNF receptor superfamily. TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 mediate NF-κB activation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (4Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). We recently showed thatTraf2 −/− Traf5 −/−(DKO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) had a severe defect in TNF-induced NF-κB activation and were highly susceptible to TNF-induced cell death (5Tada K. Okazaki T. Sakon S. Kobarai T. Kurosawa K. Yamaoka S. Hashimoto H. Mak T.W. Yagita H. Okumura K. Yeh W.C. Nakano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36530-36534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Serum response factor (SRF) is a MADS (MCM1,Agamous, Deficiens, and SRF) box-containing transcription factor that controls gene expression in response to growth and differentiation signals (6Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). SRF was first identified by its ability to mediate serum responsiveness of c-fos promoter (7Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Activation of the c-fospromoter is generally mediated by the association of SRF with members of the ternary complex factor family of Ets domain transcription factors, which serves as targets for mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (8Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 10Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Association of ternary complex factor with the MADS box of SRF is dependent on the binding of SRF to a consensus A + T-rich sequence (CC(A/T)6GG) named the CArG box. CArG boxes are also required for expression of various muscle-specific genes including α-skeletal, α-cardiac, and γ-smooth muscle actin (11Reecy J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Heart Development. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 273-290Google Scholar). Since the expression of SRF is not restricted to the heart or muscles, several myogenic accessory factors that selectively activate muscle target genes in cooperation with SRF have been identified (12Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Belaguli N.S. Sepulveda J.L. Nigam V. Charron F. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Among them, a heart-specific transcriptional activator named myocardin was recently identified by a bioinformatics approach (14Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Myocardin belongs to the SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS) domain family of nuclear proteins. Overexpression of myocardin potently activated muscle-specific promoters containing multiple, but not single, CArG boxes. Moreover, myocardin directly bound to SRF and formed a ternary complex with CArG boxes in the presence of SRF (14Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). By functional screening to identify molecules that inhibit TNF-induced cell death of DKO MEFs, here we identified a novel gene named Bsac. BSAC belongs to the SAP domain family of nuclear proteins and is composed of N-terminal basic, SAP, and coiled-coil domains. Given that the domain structure of BASC is highly homologous to that of myocardin, these two proteins constitute a novel family. BSAC is ubiquitously expressed in various murine tissues, and overexpression of BSAC potently activated promoters containing CArG boxes. In contrast to myocardin, BSAC could activate c-fospromoter that contains a single CArG box. Moreover, BSAC inhibited TNF-induced cell death of DKO MEFs by suppressing activation of caspase-3 and -8. Interestingly, a human homologue of Bsacnamed megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL)/megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1) has recently been identified as a fusion transcript with an OTT/RBM15 (onetwenty-two/RNA-bindingmotif protein-15) generated by t(1,22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (15Ma Z. Morris S.W. Valentine V. Li M. Herbrick J.A. Cui X. Bouman D. Li Y. Mehta P.K. Nizetic D. Kaneko Y. Chan G.C. Chan L.C. Squire J. Scherer S.W. Hitzler J.K. Nat.

Thus, the transcriptional activity and antiapoptotic function of BSAC may be involved in the development of acute leukemias. cDNA library construction using a retroviral vector, transient transfection, and production of viral stock were performed essentially as previously described (17Kitamura T. Morikawa Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 134: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Phoenix-Eco cells (1.5 × 106 cells) (kindly provided by Gary P. Nolan) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of a library DNA by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Approximately 5 × 106 MEFs were infected with retroviral library for 8 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma). Then the cells were cultured in the presence of TNF (10 ng/ml; BD PharMingen). After 2 weeks, surviving clones were isolated and expanded. To sequence integrated cDNAs, genomic DNAs isolated from each clone were amplified using retroviral vector primers by PCR. A full-lengthBsac cDNA was obtained by screening a murine spleen cDNA library (Stratagene) by standard methods. A retroviral vector, pMX-FLAG-puro, was generated by inserting an N-terminal FLAG tag sequence into pMX-puro containing puromycin-resistant gene for drug selection (18Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated mutants of Bsac were generated by PCR and subcloned into pMX-FLAG-puro, pcDNA3-Myc (kindly provided by Kohei Miyazono), or pFA-CMV containing the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 (Stratagene). pcDNA3-Myc-myocardin was generated by subcloning the reverse transcriptase-PCR product of myocardin into pcDNA3-Myc. pT7-ΔATG-SRF was provided by Ron Prywes (Columbia University). The PCR product of Bcl-2 from pSFFV-Bcl-2 (kindly provided by Naohiro Inohara) was subcloned into pMX-FLAG-puro, designated pMX-FLAG-Bcl-2. Anti-GAL4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), and anti-SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies (Abs) were obtained from the indicated sources. Ab specific for BSAC was raised in rabbits against the E. coli-expressed N-terminal fragment of BSAC (glutathione S-transferase-BSAC-(46–147)) and affinity-purified on the glutathione S-transferase-BSAC column. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (19Shindo M. Nakano H. Kuroyanagi H. Shirasawa T. Mihara M. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were plated on glass slides and cultured for 12 h. Then the cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged deletion mutants of BSAC by using Metafectene (Biontex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and then incubated with anti-Myc Ab. To detect endogenous BSAC, the fixed cells were stained with anti-BSAC Ab. The primary antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexia 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Stained cells were mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes) and analyzed on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (5Tada K. Okazaki T. Sakon S. Kobarai T. Kurosawa K. Yamaoka S. Hashimoto H. Mak T.W. Yagita H. Okumura K. Yeh W.C. Nakano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36530-36534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Transfection and luciferase assay were performed as described previously (20Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The pFR-luciferase contains five repeats of GAL4 binding elements upstream of the luciferase gene (Stratagene). The pSRF-luciferase reporter contains five tandem copies of CArG boxes (Stratagene). The c-fos-luciferase reporter contains a c-fos promoter region, −700/+53 (kindly provided by Yuriko Suzuki). The c-fos CArG mt-luciferase contains CArG box mutations, which were introduced by changing the consensus sequence as follows: CCATATTAGG to CAATATTAGC(mutated residues are underlined). SRF, Myc-tagged myocardin, and Myc-tagged BSAC were translated in vitro with a TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The oligonucleotides containing c-fos CArG box were 5′-TGCTGACGCAGATGTCCTAATATGGACATCCTGTGT-3′ and 5′-CCTTACACAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGCGTC-3′. EMSA was performed as described previously (21Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Phoenix-Eco cells (1.5 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of the indicated vectors using LipofectAMINE. For infection, DKO MEFs (1 × 105 cells) were seeded in six-well plates and incubated with 2 ml of the viral supernatants for 8 h. After changing the medium, the cells were cultured in fresh 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h and then selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) to isolate stable transfectants. Puromycin-resistant pools were used for the experiments. MEFs (5 × 103 cells) were plated in 96-well plates and incubated with various amounts of murine TNF for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by the WST (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)[2H]tetrazolium monosodium salt) assay using a cell counting kit (Dojindo). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Caspase activity was measured by the fluorometric assay as previously described (22Nakayama M. Ishidoh K. Kayagaki N. Kojima Y. Yamaguchi N. Nakano H. Kominami E. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysates were incubated with acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-MCA) (for caspase-3) and acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-7-amido-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (Ac-IETD-MCA) (for caspase-8). Then the release of fluorescent 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured on a fluorometer (Labsystems). To perform functional screening, we first immortalized DKO MEFs by a 3T3 protocol and established several independent cell lines from primary DKO MEFs. TNF-induced cell death of immortalized DKO MEFs was completely inhibited by a broad caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) (data not shown), indicating that the cell death was caspase-dependent. After confirming that almost all DKO MEFs died within 2 weeks of TNF treatment (data not shown), we introduced a retroviral cDNA library derived from mouse bone marrow stromal cells to DKO MEFs and selected surviving clones. Through this functional screening, we identified a novel gene, named Bsac(basic, S AP, andcoiled-coil domain). Bsac cDNA encodes 964 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 102.6 kDa. BSAC is composed of N-terminal basic, glutamine-rich, central SAP and C-terminal coiled-coil domains (Fig.1 A). Whereas the basic domain contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal, the SAP DNA binding domain is supposed to mediate the binding of DNA to nuclear scaffold or matrix and be involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control (23Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). BSAC also contains proline-rich sequence at the C terminus, which is reminiscent of a transcriptional activation domain (24Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). A BLAST search revealed a high homology of Bsacto human MAL/MKL1, suggesting that Bsac is a murine homologue of human MAL/MKL1 (15Ma Z. Morris S.W. Valentine V. Li M. Herbrick J.A. Cui X. Bouman D. Li Y. Mehta P.K. Nizetic D. Kaneko Y. Chan G.C. Chan L.C. Squire J. Scherer S.W. Hitzler J.K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 220-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Mercher T. Coniat M.B. Monni R. Mauchauffe M. Khac F.N. Gressin L. Mugneret F. Leblanc T. Dastugue N. Berger R. Bernard O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5776-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). BSAC also showed a structural homology to a heart-specific transcription factor, myocardin (14Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins constitute a novel family (Fig. 1 B). We also found related proteins in Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1 B). Northern blot analysis showed that the Bsac transcripts of 5.1, 2.7, and 1.5 kb are ubiquitously expressed in various adult murine tissues (Fig.2 A). The 2.7- and 1.5-kb transcripts might represent alternative splicing products ofBsac. A polyclonal Ab against BSAC was raised in rabbits by immunizing a glutathione S-transferase-BSAC-(46–147) fusion protein prepared in Escherichia coli. Western blot analysis of the lysate from wild-type MEFs demonstrated that the anti-BSAC Ab specifically recognized a protein of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 2 B). The apparent molecular mass of BSAC was significantly larger than the predicted molecular mass (102.6 kDa). This discrepancy might be due to the C-terminal proline-rich sequence of BSAC. The molecular mass of endogenous BSAC in human cell lines (HeLa and 293) appeared to be slightly smaller than that in murine MEFs. This difference may be due to the fact that murine BSAC contains 35 amino acids in addition to the N terminus of human BSAC/MAL/MKL1 (Fig. 1 A). Immunofluorescent analysis using HeLa cells showed that BSAC is a nuclear protein (Fig. 2 C). Because BSAC contains a SAP DNA binding motif and is localized in the nuclei, we next tested whether BSAC possesses transcriptional activity by fusing it to the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4. Expression of GAL4 fusion protein containing full-length BSAC and its deletion mutants was verified by Western blotting using anti-GAL4 Ab (data not shown). Overexpression of BSAC potently activated GAL4-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 3 A). Serial deletion mutants revealed that deletion of the N-terminal 779 amino acids, ΔN-(1–779), did not reduce but significantly enhanced its transcriptional activity, suggesting that the N-terminal portion of BSAC suppresses transcriptional activity of the C-terminal portion. On the other hand, a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 364 amino acids, ΔC-(601–964), did not exhibit transcriptional activity (Fig.3 A). Collectively, these results indicated that BSAC is a transcriptional activator, and the C-terminal portion (residues 780–964) mediates this activity. Given that BSAC has transcriptional activity, we next tried to identify a target promoter of BSAC. A previous study showed that myocardin activated promoters containing multiple, but not single, CArG boxes that serve as the binding site for SRF (6Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 14Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Since BSAC showed homology to myocardin (Fig. 1 B), we tested whether BSAC also activates promoters containing the CArG boxes. As expected, BSAC potently activated a reporter containing five tandem copies of the CArG boxes (pSRF-luciferase) (Fig. 3 B). More importantly, in contrast to myocardin, BSAC also activated the c-fospromoter that contained a single CArG box (Fig. 3 C). Mutation of the CArG box in the c-fos promoter significantly reduced the activation by BSAC (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the transcriptional activity of BSAC is mediated by the canonical CArG box sequence. To further investigate the mechanism by which BSAC exerts transcriptional activity, we next performed reporter assays using Myc-tagged deletion mutants of BSAC with the c-fos promoter. Expression of these mutants was verified by Western blotting using anti-Myc Ab (Fig.4 A). In contrast to the reporter assays using GAL4 fusion proteins (Fig. 3 A), either BSACΔN-(1–373) or ΔC-(601–964) did not activate the c-fos promoter (Fig. 4 B). These results indicated that both the N- and C-terminal portions are required for the BSAC-mediated transcriptional activity. The inability of N-terminal deletion mutants to exhibit transcriptional activity in this system might be caused by a defect in nuclear localization. To address this possibility, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with Myc-tagged deletion mutants of BSAC and then examined the subcellular localization of BSAC by confocal microscopy. Whereas BSACΔN-(1–373) and ΔN-(1–516) lost their abilities to localize in the nuclei (Fig. 4,C and D), ΔC-(543–964) and ΔC-(601–964) were predominantly localized in the nuclei (Fig. 4, E andF). Collectively, these data indicated that the N-terminal 373 amino acids containing basic and glutamine-rich domains is required for the nuclear localization of BSAC. We next investigated whether BSAC directly binds to the CArG boxes by EMSA. Recombinant Myc-tagged BSAC, Myc-tagged myocardin, and SRF proteins were translated in vitro and subjected to EMSA using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing the CArG box derived from the c-fos promoter. SRF formed a complex with the CArG box, which was supershifted by anti-SRF Ab (Fig. 5 A). As reported previously, myocardin alone did not form a complex with the CArG box, but the addition of Myc-tagged myocardin to SRF formed an additional upper complex (Fig. 5 A, asterisk). The upper complex was removed by anti-Myc Ab, indicating that this complex contained the Myc-tagged myocardin. BSAC alone also did not form a complex with the CArG box. In contrast to myocardin, however, BSAC did not form a complex with the CArG box even in the presence of SRF (Fig.5 B). Moreover, we did not detect a complex of BSAC with the CArG box using a nuclear extract from 293 cells transiently transfected with both BSAC and SRF (data not shown). Since BSAC was initially identified by functional screening, we examined whether BSAC actually inhibits TNF-induced cell death of DKO MEFs. DKO MEFs were stably transfected with retroviral expression vectors for mock, FLAG-tagged BSAC, or FLAG-tagged Bcl-2. To avoid clonal variation, pooled cells after drug selection were used for experiments. The expression of transfected proteins was verified by Western blotting with anti-FLAG Ab (Fig. 6 A). As shown in Fig.6 B, BSAC as well as Bcl-2 significantly protected the cells from TNF-induced cell death. However, such a protective effect of BSAC was not observed against cell death induced by staurosporin (Fig.6 C), which is primarily mediated by mitochondria-dependent pathway. To explore the mechanism by which BSAC inhibits TNF-induced cell death, we examined whether BSAC inhibits TNF-induced caspase activation. In the mock transfectant, robust activation of caspase-3 and -8 was observed at 12 and 24 h after TNF treatment (Fig. 6,D and E). In contrast, activation of both caspase-3 and -8 was significantly inhibited in the BSAC and Bcl-2 transfectants (Fig. 6, D and E). Collectively, these results indicated that BSAC suppresses TNF-induced cell death by inhibiting activation of caspases. We also tested whether BSAC inhibits cell death induced by other death receptors such as Fas. However, we observed only a marginal inhibitory effect of BSAC on Fas-induced apoptosis of murine B cell lymphoma A20.2J (data not shown), suggesting that the antiapoptotic function of BSAC depends on cell type and proapoptotic stimuli. We finally determined the responsible domain of BSAC for inhibiting TNF-induced cell death of DKO MEFs. We stably transfected DKO MEFs with FLAG-tagged BSAC deletion mutants by retroviral vectors, and the expression of transfected proteins was verified by Western blotting with anti-FLAG Ab (Fig.7 A). DKO MEFs stably expressing either BSAC ΔN-(1–373), ΔN-(1–516), ΔC-(543–964), or ΔC-(601–964) were not significantly protected from TNF-induced cell death as compared with the mock transfectant (Fig. 7 B). Given that BSAC lost its transcriptional activity when deleted of either N- or C-terminal domains (Fig. 4 B), these results suggested that the transcriptional activity of BSAC is indispensable for the antiapoptotic function. In the present study, we identified a novel transcriptional activator, BSAC, by functional cloning. BSAC is a potent transcriptional activator and suppresses TNF-induced cell death by inhibiting activation of caspases. BSAC is a SAP domain-containing nuclear protein and shows a high structural similarity to a heart-specific transcription factor, myocardin. Although BSAC activates promoters containing the CArG boxes, we could not demonstrate a complex formation of BSAC with the CArG box even in the presence of SRF. Our preliminary data showed that BSAC did not interact with SRF, but overexpression of SRF inhibited BSAC-induced transcriptional activity with the c-fospromoter. 2T. Sasazuki and H. Nakano, unpublished data. Although the detailed mechanism by which BSAC activates CArG box-containing promoters remains to be determined by further study, one possible explanation is that BSAC may bind a molecule other than SRF to form a ternary complex with the CArG boxes. Alternatively, an additional molecule may be required for the complex formation of BSAC with SRF. Domain mapping analysis of BSAC showed that deletion of the N-terminal 373 or C-terminal 364 amino acids almost completely abolished transcriptional activity with the c-fos promoter (Fig.4 B). Subcellular localization analysis showed that the deletion of the N-terminal 373 amino acids impaired nuclear localization of BSAC (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that nuclear localization signal exists in this region. Since the basic domain contains the KKAKELKPKVKKLK sequence, this may act as a bipartite nuclear localization signal (25Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Taken that the C-terminal 185 amino acids containing proline-rich sequence was sufficient for BSAC-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig.3 A), the N-terminal basic region and the C-terminal proline-rich sequence of BSAC are required for nuclear localization and transcriptional activation, respectively. Functional roles of the SAP and coiled-coil domains of BSAC remain to be determined by further studies. Because BSAC contains a SAP DNA binding motif and is localized in the nuclei, it seems unlikely that BSAC directly inhibits caspase activation. Indeed, we could not observe any interaction or co-localization of BSAC with caspase-3 and -8 (data not shown). A transcription factor, NF-κB, has been shown to exert antiapoptotic function by up-regulating antiapoptotic genes, such asCash/Flip, Xiap, or Bcl-x L(26Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Thus, BSAC may up-regulate antiapoptotic molecule(s), which in turn inhibit(s) caspase activation. Consistent with this notion, transcriptional activity of BSAC was well correlated with its antiapoptotic function. However, we could not observe up-regulation ofCash/Flip, Xiap, Bcl-2, orBcl-x L in the BSAC transfectants (data not shown), suggesting that BSAC may control some other antiapoptotic molecules yet to be determined. Although both BSAC and myocardin activate promoters containing the CArG boxes, we observed significant differences between these two proteins. First, the expression of myocardin was restricted to the heart (14Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), but the expression of BSAC was ubiquitous. Second, in contrast to myocardin, BSAC did not form a ternary complex with the CArG boxes in the presence of SRF. Third, BSAC activated promoters containing either single or multiple CArG boxes, but myocardin could not activate the c-fos promoter containing a single CArG box. Collectively, BSAC and myocardin seem to differentially regulate target genes in a cell type- and promoter-dependent manner. Myocardin has been shown to be essential for heart development (14Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Since BSAC is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, it would be interesting to examine whether BSAC is involved in the development of various organs. Recently, two groups independently identified the human homologue ofBsac named MAL/MKL1 as a fusion transcript withOTT/RBM15 generated by t(1,22) translocation in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (15Ma Z.

Although these studies suggested a critical role of OTT/RBM15-BSAC/MAL/MKL1 in the development of acute leukemias, the function of these proteins remains unknown. Accumulating data have demonstrated that the deregulation of c-fos is critically involved in oncogenesis (27Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In this regard, the transcriptional function of BSAC to strongly activate c-fospromoter may represent a link of BSAC to the leukemogenesis. In another aspect, the antiapoptotic function of BSAC may be also involved in the development of leukemias. Further studies are under way to address these possibilities. We thank Y. Suzuki, G. P.

Three mammalian isoforms, PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ1, are expressed in all tissues (4Shima H. Hatano Y. Chun Y.S. Sugimura T. Zhang Z. Lee E.Y. Nagao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunocytochemistry using isoform-specific antibodies suggested that expression of PP1 isoforms varied in different brain regions where they are also localized to different subcellular compartments (6Strack S.

Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3375-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, PP1β was the predominant isoform associated with microtubules in the neuronal cell body, whereas PP1γ1 and PP1α were preferentially concentrated in dendritic spines (6Strack S. Kini S.

Villa-Moruizz E. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) showed that the distribution of PP1 isoforms in cells was highly dynamic. This placed new emphasis on understanding the mechanisms that target individual PP1 isoforms to cellular organelles. Isolation of PP1 bound to skeletal muscle glycogen (10Hubbard M.J. Cohen P.

Biochem. 1992; 210: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) established the paradigm that regulatory or targeting subunits bound to PP1 catalytic subunits dictate the subcellular localization, substrate recognition, and hormonal control of PP1. The search for PP1 regulators that control functions as diverse as protein synthesis, gene expression, cell division, and motility has thus far yielded more than 50 PP1-binding proteins (12Cohen P.T.

PP1 plays a key role in regulating synaptic transmission in mammalian neurons (18Winder D.G. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). PP1γ1 and PP1α, but not PP1β, were enriched in dendritic spines (6Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp.

Recent studies (20Muly E.C. Greengard P. Goldman-Rakic P.S. J. Comp.

Prior studies showed that anti-neurabin immune complexes from rat brain contained PP1γ1 but excluded PP1β (23MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E.

Far Westerns of brain extracts using recombinant PP1 catalytic subunits as probes suggested that neurabins displayed a significant preference for PP1γ1 and PP1α over PP1β (24Colbran R.J.

Our studies highlighted a domain in both neurabins that displayed PP1 isoform selectivity similar to the native proteins. Subsequent analyses of chimeric neurabins focused attention on sequences in neurabin I that regulated PP1 activity and determined PP1β binding. Mutation of the PP1 catalytic subunit also suggested that its C terminus participated in neurabin binding. Finally, neurabin complexes from tissues of a PP1γ null mouse confirmed their preference for PP1γ1 and PP1α over PP1β. These studies provided the first experimental evidence for structural contributions from both PP1 and its regulator, neurabin, in selective targeting of PP1γ1 and PP1α to the neuronal actin cytoskeleton. A monoclonal antibody against neurabin I (dilutions used for Western blotting are in parentheses) (1:250) and a pan anti-PP1 antibody (1:2000) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against neurabin II/spinophilin (1:500) was described previously (65Oliver C.J. Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Elliott E. Bloomer W.A.C. Barutigan D.L. Colbran R.J. Shenolikar S.

The plasmid, pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences), containing a cDNA encoding amino acids 354–494 of rat neurabin II (NrbII) fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was described previously (27Smith F.D. Oxford G.S. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19894-19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding amino acids 374–516 of rat neurabin I (NrbI) were PCR-cloned with the following DNA oligonucleotide primers: 5′-ACCTGGATCCACGCGTCTGCTTC-3′ (NrbI primer 1) and 5′-AGAATTCTTATATGCCAAGCCCATCCTC-3′ (NrbI primer 2) by using full-length neurabin I cDNA as template and subcloned intoBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-5X-2. A similar approach was also used to clone this cDNA into the NcoI and HindIII sites of pRSET-B (Invitrogen) that expressed hexahistidine-tagged neurabin. To generate NrbI/NrbII chimeras, two different strategies were used. The cDNAs encoding GST-NrbCH3, NrbI-(374–443), were PCR-amplified using NrbI primer 1 and 5′-CAACCCGGGAATTTCCGAG-3′. This introduced 5′-BamHI and 3′-SmaI restriction sites. NrbII-(435–494) was generated from an NrbII cDNA using 5′-GATTCCCGGGCTTTCAGAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTGTCAGAGGTTTTCACCGTC-3′, a primer derived from the pGEX vector. This introduced 5′-SmaI and 3′-NotI sites in NrbII fragment. Following digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, the two PCR products were ligated together into the BamHI and NotI sites in pGEX-5X-2. Other chimeras were generated using the following strategy. For GST-NrbCH4, the NrbII fragment was PCR-amplified using 5′-CGTGGGATCCAGGCGTCGTCAGTG-3′ (NrbII primer 1) and 5′-CAAGCCAACAATCTCCACACACCCTG-3′ that yielded a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-NrbI overhang. The NrbI fragment was PCR-amplified using 5′-GTGTGGAGATTGTTGGCTTGCCGCAAG-3′ and the NrbI primer 2 to yield a cDNA with 5′-NrbII overhang and 3′-EcoRI site. The two PCR products were combined and used in a second PCR with NrbII primer 1 and NrbI primer 2. Following digestion with BamHI andEcoRI, the chimeric PCR product was subcloned into pGEX-5X-2. Other primers used to generate the chimeras shown in Fig.4 A are as follows. At site 1, 5′-GGTGCTGAAATGGATCTTCCTATTTGCTGGGATTTCTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAGCAAATAGGAAGATCCATTTCAGCACCGC-3′ produced NrbCH1; 5′-CAACTAAACTTAATTTTCCGGCTCGGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CCCGAGCCGGAAAATTAAGTTTAGTTGTGCTCCGATTAAGG-3′ were used for NrbCH2. At site 3, 5′-CATCTTCTTCATCGTCCTCTGTGCCCGTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGACGGGCACAGAGGACGATGAAGAAGATG-3′ produced NrbCH5; 5′-TCCCCCTCATCCTGCTCTTCCAGGGCACTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTGGAAGAGCAGGATGAGGGGGACGACAG-3′ yielded NrbCH6. All cDNAs were verified by direct DNA sequencing. pRSET-B encoding hexahistidine-NrbI-(374–516) was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysSEscherichia coli (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown in LB media to an A 600 = 0.6, and protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the media and further incubation for 2 h at 30 °C. Following the lysis of bacterial cells using sonication, hexahistidine fusion protein was purified on Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The pGEX-5X-2 plasmids were transformed into BL21-Codon Plus-RIL (Stratagene), and the bacteria were grown in LB media toA 600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the media and continued growth for 6 h at 24 °C. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French press (at 1000 pounds/square inch), and GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (AmershamBiosciences).

The tissue was homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1% w/v deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin using a Dounce homogenizer. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against 100 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmbenzamidine for 3 h with one change of buffer. The lysates were used either immediately or frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. For immunoprecipitation, anti-NrbI or NrbII antibody (10 μl) was mixed with rat brain (2.5 mg of total protein) or mouse brain lysate (4 mg of total protein) for 1 h at 4 °C. A 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad) and protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) (25-μl total bed volume) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. The beads were washed 4 times with NETN-250 (250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40), and the bound proteins were eluted using 25 μl of SDS sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. For sedimentation or pulldown assays, glutathione-Sepharose (25-μl bed volume) was equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline. GST-neurabin proteins were added, and the volume was adjusted to 300 μl with Tris-buffered saline prior to incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 2 times with Tris-buffered saline, and rat brain lysate (5 mg total protein) was added and the mixture incubated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with NETN-250, and the bound proteins were eluted using 25 μl of SDS sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue staining verified the loading of GST-neurabins on beads, and the specific PP1 isoform sedimented was quantified by immunoblotting and densitometry using Densitometer SI and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity-purified sheep IgGs specific for PP1β or PP1γ1 (23MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol.

The anti-β and anti-γ1 resins (0.1 ml packed beads) were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with 0.25 ml of a rat brain protein phosphatase catalytic subunit preparation containing a mixture of PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits in 2.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2 (Buffer A), and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The resin was washed 4 times with 5 ml of Buffer A, and bound PP1s were eluted sequentially with 3 mmagnesium chloride (3× 0.3-ml aliquots) and then 3 msodium isothiocyanate (3× 0.3-ml aliquots), both in Buffer A. The eluted samples were dialyzed separately against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEGTA, 2 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol before storage at −80 °C. By using affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to specific PP1 isoforms (6Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and recombinant PP1 isoforms as standards, the purity of the immunopurified rat brain PP1 isoforms was verified, and protein concentration was estimated (0.5–2.5 μg/ml). PP1 catalytic subunit was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to DeGuzman and Lee (28DeGuzman A. Lee E.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and purified PP2A catalytic subunit was provided by Brian Wadzinski, Vanderbilt University. Human PP1α in pK233 vector was a gift from Richard Honkanen, University of South Alabama College of Medicine (29Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E.

CRHM2, a chimera of residues 1–273 of human PP1α fused to amino acids, 267–309, from the bovine PP2ACα catalytic subunit, has been described previously (29Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All recombinant phosphatases were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (31Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol.

Fractions containing phosphorylase phosphatase activity were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Phosphorylase bobtained from Calzyme Laboratories, Inc., was phosphorylated using phosphorylase kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and used as substrate in a protein phosphatase activity as described in Shenolikar and Ingebritsen (32Shenolikar S.

Assays with PP1 and PP2A were performed for 10 min at 37 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol using 20 μm32P-labeled phosphorylase a or 0.2 μm GluR1 as substrates and restricted to a maximum of 20% release of [32P]phosphate to ensure linearity. Three major PP1 isoforms, PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ1, are expressed in the mammalian brain. Purification of neurabin I (NrbI) and neurabin II/spinophilin (NrbII) from rat brain showed preferential association with PP1γ1 and not PP1β (23MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Neurabin association with PP1α was not analyzed. To analyze neurabin-PP1 complexes from rat brain, we immunoprecipitated NrbI and NrbII from brain lysates by using antibodies specific for each neurabin isoform (Fig.1). Immunoprecipitates with either antibody contained both NrbI and NrbII, consistent with the heterodimerization of these proteins (23MacMillan L.B. Bass M.A. Cheng N. Howard E.F. Tamura M. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35845-35854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 65Oliver C.J. Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Elliott E. Bloomer W.A.C. Barutigan D.L. Colbran R.J. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4690-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with PP1 isoform-specific antibodies showed that the anti-NrbI and NrbII immunoprecipitates contained PP1γ1 and PP1α but not PP1β. This suggested that PP1β was selectively excluded from neuronal complexes containing neurabins. To investigate PP1 recognition by the individual neurabins, we expressed recombinant neurabin polypeptides in E. coli as proteins fused to GST; these constructs lacked the actin-binding and the C-terminal dimerization domains. The GST fusion proteins affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose were utilized in sedimentation assays or pulldowns from rat brain lysates (Fig.2 A). Immunoblotting showed that GST-NrbI-(374–516), GST-NrbI-(436–479), GST-NrbII-(354–494), and GST-NrbII-(427–470) did not associate with endogenous brain neurabins (data not shown). In contrast, all four peptides bound PP1. The larger polypeptides, GST-NrbI-(374–516) and GST-NrbII-(354–494), bound both PP1α and PP1γ1, whereas only the NrbI fusion protein bound significant amounts of PP1β. Equivalent amounts of the smaller GST-NrbI-(436–479) and GST-NrbII-(427–470) polypeptides showed a reduced binding to PP1α and PP1γ1 and failed to bind any detectable PP1β. We utilized laser densitometry to quantify PP1 binding by recombinant neurabins in several independent experiments (Fig.2 B). The data are presented as percentage of each PP1 isoform present in the input lysate (5 mg of total protein) that was sedimented by a fixed amount of GST fusion (20 μg). This emphasized the greater efficiency of GST-NrbI-(374–516) and GST-NrbII-(354–494) to sediment PP1γ1 (15% of total) and PP1α (∼9% of total). By comparison, GST-NrbI-(374–516) bound 3% of total PP1β in the input lysate, and GST-NrbII-(354–494) bound only 0.6% of PP1β. These data also showed that the smaller neurabin peptides were 5–10-fold weaker in binding PP1γ1 and PPα and demonstrated no PP1β binding. This suggested that the central PP1-binding domain in NrbI and NrbII contained some of the structural determinants that dictated the preference of native neurabins for PP1γ1 and PP1α over PPβ. Previous studies (21McAvoy T. Allen P.B. Obaishi H. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Hemmings H.C., Jr. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12943-12949Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,22Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) showed that recombinant neurabin peptides, like many other PP1 regulators, inhibited the in vitro activity of purified rabbit skeletal muscle PP1 catalytic subunit using phosphorylasea as substrate; skeletal muscle contains multiple PP1 isoforms but is enriched in PP1β (34Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 35Barker H.M. Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Spurr N.K. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, GST-NrbI-(374–516) and GST-NrbII-(354–494) inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of purified rabbit muscle PP1 catalytic subunit with IC50values of 15 and 70 nm, respectively. In contrast, GST-NrbI-(374–516) had no effect on the activity of a structurally related protein phosphatase, PP2A, even at 1,000-fold higher concentration. Substitution of the core PP1-binding motif, KIKF, with alanines to produce GST-NrbI-(374–516), AAAA, abolished the ability of neurabin to inhibit PP1 activity in vitro. Peptides that disrupt PP1 binding to targeting subunits modified AMPA currents in striatal neurons (36Yan Z. Hsieh-Wilson L. Feng J. Tomizawa K. Allen P.B. Fienberg A.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), suggesting that a PP1 complex dephosphorylated the α-amino-5-hydroxy-3-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor. Mutation of the mouse NrbII gene abolished NrbII expression and impaired AMPA receptor regulation (37Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M. Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9287-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) consistent with a deficit in GluR1 (an AMPA receptor subunit) phosphatase activity. Thus, we analyzed the dephosphorylation of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the GluR1 subunit fused to GST that was phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (Fig. 3 B). Both GST-NrbI-(374–516) and GST-NrbII-(354–494) inhibited dephosphorylation of GST-GluRI by skeletal muscle PP1, although requiring higher concentrations than those needed to inhibit its phosphorylase phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 A). PP1 binding was essential as the mutant GST-NrbI-(374–516; AAAA) failed to inhibit GluRI dephosphorylation by PP1. At similar concentrations, GST-NrbII-(354–494) also failed to inhibit PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of GST-GluRI. These data suggested that the interaction of neurabins with PP1 via the KIXF motif regulated its activity against neuronal substrates. To analyze the neurabin sequences that mediated PP1 binding and regulation, we generated chimeric neurabins that exchanged regions of NrbI and NrbII, schematically shown in Fig.4 A. NrbI and NrbII sequences C-terminal to site 1 are highly conserved, whereas those N-terminal to this site diverge significantly. Two other sites, 2 and 3, were selected to narrow down the functional domains. PP1 pulldowns from rat brain lysates (Fig. 4 B) and inhibition of skeletal muscle PP1 (Fig. 4, C and D) were used to characterize the chimeric neurabins. Focusing on the nearly 5-fold difference in PP1β binding shown by GST-NrbI-(374–516) compared with GST-NrbII-(354–494) (Fig. 2), we noted that three chimeras, NrbCH1, NrbCH3, and NrbCH6, showed a dose-dependent association with PP1β, similar to GST-NrbI-(374–516) (Fig. 2), whereas NrbCH2, NrbCH4, and NrbCH5, like GST-NrbII-(354–494), bound little or no PP1β. This highlighted the region between sites 2 and 3 in NrbI (dashed box in Fig.4 A) necessary for effective PP1β recognition. This region was largely eliminated in the shorter peptides, GST-NrbI-(436–479) and GST-NrbII-(427–470), that both failed to bind PP1β. Compared with other recombinant neurabins, NrbCH2 and NrbCH4 were significantly attenuated in their binding to PP1α and PP1γ1 in the pulldown assays. Although the reason for this deficiency is not clear, it emphasizes that proper arrangement of neurabin KIXF and N-terminal regions may be crucial for effective PP1 binding. We also analyzed the neurabin chimeras in protein phosphatase assays, which are more readily quantified than the pulldowns and detected both PP1 activity and binding. We utilized a phosphorylase phosphatase assay in the presence of physiological salt concentrations (100–150 mm KCl or NaCl) shown previously to enhance differences in the properties of modified PP1 re"

The N proteins associate with viral membranes, encapsidate viral RNAs, form viral core structures, and probably participate in viral transcription and replication processes (1Bishop D. Elliot R.

Recent studies have mapped RNA and membrane binding domains to the central and carboxyl-terminal sequences of the protein, respectively (4Severson W. Partin L. Schmaljohn C. Jonsson C. J. Biol.

Additionally, we have demonstrated that N protein trimers can be detected in virus particles, in infected cells, and in vitro (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that trimers represent natural, functional nucleocapsid protein oligomers. Using a genetic assay for the analysis of protein-protein contacts, we have mapped the association domains of the Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV; Ref.3Chizhikov S. Spiropoulou C. Morzunov S. Monroe M. Peters C. Nichol S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nucleocapsid protein to its carboxyl-terminal half and its amino terminus (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The identification of the SNV N protein amino terminus (sequence shown in Fig. 1) as an interaction domain is of interest because structure prediction algorithms implicate this region as a coiled-coil motif (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,10Wolf E. Kim P. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In particular, examination of N protein sequences from seven different hantavirus strains suggested that the amino-terminal 35 residues form trimeric coiled-coils, while residues 40–75 were predicted to form either dimeric or trimeric coiled-coils (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Wolf E. Kim P. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). To test these structure predictions and to help elucidate the mechanisms of hantavirus nucleocapsid protein oligomerization, we have analyzed the characteristics of peptides N-(3–35), N-(43–75), and N-(3–75), corresponding to SNV N protein residues 3–35, 43–75, and 3–75 (see Fig. 1). Our data indicate that while N protein residues 3–35 require high concentrations or low temperatures to form coiled-coils, the N-(43–75) peptide readily assembles stable trimeric coiled-coils, supporting the notion that it carries a “trigger” sequence (11Kammerer R.

Kammerer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11672-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and suggesting that it may initiate the oligomerization process. Interestingly, whereas the longer N-(3–75) peptide demonstrates the capacity to assemble into oligomers, it also forms stable intramolecular coiled-coils. These results suggest that the pathway of hantavirus nucleocapsid oligomerization involves helix bundling or alternative amino-terminal coiled-coil conformations.DISCUSSIONThe hantavirus nucleocapsid proteins assemble with the viral RNAs and polymerase proteins to organize the core structures of hantavirus particles (1Bishop D. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 19-61Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schmaljohn C. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 63-90Crossref Google Scholar). The N proteins are 420–430-residue polypeptides that have been shown to trimerize in vitro and in vivo(8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), presumably enroute to the assembly of higher order structures. Because the amino-terminal 75 N protein residues facilitate oligomerization and carry predicted coiled-coil motifs (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Wolf E. Kim P. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), we investigated the properties of peptides encoding the separate motifs (N-(3–35) and N-(43–75)), along with a longer peptide (N-(3–75)), encoding both motifs.Our data permit several conclusions concerning the N protein coiled-coil motifs. Firstly, the N-(3–35) peptides only adopt coiled-coil conformations at high concentration and/or low temperature (Figs. 2 and 3), and oligomers appeared to be predominantly dimers (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). A second conclusion is that N-(43–75) peptides efficiently form trimeric coiled-coils (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), in agreement with the presence of a trimeric trigger sequence (11Kammerer R. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Steinmetz M. Stock A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Faix J. Gerisch G. Aebi U. Kammerer R.

At low concentration, the peptide remained largely monomeric (Table I and Figs. 4 and 5) but showed a characteristic coiled-coil CD spectrum (Figs. 2 and 3). High concentrations yielded a mixture of monomers, dimers, and trimers (Table I and Figs. 4 and 5). The appearance of a coiled-coil CD spectra involving N-(3–75) monomers implies an intramolecular coiled-coil conformation and is consistent with the concentration independence of the N-(3–75) thermal unfolding transition (Figs. 2 and 3) as well as the apparent cross-linking of N-(3–45) to N-(43–75), and N-(3–75) partners (Figs. 6 and 7).Although our results indicate intra- and intermolecular coiled-coil conformations, it is unclear whether N protein peptides assemble parallel or antiparallel coils. While both types of coils feature heptad repeats with hydrophobic interactions between residues in the designated a and d positions (Refs. 24Oakley M. Kim P.

Given these alternatives, it is useful to consider the six possible homo- and heterodimeric packing arrangements of the N-(3–35) and N-(43–75) peptides. Inspection of the two homodimeric N-(3–35) options suggests a possible preference for the antiparallel conformation, as parallel N-(3–35) coils are predicted to require the unfavorable packing of residue 15 histidines together and basic e and gpositions (Arg-22, Lys-24) together. In contrast, the predicted central N-(43–75) heptad repeats pack complementary glutamate and lysine residues in the parallel conformation (Fig. 8), consistent with the assembly of a parallel trimeric coiled-coil. Despite this, it should be noted that the modeled antiparallel N-(43–75) arrangement also features complementary packing of charged residues. Sequence inspection is similarly inconclusive for heterodimer options; while experimental support for intramolecular N-(3–75) coils indicates that antiparallel heterdimeric coiled-coils are observed, theoretical bonding patterns for the e and g positions do not clearly favor the antiparallel over the parallel arrangement.Figure 8Alternative nucleocapsid protein coiled-coil interactions. The six possible parallel and antiparallel dimeric coiled-coil interactions between the N protein N-(3–35) and N-(43–75) motifs are diagrammed. For convenience, only the predicted core helical residues 4–31 and 44–71 are shown. The heptad repeat a–gpositions are labeled, and interactions between a andd residues are indicated with black circles, while potential hydrophilic interaction positions are marked withgray lines. Note that polar interactions between parallel coils typically involve e–g and g–e bonds, while polar interactions between antiparallel coils involvee–e and g–g bonds. Non-covalent bonds in trimeric coiled-coils are expected to employ the same residues but with tighter packing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Assuming that natural N protein trimers use amino-terminal trimer contacts and utilize precursors with intramolecular, antiparallel, hairpin coils, at least two general alternative trimerization pathways can be envisioned. One such pathway retains the postulated helix-turn-helix arrangement of residues 3–75 in monomers and assembles them into helical bundles in a fashion reminiscent ofEscherichia coli ROP protein packing (27Betz S. Liebman P. DeGrado W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2450-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Banner D. Kokkinidis M. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway requires the unfolding of intramolecular hairpin coils and oligomerization to generate intermolecular coiled-coil trimers, using a conformational switch similar to that of heat shock factor 1 (29Rabindran S. Haroun R. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 30Westwood J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these models, it will be of interest to obtain three-dimensional structures of the hantavirus nucleocapsid amino-terminal domain, and to examine the process of N protein oligomerization in vivo. Hantaviruses are enveloped, animal viruses that can be lethal to humans as a consequence of virus-induced heart, lung, and kidney damage (1Bishop D. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 19-61Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schmaljohn C. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 63-90Crossref Google Scholar). Hantaviral genomes consist of three negative-sense RNAs, which encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), glycoproteins, and nucleocapsid (N)1 protein (1Bishop D. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 19-61Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schmaljohn C. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 63-90Crossref Google Scholar). The N proteins associate with viral membranes, encapsidate viral RNAs, form viral core structures, and probably participate in viral transcription and replication processes (1Bishop D. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 19-61Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schmaljohn C. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 63-90Crossref Google Scholar). Although hantavirus N protein sequences are well conserved and are homologous to the nucleocapsid proteins of other bunyaviruses (1Bishop D. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 19-61Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schmaljohn C. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 63-90Crossref Google Scholar, 3Chizhikov S. Spiropoulou C. Morzunov S. Monroe M. Peters C. Nichol S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the structure or functional domains of the 420–430-residue hantaviral N proteins. Recent studies have mapped RNA and membrane binding domains to the central and carboxyl-terminal sequences of the protein, respectively (4Severson W. Partin L. Schmaljohn C. Jonsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33732-33739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Severson W., Xu, X. Jonsson C. J.

Schmaljohn C. Jonsson C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3301-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have demonstrated that N protein trimers can be detected in virus particles, in infected cells, and in vitro (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that trimers represent natural, functional nucleocapsid protein oligomers. Using a genetic assay for the analysis of protein-protein contacts, we have mapped the association domains of the Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV; Ref.3Chizhikov S. Spiropoulou C. Morzunov S. Monroe M. Peters C. Nichol S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nucleocapsid protein to its carboxyl-terminal half and its amino terminus (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The identification of the SNV N protein amino terminus (sequence shown in Fig. 1) as an interaction domain is of interest because structure prediction algorithms implicate this region as a coiled-coil motif (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,10Wolf E. Kim P. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In particular, examination of N protein sequences from seven different hantavirus strains suggested that the amino-terminal 35 residues form trimeric coiled-coils, while residues 40–75 were predicted to form either dimeric or trimeric coiled-coils (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Wolf E. Kim P. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). To test these structure predictions and to help elucidate the mechanisms of hantavirus nucleocapsid protein oligomerization, we have analyzed the characteristics of peptides N-(3–35), N-(43–75), and N-(3–75), corresponding to SNV N protein residues 3–35, 43–75, and 3–75 (see Fig. 1). Our data indicate that while N protein residues 3–35 require high concentrations or low temperatures to form coiled-coils, the N-(43–75) peptide readily assembles stable trimeric coiled-coils, supporting the notion that it carries a “trigger” sequence (11Kammerer R. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Steinmetz M. Stock A.

Kammerer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11672-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and suggesting that it may initiate the oligomerization process. Interestingly, whereas the longer N-(3–75) peptide demonstrates the capacity to assemble into oligomers, it also forms stable intramolecular coiled-coils. These results suggest that the pathway of hantavirus nucleocapsid oligomerization involves helix bundling or alternative amino-terminal coiled-coil conformations. DISCUSSIONThe hantavirus nucleocapsid proteins assemble with the viral RNAs and polymerase proteins to organize the core structures of hantavirus particles (1Bishop D. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 19-61Crossref Google Scholar, 2Schmaljohn C. Elliot R. The Bunyaviridae. Plenum Press, New York1996: 63-90Crossref Google Scholar). The N proteins are 420–430-residue polypeptides that have been shown to trimerize in vitro and in vivo(8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), presumably enroute to the assembly of higher order structures. Because the amino-terminal 75 N protein residues facilitate oligomerization and carry predicted coiled-coil motifs (8Alfadhli A. Love Z. Arvidson B. Seeds J. Willey J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2019-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Wolf E. Kim P. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), we investigated the properties of peptides encoding the separate motifs (N-(3–35) and N-(43–75)), along with a longer peptide (N-(3–75)), encoding both motifs.Our data permit several conclusions concerning the N protein coiled-coil motifs. Firstly, the N-(3–35) peptides only adopt coiled-coil conformations at high concentration and/or low temperature (Figs. 2 and 3), and oligomers appeared to be predominantly dimers (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). A second conclusion is that N-(43–75) peptides efficiently form trimeric coiled-coils (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5), in agreement with the presence of a trimeric trigger sequence (11Kammerer R. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl.

At low concentration, the peptide remained largely monomeric (Table I and Figs. 4 and 5) but showed a characteristic coiled-coil CD spectrum (Figs. 2 and 3). High concentrations yielded a mixture of monomers, dimers, and trimers (Table I and Figs. 4 and 5). The appearance of a coiled-coil CD spectra involving N-(3–75) monomers implies an intramolecular coiled-coil conformation and is consistent with the concentration independence of the N-(3–75) thermal unfolding transition (Figs. 2 and 3) as well as the apparent cross-linking of N-(3–45) to N-(43–75), and N-(3–75) partners (Figs. 6 and 7).Although our results indicate intra- and intermolecular coiled-coil conformations, it is unclear whether N protein peptides assemble parallel or antiparallel coils.

The point mutations in specific conserved sites within the bovine or human PV E2 transactivation domain that result in the loss of transcriptional activation also eliminate E6/E7 promoter repression. E2 induces senescence in HPV-positive cells via pRb- and p21-dependent pathways (25Wells S.I. Francis D.A. Karpova A.Y. Dowhanick J.J. Benson J.D. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because E2 is associated with growth suppression and senescence, it is possible that the protein modulates cellular gene expression related to these processes. Telomeres form the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes composed of tandem arrays of telomeric repeats (5′-TTAGGG-3′ in human) (reviewed in Ref.26Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M.

The hTERT promoter region lacks a canonical TATA or CAAT box and possesses a relatively high density of CpG dinucleotides and Sp1 sites (reviewed in Ref. 29Poole J.C. Andrews L.G. Tollefsbol T.O. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Additionally, the promoter contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites such as Sp1, c-Myc, MZF-2, WT1, and possibly MAZ (34Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C.

The observation that the introduction of viral E2 into HPV-infected cells inhibits telomerase activity raises the possibility of a link between hTERT expression and the E2 protein. In this study, we demonstrate that E2 represses the hTERT promoter. Moreover, Sp1 sites within the hTERT promoter are important for negative regulation of the HPV E2 protein. The pGL3B-hTERT luciferase reporter and pCG18-E2 constructs were described previously (34Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pCDNA3–18E2, pCDNA3–16E2, pCDNA3–11E2, and pCDNA3–6bE2 constructs were prepared by subcloning various E2 open reading frames into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) using PCR amplification. The E2 mutant expression vectors were described previously (18Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The c-Myc expression vector was a generous gift from Dr. Martin Eilers. For producing glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in bacteria, each gene was digested with EcoRI-XhoI and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of pGEX4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences). The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). 293T, HeLa, COS-1, and C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 24 h before transfection, 3 × 105 293T or C33A cells were plated in 6-cm dishes. The transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (42Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3507) Google Scholar). DNA was prepared using the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen), and the total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted by the addition of blank plasmid DNA. In some experiments, pRL-tk was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. Equal amounts (5 × 105cells) of cell lysates were used for the detection of luciferase activity (Promega, Madison WI). Renilla luciferase activity was measured with the Dual luciferase kit (Promega). Telomerase activity was analyzed using modified telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay (43Szatmari I. Aradi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Crude cell extracts from 293T cells were prepared by the CHAPS lysis method (44Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D., Ho, P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6550) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation for telomerase-mediated primer extension, the mixtures were heated to 90 °C for 30 min to inactivate telomerase activity. During this treatment, we added RP primer and RPC3g primer, and then the samples were subjected to 29 cycles of PCR amplification. We used MTS primer (5′-AGCATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′) for elongation with telomerase and RP primer (5′-TAGAGCACAGCCTGTCCGTG-3′) and RPC3g (5′-TAGAGCACAGCCTGTCCGTG(CTAACC)3GG-3′) for PCR amplification. Cells transfected with E2 expression vectors were pelleted, boiled for 5 min, separated on a SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked and hybridized to anti-E2 antibody. The proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The pBTdel-204-Sp1-mt and pBTdel-266-Myc-mt plasmids were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using manufacturer's instructions. 10 ng of plasmid template and 125 ng of each primer were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl. Each construct was sequenced to confirm the incorporated mutations. ChIP assays were performed essentially as described in the Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA) protocol. 50% confluent 293T cells in a 10-cm dish were transfected with 1 μg of hTERTp-Luc reporter plasmid and 2 μg of pCG-18E2 plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cross-linked and treated as protocol. Approximately 1 μg of each indicated antibody was used. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of water. To detect the precipitated plasmid sequence, 1–5 μl of DNA in a total volume of 100 μl was subjected to 22–30 cycles of PCR with the following primers for luciferase. Luc5 (5′-ATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACAT-3′) and Luc3 (5′-CATAGCTTCTGCCAACCGAA-3′). The cell growth suppression activity and down-regulation of telomerase activity by E2 suggests a role for the protein in hTERT promoter regulation (45Goodwin E.C. Yang E. Lee C.J. Lee H.W. DiMaio D. Hwang E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10978-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because the catalytic subunit of telomerase is a primary target for activity and its gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level, we examined whether hTERT promoter activity was regulated by E2. The C33A cells were co-transfected with E2 and the full-length hTERT reporter construct (pBT-3970). The pBT-3970 reporter was repressed upon co-transfection with E2 expression plasmids (pCG-18E2). Similar assays were performed with other cell lines including COS-1, 293T, and HeLa. As expected, E2 down-regulated the hTERT promoter in all of the cell lines (Fig. 1 A). To examine the effect of E2 on endogenous telomerase activity, we performed telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay using transient transfection of E2. Consistent with Fig. 1 A, cells expressing E2 showed low levels of telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). As a control experiment, the preheated or RNase-treated samples before extension reaction exhibited no telomerase activity. We also performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis using the same extracts, and we observed the down-regulation of hTERT expression by E2 (data not shown). These data suggested that E2 down-regulates telomerase activity through inhibiting hTERT expression. The relationship between hTERT transcription and HPV-18 E2 expression was further characterized by comparing E2 with p53 and HPV-16 E6 proteins. p53 down-regulates while HPV-16 E6 up-regulates hTERT expression (41Oh S.T. Kyo S. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 36Xu D. Wang Q. Gruber A. Bjorkholm M. Chen Z. Zaid A. Selivanova G. Peterson C. Wiman K.G. Pisa P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, E2 decreases hTERT promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner similar to p53, whereas HPV-16 E6 dose-dependently increases hTERT promoter activity. These results indicate that HPV-18 E2 overexpression results in the down-regulation of the hTERT promoter. Having established that the hTERT promoter is down-regulated by HPV-18 E2, we designed experiments to test whether this activity is observed in E2 proteins from various HPV. Papillomavirus strains fall into two categories, specifically high risk (HPV-16, HPV-18) and low risk groups (HPV-6, HPV-11) for the development of cervical cancer. As shown in Fig.3, a co-transfection of expression vectors encoding various HPV E2 whereby the transcription of HPV E2 was driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter decreased the transcriptional activity of the hTERT promoter. The ability of HPV E2 to down-regulate the hTERT promoter appears to be a universal property of human papillomavirus, regardless of viral type. To determine thecis-element responsible for hTERT down-regulation by E2, we examined a series of hTERT promoter deletion mutants (Fig.4 A). The pBT-3970, pBT-310, and pBT-266 were down-regulated by E2. 3′-E-box-deleted hTERT promoter mutants (pBTdel-463, pBTdel-263, pBTdel-204, and pBTdel-185) were also repressed by E2 (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas the pGL3 basic promoter (a negative control) remained unaffected. Our data indicate that E2 does not influence E-box elements. Previous studies show that bovine papillomavirus E2 binds the Sp1 transactivation domain and superactivates GAL4-Sp1 transcription (20Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We speculate that E2 may activate or repress Sp1-related transcription in a context-dependent manner and consequently down-regulate the hTERT promoter via protein-protein interactions. The hTERT promoter does not contain a specific binding site for E2. Similarly, no binding site has been identified for p53, although the promoter is specifically repressed by this tumor suppressor protein (36Xu D. Wang Q. Gruber A. Bjorkholm M. Chen Z. Zaid A. Selivanova G. Peterson C. Wiman K.G. Pisa P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The E2-mediated transcriptional repression of the hTERT promoter may result from interactions of the protein withcis-elements within this region. The core region of the hTERT promoter (pBT-266 or pBTdel-204) contains five Sp1 and two c-Myc binding sites as shown in Fig. 5. To elucidate the mechanism of hTERT gene regulation, we engineered point mutations in the c-Myc and Sp1 binding sites of the hTERT promoter reporter (Fig. 5). The effects of E2 on various mutated c-Myc binding sites were initially examined in 293T cells. As shown in Fig.6, E2 down-regulated both the wild-type promoter and mutant c-Myc binding site promoter constructs. The results indicate that c-Myc binding sites are not involved in E2-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter. To further confirm that c-Myc does not affect the double mutant hTERT promoter (pBT-266-Myc-mt21), we performed transient transfection assays using c-Myc and various hTERT promoters. As expected (Fig. 6 C), c-Myc activated the hTERT promoter (pBT-266) and single mutant hTERT promoters (pBT-266-Myc-mt1 and pBT-266-Myc-mt2). However, no activation of the double mutant hTERT promoter (pBT-266-Myc-mt21) was observed. These data correlate with previous results and confirm that c-Myc binding sites are not required for E2-mediated down-regulation of the hTERT promoter.Figure 6Mutational analyses of c-Myc binding sites in the minimum hTERT promoter. A, schematic diagram of the minimum hTERT promoter region containing c-Myc binding sites.Crossed-out boxes indicate the mutated sites for c-Myc as shown above figure. B, 293T cells were co-transfected with pBTdel-204, mutant reporter vectors, and E2 expression vector. The luciferase activities of pBT-266 vector were normalized to 100, and the relative luciferase activity is shown. The experiments were performed a minimum of three times. C, c-Myc up-regulates the hTERT promoter. However, hTERT mutated at the c-Myc binding site is not up-regulated by c-Myc. 293T cells were co-transfected with pBTdel-204, its mutant reporter vectors, and c-Myc expression vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm our results and examine the importance of Sp1 binding sites in the hTERT promoter, we performed site-directed mutagenesis experiments followed by reporter assays on Sp1 mutants (Fig. 7). A series of Sp1-binding defective mutants was constructed as described previously (46Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed with reporter and E2 expression vectors (Fig. 7, A and B). The abrogation of each Sp1 site by substitution of the amino acids within this region (pBTdel-204-Sp1mt) reduced transcription to a gradual extent. Co-transfection with E2 reduced the reporter activity of each mutant but not that of pBTdel-204-Sp1mt-54321. As shown in Fig. 7 C, a loss of all of the Sp1 binding sites impaired the down-regulation of the hTERT promoter by E2. In addition, the rate of inhibition of hTERT promoter activity by E2 was gradually decreased. These data clearly demonstrate that E2 targets multiple Sp1 binding sites to induce the down-regulation of the hTERT promoter. We next examined whether HPV-18 E2 protein targets Sp1 sites of the hTERT promoter in vivo. To investigate the association between E2 and the hTERT promoter, we performed a ChIP analysis on 293T cells transfected with the hTERT promoter in combination with pME18S-FLAG-Sp1, pCG-18E2 or a control vector. The presence of a particular promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitates was detected by semi-quantitative PCR using specific pairs of primers spanning the luciferase sequence region. The antibodies to FLAG and E2 precipitated the wild-type reporter sequence (pBTdel-204) but failed to precipitate significant amounts of reporter DNA from pBTdel-204-Sp1mt-54321 (Fig.8). Therefore, the results from the ChIP assay confirm that E2 binds the hTERT promoter region via Sp1in vivo. The HPV E2 protein is essential for viral DNA replication and transcription. In HPV-positive cells, the overexpression of full-length E2 protein results in growth inhibition and apoptosis (22Francis D.A. Schmid S.I. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Wells S.I. Francis D.A. Karpova A.Y. Dowhanick J.J. Benson J.D. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The continuous expression of E6 and E7 genes from integrated HPV DNA is a hallmark in the majority of HPV-positive carcinoma cell lines. E6 and E7 play central roles in the progression and maintenance of cancers. Several recent reports show that E6 stimulates the hTERT promoter and activates telomerase activity (39Gewin L. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7198-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 40Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 41Oh S.T. Kyo S. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5559-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). HPV E2 suppresses the expression of E6 and E7 in HeLa cells, which in turn leads to cell growth arrest (22Francis D.A. Schmid S.I. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Wells S.I. Francis D.A. Karpova A.Y. Dowhanick J.J. Benson J.D. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Intact E2 transactivation function is required for the binding of this protein to the integratedE6/E7 promoter to suppress promoter activity in HeLa cells. However, only E6/E7 suppression by ectopic expression of E2 is associated with E2-mediated senescence and cell growth suppression, because the overexpression of Rb or p53 in HeLa cells does not result in senescence (25Wells S.I. Francis D.A. Karpova A.Y. Dowhanick J.J. Benson J.D. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is possible that E2 has other functions that contribute to cell growth suppression. Here we demonstrate that the overexpression of E2 results in the down-regulation of the hTERT promoter. Because E2-mediated suppression of the hTERT promoter is observed in p53 and pRb-negative C33A cells, this inhibition may not be necessary for the activity of these two proteins. Although we have not determined the possibility of the physical interactions between E2 and telomerase, the identification of differentially expressed subunits of telomerase indicates major control points at the level of transcription. Accordingly, we speculate that E2 may control telomerase activity primarily at the transcriptional level. Our data indicate that protein-protein interactions between E2 and Sp1 are significant for E2-mediated down-regulation of the hTERT promoter, although the exact mechanism remains to be clarified. It is possible that E2 destabilizes protein-protein interactions between Sp1 and co-activators, which result in the negative regulation of the transactivation function of Sp1 itself. Previously, we documented that E2 transactivation mutants do not bind the CREB-binding protein, a co-activator, and lose their transactivation function. Through competition with co-activators, E2 down-regulates the transactivation function of Sp1-mediated hTERT promoter activity. However, our ChIP assay indicates that E2 is recruited to the hTERT promoter in a Sp1-dependent manner, suggesting the existence of another mechanism. Alternatively, E2 may recruit the co-repressor complex via its DNA-binding domain. The hTERT promoter is affected by trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Sp1 plays an important role in the enhancement of the hTERT promoter by trichostatin A (47Cong Y.S. Bacchetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35665-35668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 48Takakura M. Kyo S. Sowa Y. Wang Z. Yatabe N. Maida Y. Tanaka M. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3006-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the hTERT promoter is regulated by the status of acetylation within the promoter region. Moreover, Sp1 recruits either the histone deacetylase or histone acetylase complex to the hTERT promoter. NFκB is a good example of a factor that uses co-repressors and co-activators to regulate gene expression. The activation of transcription by NFκB requires a number of co-activators, whereas repression requires histone deacetylase co-repressors (49Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether E2-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter is derived from the recruitment of the histone deacetylase complex. We are currently attempting to determine the importance of the co-repressor complex in the regulation of the hTERT promoter activity by E2. HPV DNA is maintained as an episome in precancerous lesions, and E2 is important for episomal DNA replication (1Howley P.M. Fields virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1996Google Scholar, 9Ustav M. Ustav E. Szymanski P. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Androphy E.J. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. Nature. 1987; 325: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The E2 function is almost lost during carcinogenic progression as a result of viral DNA integration into the cellular genome and concomitant disruption of the E2 open reading frame. The loss of E2 increases the level ofE6/E7 whose continuous expression is necessary to maintain the transformed state of cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Howley P.M. Fields virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1996Google Scholar). These phenomena indicate that the loss of E2 protein expression contributes to carcinogenesis. The observed down-regulation of the hTERT promoter by E2 suggests that this protein has another role in host cell growth control. Moreover, loss of E2 protein expression may be contributed to E2-mediated cell growth suppression. Although E2 repressesE6/E7 expression in HPV-infected cells, the protein may contribute to cell growth suppression in other ways (25Wells S.I. Francis D.A. Karpova A.Y. Dowhanick J.J. Benson J.D. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5762-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We believe that E2-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter is not sufficient to suppress cell growth. However, our data suggest that E2 itself has a direct role in senescence induction, independent of the down-regulation of E6/E7. In this report, we clearly demonstrate that E2 down-regulates the hTERT promoter in various cell lines. Our findings elucidate the biological activity of E2 in cell growth suppression and reveal the cellular target genes modulated by this protein."

Binding studies indicated an altered binding pattern of the mutant toxin in that bound toxin could not be fully displaced by a high molar excess of fully trypsin-activated toxin. These results suggest that proteolytic removal of the N-terminal peptide of Cry1Ac is an important step in toxin activation.

Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ingestion by a susceptible insect the protoxin is activated through the proteolytic removal of an N-terminal peptide of 25–30 amino acids and approximately half of the remaining protein from the C terminus. The activated toxin then binds to specific sites on the brush border membrane of the midgut epithelium before inserting into the membrane and forming a pore. B. thuringiensis toxins produced in transgenic plants have often been expressed as proteins truncated at the C terminus because this has resulted in higher expression levels (2Vaeck M. Reynaerts A. Hofte H. Jansens S. Debeuckeleer M. Dean C. Zabeau M. Vanmontagu M. Leemans J. Nature. 1987; 328: 33-37Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). These truncated forms are regularly described as the active form of the toxin despite having an intact N terminus. The role of the C-terminal extension to the active toxin is believed to be in the formation of crystalline inclusion bodies within the bacterium and is dispensable for toxicity (3Park H.W. Bideshi D.K. Federici B.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 4449-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Little is known about the role of the N-terminal peptide and whether its removal is important in the mechanism of action of the toxin. It has previously been observed that if an engineered Cry1Ab or Cry1Ca toxin lacking the N-terminal peptide is expressed in Escherichia coli, growth of the E. coli culture is severely affected (4Martens J.W.M. Knoester M. Weijts F. Groffen S.J.A., Hu, Z.H. Bosch D. Vlak J.M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1995; 66: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Strizhov N. Keller M. KonezKalman Z. Regev A.

Microbiol. 2001; 43: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It was speculated that the N-terminally truncated toxin was free to interact with the cell membrane of the E. coli host cell and that the first 28 amino acids prevented the Cry toxin from inserting into the membrane. When expressed in B. thuringiensis an N-terminally truncated Cry1Ca toxin was expressed at a much lower level than the full-length toxin, and the formation of crystals was repressed. Although this might have indicated a role of the N terminus in promoting crystallization, the low levels of expression and lack of crystals might also have been an effect of an inappropriate interaction between the toxin and the host cell (6Kouskoura T. Tickner C. Crickmore N. Curr. Microbiol. 2001; 43: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this article we compare the toxicity, binding, and pore-forming abilities of activated Cry1Ac with a partially activated recombinant form of Cry1Ac in which the N terminus remains intact after treatment with trypsin. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove the N-terminal tryptic cleavage site of Cry1Ac using methods described previously (7Smedley D.P. Ellar D.J. Microbiology (Read.). 1996; 142: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two amino acid substitutions were made, R28T and I29M. Both mutant and wild-type toxins were expressed inE. coli JM109, and crystalline material was purified from sonicated cell cultures by sucrose density centrifugation. The protoxin was solubilized in 50 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.4 (37 °C, 1 h) and then activated by incubation with trypsin (1 mg/ml; 37 °C, 1 h) in the same buffer. The trypsin-treated toxin was purified by Mono Q FPLC1 and stored in buffer A: 100 mm methylglucamine chloride, 10 mm2-N-cyclohexylaminoethanesulfonic acid, pH 9.5 (Fig.1). Manduca sexta larvae were reared on artificial diet (Bio-Serv) at 23 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness. BBMVs from fifth instar larvae were prepared and analyzed as reported previously (8Wolfersberger M. Luethy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Physiol. 1987; 86: 301-308Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar) except that neomycin sulfate (2.4 μg/ml) was included in the buffer (300 mmmannitol, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 150 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 8.0). The vesicles were dialyzed overnight against 400 volumes of 150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.5 (Sigma) and sonicated for six periods of 30 s each at 25 °C (BRANSON 1200 sonic bath, Danbury, CT) in the same solution. BBMV enrichment was estimated according to the alkaline phosphatase (AP) and cytochrome-coxidase activity relative to the initial homogenate (9.5-fold increase in AP/mg of protein). Vesicle orientation was determined from the AP activity in the presence and absence of 0.02% Triton X-100. Pore formation activity was assayed by monitoring changes in membrane potential with the fluorescent, positively charged dye 3,3′-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine (Dis-C3-(5), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (9Lorence A. Darszon A. Diaz C. Lievano A. Quintero R. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was recorded at 620/670 nm in a Hansatech system (Norfolk, England). Hyperpolarization causes dye internalization into the BBMVs and a decrease in fluorescence; depolarization causes the opposite effect. BBMVs (10 μg) previously loaded with 150 mm KCl were suspended in 900 μl of 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 10 mmHEPES-HCl, pH 8 buffer. After equilibration of the dye (2 min), 50 nm toxin was added. Changes in membrane potential were monitored by successive additions of KCl to the BBMV suspension. Analyses of the slope (m) of ΔF (%)versus K+ equilibrium potential (E K+) (mV) curve are reported in this work. E K+ was calculated with the Nernst equation. Binding analysis and homologous competition of wild-type and mutant toxins to M. sexta BBMVs were performed in a semiquantitative binding assay. Toxin was biotinylated by using biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (RPN28,Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding was performed in 100 μl of binding buffer (PBS, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6). 20 μg of BBMV protein were incubated with 10 nm biotinylated toxin in the absence or presence of different (50–1000)-fold excesses of unlabeled, activated Cry1Ac toxin for 1 h. The unbound toxin was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The BBMVs were suspended in 100 μl of binding buffer and washed twice with the same buffer. Finally the BBMVs were suspended in 20 μl of PBS, pH 7.6, and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added. Samples were boiled for 3 min, electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The biotinylated protein that remained bound to the vesicles was visualized by incubating with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:4000 dilution) for 1 h followed by luminol as described by the manufacturers. Bioassays were conducted by means of the diet-surface contaminating procedure. A constant volume of the sample to be tested (35 μl in PBS) was applied on the diet surface contained in 24-well plates (Cell Wells, Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY). Two neonate M. sexta larvae were placed in each well, and 24 larvae were assayed for each protein concentration. The plates were incubated under the following conditions: 28 °C, 65 ± 5% relative humidity, and a 16:8 h, light:dark photoperiod. Mortality was recorded after 7 days. The effective dose estimates (50% lethal concentration of the toxins, LC50) were calculated using PROBIT analysis. Fifth instar M. sexta larvae were chilled for 10 min on ice, and midgut tissue was dissected. Midgut juice was separated from solid material by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 10 min) and filtered through 0.22-μm filters. The midgut juice was stored at −70 °C. 2 μg of protoxin in 30 μl of 50 mmNa2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 11.0 were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of different amounts of M. sexta midgut juice (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000, midgut juice:protoxin, w/w). Proteolysis was stopped by adding phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm, final concentration), and the samples were briefly centrifuged to remove insoluble material. 5-μl samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. In vitro pore formation assays performed with either fully or partially activated Cry1Ac toxin clearly demonstrate that the partially activated toxin is incapable of forming pores inM. sexta BBMVs since no membrane polarization was observed upon addition of toxin (Fig. 2). To test whether this could have been due to reduced binding of the partially activated toxin, binding assays were performed (Fig. 3). The results show that initial binding of labeled, fully activated Cry1Ac toxin to M. sexta BBMVs is competitive and largely abolished in the presence of an excess of unlabeled toxin. In contrast, although the partially activated toxin binds to the BBMVs a significant proportion remains bound even in the presence of the large excess of unlabeled fully activated toxin. When the assay was repeated in the absence of BBMVs no labeled toxin was observed in the insoluble fraction.Figure 3Binding of wild-type and mutant Cry1Ac toM. sexta brush border membrane vesicles.Biotinylated, trypsin-treated wild-type (a) or mutant (b) toxin were incubated with the BBMVs in the absence (lanes 1) or presence of different -fold excesses of unlabeled, fully activated Cry1Ac toxin (lanes 2, 1000-fold;lanes 3, 500-fold; lanes 4, 100-fold, lanes 5, 50-fold.

The wild-type protoxin was found to have an LC50 of 0.1 (0.08–0.15) ng/cm2, whereas the mutant protoxin had an activity of 2.5 (1.8–3.9) ng/cm2. Given that no appreciable in vitro pore formation activity could be observed with the mutant toxin it was interesting to observe that the mutant protoxin demonstrated in vivo toxicity, albeit ∼25-fold lower than the wild-type toxin. A possible explanation for this is that proteinases other than trypsin within theM. sexta gut were fully activating the mutant toxin. This was tested by incubating wild-type and mutant toxins with varying concentrations of M. sexta gut extract and monitoring activation by SDS-PAGE. The results are shown in Fig.4. At the highest concentration of gut extract used both protoxins appear fully activated, suggesting that alternative enzymes do indeed exist. At higher dilutions of gut extract it can be seen that while the wild-type protoxin was fully activated, the mutant protoxin was only partially activated at the N terminus. N-terminal sequencing has confirmed that the higher molecular weight band has the same N terminus as the protoxin. The reduced toxicity of the mutant protoxin could thus be explained by the reduced rate of N-terminal activation. The fact that mutant toxin, activated by endogenous proteinases, has insecticidal activity eliminates the possibility that the lack of pore-forming ability described earlier could have been due to a misfolded and thus inactive protein. It has previously been suggested that the presence of the N-terminal peptide might prevent binding to non-target membranes (4Martens J.W.M. Knoester M. Weijts F. Groffen S.J.A., Hu, Z.H. Bosch D. Vlak J.M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1995; 66: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that the pore-forming potential of domain I is only realized after proteolytic removal of this peptide. In the homologous Cry1Ab protoxin a similar mutation that prevented N-terminal processing also showed reduced toxicity to M. sexta larvae (4Martens J.W.M. Knoester M. Weijts F. Groffen S.J.A., Hu, Z.H. Bosch D. Vlak J.M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1995; 66: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for a possible role of the N-terminal fragment in modulating binding of the toxin has come from the solution of the structure of the Cry2Aa toxin (10Morse R.J. Yamamoto T. Stroud R.M. Structure. 2001; 9: 409-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Unlike previously reported structures for the Cry3Aa and Cry1Aa toxins, the Cry2Aa toxin had not been proteolytically activated and therefore contained an uncleaved N-terminal peptide. The structure revealed that the N-terminal region masks a region of the toxin believed to be involved in the interaction between the toxin and the brush border membrane of the target insect. The N terminus of the Cry1 toxins might similarly prevent an interaction between the toxin and the target membrane, an important initial step in pore formation. The altered binding properties of the mutant toxin could be due to an additional binding activity between the N-terminal peptide and the BBMVs following binding of the toxin to its receptor. This additional binding affinity would be strong enough to prevent full displacement of the toxin by an excess of competitor. The conclusion to be drawn from this work is that N-terminal cleavage of a Cry1 protoxin is required before the toxin can properly be considered active. The reduced activity of the mutant toxin in vivo suggests that it might be possible to engineer a toxin that would only be fully active in insects sharing a specific combination of receptor and gut proteinase."

The mammalian form of the enzyme, unlike itsEscherichia coli counterpart, can also interconvert UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc. One key feature of the epimerase reaction mechanism is the rotation of a 4-ketopyranose intermediate in the active site. By comparing the high resolution x-ray structures of both the bacterial and human forms of the enzyme, it was previously postulated that the additional activity in the human epimerase was due to replacement of the structural equivalent of Tyr-299 in the E. coli enzyme with a cysteine residue, thereby leading to a larger active site volume. To test this hypothesis, the Y299C mutant form of the E. coli enzyme was prepared and its three-dimensional structure solved as described here. Additionally, the Y299C mutant protein was assayed for activity against both UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc. These studies have revealed that, indeed, this simple mutation did confer UDP-GalNAc/UDP-GlcNAc converting activity to the bacterial enzyme with minimal changes in its three-dimensional structure. Specifically, although the Y299C mutation in the bacterial enzyme resulted in a loss of epimerase activity with regard to UDP-Gal by almost 5-fold, it resulted in a gain of activity against UDP-GalNAc by more than 230-fold.

Filling C. Jörnvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Typically, members of this superfamily catalyze oxidation-reduction type reactions with some functioning, for example, as dehydrogenases, dehydratases, isomerases, or epimerases (2Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. González-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 3Duax W.L. Griffin J.F. Ghosh D. Curr. Opin.

In most cases, enzymes belonging to this superfamily are typically around 250 amino acid residues in length and contain two characteristic signature sequences. The first of these is a YXXXK motif in which the conserved tyrosine plays a key role in catalysis. The second of the signature sequences is a GXXXGXG motif, which is located near the cofactor-binding pocket. Recently, on the basis of amino acid sequence homologies, it has been suggested that other members of the SDR superfamily may not function as enzymes or, at least, not in oxidation-reduction type capacities (5Baker M.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of these proteins, human TIP30, is a cofactor that enhances human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat-activated transcription (6Xiao H. Tao Y. Greenblatt J. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TIP30 is 98% identical to human CC3, a protein associated with suppression of metastasis in small cell lung carcinomas (7Shtivelman E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The recent and elegant structural analyses by Stammers et al. (8Stammers D.K. Ren J. Leslie K. Nichols C.E. Lamb H.K. Cocklin S. Dodds A. Hawkins A.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6619-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that NmrA from Aspergillus nidulans, a negative transcriptional regulator, also belongs to the SDR protein superfamily. One of the first members of the SDR protein superfamily to be extensively studied by high resolution x-ray crystallographic analyses was UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from Escherichia coli, which is somewhat larger with 338 amino acid residues per subunit (Ref. 9Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11469-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and references therein). This dimeric enzyme functions in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the interconversion of UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc as indicated in Scheme FS1. Within the last three years, the molecular architecture of the human form of the enzyme complexed with NADH and UDP-Glc has also been determined to high resolution (1.5 Å) and has led to the suggestion that Tyr-157 serves as the active site base required for catalytic activity (10Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both the bacterial and human epimerases are B-side-specific enzymes. As indicated in Fig. 1, the polypeptide chain of each subunit of human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, hereafter referred to simply as epimerase, adopts a distinctly bilobal structure. The N-terminal domain is characterized by a seven-stranded, parallel β-sheet, whereas the smaller C-terminal domain contains six strands of β-sheet with five α-helices. The active site is wedged between the interface of these two domains.Figure 1Ribbon representation of one subunit of human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase complexed with NADH and UDP-Glc. The N- and C-terminal domains are displayed in green andlight green, respectively, and the binding positions for the NADH and UDP-Glc molecules are indicated by theball-and-stick models. Tyr-157 is the catalytic base that abstracts the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen during the reaction mechanism. All figures were prepared with the software package, MOLSCRIPT (28Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, the two enzymes are 55% identical with respect to amino acid sequence. A recent structural analysis of the human epimerase complexed with NADH and UDP-GlcNAc demonstrated that accommodation of the additional N-acetyl group at the C2 position of the sugar is accomplished by movement of the side chain of Asn-207 (16Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15131-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additionally, from this investigation it was shown that the active site volume of the human protein is ∼15% larger than that observed for the E. coli enzyme. The reaction mechanism of epimerase is thought to occur via the abstraction of the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen of the sugar by the active site tyrosine, transfer of a hydride from C4 of the sugar to C4 of NAD+ (si-face) to generate a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate and NADH, and finally rotation of the resulting 4′-ketopyranose moiety in the active site, thereby presenting the opposite face of the sugar to the reduced dinucleotide for subsequent hydride transfer back to the UDP-sugar substrate. A superposition of the human epimerase/NADH/UDP-GlcNAc structure onto the model of the bacterial enzyme with bound NADH and UDP-Glc is displayed in Fig.2. Note that Cys-307 in the human enzyme is replaced with a tyrosine residue (Tyr-299) in the enzyme fromE. coli. This substitution of the more bulky tyrosine residue in the active site of the bacterial enzyme could partly explain the inability of the E. coli enzyme to interconvert UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc due to lack of the space required for rotation of the 4′-ketopyranose intermediate. To test this hypothesis, Tyr-299 in the E. coli enzyme was changed to a cysteine residue via site-directed mutagenesis. Here we present both enzymatic assays and high resolution x-ray crystallographic data demonstrating that replacement of Tyr-299 with a cysteine residue confers activity on the E. coli enzyme against UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc with minimal structural perturbations. The plasmid containing the epimerase Y299C mutation was constructed via cassette mutagenesis using the plasmid pTZSynE (17Liu Y. Thoden J.B. Kim J. Berger E. Gulick A.M. Ruzicka F.J. Holden H.M. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10675-10684Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Y299C oligonucleotides were designed as follows: 1) Y299C-top, 5′-GGCGTGAAGGTGACCTTCCGGCGTGCTGGGCGGACG-3′ and 2) Y299C- bottom, 5′-CTAGCGTCCGCCCAGCACGCCGGAAGGTCACCTTCACGCCGC-3′ (Invitrogen). These oligonucleotides were utilized to give overhangs compatible with SacII and NheI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends. They were boiled for 5 min and then slowly cooled to 4 °C to form the double-stranded cassette. The cassette was subsequently phosphorylated at the 5′-ends with polynucleotide kinase. The pTZSynE plasmid was digested with SacII andNheI, treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and purified with the GeneClean DNA purification kit. The mutagenic cassette was ligated into the cut pTZSynE plasmid with T4 DNA ligase. The wild-type and Y299C mutant epimerases were purified as previously described (18Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Three different protein/NADH/UDP-sugar complexes were crystallized for this investigation, namely the complex of the wild-type enzyme with NADH and UDP-GlcNAc and the complexes of the Y299C protein with NADH and either UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-Glc. Note that attempts to solve the structures of the Y299C protein with NADH and either UDP-GalNAc or UDP-Gal resulted in either UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-Glc, respectively, being observed in the resulting electron density maps. Clearly the mutant enzyme is catalytically active in the crystalline state. For the preparation of the above complexes, solid UDP-sugar was added to either the wild-type or Y299C protein samples to a final concentration of 20 mm. The samples were then allowed to stand at 4 °C for 3 days. Following this incubation, they were dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and concentrated to 25 mg/ml. Single crystals of all three complexes were grown by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion at 4 °C. The precipitant was 15–19% polyethylene glycol 8000, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Crystal growth generally required 4–7 days with crystals attaining maximum dimensions of 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm. All of the crystals belonged to the space groupP3221 with typical unit cell dimensions ofa = b = 83.2 Å and c = 109.5 Å and one molecule per asymmetric unit. Prior to x-ray data collection, the crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution composed of 24% polyethylene glycol 8000, 600 mm NaCl, 20 mm UDP-sugar, 20% ethylene glycol, and 100 mmHEPES (pH 7.5). The crystals were suspended in 20-μm nylon loops and flash-cooled to −150 °C in a nitrogen gas stream.

Open table in a new tab Aliquots of each purified enzyme were stored in 50% glycerol with 4 mm NAD+ in liquid nitrogen until needed. Assays to determine the level of epimerase activity with respect to UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc were performed essentially as previously described (11Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the conversion of UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc was measured in a 12.5-μl reaction containing 2.5 μl of premix (0.05 μCi of UDP-[14C]Gal (Amersham Biosciences), 2 mm cold UDP-Gal, 0.2m glycine buffer, pH 8.7), 2.5 μl of 20 mmNAD+, and 7.5 μl of purified protein diluted in Johnston buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.3 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml). The amount of protein used per reaction ranged from 0.0001 to 0.005 μg, in order to stay within the predetermined linear range of the assay. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and were stopped by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min. Following high speed centrifugation for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, 10 μl of the sample was spotted onto a prewashed PEI-Cellulose TLC plate (Baker). After thorough drying, the plate was run for 16–24 h in a solvent containing 1.5 mmNa2B4O7, 5 mmH3BO3, and 25% ethylene glycol. After running, plates were air-dried before being exposed to storage phosphor screens (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. Images were visualized with a Typhoon 9200 variable mode imager and quantified using ImageQuant software (both from Amersham Biosciences). Percent conversion was determined by dividing the product signal by the total signal and multiplying by 100. This number was converted to specific activity using the formula: ((% conversion/100) × 5.085 nmol of substrate)/(μg of enzyme × 30 min). The conversion of UDP-GalNAc to UDP-GlcNAc was determined essentially as described above, with the following assay components per 25 μl of reaction: 8.75 μl of premix (0.04 μCi of UDP-[14C]GalNAc (ICN), 1.89 mm cold UDP-GalNAc, 28.6 mm pyruvate, 286 mm glycine, pH 8.7, 5 μl of 20 mm NAD) and 11.25 μl of protein diluted in Johnston buffer. The amount of protein used in each assay ranged from 0.0005 to 2.0 μg. Assays were performed as for UDP-Gal, with a TLC run-time of 10 h and quantified as described for UDP-Gal. The percentage conversion was translated to specific activity using the following formula: ((% conversion/100) × 16.52909 nmol of substrate)/(μg of enzyme × 30 min). To confirm the difference in substrate specificities of the wild-type human and E. coli epimerases, as well as to define the catalytic impact of the Y299C mutation in the bacterial enzyme,in vitro enzymatic activity analyses were conducted with purified proteins and each of the substrates in question, UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc. With regard to the wild-type human and E. colienzymes, the results presented in TableIII clearly confirm earlier reports (11Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum.

Med. 1986; 314: 1257-1258PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that although human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase demonstrates strong activity against both substrates, the bacterial enzyme is active only against UDP-Gal. Indeed, the wild-type bacterial enzyme is more than 8,000-fold less active against UDP-GalNAc than it is against UDP-Gal. In contrast, the Y299C bacterial enzyme demonstrated significant activity against both substrates (Table III). Although the Y299C mutation in the bacterial enzyme resulted in a loss of epimerase activity with regard to UDP-Gal by almost 5-fold, it resulted in a gain of activity with regard to UDP-GalNAc by 230-fold.Table IIIEnzymatic activity assaysSubstrateEnzymeSpecific activityS.D.n 3-an, the number of separate analyses performed with aliquots of the indicated purified enzymes.mol product/mol active sites/secUDP-Gal (0.41 mM)Wild-type bacterial enzyme23.911.016Wild-type human enzyme33.811.217Y299C mutant enzyme5.11.623UDP-GalNAc (0.66 mM)Wild-type bacterial enzyme0.0030.00212Wild-type human enzyme26.07.112Y299C mutant enzyme0.690.13183-a n, the number of separate analyses performed with aliquots of the indicated purified enzymes. Open table in a new tab As a control experiment, the first complex to be solved in this combined structural and functional investigation was that of the wild-type bacterial enzyme with bound NADH and UDP-GlcNAc. In light of past x-ray crystallographic studies of the binding of UDP-sugar moieties such as UDP-mannose or UDP-4-deoxy-4-fluoro-α-d-galactose to E. coliepimerase (25Thoden J.B. Hegeman A.D. Wesenberg G. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6294-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it was anticipated a priori that little conformational change would accompany the binding of UDP-GlcNAc in the active site of the wild-type enzyme. In retrospect that assumption was perhaps naı̈ve in that the ligand, UDP-GlcNAc, contains a rather bulky group attached to C2 of the hexose. The electron density corresponding to the sugar moiety is indeed disordered in the map, thus indicating that it adopts multiple conformations when bound in the epimerase active site. The electron density corresponding to the UDP portion of the ligand is unambiguous, however. Additionally, the electron density corresponding to the polypeptide chain between Asn-131 and Ile-134 is weak. There are several regions in the polypeptide chain that change in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc versus UDP-Glc, as can be seen by the superposition displayed in Fig. 3. Indeed, the α-carbons for the epimerase/NADH/UDP-Glc and epimerase/NADH/UDP-GlcNAc models superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.52 Å. Most of the changes are confined primarily to the regions delineated by Phe-121 to Asn-131, Tyr-177 to Pro-180, Gln-194 to Leu-200, Phe-218 to Arg-231, and Arg-292 to Asp-302. All of these regions contain either side chains or backbone atoms that participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the UDP-sugars and, thus, are sensitive to the chemical identity of the ligand positioned in the active site. In the previously determined wild-type epimerase/NADH/UDP-Glc model, for example, Oγ of Ser-124 lies within 2.6 Å of the 4′-hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety, while the side chains for both Asn-179 and Tyr-299 form hydrogen bonds with the 6′-hydroxyl group of glucose (9Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11469-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The movement of the side chain carboxamide group of Asn-199, as shown in Fig. 3, is especially striking. When UDP-Glc is bound in the active site, both the 2′-hydroxyl group of the sugar and an α-phosphoryl oxygen are hydrogen-bonded to Nδ2 of Asn-199. However, with UDP-GlcNAc bound in the active site, this interaction is missing, and the side chain of Asn-199 rotates toward the nicotinamide ring of NADH. There is a general shift of ∼0.4 Å of the nucleoside portions of UDP-GlcNAc versus UDP-Glc in the active site. The lack of activity of the E. coli epimerase against UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc most likely arises from the following two key factors: (a) the inability of the larger sugar moiety to correctly position into the active site and (b) the inability of the 4′-ketopyranose intermediate to rotate in the active site. The second structure that was solved in this investigation was that of the Y299C mutant protein complexed with NADH and UDP-GlcNAc. The electron density corresponding to the region surrounding the mutation is well ordered, as displayed in Fig.4a. In fact, the molecular changes that occur upon substituting a cysteine residue for Tyr-299 are localized in the regions defined by Arg-176 to Asn-179, Ala-216 to Arg-231, and His-287 to Cys-299. The net effect of these changes, as indicated in Fig. 5a, is an opening of the substrate binding cleft, which results in an overall 20% increase in the volume of the active site for the Y299C mutant protein as calculated with the program VOIDOO (26Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Newsl. Prot. Crystallogr. 1993; 29: 26-28Google Scholar, 27Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The α-carbons for the wild-type enzyme with bound UDP-Glc and the Y299C mutant protein with bound UDP-GlcNAc correspond with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.96 Å.Figure 5Structure of the Y299C enzyme/NADH/UDP-GlcNAc complex. a, a superposition of the α-carbons for the wild-type enzyme with bound NADH and UDP-Glc in red and the Y299C enzyme/NADH/UDP-GlcNAc complex in black.

For the sake of clarity, only those amino acid side chains in the wild-type enzyme that are important for anchoring the hexose moiety to the protein are shown, namely Asn-179 and Asn-199. Ordered water molecules are depicted in yellow-blue gradients. Also included are those residues thought to play critical roles in the reaction mechanism of epimerase, namely Lys-153, Tyr-149, and Ser-124.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A portion of the electron density map corresponding to the bound UDP-GlcNAc in the Y299C mutant protein is depicted in Fig.4b and, unlike that observed for the wild-type protein/NADH/UDP-GlcNAc complex, the sugar moiety is reasonably well ordered. Average B-factors for the NADH and the UDP-GlcNAc ligands are 22.0 and 43.6 Å2, respectively. A close-up view of the active site for the Y299C mutant protein is displayed in Fig. 5b. In the case of the wild-type bacterial epimerase, the side chain functional groups of Asn-179, Asn-199, and Tyr-299 form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the hexose sugar moieties of the UDP-Glc or UDP-Gal substrates. Additionally, Oγ of Ser-124 lies within 2.6 Å of the 4′-hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety in UDP-Glc. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, the UDP-GlcNAc ligand is situated in the active site such that these residues are no longer within hydrogen-bonding distance to the hydroxyl groups of the hexose. Indeed, the sugar hydroxyl groups lie only within hydrogen-bonding distance to solvent molecules. In the wild-type protein/NADH/UDP-Glc model, the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor is in the syn-conformation as would be expected for aB-side-specific enzyme. In the Y299C mutant protein/NADH/UDP-GlcNAc model, the nicotinamide ring is in theanti-conformation such that the carbonyl oxygen of its carboxamide group lies within 2.5 Å from Oγ of Ser-124. The distance between the C4 carbon of theN-acetylglucosamine moiety and the C4 carbon of the nicotinamide ring is 9.4 Å. In the wild-type enzyme/NADH/UDP-Glc complex, this distance is 3.8 Å. The fact that the mutant protein but not the wild-type bacterial enzyme is active against UDP-GalNAc as a substrate argues for the fact that in the mutant protein the UDP-sugar must, at some point, rotate into the proper position for catalysis. The final structure to be solved in this investigation was that of the Y299C mutant protein complexed with NADH and UDP-Glc. The electron density corresponding to the hexose portion of the UDP-Glc was weak. This is in sharp contrast to that observed for the wild-type enzyme/NADH/UDP-Glc crystalline complex (19Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The α-carbons for the wild-type and Y299C proteins complexed with NADH and UDP-Glc correspond with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.56 Å. For comparison, the α-carbons for the mutant proteins that were complexed with either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcNAc superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.22 Å. A close-up view of the Y299C mutant protein active site with NADH and UDP-Glc is shown in Fig. 6. In this complex, the nicotinamide ring of the NADH ligand is in thesyn-conformation. The position of the glucose moiety is approximate because of the weakness of the electron density. It is clear, however, that in the Y299C mutant protein the loss of the hydrogen bond between Tyr-299 and the 6′-hydroxyl group of glucose normally observed in the wild-type enzyme results in a movement of the sugar away from the nicotinamide ring. The 5-fold reduction in enzymatic activity of this Y299C mutant protein arises in part because of the loss of this electrostatic interaction, thereby leading to unproductive binding modes for the hexose portion of the UDP-sugar substrate. In conclusion, by comparing the three-dimensional structures of both the human and bacterial UDP-galactose 4-epimerases, it was possible to predict the necessary single site-specific change that would be required to confer UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc interconverting activity on the E. coli protein. This combined structural/functional analysis emphasizes the power in comparing in detail various superfamily members for the rational design of new enzymatic activities on particular protein scaffolds.

Activation of a cascade of cysteine proteases, i.e. caspases, plays a key role in the effector phase of virus-induced apoptosis. However, little is known about pathways leading to the activation of initiator caspases in virus-infected host cells. Recently, we have shown that Sendai virus (SeV) infection triggers apoptotic cell death by activation of the effector caspase-3 and initiator caspase-8. We now investigated mechanisms leading to the activation of another initiator caspase, caspase-9. Unexpectedly we found that caspase-9 cleavage is not dependent on the presence of active caspases-3 or -8. Furthermore, the presence of caspase-9 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells was a prerequisite for Sendai virus-induced apoptotic cell death. Caspase-9 activation occurred without the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria and was not dependent on the presence of Apaf-1 or reactive oxygen intermediates. Our results therefore suggest an alternative mechanism for caspase-9 activation in virally infected cells beside the well characterized pathways via death receptors or mitochondrial cytochrome c release.

On the one hand, this process could be interpreted as an efficient mechanism for the release and dissemination of host cell-produced progeny virions by minimizing inflammatory or immune responses to the viral agent. On the other hand, virus-induced apoptosis could be regarded as a defense strategy of multicellular host organisms for the purposeful destruction of infected cells. Most viruses that lead to apoptotic cell death trigger the activation of the caspase cascade for the execution process of the death program, e.g. adenovirus (20White E. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 505-513Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), HIV (21Bartz S.R. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HSV-1 (22Galvan V. Brandimarti R. Roizman B. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). However, for a comprehensive understanding of virus-induced pathogenesis through apoptotic host cell death a detailed dissection of molecular events leading to the activation of so called initiator caspases for distinct viruses have to be done. In a recent report, for example, it has been demonstrated that expression of the second exon of HIV-1 Tat leads to an increased level of pro-caspase-8, which contributes to increased apoptosis and sensitivity to apoptotic signals in the cells of HIV-1-infected patients (21Bartz S.R. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar data, concerning the role of individual caspases during other viral infections are missing. Recently, we have demonstrated that host cell infection with Sendai virus (SeV; a negative strand RNA virus belonging to the paramyxovirus family) results in caspase-3 and -8 activation leading to a subsequent host cell apoptosis, which could be completely blocked by z-VAD-fmk (25Bitzer M. Prinz F. Bauer M. Spiegel M. Neubert W.J. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lauer U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we provide evidence that in addition to an activation of caspase-8, SeV infection triggers the activation of a further initiator caspase, caspase-9. Furthermore our results suggest an alternative mechanism for caspase-9 activation in virally infected cells in addition to the well characterized pathways via death receptors or mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Sendai virus (strain Fushimi) and for immunofluorescence studies a recombinant SeV coding for the reporter protein “green fluorescent protein” by an insertion between the two viral genes for P and M in the wild-type genome were grown in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs as described previously (29Leyrer S.

Methods. 1988; 22: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and MCF7 cells (human breast carcinoma) from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ETACC, Salisbury, United Kingdom). MCF-vector, -Bcl-2, and -Bcl-XL cells were a kind gift of M. Jäättelä, Copenhagen, Denmark, and have been described previously (31Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Abdul R.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). MCF7-CrmA cells were a kind contribution of C. Vincenz, Ann Arbor, MI. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Caspase-9 +/+ and −/− MEF cells were a kind gift from Richard Flavell, New Haven, CT, and Apaf-1 +/+ and −/− MEFs have been described previously (32Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were seeded out in 35-mm plates and infected when monolayers had reached 85–90% confluency. As standard inoculation procedure monolayers were washed twice with medium lacking FCS (washing medium) and overlaid with washing medium containing SeV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, non-adsorbed virus was removed by repeated washing of the cells. Medium containing FCS (growth medium) was added, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. 5 × 106 cells were harvested, washed once in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mmHEPES, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4), resuspended in 0.2 ml of hypotonic buffer, and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cell membranes were disrupted by shearing 15× through a 21-guage needle. Debris, nuclei and mitochondria, were removed by centrifuging twice at 18,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were boiled at 100 °C with one-third volume of 4× RotiLoad (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 10 min. From each sample 30 μg of cellular protein was electrophoretically separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (AmershamBiosciences), and subjected to immunoblotting. To detect proteolytic processing of caspases Western blot assays were done as described previously (25Bitzer M. Prinz F. Bauer M. Spiegel M. Neubert W.J. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lauer U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 106 cells (including floating cells) were harvested, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing leupeptin (3 μg/ml), pepstatin (3 μg/ml), aprotinin (3 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm)) and boiled after 15 min of incubation on ice with 4× RotiLoad (Roth) for 10 min. From each sample 30 μg of cellular protein was electrophoretically separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in RotiBlock (Roth) for 1 h. Next, membranes were incubated with the respective antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: anti-FLICE C15 1:10, (Biomedia, Baesweiler, Germany); anti-human caspase-9 1:2000 (kind gift of Y.

Membranes were washed for 1 h with TBS-T, and further detection was performed by the ECL Western blotting detection system on Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Fragmentation of genomic DNA to hypodiploid DNA was assessed by FACS analysis as described previously (25Bitzer M. Prinz F. Bauer M. Spiegel M. Neubert W.J. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lauer U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 cells (including floating cells) were collected and washed once in PBS (5 min, 1000 × g). Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, fixed with 1 ml of acetone-methanol (1:1; −20 °C), and subsequently washed with PBS. Next, the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of PBS containing 1 mg of RNase/ml and incubated on ice for 1 h. After addition of 20 μl of propidium iodide solution (2 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma) and incubation for 30 min on ice, flow cytometry was performed (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using the CellQuest program. Cells to the left of the 2n-peak containing hypodiploid DNA were considered as apoptotic. Annexin staining (Annexin FLUOS staining kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed according to the manufacturer. In brief, 5 × 105 cells (including floating cells) were collected, and pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer, containing 2 μl of each annexin V and propidium iodide solution and incubated on ice for at least 15 min. Flow cytometry was performed as above. Apoptosis was blocked by addition of 20–50 μm of the peptide inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Alexis Biochemicals) every 24 h to the culture supernatant. In other inhibition experiments 1% Me2SO (Sigma) or up to 10 μmN-acetylcysteine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used. For inhibition experiments 5 × 106 cells were infected with SeV (m.o.i. 10) and incubated immediately after infection for various periods of time. Cells were analyzed either by immunoblotting or by flow cytometry. Mircroscopy was performed as described elsewhere (35Wybranietz W.A. Prinz F. Spiegel M. Schenk A. Bitzer M. Gregor M. Lauer U.M. J. Gene Med. 1999; 1: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown on coverslips until they had reached 70–80% confluency. At 48 h postinfection mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker™ (500 nm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS for 30 min at 37 °C, and cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Coverslips were blocked with 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) in PBS (blocking solution) for 10 min. Cells were incubated with anti-cytochromec antibody (1 μg/ml, 7H8.2C12, PharMingen) in blocking solution for 20 min, followed by detection with a secondary CyTM5-conjugated antibody (5 μg/ml, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Slides were mounted in a Mowiol 40–88 (Sigma) preparation containing 2.5% DABCO (Sigma) as an antifade reagent. Specimens were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Recently, we have demonstrated caspase-dependent apoptosis induction and activation of the effector caspase-3 and the initiator caspase-8 in SeV-infected host cells (25Bitzer M. Prinz F. Bauer M. Spiegel M. Neubert W.J. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lauer U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As neither the contribution of each single caspase on the apoptosis-initiating event nor the involvement of other key caspases after SeV infection have been investigated yet, we set out to further characterize the apoptosis initiator mechanisms in our model system of SeV-induced apoptosis. It is well known that caspase-3 can be activated in a caspase-8-dependent pathway as a so-called effector or downstream caspase. On the other hand, caspase-3 has been shown to cleave caspase-8 after being activated by another initiator caspase, caspase-9 (12Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 36Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a starting experiment we chose to exclude the influence of caspase-3 in SeV-infected cells by using the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, which is known to be devoid of functional caspase-3 as a result of a 47-base pair deletion within the caspase-3 coding sequence (37Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Western blot analysis of MCF-7 cells 48 h postinfection (p.i.) showed cleavage of both, caspase-8 and -9, indicating a caspase-3-independent processing of both so-called initiator caspases after SeV infection (data not shown). Starting from this we investigated the process of caspase activation in detail using inhibitors that block different apoptosis signal transducing pathways. Both caspases-8 and -9 have been shown to be capable of indirectly activating the other one (i.e.caspase-9-dependent caspase-8 cleavage and vice versa), depending on the apoptotic stimulus (6Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 38Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of active caspase-8 for caspase-9 cleavage, we used MCF-7 cells overexpressing the cytokine response modifier protein A (CrmA) from cowpox virus, which has been described to predominantly bind to and inhibit caspases-8 and -1 (39Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a result, overexpression of CrmA did not block SeV-triggered cleavage of caspase-9 (Fig.1A) but did inhibit caspase-8 cleavage (Fig. 1B). Moreover, looking at annexin V staining, CrmA overexpression in MCF-7 cells could not reduce the percentage of SeV-induced apoptotic cells compared with MCF-7 control cells (Fig.1C). As a further control demonstrating the dependence of apoptosis on the presence of activated caspases, the broad caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk nearly completely blocked SeV-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). These results suggested a key role of caspase-9 in SeV-induced apoptotic cell death, being independent of the presence of active caspases-3 or -8. Therefore we next used MEF cells prepared from mice lacking caspase-9 (caspase-9 −/−) (40Kuida K. Haydar F.H. Kuan C.Y. Yong G. Taya C. Karasuyama H., Su, M.S.S. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 325-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar) to further determine the role of this caspase in the SeV-mediated death program. Surprisingly, compared with caspase-9 +/+ MEFs SeV-mediated apoptosis was completely absent in caspase-9 −/− cells 48 h p.i. (Fig.2). These results stimulated us to further investigate the mechanisms of caspase-9 activation in SeV-infected host cells.FIG. 2Caspase-9-dependent apoptosis induction in SeV-infected cells. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, either caspase-9 +/+ or −/−, were infected with different amounts of SeV (m.o.i. 2 or 10). The rate of apoptotic cells was determined by detection of sub2n-DNA by FACS analysis 48 h p.i. Uninfected cells served as a background control. Results are representative for two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cytochrome c release from mitochondria has been described as a prerequisite for caspase-9 activation in numerous settings, including certain viral infections (e.g.Ref. 41Roggero R. Robert-Hebmann V. Harrington S. Roland J. Vergne L. Jaleco S. Devaux C. Biard-Piechaczyk M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7637-7650Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol an interaction with the adaptor protein apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (Apaf-1) subsequently leads to an oligomerization of caspase-9 monomers resulting in a self-activating process by an intrinsic autocatalytic activity (42Qin H.X.

Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 activation in this pathway can be blocked by antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family like Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (44Kluck R.M. Bossy W.E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar, 45Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar) by inhibiting the mitochondrial release of intermembrane proteins including cytochrome c (46Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 47Moriishi K. Huang D.S. Cory S. Adams J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9683-9688Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated the effects of SeV infection in MCF-7 cell lines overexpressing either Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 (Fig.3B). Unexpectedly we found caspase-8 cleavage both in Bcl-XL (Fig. 3A, left side) and Bcl-2 (data not shown) as well as caspase-9 cleavage in Bcl-2- (Fig. 3A, right side) and Bcl-XL-overexpressing cell lines (data not shown). Most strikingly, MCF-7 cells overexpressing Bcl-XL (Fig.3C) showed a percentage of annexin V staining quite similar to SeV-infected MCF-7 control cells (Fig. 1C). The functionality of overexpressed Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins in MCF-7 cells was confirmed by an inhibition of apoptosis after the incubation for 24 h with 50 μm cisplatin; the mean percentage of living cells was determined by trypan blue staining to be 1, 57, and 95% for MCF-7 control, MCF-7 Bcl-2, and MCF-7 Bcl-XL cells, respectively. Taken together, these results suggested a SeV-triggered caspase-9 activation not being dependent on cytochrome c release in host cells. However, an inactivation of Bcl-2 proteins during the viral replication cycle of Sindbis virus leading to proapoptotic Bcl-2 fragments has been described recently (48Grandgirard D. Studer E. Monney L. Belser T. Fellay I. Borner C. Michel M.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and therefore could not be ruled out in our setting. Consequently, we further investigated a possible SeV-mediated cytochrome crelease into the cytosol of infected cells. To determine whether a cellular redistribution of cytochrome c plays any role in the signal transduction of SeV-triggered apoptotic cell death, cytochrome c detection in infected cells was performed by immunochemistry and confocal microscopy. Thereby the infection of individual cells could be confirmed by using recombinant SeV particles coding for the reporter protein green fluorescent protein (GFP). Our results demonstrate that cytochrome c (Fig. 4, B and E, displaying blue staining of cytochromec) colocalizes with mitochondria (Fig. 4, A and D, displaying red staining of mitochondria with MitoTracker) for up to 48 h after SeV-GFP infection (Fig. 4C, infection was verified by displaying green staining due to SeV-mediated GFP expression) indicating a lack of cytochrome c release to the cytosol. As a control, cytochrome c release could be demonstrated by a missing colocalization with mitochondria 6 h after incubation of MCF-7 cells with staurosporine (Fig.4F). Since SeV usually is propagated and replicates in caspase-3-competent cells and activation of caspase-3 might be involved in generating proapoptotic cytochrome c-releasing protein fragments (48Grandgirard D. Studer E. Monney L. Belser T. Fellay I. Borner C. Michel M.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we subsequently performed a Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts from SeV-infected CV-1 cells, employing primary antibodies to cytochrome c. In accordance with the immunofluorescence staining results in MCF-7 cells, we did not detect any cytosolic cytochrome c up to 48 h after SeV infection (Fig. 5). In conclusion, the experiments using overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, confocal microscopy, and cytochrome c Western blot analysis clearly demonstrate a cytochrome c-independent caspase-9 cleavage after SeV infection of host cells.FIG. 5Cytochrome c is not released to the cytosol after SeV infection in caspase-3 competent CV-1 cells. SeV-infected CV-1 cells were harvested at the time indicated p.i. (0, 20, 48 h), and the cytosol fraction was examined by immunoblotting for cytochrome c and tubulin (loading control). As a positive control uninfected cells were treated with staurosporine (Stau) for 20 h (left lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Currently, Apaf-1 is the best characterized adaptor molecule being involved in caspase-9 activation. The interaction between both proteins has been described to be highly specific, and it could not be shown for any other caspase so far (36Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 42Qin H.X. Srinivasula S.M., Wu, G. Fernandes A.T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.G. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Theoretically, caspase-9 cleavage could still be mediated by Apaf-1 through a cytochromec-independent mechanism. Therefore we investigated caspase-9 processing in Apaf-1-deficient SeV-infected embryonic fibroblasts (Apaf-1 −/− cells) (32Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). First, looking at the amount of SeV-infected apoptotic cells 48 h p.i., we found a similar percentage of apoptotic cells in Apaf-1 −/− and Apaf-1 +/+ cultures (Fig.6A, column pair on the right side)"

The molecular details, however, by which FVIIa/TF affects gene expression and cellular physiology, remain obscure. Here we show that FVIIa induces a transient phosphorylation of p70/p85S6K and p90RSK in BHK cells stably transfected with either full-length TF or with a cytoplasmic domain-truncated TF but not in wild type BHK cells. Phosphorylation of these kinases was also observed in HaCaT cells, expressing endogenous TF. Phosphorylation of p70/p85S6K coincided with protein kinase B and GSK-3β phosphorylation. Activation of p70/p85S6K was sensitive to inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and to rapamycin, whereas phosphorylation of p90RSK was sensitive to PD98059. FVIIa stimulation of p70/p85S6K and p90RSK correlated with phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4E, up-regulation of protein levels of eEF1α and eEF2, and enhanced [35S]methionine incorporation. These effects were not influenced by inhibitors of thrombin or FXa generation and were strictly dependent on the presence of the extracellular domain of TF, but they did not require the intracellular portion of TF. We propose that a TF cytoplasmic domain-independent stimulation of protein synthesis via activation of S6 kinase contributes to FVIIa effects in pathophysiology.

After binding to the zymogen FVII, activation of the serine proteases FIX and FX and prothrombin takes place, eventually leading to platelet activation and fibrin deposition, inducing the formation of a blood clot. In addition, recent research suggests that TF is implicated in various other physiological events, as is most dramatically demonstrated by the observation that TF knock-out mice die at days 9.5–10.5 of embryogenesis as a consequence of defective neoangiogenesis (4Carmeliet P.

Also, TF plays an eminent role in tumor angiogenesis, because interfering with the association of FVIIa to TF results in a dramatic reduction in tumor potential (5Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A.

Finally, TF/FVIIa complex formation is implicated in the inflammatory response, as evident from the up-regulation of mRNA of pro-inflammatory cytokines (6Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and from the reduction of LD100 Escherichia coli-induced mortality of baboons infused with active site-inhibited FVIIa (7Taylor F.B., Jr. Chang A.C. Peer G., Li, A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, TF also regulates leukocyte trafficking, because inhibiting TF with an antibody resulted in a significant reduction of mononuclear phagocyte's trans-endothelial migration (8Randolph G.J. Luther T. Albrecht S. Magdolen V. Muller W.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 4167-4177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular details of these effects, however, remain largely unresolved but are generally assumed to be a consequence of FVIIa-induced signal transduction in TF-expressing cells (reviewed in Refs. 9Rao L.V.M.

The mechanism for the signal transduction across the membrane is still unclear but may involve the sequestration of FVIIa to the membrane by TF and subsequent proteolytic cleavage and activation of a protease activated receptor (PAR) that remains yet to be unequivocally identified (19Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 20Petersen L.C. Thastrup O. Hagel G. Sørensen B.B. Freskgard P.O. Rao L.V.

Moreover, recently we showed that FVIIa induces the activation of the Src family members c-Src, Lyn, and Yes, followed by stimulation of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. In turn, Rac mediates p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and cytoskeletal reorganization, events which may be related to TF effects in angiogenesis and inflammation (18Versteeg H.H. Hoedemaeker I. Diks S.H. Stam J.C. Spaargaren M. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. van Deventer S.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28750-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown changes in the transcription of various cytokines and extracellular matrix components (6Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Pendurthi U.R. Allen K.E. Ezban M. Rao L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14632-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, although important aspects of TF/FVIIa signal transduction have now been uncovered, significant sections of this signal transduction pathway remain to be explored, and in particular links to the translational process are largely unknown. This prompted us to study possible links between TF/VIIa-induced signal transduction and changes in translation. Initiation of protein synthesis is largely regulated by the kinases c-Akt/PKB and the S6 kinases (e.g. Refs. 23Ueki K. Yamamoto H.R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar and 24Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter proteins activate both the ribosome, by phosphorylation of the Ribosomal S6 protein, and eukaryotic initiation factors, which facilitate binding of the mRNA to the ribosome. In this study, we have investigated the activation of several protein synthesis mechanisms, and we show that FVIIa induces phosphorylation of c-Akt/PKB, p70/p85S6K, as well as p90RSK in HaCaT cells and BHK cells transfected with full-length or cytoplasmic domain-deleted TF but not in untransfected BHK cells. Furthermore, eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4E was similarly activated in the same cells. We show that activation of the translational machinery was specific for FVIIa and that this effect could not be inhibited by the specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin or the specific FXa inhibitor tick anti-coagulant protein (TAP). From these data we conclude that binding of FVIIa to cellular TF results in protein synthesis, independent of the TF cytoplasmic domain. Wild type baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, BHK cells stably transfected with a construct, expressing full-length TF (BHKTF), or a cytoplasmic domain-truncated mutant (BHKTFΔcyto) (TF-(1–247)) were cultured, as described before (15Poulsen L.K.

HaCaT human keratinocytes were cultured likewise. Prior to experiments, BHK cells were serum-starved in DMEM for 16–18 h, whereas HaCaT cells were starved for 24 h. Half an hour before stimulation, hirudin (25 units/ml), TAP (200 nm), LY294002 (10 μm), or PD98059 (20 μm) were added. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (20 ng/ml) was added for 15 min. Antibodies directed against phospho-PKBSer473, phospho-p70S6K-Thr389, phospho-GSK3α/βSer21, phospho-p90RSK-Ser381, phospho-eIF-4ESer209 as well as peroxidase-conjugated Goat-anti-Rabbit antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). All non-phosphospecific antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) except for the antibody raised against eEF1α (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, MA). The eEF2 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Angus Nairn (Rockefeller University, New York). [35S]Methionine (Promix) was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), hirudin, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), and rapamycin were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). LY294002 as well as PD98059 were from Alexis. Recombinant human FVIIa (NovoSeven) and active site-inhibited FVIIa (FVIIai or FFR-FVIIa) were from Novo Nordisk A/S (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Insulin was from Eli Lilly (Nieuwegein, The Netherlands). TAP was a generous gift from Dr. George Vlasuk (Corvas International, Inc., San Diego, CA). BHKTF cells were seeded in 24-well plates and serum-starved for 16 h in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with mock, FVIIa, or 10% FCS in DMEM. Cell proliferation was determined, using an MTT assay as described by Rubinstein et al. (25Rubinstein L.V. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Simon R.M. Tosini S. Skehan P. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Briefly, after mock stimulation or incubation with FVIIa or FCS, 0.5 mg/ml MTT was directly added to the media for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the media were aspirated and the cells were lysed in isopropanol/0.04n HCl. The A550 of this solution was determined, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Cells at 80% confluence were serum-starved in DMEM for 16 h before incubation with the indicated compounds. After incubation, cells grown in 20-cm2 dishes were kept on ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After that, the cells were rapidly harvested by adding 100 μl of heated (95 °C) sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8; 4% SDS; 2% β-mercaptoethanol; 20% glycerol; 1 mg of bromphenol blue), and lysates were collected by scraping. After a 5-min incubation at 95 °C, 30 μl of the lysates was loaded onto SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (wash buffer) and 2% low fat milk powder and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer containing 2.5% BSA. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in wash buffer, containing 2% low fat milk powder. The bands were visualized, using Lumilight plus ECL substrate from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and a chemiluminescence detector with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Genegnome) from Syngene. Antibody bands were quantified using Genetools from Syngene. The cells were grown in six-well plates until 75% confluence and serum-starved for 16 h. The next day, 20 μCi/well of [35S]methionine was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 h. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm FVIIa for the times indicated, in the presence or absence of inhibitors, or 170 nm (1 μg/ml) insulin. Control cells were left unstimulated. After incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in a 1% SDS solution in H2O. Trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 15%, and proteins were precipitated for 30 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 ×g, and the pellets were washed with 15% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of 0.1 nNaOH, 3.6 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, Packard) was added, and the number of disintegrations per minute (dpm) was determined using a scintillation counter (Packard). For immunoprecipitation, cells were grown and labeled as described above. After stimulation, cells were lysed in 600 μl of non-denaturing lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and scraped. The insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was precleared with either protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose, respectively. Subsequently, monoclonal anti-eEF1α or polyclonal anti-eEF2 was added overnight or for 2 h, respectively, and the immune complexes were precipitated with either protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose for 1.5 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 400 μl of 0.1 n NaOH. Again, 3.6 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and the number of disintegrations per minute (dpm) was determined. TF plays a pivotal role in vascular development and neoangiogenesis (e.g. Refs.3Camerer E. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar and 4Carmeliet P. Mackman N. Moons L. Luther T. Gressens P. Van Vlaenderen I. Demunck H. Kasper M. Breier G. Evrard P. Muller M. Risau W. Edgington T. Collen D. Nature. 1996; 383: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), but the role of TF in such phenomena remains unclear. Therefore we investigated the capability of FVIIa of inducing proliferation in baby hamster kidney cells stably transfected with TF (BHKTF (15Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sørensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). Cells were serum-starved in DMEM, and after 16 h, proliferation was assessed, using an MTT assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After mock stimulation, 100 nm FVIIa, or 10% FCS for 24 h, proliferation was assessed again. Fig. 1 shows that, in contrast to stimulation with FCS, exposure to FVIIa did not result in any increase in proliferation within 24 h. Thus, cell proliferation appears not to be a plausible cause for the FVIIa/TF-induced effect on neovascularization, and other mechanisms involving protein synthesis without cell division may be involved. Recently we have shown that exposure of A14 fibroblasts to FVIIa leads to activation of the anti-apoptotic kinase PKB (18Versteeg H.H. Hoedemaeker I. Diks S.H. Stam J.C. Spaargaren M. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. van Deventer S.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28750-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To investigate whether stimulation of PKB by FVIIa is restricted to these fibroblasts or may constitute a more general phenomenon in TF-dependent signal transduction, we subjected BHKTF cells to 100 nm FVIIa for various times ranging from 5 to 60 min. Lysates were analyzed for phosphorylation of PKB, S6 kinases, GSK3, and eIF-4E by immunoblotting using phosphospecific antibodies. As can been seen in Fig.2A, BHKTF cells show a transient and concentration-dependent phosphorylation of PKB in response to FVIIa, whereas media control experiments had no effect. Also, wild type BHK cells did not react to FVIIa (Fig. 2B). PKB and its upstream activator PI3K are frequently associated with signaling events leading to protein synthesis; PKB activation leads to phosphorylation of the downstream targets p70/p85S6K via mTOR and GSK3. The S6 kinases mediate activation of the ribosome, whereas phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of GSK3 is a prerequisite for protein synthesis (26Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore we also investigated the effect of FVIIa on these kinases. Fig. 2A shows a transient phosphorylation of both p70/p85S6K and GSK3α/β, after stimulation with FVIIa. In addition, we investigated the FVIIa-induced phosphorylation of p90RSK, which phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 in vitro and, unlike the p70/p85S6K, is activated through the MAPK pathway (27Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activation of both p90RSK was observed in BHKTF cells (Fig. 2A), but untransfected BHK cells did not display p90RSK activation in response to FVIIa (Fig. 2B). Apparently, S6 kinase phosphorylation is a major event in FVIIa/TF-induced signal transduction. Next, we determined the phosphorylation status of the eukaryotic translation factor eIF-4E, which regulates translation initiation of a subset of highly structured growth-regulatory mRNAs. Phosphorylation of both eIF-4E and 4E-BP, the latter leading to its dissociation from eIF-4E, are brought about by the p70/p85S6K pathway, specifically mTOR (28Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed a sustained phosphorylation of eIF-4E in BHKTF in response to FVIIa (Fig. 2C), whereas untransfected BHK cells were not responsive in this respect (Fig. 2D). To compare FVIIa-induced phosphorylation events with a more established activator of these proteins, we also treated BHKTF cells with 170 nm insulin. Fig. 3 shows that the effect of insulin on phosphorylation of PKB, p70/p85S6K, p90RSK, and GSK3 is much less transient, suggesting a more profound or longer effect on protein synthesis. With the above demonstration of sequential activation of PKB, the S6 kinases, GSK3, and eIF-4E in BHK cells type stably transfected with TF, it was of interest also to study the FVIIa-induced activation of these components in a cell type ubiquitously expressing TF. Hence we challenged HaCaT keratinocytes with 100 nmFVIIa for various times and screened phosphorylation states of these proteins as described before. Fig. 4shows that HaCaT cells, exposed to FVIIa, respond with a much less transient phosphorylation of PKB, the S6 kinases, GSK3, and eIF-4E, compared with BHKTF cells. We conclude from this that FVIIa activation of these proteins is not restricted to TF-transfected cells but also occurs in cells that naturally express TF constitutively, at physiological density on the cell membrane. To establish the physiological relevance of FVIIa-induced signaling, we subjected both BHKTF and HaCaT cells to various concentrations of FVIIa. From Fig. 5A it is evident that PKB and both 90RSK and its upstream activator p42/p44 MAPK were clearly phosphorylated at concentrations as low as 17 nm in BHKTF cells. In HaCaT cells concentrations lower than 10 nm, which is the FVII plasma concentration, were sufficient to induce phosphorylation of both p90RSK, being an effector of the MAPK pathway, and GSK3β, activated through the PI3K pathway (Fig. 5B). We conclude that, in cells ubiquitously expressing TF, FVIIa acts on signal transduction at physiological concentrations. Although the relatively short cytoplasmic tail of TF contains two putative phosphorylation sites and has been shown to bind to the protein ABP-280 in yeast two-hybrid studies (29Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), so far no physiological function has been found for this 21-amino acid domain despite its strong sequence conservation in divergent species. Therefore, we decided to explore the requirement of the TF-cytoplasmic domain for the aforementioned signal transducers. Sørensen et al. (16Sørensen B.B. Freskgard P.O. Nielsen L.S. Rao L.V. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed BHK cells expressing a truncated form of TF (BHKTFΔcyto) responded to FVIIa treatment with a prominent phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK similar to that observed when BHK cells were transfected with full-length TF. As can be seen in Fig. 6, this was also true for PKB activation and subsequent signaling. BHKTFΔcytocells were equally responsive to FVIIa as were the BHKTFcells. It thus appears that activation by FVIIa of neither the MAPK pathway nor the PI3K pathway requires the cytoplasmic TF domain. To study the specificity of FVIIa effects on translation-related signal transduction as well as the contribution of the various pathways to the intracellular signaling generally associated with protein translation, we stimulated BHKTF cells with 100 nm FVIIa in the presence of the thrombin inhibitor hirudin (25 units/ml) or the FXa inhibitor TAP (200 nm). As is clear from Fig.7A, neither hirudin nor TAP abrogated FVIIa-induced activation of PKB, p90RSK, p70/p85S6K, and eIF-4E, demonstrating that the FVIIa-induced signals were direct and not dependent on FXa and thrombin generation. To establish the possible relative contribution of the different pathways involved, cells were preincubated with rapamycin, being the inhibitor to the upstream p70/p85S6K activator mTOR, as well as the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Whereas PD98059, but not LY294002, and rapamycin had an effect on p90RSK phosphorylation, all three inhibitors had an effect on p70/p85S6K and eIF-4E phosphorylation in BHKTF cells, suggesting possible roles for both the MAPK pathway and the PI3K pathway in FVIIa-induced protein translation. In this experimental set-up, the use of active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIai) did not result in increased phosphorylation of the signaling components, demonstrating the necessity of FVIIa proteolytic activity. The specificity of FVIIa effects on translation-related signal transduction was also determined in HaCaT cells; thrombin and FXa inhibitors showed no effect on phosphorylation of p90RSK, GSK3β, eIF-4E, p70/p85S6K, and the downstream p70/p85 S6 kinase target S6 (Fig. 7B). PD98059 inhibited the p90RSK pathway, and LY294002 inhibited GSK3β. Importantly, although PD98059 reduces FVIIa-mediated eIF-4E phosphorylation in BHKTF, this MEK inhibitor did not inhibit eIF-4E phosphorylation in HaCaT, excluding a role for the MAPK pathway in eIF-4E phosphorylation in this cell type. Contrastingly, MEK activity appears to be essential for both p70/p85S6K and S6 phosphorylation, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is involved in ribosomal activation. Finally, as was observed in BHKTFcells, FVIIai did not elicit any effects in HaCaT cells. Because exposure of TF-expressing cells showed a dramatic activation of protein synthesis key regulators, we decided to investigate the potential of FVIIa for initiating protein synthesis. Therefore, BHKTF cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and stimulated with either insulin or FVIIa for various times. Strikingly, in this cell type FVIIa was as potent as insulin on the induction of protein synthesis (Fig.8A). However, after 2h FVIIa-induced protein levels decreased again, whereas insulin-induced protein synthesis appeared to be more persistent, correlating with the less transient phosphorylation of key signal transducers by insulin (see above). Subsequently, we investigated the contribution of possible FXa and thrombin generation to the FVIIa-induced protein synthesis. Fig. 8B shows that the use of hirudin or TAP did not result in any decrease of FVIIa-induced protein synthesis, ruling out a possible role for FXa or thrombin. Thus FVIIa/TF interaction has a strong and specific stimulatory effect on protein synthesis. To identify a possible contribution of the intracellular domain of TF in the FVIIa effects on translation, we decided to compare protein synthesis in BHKTF, BHKTFΔcyto, and wild type BHK cells. For this purpose, cells were stimulated for 0, 2, and 4 h, and Fig. 9 shows that, although BHK cells exposed to 100 nm FVIIa did not show any response, BHKTF, stimulated with the same concentration of FVIIa, showed a dramatic induction of protein synthesis after 2 and 4 h. Similarly, FVIIa elicited a very similar induction in BHKTFΔcyto cells, demonstrating that FVIIa TF-mediated translation is independent of the TF cytoplasmic domain. The p70/p85 S6 kinases often induce rapid synthesis of proteins that are direct regulators of protein synthesis, such as the elongation factors eEF1α and eEF2 (reviewed in Ref. 30Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These proteins bind aminoacyl-tRNA and deliver it to the ribosomal aminoacyl site during the elongation phase of protein biosynthesis. Interestingly, these proteins are translated from mRNA containing a 5′-polypyrimidine tract; upon stimulation of the S6 kinase pathway these pre-existing mRNA sequences are preferentially translated within 30 min (31Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 32Levenson R.M. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11904-11911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), almost parallel with S6 kinase activation. Thus, synthesis of these proteins is a good measure for stimulus-induced activation of translation, independent of enhanced mRNA synthesis. Fig. 10Ashows the FVIIa-induced increase in cellular eEF1α contents; eEF1α levels are up-regulated in a similar fashion as those after stimulation with 170 nm insulin. FVIIai, however, does not appear to have an effect on eEF1α. Levels of eEF2 were also up-regulated by FVIIa within 30 min, as was demonstrated after [35S]methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation of eEF2 (Fig. 10B). Both proteins were also up-regulated in HaCaT cells, as determined by labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation of both proteins (Fig. 10, C andD). Finally, in HaCaT eEF1α was not up-regulated by active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIa), whereas in the same experiment, FVIIa and insulin induced significant levels of eEF1α (Fig. 10E). Thus FVIIa regulates protein synthesis, further supporting the concept that enhanced translation is a principal effector of TF signal transduction. A picture has emerged in recent years, which considerably broadens the present understanding of the TF/FVIIa functionality. Apart from initiating the coagulation cascade, TF/FVIIa has been implicated in a number of other biological functions as a consequence of FVIIa's capability of mediating intracellular signaling in TF-expressing cells. It remains, however, elusive exactly how TF/FVIIa signaling links to the presumed effects of TF in (patho)physiology, especially angiogenesis and inflammation. One theory relies on a TF/FVIIa-dependent MAPK activation and subsequent proliferation, necessary for neovascularization. Another option might be that FVIIa/TF signal transduction leads to translation and secretion or membrane expression of factors, such as cytokines or angiogenesis-promoting agents, which in turn mediate the effects of TF/FVIIa on pathophysiology. In general, relevant production of such factors requires substantial stimulation of the translational machinery, and this led us to focus on the effect of TF/FVIIa on sections of the signal transduction pathways implicated in regulation of protein synthesis. The present study revealed a TF/FVIIa-dependent activation of p70/p85S6K and p90RSK, especially the first kinase implicated in enhanced translation. Further evidence for enhanced translation was suggested by the observation of GSK3 phosphorylation leading to deactivation of this translation inhibitor. Thus, binding of FVIIa to TF stimulates multiple pathways leading to enhanced translational activity. In agreement with this concept, exposure of TF-expressing cells to FVIIa led to: 1) a strong phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF-4E; 2) increased protein synthesis within 20 min of 5′-polypyrimidine tract-containing mRNAs; and 3) within 15 min to 4 h an enhanced protein synthesis, as assayed by [35S]methionine incorporation. The effect of FVIIa/TF interaction on translation was comparable to that observed with insulin, and, hence, it seems fair to suggest that enhanced translational activity might be a major effect of FVIIa signaling on cellular physiology. Expression of the extracellular part of TF was mandatory for the effect of FVIIa on translational regulation. However, as indicated by the results with BHK cells transfected with truncated TF, the cytoplasmic domain was not required for translational regulation. Finally, the effects were not sensitive to the specific thrombin and FXa inhibitors hirudin and TAP. Therefore, the cellular effects of FVIIa addition are direct effects of this coagulation factor on TF-expressing target cells, however, they are not transmitted by the TF receptor itself but are probably mediated via a FVIIa-cleavable alternative receptor,e.g. the often-proposed PARs (e.g. Ref. 19Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). So far, the role of the cytoplasmic domain in TF has been a matter of debate. Some investigators have found evidence for functional interactions of the intracellular domain with downstream signaling components, for example in FVIIa-induced production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages (33Cunningham M.A. Romas P. Hutchinson P. Holdsworth S.R. Tipping P.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or suggested an association of the domain with filamin-A (ABP-280) (29Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas others have found no function for this domain in FVIIa signaling (16Sørensen B.B. Freskgard P.O. Nielsen L.S. Rao L.V. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of TF does not result in abnormal embryonic development despite the essential role of TF for normal angiogenesis (34Melis E. Moons L., De Mol M. Herbert J.M. Mackman N. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In our studies, we confirm that the lack of this domain does not abrogate signaling nor protein synthesis. However, it did not escape our attention that cells expressing the cytoplasmic domain-deleted TF showed a prolonged protein synthesis. This might correlate with previous data (17Camerer E. Rottingen J.A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32225-32233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that show increased mRNA synthesis in cells expressing the mutant when compared with cells expressing wild type TF. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is currently not known, but it is tempting to suggest that the cytoplasmic tail might, in some way, inhibit protein synthesis. Further attention should be paid to the activation of the p90RSK pathway, which like p70S6K is often suggested to phosphorylate the ribosomal S6 protein. However, although p90RSK readily phosphorylates S6 upon activationin vitro, in vivo phosphorylation has not been reported (for review, see Ref. 35Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Although this makes the contribution of the MAPK pathway in FVIIa-induced protein translation somewhat unclear, it may very well be that another MAPK-activated protein plays a role in FVIIa-induced translation. Especially, Mnk1, which associates with, and phosphorylates eIF-4E in vivo(36Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 37Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), might be a direct key player in FVIIa-induced protein synthesis via the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, the role of the MAPK pathway in eIF-4E phosphorylation appears to differ between cell lines; although the MEK inhibitor PD98059 reduced eIF-4E phosphorylation to basal levels in BHKTF cells, pretreatment with PD98059 did not have any effect on eIF-4E phosphorylation in FVIIa-stimulated HaCaT cells but prevented both FVIIa-induced p70/p85S6K and S6 phosphorylation. Apparently, activity of the MAPK pathway is essential for p70/p85S6K phosphorylation in this system. It is noteworthy that FVIIa exhibits a large degree of cell-type specificity in its intracellular effects. Evidently TF expression is mandatory for FVIIa-induced signaling, however, there appears still to exist a high degree of variability in the response to VIIa between various TF-expressing cell lines. For instance, whereas FVIIa signal transduction provokes activation of the MAPK family member JNK in keratinocytes, it does not in A14 fibroblasts (18Versteeg H.H. Hoedemaeker I. Diks S.H. Stam J.C. Spaargaren M. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. van Deventer S.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28750-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although A14 fibroblasts, HaCaT keratinocytes, and BHK cells transfected with TF show a large potential in PKB phosphorylation, other cell lines do not respond with PKB activation. Thus, not every TF-expressing cell type responds to FVIIa exposure with a significant phosphorylation of PKB, and it might prove interesting to investigate the effects on FVIIa on the translation machinery in such cell types, because it may contribute to our understanding as to the relative importance of the PKB and MAPK pathway for FVIIa-induced protein synthesis. It is tempting to speculate on the possible function of FVIIa-dependent stimulation of protein production in physiology. Earlier studies have demonstrated a TF/FVIIa-dependent transcription of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, IL-1β, and the IL-6-like cytokine leukemia-inhibiting factor, within 1.5 h (6Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In addition, FVIIa treatment has been shown to induce up-regulation of mRNAs encoding the growth factors heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 5, cysteine-rich 61, and connective tissue growth factor (6Camerer E. Gjernes E. Wiiger M. Pringle S. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6580-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Pendurthi U.R. Allen K.E. Ezban M. Rao L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14632-14641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and these proteins may form intermediates for TF-driven neoangiogenesis. Adequate subsequent production of protein from these mRNAs may well be dependent on the signal transduction phenomena described in the present study. Hence it may prove interesting to investigate the effects of inhibitors of these pathways in experimental in vivo models of pathophysiology known to involve TF/FVIIa interaction. Studies examining this possibility are currently in progress. In conclusion, we have shown here that FVIIa/TF interaction does not lead to cell proliferation, but induces signal transduction, associated with protein synthesis, as well as up-regulation of the translational machinery, suggesting that FVIIa/TF may induce pathophysiological events such as angiogenesis, through production of proteins, relevant for these processes."

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 10 g/liter NaCl containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C untilA 600 reached ∼0.6. The cultures were then induced with 100 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galatopyranoside and incubated with shaking at 225 rpm for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Mid-logarithmic phase cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, to give a final protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. To make crude cell extracts, the cells were broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 18,000 pounds/square inch, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 15 min. Membranes were prepared from the crude cell extracts by centrifugation at 149,000 × g for 60 min. The membrane pellet was suspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of ∼5–10 mg/ml, and the washed membranes were collected by another centrifugation at 149,000 ×g for 60 min. The washed membranes were again suspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of ∼5–10 mg/ml. The soluble fraction from the initial centrifugation of the crude cell extract at 149,000 × g for 60 min was centrifuged a second time to remove residual membranes. Samples of washed membranes and membrane-free cytosol were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal.

Kdo2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA, Kdo-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA, and [4′-32P]-lipid IVA were prepared using theE. coli 4′-kinase and the appropriate Kdo transferase, as described previously (12Basu S.S. York J.D.

Aqueous dispersions of these lipids were stored at −20 °C, and prior to use they were subjected to sonic irradiation in a bath sonicator for 90 s. The reaction was carried out in 10 μl under optimized conditions at 30 °C for 10 min (32Vorachek-Warren M.K. Ramirez S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Various protein fractions were added as indicated. Following the incubation, 4-μl samples were withdrawn and spotted directly onto thin layer chromatography plates that were developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v). Following overnight exposure to imaging screens, the extent of conversion of substrate to product was measured using a Amersham Biosciences model Storm PhosphorImager, equipped with ImageQuant software. The cosmid (pLAFR-1) (21Friedman A.M. Long S.R. Brown S.E. Buikema W.J. Ausubel F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 18: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) library of R. leguminosarum 3841 genomic DNA (∼20–25 kb) (14Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inE. coli 803 host (22Wood W. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. J. Downie of the John Innnes Institute, Norwich, UK. It was not possible to assay colony lysates of the E. coli host directly, because R. leguminosarum promoters are not recognized inE. coli. Accordingly, the entire library was first transferred into S. meliloti 1021 by tri-parental mating (23Glazebrook J. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). E. coli strain 803 harboring the cosmid library served as the cosmid donor, whereas E. coli MT616 (24Finan T.M. Kunkel B. De Vos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (the helper strain) provided the transfer functions. S. meliloti 1021 (the recipient) was grown on TY agar with nalidixic acid (20 μg/ml) and streptomycin (200 μg/ml) selection for 24 h. E. coli strain 803 harboring the cosmid library was grown on LB agar containing tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml) for 12 h, and the E. coli MT616 helper strain was grown on LB agar with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) for 12 h. The bacteria were then scraped off from their respective plates and resuspended in TY medium (0.5 ml per plate) with no antibiotics. The S. meliloti 1021 (the recipient), the E. coli strain 803 harboring the cosmid library (donor), and the E. coli MT616 helper strain were mixed in a test tube in the approximate ratio of 3:1:1, v/v. A portion (0.5 ml per plate) of the mixture was then spread in a circular area (∼5 cm diameter) on TY agar plate without antibiotic selection. Mating was allowed to take place for 24–36 h at 30 °C. The mixture was scraped off the plate surface in TY medium containing 20% glycerol and then stored at −80 °C. The successful transfer of the cosmid library into S. meliloti 1021 was verified by analysis of the cosmids isolated from several randomly chosen transformed recipient colonies grown on a TY agar plate containing nalidixic acid (20 μg/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml). To examine a large number of S. meliloti 1021 cells harboring the individual members of the R. leguminosarumlibrary in the pLAFR-1 cosmid, the glycerol stock of the mating mixture was thawed and appropriately diluted to obtain 50–100 colonies per TY agar plate, supplemented with nalidixic acid (20 μg/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml). The plates were incubated for 72 h at 30 °C to obtain individual colonies. For large scale screening, several thousand such colonies were re-grown one at a time for 24 h with constant shaking at 30 °C in separate wells of 96-well microtiter plates in 150 μl of TY medium, containing nalidixic acid (20 μg/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml). A 50-μl portion of the culture from each well was transferred to another microtiter plate and stored as a 20% glycerol stock at −80 °C. The remaining cells were collected in each of the wells of the original microtiter plate by centrifugation at 3,660 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were decanted, and the cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. In order to generate concentrated lysates, the cells were broken by incubating with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and EDTA (10 mm) for an hour at 4 °C (both added from concentrated stocks). Portions of the lysates (5 μl from each well) from four microtiter plates were combined to give 96 pools of four lysates in a fresh microtiter plate (20 μl per well final volume). The pooled cell lysates were assayed for their ability to acylate Kdo2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA in the following manner. A fresh 96-well microtiter plate was prepared in which each well contained 2 μl of 250 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 1.0 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA and 8 μl of pooled cell lysate, which was added last to give final volume of 10 μl. These plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and a portion of each reaction mixture (5 μl) was then spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–8). A negative control reaction without enzyme (Fig. 3 A, left lane) and positive controls containing either an R. leguminosarum 3841 or an S. meliloti crude extract (prepared by passage of cells through a French pressure cell) as the enzyme source were also spotted on each plate. The R. leguminosarum 3841 lysate provided standards for the various metabolites generated from Kdo2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA in extracts of R. leguminosarum (Fig. 3,lane R.l.). The plates were developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v) and exposed to an imaging screen overnight. An Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager, equipped with ImageQuant software, was used to detect metabolism of the Kdo2-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA substrate to either more hydrophilic or more hydrophobic products. S. meliloti 1021/pSSB-1 was representative of several hybrid cosmids that directed overexpression of the long chain acyltransferase and was used for subcloning and DNA sequencing experiments. Plasmid and cosmid DNA were isolated using the Qiagen Spin Prep kit or a BIGGERprep kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Restriction endonucleases, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit. All other techniques involving manipulation of DNA and cell transformation were done as described previously (25). Plasmids or cosmids were introduced into S. meliloti by tri-parental mating, as outlined above for the library screening (23Glazebrook J. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).E. coli strain 803 (22Wood W. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) or HB101 (Invitrogen) served as plasmid donors, and E. coli MT616 (24Finan T.M. Kunkel B. De Vos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided the transfer function. Different strains of S. meliloti (see below) served as recipients. The cosmid pSSB-1, isolated from the S. meliloti 1021/pSSB-1, was subjected to restriction digestion withEcoRI. This resulted in the release of several fragments (12.0, 6.0, 4.5, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2 kb), including the ∼21-kb linearized cosmid vector (pLAFR-1). Two EcoRI (6.0 and 4.0 kb) fragments and two HindIII (6.6 and 5.8 kb) fragments were selected for subcloning into the multiple cloning sites of the pRK404A shuttle plasmid (26Ditta G. Stanfield S. Corbin D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). These restriction fragments were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and were purified directly from the gel. Each fragment was then ligated into pRK404A (Fig.4). The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli HB101. Plasmid-containing cells were selected by growth at 37 °C on LB agar supplemented with tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml). The plasmids isolated from several tetracycline resistance clones were also analyzed by restriction digestion to verify the presence of the right insert. The four plasmid constructs generated were designated as follows: pSSB-2, having the 5.8-kb HindIII DNA insert; pSSB-3, having the 4.0-kbHindIII DNA insert; pSSB-4, having the 6.0-kbEcoRI DNA insert; and pSSB-5, having the 4.0-kbEcoRI DNA insert. Each of these four plasmids was then transferred from E. coli HB101 into S. meliloti 1021, by tri-parental mating. S. meliloti 1021 recipient cells harboring pSSB-2, pSSB-3, pSSB-4, or pSSB-5 were selected on TY agar plates containing nalidixic acid (20 μg/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml). Lysates prepared from these strains (16 colonies per construct) were screened in vitro for the overexpression of long chain acyltransferase activity. Both strands of the DNA inserts in pSSB-2 and pSSB-4 (isolated on larger scale from their E. coli host strains) were sequenced at the Duke sequencing system facility using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase in conjunction with an ABI 377 Prism DNA Sequencer. Sequencing of the downstream region of orf6 (see below) was carried out using pSSB-1 as the template. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing thelpxXL gene was cloned into pET23b vector behind the T7 promoter (Fig. 4) (54Golenbock D.T. Hampton R.Y. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The forward PCR primer (5′-GCGCGTCATATGAAACTGTTCATCACCCG-3′) was synthesized with a clamp region, an NdeI restriction site, and a match of the coding strand starting at the translation initiation site. The reverse primer (5′-AGATAGAATTCCTAAGGCGCGAGCGTCTGC-3′) was synthesized with a clamp region, an EcoRI restriction site, and a match to the anti-coding strand that included the stop codon. The PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase, as specified by the manufacturer. The plasmid pSSB-4 was used as the template. Amplification was carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 100 ng of template, 20 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μm dNTPs, and 2 units of Pfu polymerase. The reactions were subjected to 25 cycles of denaturation (45 s, 94 °C), annealing (45 s, 55 °C), and extension (2 min, 72 °C) in a DNA thermal cycler.

To address the role of PKCζ in T cell activation, we have generated Jurkat T cell transfectants expressing either the wild type (J-PKCζ) or “kinase-dead” mutant (J-PKCζmut) versions of this protein. Expression of PKCζ but not PKCζmut increased transcriptional activation mediated by the NF-κB or nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). PKCζ cooperates with calcium ionophore and with NFAT1 or NFAT2 proteins to enhance transcriptional activation of a NFAT reporter construct. However, neither NFAT nuclear translocation nor DNA binding were in J-PKCζ cells. Our results show that PKCζ enhanced transcriptional activity mediated by Gal4-NFAT1 fusion proteins containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of human NFAT1. Interestingly, PKCζ synergizes with calcineurin to induce transcriptional activation driven by the NFAT1 transactivation domain. Co-precipitation experiments showed physical interaction between PKCζ and NFAT1 or NFAT2 isoforms. Even more, PKCζ was able to phosphorylate recombinant glutathione S-transferase-NFAT1 (1–385) protein.

The named atypical subclass of the PKC family comprises two members, PKCζ and PKCλ/ι, which are unresponsive to calcium or phorbol esters. Both PKCζ and PKCλ/ι are more than 70% homologous in primary structure and so far have been implicated in similar activities (3Dı́az-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sánchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L.

PKCζ is activated by important lipid co-factors like phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid (4Limatola C. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem.

PKCζ activity can be also regulated by phosphorylation at two distinct residues. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, a critical enzyme in phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling (8Toker A.

One of the mechanisms proposed for PKCζ-mediated regulation of transcriptional activation and cell growth is through the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (16Berra E.

However, the importance of PKCζ in T cell activation-mediated events is unclear. PKCζ is expressed in T lymphocytes that are involved in IL-2-mediated proliferation (29Gomez J. Pitton C. Garcia A.

We have recently described the involvement of PKCζ in the regulation of NF-κB transactivation in T cells (24Martin A.G. San-Antonio B. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but little is known about the effect of this atypical PKC on the function of other transcription factors known to be essential for T cell activation as the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). This transcription factor plays a prominent role in T cell activation by regulating the expression of a large number of inducible genes encoding cytokines and cell surface receptors that are essential for a productive immune response (31Crabtree G.R.

Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). NFAT activation is strongly regulated in T cells by the integration of calcium-and phorbol ester-dependent signals. Thus, a calcium increase activates the phosphatase Cn, which dephosphorylates NFAT, inducing its translocation to the nucleus (31Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 32Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Ann Rev Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). The activity of Cn (and therefore NFAT activation) can be inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) (39O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A.

Phorbol esters indirectly stimulate NFAT activity by promoting the synthesis and activation of Fos and Jun, components of the AP-1 family of transcription factors (41Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr Opin Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), which cooperatively bind with NFAT to composite DNA elements found in the promoter region of many NFAT target genes (42Chen L.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4783-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). At the structural level, NFAT proteins contain highly conserved DNA-binding domains responsible for cooperation with Fos/Jun (32Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G.

Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). NFAT1-dependent transactivation has been shown to be controlled by two different transactivation domains (TAD), at the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein (32Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Ann Rev Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar, 47Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The N-terminal TAD (amino acids 1–100) of NFAT1, the stronger of both domains, is rich in acidic residues and prolines, characteristic of acidic transactivation domains. This region is able to recruit the p300/CBP co-activator and is regulated by the adjacent regulatory domain, a serine- and proline-rich region with sequence motifs conserved within the NFAT family (48Avots A. Buttmann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Smola U. Bannister A.J. Rapp U.R. Kouzarides T. Serfling E.

Med. 1998; 187: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that signals mediated by PMA plus ionomycin induced phosphorylation of the N-terminal TAD of NFAT1, strongly enhancing the transcriptional activity of this factor (50Garcı́a-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Here, we show that PKCζ modulates NFAT-mediated signaling through potentiation of its transactivating function in T cells. Even more, physical interaction between PKCζ and NFAT suggest direct regulation of this factor by PKCζ. We propose that phosphorylation of the N-terminal transactivation domain of NFAT by PKCζ might mediate modulation of gene expression.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that atypical PKCs play an important role in transcription factor regulation such as NF-κB and AP-1 activation (13Dı́az-Meco M.T.

Mol Carcinog. 2000; 27: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that overexpression of PKCζ is sufficient to activate κB-dependent transcription in synergism with tumor necrosis factor-α (24Martin A.G. San-Antonio B. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 66Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, contradictory data about the involvement of PKCζ in NFAT and NF-κB activation have been documented. Whereas some groups have described different roles of PKCζ in NF-κB signaling (6Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dı́az-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other authors discard a role of this kinase in NF-κB and NFAT transactivation (67Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we describe for the first time the regulation of NFAT activity by PKCζ in T lymphocytes through a novel mechanism. The mechanisms described so far by which some kinases and phosphatases regulate NFAT activation imply modulation of nuclear translocation of this factor or its binding to DNA. Thus, it is well established that nuclear import of NFAT factors requires dephosphorylation by the phosphatase Cn (62Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 68Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). On the other hand, increasing evidence supports the contribution of several kinases to nuclear shuttling of this factor, thus promoting opposed effects to those driven by Cn signaling. Thus, casein kinase Iα and JNK have been shown to phosphorylate NFAT4, resulting in inhibition of its nuclear translocation (70Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 71Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). JNK is also able to phosphorylate NAFT1 or NFAT2 isoforms likely favoring nuclear shuttling of these factors (55Martı́nez-Martı́nez S. Gómez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 63Chow C.W. Dong C. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a similar way it has been shown that glycogen synthase kinase-3 enhanced nuclear export of NFAT2, thus inhibiting NFAT activation (72Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In contrast, induction of NFAT signaling by kinases as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 seems to be mediated by enhancing its DNA binding activity (73Park J.H. Levitt L. Blood. 1993; 82: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results show that modulation of NFAT activity by PKCζ does not involve either the shuttling to the nucleus or DNA binding of this factor to its recognition sequences. In contrast, our data show that PKCζ modulates NFAT-mediated transcription by increasing the activity of its N-terminal transactivation domain.NFAT1-dependent transactivation seems to map in two different domains of this protein, located at the N and the C termini (47Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have established that PKCζ strongly potentiates transactivation mediated by amino acids 1–415 of the N terminus of NFAT1. This region contains the N-terminal TAD-A of NFAT1 that has been defined as the stronger transactivation domain (47Luo C. Burgeon E. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 61Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports showing that this region still requires the inputs from Ca2+ and phorbol ester-mediated signaling pathways for optimal function, we have shown that treatment with PMA + Io increase its activity (50Garcı́a-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that PKCζ cooperates with Ca2+-mediated signaling in the induction of NFAT-dependent transactivation. Thus, transfection of a constitutively active Cn mimicking Ca2+ requirement cooperated with PKCζ to further augment transactivation mediated by the N-terminal TAD of NFAT1. Cn is required not only for the nuclear import of NFAT proteins but also to regulate the intrinsic transcriptional activity of the TAD-A of NFAT1 (50Garcı́a-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cooperation between Cn and PKCs has been well established for other PKC isoforms in the regulation of NFAT signaling (25Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Ann Rev Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar, 62Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). The fact that PKCζ cooperates with Ca2+ signaling and did not affect nuclear translocation together with the lack of effect of CsA on the induction of NFAT by PKCζ support the hypothesis that this kinase does not seem to be required for the initiation of NFAT signaling but rather for the potentiation of their transactivation function in conjunction with signals converging on NFAT activation. Moreover, the increase in the transactivating function of NFAT induced by PKCζ seems to be unrelated to that induced by PMA + Io/Cn signaling because PKCζ and PMA + Io/Cn-mediated signals were always additive. Moreover, in Jurkat cells stably expressing the dominant-negative mutant of PKCζ (J-PKCζmut), there was no inhibition of PMA + Io or Cn-induced NFAT activation. More importantly, PKCζ but not PMA + Io was able to activate the GAL4 NFAT1 (1–104) construct. Taken together, it is likely that PKCζ activates NFAT in a Ca2+/Cn-independent pathway.Acidic transactivation domains are usually regulated by phosphorylation (74Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 75Martı́n A.G. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24383-24391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A recent report describes that phosphorylation of a novel site in the TAD-A of NFAT1 upon PMA + Io stimulation is important for transcriptional activity (61Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We report here that PKCζ is able to physically interact with both NFAT1 and NFAT2. This interaction was independent of the kinase activity of PKCζ, because it also took place with a kinase-dead mutant. Interestingly, we have been able to identify PKCζ as a kinase able to phosphorylate the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–385) of NFAT1. Although our experiments suggest that phosphorylation by PKCζ might contribute to the activation of the transactivating activity of NFAT1, with residues 1–104 in the TAD-A responsible for this activation, additional experiments need to be performed to address the importance of NFAT-1 phosphorylation by PKCζ and to determine the exact residues involved. Transactivation activity of transcription factors such as NFAT or NF-κB is modulated by interaction with basal transcription machinery or with coactivators such as CBP/p300 (65Huang C., Li, J. Chen N., Ma, W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. Mol Carcinog. 2000; 27: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 49Garcı́a-Rodrı́guez C. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 48Avots A. Buttmann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Smola U. Bannister A.J. Rapp U.R. Kouzarides T. Serfling E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCζ actions regulating NFAT-dependent transactivation could be achieved by modulation interaction of NFAT and coactivator factors such as CBP/p300. However, preliminary results trying to address this hypothesis have failed to establish any effect of CBP/p300 on PKCζ actions (data not shown).This effect of PKCζ on NFAT signaling is similar to that we have described on c-Rel, a transcription factor of the NF-κB family (24Martin A.G. San-Antonio B. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that PKCζ can play a dual role in the activation of NF-κB through the activation of the IκB kinases (66Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also by regulating the transactivating function of several members of the Rel family of proteins, through the phosphorylation of the DNA-binding subunits (RHD) or the transactivation domains (reviewed in Ref. 76Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, in endothelial cells, phosphorylation of p65 RHD by PKCζ- and Ras-derived signals contributes to p65 transcriptional activity (23Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown in a previous work that PKCζ is a critical downstream signaling molecule in tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent activation of c-Rel transactivating activity, and we have identified the target sites for PKCζ in the TAD of c-Rel (24Martin A.G. San-Antonio B. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).In the past, much work has focused on the identification of pathways regulating dephosphorylation/nuclear translocation and rephosphorylation/nuclear export of NFAT proteins, as well as the identification of kinases and phosphatases involved in these processes. However, there is increasing evidence supporting a role for serine/threonine kinases in the regulation of the intrinsic NFAT transactivation function in T cells. Thus, we have described that Cot/Tpl2 kinase, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, increases transcription mediated by NFAT through enhancement of the transactivation function of the NFAT1 N-terminal TAD (54de Gregorio R. Iniguez M.A. Fresno M. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27003-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of the CaM-dependent kinase IV has been also demonstrated to be required for potentiation of transactivation mediated by this domain (50Garcı́a-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In a very recent report, it has been shown that Pim-1 is able to interact with NFAT and phosphorylate it in several serine residues enhancing NFAT-dependent transactivation in Jurkat cells (77Rainio E.M. Sandholm J. Koskinen P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Together with the results presented here, these data support a role of serine/threonine kinases in the regulation of NFAT-dependent gene expression in T cells through the potentiation of the activity of its transactivation domain. However, future work is needed to address the exact mechanism by which these kinases are achieving these effects on NFAT. The serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC)1 family is constituted by several isoenzymes that have been grouped into three subfamilies according to their activation profile and their regulatory properties (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The named atypical subclass of the PKC family comprises two members, PKCζ and PKCλ/ι, which are unresponsive to calcium or phorbol esters. Both PKCζ and PKCλ/ι are more than 70% homologous in primary structure and so far have been implicated in similar activities (3Dı́az-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sánchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L"

Chimeric constructs between Kv1.5 and the NH<sub>2</sub> termini of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 preserved the inactivation kinetics observed in full-length Kv1.5, again suggesting that the Kv1 T1 domain influences slow inactivation. Furthermore, disruption of intersubunit T1 contacts by mutation of residues Glu<sup>131</sup> and Thr<sup>132</sup>to alanines resulted in channels exhibiting a U-shaped inactivation-voltage relationship. Fusion of the NH<sub>2</sub>terminus of Kv2.1 to the transmembrane segments of Kv1.5 imparted a U-shaped inactivation-voltage relationship to Kv1.5, whereas fusion of the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of Kv1.5 to the transmembrane core of Kv2.1 decelerated Kv2.1 inactivation and abolished the U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation normally observed in Kv2.1. These data suggest that intersubunit T1 domain interactions influence U-type inactivation in Kv1 channels, and suggest a generalized influence of the T1 domain on U-type inactivation between Kv channel subfamilies."

For example, VN is anchored to the extracellular matrix via collagen or proteoglycan binding, and it promotes cell attachment, spreading, and migration through specific interactions of its single Arg-Gly-Asp (R-G-D) sequence with cellular integrins, such as αvβ3 (2Brooks P.C. Clark R.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar, 3Seiffert D. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Upon binding to VN, these integrins activate signaling pathways and regulate cytoskeletal reorganization and kinase activation (6Meredith J.E., Jr. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). VN also binds to urinary-type plasminogen activator receptor on the cell surface, an interaction that also promotes cell adhesion (7Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

In addition to its functions in cell adhesion and migration, VN was shown to act as an inhibitor of the cytolytic reactions of complement by binding to complement factor C5b-7 (1Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Coller B.S. Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1991: 269-305Google Scholar). In this regard, it is now clear that VN is identical to the S protein of complement (11Podack E.R. Muller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9808-9814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jenne D. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Finally, VN interacts with several critical proteins that regulate thrombosis and fibrinolysis. For example, it protects thrombin from rapid, heparin-dependent inactivation by antithrombin III, possibly because it acts as a heparin scavenger (13Podack E.R. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7387-7392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also binds to type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), the primary inhibitor of both tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activators, and stabilizes its biological activity (14Declerck P.J., De Mol M.

Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that VN may be a cofactor for PAI-1 (19van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The interaction between VN and PAI-1 is potentially important because the plasminogen activation system plays a role in physiological processes such as fibrinolysis and cell migration (20Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and in pathological processes such as tumor growth and metastasis (21Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). PAI-1 not only regulates the above biological processes by inhibiting plasminogen activation, but it also can directly affect integrin- and urinary-type plasminogen activator receptor-mediated cell attachment to and migration on VN (9Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 22Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The domain at the very NH2 terminus (residues 1–44) of VN is the Cys-rich somatomedin B (SMB) domain, and this domain has been isolated from human serum as a separate soluble protein (26Fryklund L. Sievertsson H. FEBS Lett. 1978; 87: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Standker L. Enger A. Schulz-Knappe P. Wohn K.D. Germer M. Raida M. Forssmann W.G. Preissner K.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The single R-G-D sequence in VN is located immediately COOH-terminal to the SMB domain (residues 45–47) in the so-called connecting region, a region that also contains a putative collagen-binding site (28Izumi M. Shimo-Oka T. Morishita N., Ii, I. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally, the two most COOH-terminal domains in VN have, respectively, three and four tandem repeat sequences with weak homology to sequences in hemopexin (1Tomasini B.R. Mosher D.F. Coller B.S. Progress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1991: 269-305Google Scholar). The second hemopexin homology domain contains the positively charged heparin-binding segment (residues 348–370) (29Kost C. Stuber W. Ehrlich H.J. Pannekoek H. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12098-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The high affinity PAI-1-binding site in VN has been localized to the SMB domain (30Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 2000; 14: 22-34Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This domain contains eight Cys residues arranged in four disulfide bonds, suggesting that it is folded into a compact structure that is stabilized by the disulfide bonds. Seiffert and Wagner (36Seiffert D. Wagner N.V. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that treatment of the isolated SMB domain with reducing agents abolished PAI-1 binding. Deng et al. (33Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) also reported that conversion of any single Cys residue in the SMB domain into alanine destroyed its PAI-1 binding activity. These observations indicate that correct disulfide linkages in the SMB domain are required for PAI-1 binding. However, the identification and arrangement of the individual disulfide bonds in the SMB domain remain unknown. All eight Cys residues are strictly conserved in the VN molecules isolated from a number of other species, including rabbit (33Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and mouse (37Seiffert D. Keeton M. Eguchi Y. Sawdey M. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9402-9406Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and in other SMB-like proteins, such as plasma cell membrane glycoprotein PC-1 (38Buckley M.F. Loveland K.A. McKinstry W.J. Garson O.M. Goding J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17506-17511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and autotaxin (39Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disulfide-linked structure of these SMB-like proteins also is unknown. Because disulfide bonds contribute to the native structure, biological activity, and stability of folded proteins, the identity of the disulfide bonds in SMB must be determined to begin to understand its tertiary structure.In the present study, we expressed the SMB domain of human VN in transformed Escherichia coli as a fusion protein containing 97 amino acid residues linked to the COOH terminus of thioredoxin (VN1–97). We then isolated the active recombinant SMB (rSMB) domain from the resulting mixture of active and inactive rSMBs by affinity chromatography using a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) and characterized its PAI-1 binding activity. We also mapped the four disulfide bonds in the purified active rSMB domain and evaluated their functional importance. The disulfide linkages present in active rSMB were identified by partial reduction and S-alkylation under acidic conditions, chemical and proteolytic digestions, mass spectrometry, and protein sequencing. These results indicate that the disulfide bonds in active rSMB are arranged consecutively in a linear uncrossed pattern and suggest that the disulfide linkages within the SMB domain of human VN are similarly arranged.DISCUSSIONThe active form of PAI-1 in solution is relatively unstable and rapidly changes into the inactive or latent conformation (50Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational change is characterized by a dramatic structural rearrangement, with the reactive center loop of the inhibitor being inserted into β-sheet A as the central β-strand s4A (51Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This alteration in the structure of active PAI-1 is accompanied by a decrease in the availability of its reactive site for tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activators, resulting in the loss of inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the active conformation of PAI-1 can be stabilized by binding to VN, an interaction that results in a 2–3-fold increase in the half-life of the inhibitor (19van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 263-276Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). VN binding is thought to stabilize PAI-1 by restricting movement of the central β-sheet A of the inhibitor and preventing insertion of the reactive center loop (52Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Cys-rich domain at the very NH2 terminus of VN (i.e. residues 1–44; the SMB domain) contains the high affinity PAI-1-binding site (30Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.B. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 2000; 14: 22-34Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the SMB domain demonstrated that each of the eight Cys residues are critical for PAI-1 binding and are required for VN to stabilize PAI-1 activity (33Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The specific binding of PAI-1 to VN also requires the correct disulfide linkages in SMB (36Seiffert D. Wagner N.V. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), further pointing to the importance of the Cys residues. Despite this, the identity of the disulfide linkages in the SMB domain and the exact location of the essential disulfide bonds for PAI-1 binding remain unknown. In fact, very little is known about the three-dimensional structure of VN because no NMR or x-ray crystallography data are available. These considerations emphasize the importance of identifying the disulfide linkages in the SMB domain to begin to understand its tertiary structure.To determine the disulfide bonds present in the SMB domain of human VN, the correctly folded and biologically active form of rSMB was purified to homogeneity and characterized biochemically. For this purpose, rSMB was expressed in transformed E. coli as a fusion protein with thioredoxin, and the active form was purified from the mixture of active and inactive forms by immunoaffinity chromatography using a column of mAb 153-conjugated gel. This mAb recognizes an immunoepitope within the SMB domain and inhibits the binding of PAI-1 to VN (31Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.B. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this mAb only weakly recognizes VN in Western blots, and treatment of VN with reducing agents destroys the ability of both PAI-1 and mAb 153 to bind to the SMB domain (36Seiffert D. Wagner N.V. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These results indicate that mAb 153 recognizes a conformational epitope that is in close proximity to the PAI-1-binding site and is created by correctly formed disulfide linkages. This epitope is presumably masked or altered in the inactive form of SMB. Taken together, these observations indicate that mAb 153 is a useful tool for distinguishing between the active and inactive forms of SMB. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the PAI-1 binding activity of the purified rSMB was similar to that of urea-activated VN itself (Fig. 4). However, the form of rSMB that did not bind to the mAb 153-conjugated gel lacked PAI-1 binding activity (Fig. 4), even though it had the same molecular mass and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence as the active form (TableI).A variety of approaches were taken to identify the four pairs of disulfide bonds present in the active human SMB domain. We initially attempted to cleave the intact and unreduced SMB domain using trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, pepsin, and thermolysin, but the recombinant peptide was relatively resistant to these proteinases (data not shown). We next employed the partial reduction and S-alkylation method, an approach that has been widely used for determining the disulfide linkages present in small disulfide bond-rich proteins (45Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1749-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 46White C.E. Hunter M.J. Meininger D.P. Garrod S. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This method relies on partial reduction by TCEP at low pH, followed by reversed phase chromatography to separate the partially reduced and S-alkylated products. The purified peptides are then analyzed by protein sequencing to determine the location of theS-alkylated Cys residues. By using this approach, two pairs of disulfide bonds, Cys5–Cys9 and Cys19–Cys21, were identified in the NH2-terminal portion of the rSMB domain (Table III). In subsequent experiments, protease treatment of partially reduced andS-alkylated rVN1–51 identified the two other disulfide linkages as Cys25–Cys31 and Cys32–Cys39 (Table IV). Based on these observations, we propose that the active, recombinant SMB domain of human VN has four simple disulfide linkages arranged consecutively in a linear, uncrossed pattern: Cys5–Cys9, Cys19–Cys21, Cys25–Cys31, and Cys32–Cys39 (Fig.9A).Harrison and Sternberg (53Harrison P.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported previously that small disulfide bond-rich proteins or functional domains (which are defined as having less than 100 amino acid residues and two or more disulfide bonds) have a structural motif termed the disulfide β-cross, a structural feature imposed by four closely clustered Cys residues. This structural motif consists of a β-hairpin loop with two disulfide bonds connecting each strand of the hairpin to two adjacent Cys residues. Importantly, the disulfide linkages are generally overlapping and crossed (53Harrison P.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This structural motif may provide a folding nucleus in small disulfide bond-rich proteins and thus may play a crucial part in determining both the structure and stability of these proteins. The four disulfide linkages of several toxin-agglutinins such as snake toxin (54Rees B. Bilwes A. Samama J.P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 281-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), spider toxin (55Yu H. Rosen M.K. Saccomano N.A. Phillips D. Volkmann R.A. Schreiber S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13123-13129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), scorpion neurotoxin (56Zhao B. Carson M. Ealick S.E. Bugg C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and hevein (57Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A. Arreguin B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1407-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), as well as the disintegrin echistatin (45Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1749-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 9B. This complex crossed pattern of disulfide bonds is strikingly different from the linear uncrossed pattern proposed for the rSMB domain (Fig.9A). However, a similar linear and uncrossed pattern was recently described for the disulfide bond topology of the fifth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of thrombomodulin (46White C.E. Hunter M.J. Meininger D.P. Garrod S. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10177-10182Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 58Hunter M.J. Komives E.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,59Wood M.J. Sampoli Benitez B.A. Komives E.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This domain, which is essential for thrombin binding, has three simple disulfide linkages in an uncrossed pattern (Fig. 9C) and thus differs from the crossed pattern of the other EGF-like domains (47Katsumi A. Tuley E.A. Bodo I. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25585-25594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the thrombin binding affinity of synthetic peptides containing the “uncrossed” fifth EGF-like domain was nearly an order of magnitude higher than that of synthetic peptides containing the “crossed” fifth EGF-like domains (58Hunter M.J. Komives E.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NMR analysis also demonstrated that the fifth uncrossed EGF-like domain was much more mobile than the fourth EGF-like domain and that the residues in the fifth EGF-like domain, including the Cys residues, showed shifts upon thrombin binding (59Wood M.J. Sampoli Benitez B.A. Komives E.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the uncrossed disulfide bonds may contribute to the conformational flexibility of the fifth EGF-like domain and that this may be important for interactions with thrombin.During the course of these studies, we also investigated the relationship between the disulfide linkages of the SMB domain and its PAI-1 binding activity. As mentioned previously, Deng et al.(33Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that replacing any single Cys residue with alanine severely decreased the PAI-1 binding activity of the SMB domain. However, we could not identify the critical disulfide bond pairs for PAI-1 binding because each of these replacements created a free reactive Cys residue that in turn would be expected to disrupt the overall structure of the molecule. Therefore, in the current study, we compared the PAI-1 binding activity of partially reduced andS-alkylated-rVN1–51 with that of intact and unreduced rVN1–51. As shown in Fig. 7, the activity of the rVN1–51 form containing the selectively reduced Cys5–Cys9disulfide linkage was significantly but not completely destroyed. Denget al. (33Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12716-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) also observed that replacement of Cys5 with alanine did not completely destroy PAI-1 binding activity. However, the rVN1–51 form in which both Cys5–Cys9 and Cys19–Cys21 were reduced andS-alkylated, lacked detectable PAI-1 binding activity. Thus, the protein structure created by the Cys5–Cys9and Cys19–Cys21 disulfide linkages in the NH2-terminal portion of the SMB domain is essential for PAI-1 binding. Because the disulfide linkages in the COOH-terminal portion of SMB were more resistant to reduction, we could not prepare rVN1–51 in which these two disulfide linkages were selectively reduced. Thus, their role in PAI-1 binding remains to be determined.Finally, it is important to note that the unusual linear uncrossed pattern of disulfide bonds present in active recombinant SMB may not be present in the SMB domain of urea-activated vitronectin itself. Although this issue cannot be resolved until the structure of native SMB is determined, a number of considerations argue against this possibility. These considerations suggest instead that rSMB and native SMB are substantially similar. For example, both molecules are recognized by mAb 153, a conformationally dependent mAb. The facts that both forms of SMB compete with each other for binding to this mAb (34Okumura Y. Kamikubo Y. Curriden S.A. Wang J. Kiwada T. Futaki S. Kitagawa K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) suggest that the SMB domain is correctly and similarly folded in both SMB forms. This conclusion is supported by the observation that both forms of SMB bind active PAI-1 with similar high affinities (34Okumura Y. Kamikubo Y. Curriden S.A. Wang J. Kiwada T. Futaki S. Kitagawa K.

Because any disruption of disulfide bond pairing in SMB results in a dramatic loss of high affinity PAI-1 binding (33Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Finally, we have identified five additional mAbs that not only bind to recombinant and native SMB but also compete with PAI-1 for binding to these molecules (41Royle G. Deng G. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These mAbs recognize three separate, partially overlapping epitopes within SMB. Thus, recombinant SMB and native SMB are recognized by six conformation-dependent mAbs and by PAI-1 itself, and these molecules bind to different regions of SMB (41Royle G. Deng G. Seiffert D.

It significantly prolonged the survival days of EL-4-transplanted mice. <i>In vitro</i> study revealed that its antiproliferative effect appeared only after 2 days of treatment. At that time, protein synthesis was significantly inhibited rather than DNA and RNA syntheses. Furthermore, DSG induced apoptosis without arresting the cell cycle. p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), a key molecule in protein synthesis, was inhibited by 2 days of treatment of DSG. Akt, an upstream kinase of p70S6K, was also deactivated by 2 days of treatment of DSG. Hsp90 is reported to bind to and stabilize Akt kinase and also to bind to DSG. Yet DSG did not inhibit the binding of Hsp90 to Akt kinase. PI3-kinase, an activator of Akt, was not affected by DSG treatment. However, when we looked into phospholipid synthesis, we found that DSG inhibited phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis strongly rather than phosphatidylinositol even by 1 day of treatment. Moreover, DSG failed to inhibit Akt kinase activation and PC synthesis in DSG-less sensitive human K562 leukemia cells. These results demonstrate that DSG inhibits tumor cell growth through the inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis, which is caused by the down-regulation of Akt kinase and p70S6K. It is also indicated that the down-regulation of Akt kinase by DSG should not depend on PI3-kinase and Hsp90. There might be possible involvement of PC in Akt kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2083608503,"The amino terminus of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) contains three potential membrane-interacting determinants: a phox homology (PX) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and two adjacent cysteines at positions 240 and 241 within the PH domain that are fatty acylated in vivo. To understand how these determinants contribute to membrane localization, we have mutagenized critical residues of the PLD1 PH domain in the wild type or palmitate-free background in the intact protein, in a fragment that deletes the first 210 amino acids including the PX domain, and in the isolated PH domain. Mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and examined for membrane residence, intracellular localization, palmitoylation, and catalytic activity. Our results are as follows. 1) Mutagenesis of critical residues of the PH domain results in redistribution of PLD1 from membranes to cytosol, independently of fatty acylation sites. Importantly, PH domain mutants in the wild type background showed greatly reduced fatty acylation, despite the presence of all relevant cysteines. 2) The isolated PH domain did not co-localize with PLD1 and was not palmitoylated. 3) The PX deletion mutant showed similar distribution and palmitoylation to the intact protein. Interestingly, PH domain mutants in this background showed significant palmitoylation and incomplete cytosolic redistribution. 4) PH domain mutants in the wild type or palmitate-free background maintained catalytic activity.

PLD activity is evident in most cell types, and it is thought to constitute an important component of signal transduction pathways that operate in the control of diverse cellular functions (1Exton J.H.

In most mammalian cell types and tissues, a substantial portion of PLD activity is found associated with the membrane fraction under all conditions (4Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Liscovitsch M. Signal-activated Phospholipases. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 31-63Google Scholar) although neither of the two mammalian PLD isoforms that have been identified, PLD1 and PLD2, contains a membrane-spanning domain (5Colley W.

Whereas PLD2 is mostly associated with the plasma membrane (5Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that PLD1 localizes to the Golgi stacks (9Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We are trying to understand the mechanisms for membrane targeting of PLD1. Part of the requirement for targeting to internal membranes is fulfilled by palmitoylation of two adjacent cysteine residues at positions 240 and 241 near the amino terminus of PLD1 (10Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, unlike other proteins for which absence of palmitoylation results in cytosolic redistribution or miss-targeting to internal membranes (11Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), PLD1 redistributes from internal membranes to the plasma membrane upon removal by mutagenesis of its palmitoylation sites (10Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One way to explain this result is to assume that PLD1 contains multiple membrane-targeting signals; removal of the palmitate sites may expose an additional signal that specifies plasma membrane localization. What is the nature of the second signal? In analogy with other proteins, it could be modification with a second type of fatty acid, for example myristoylation (11Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, neither the primary sequence of PLD1 nor labeling with radioactive myristate and immunoprecipitation provides any evidence for such a modification. Alternatively, the second signal could be an additional membrane-binding determinant. At least two such determinants exist in PLD1, a PH domain and a PX domain (2Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The fatty acylation site on PLD1 is on a flexible loop of a putative PH domain that encompasses amino acids 220–330 of the protein (12Steed P.M. Clark K.L. Boyar W.C. Lasala D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Holbrook P.H. Geetha V. Beaven M.A. Munson P.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that removal of the fatty acid would still maintain the PH domain and that PLD1 would redistribute to the plasma membrane presumably as a reflection of the preference of its PH domain to binding a plasma membrane determinant (which could be a phosphoinositide) (10Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similar dynamics could be envisaged for the PLD1 PX domain, which is located in close proximity to the PH domain at its amino-terminal side (14Ponting C. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In light of recent reports that have described a preference of PX domains for binding phosphoinositides (15Cheever M. Sato T. de Beer T. Kutateladze T. Emr S. Overduin M. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 16Ellson C. Gobert-Gosse S. Anderson K. Davidson K.

Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is possible that upon removal of the palmitates, the PX domain assumes a dominant role and is responsible for the redistribution of the protein. In this work we have examined the relative contribution to cellular localization of PLD1 of its three membrane-targeting determinants, the palmitoylation sites, the PH domain, and the PX domain. We provide evidence by selected mutagenesis that the PLD1 PH domain in the intact protein is important both for membrane targeting and for fatty acylation. In contrast, the isolated PH domain does not recapitulate any of the membrane localization characteristics of PLD1 and cannot therefore be studied in isolation. Finally, the smallest PLD1-derived fragment that recapitulates membrane localization, palmitoylation, and lipid binding of the intact protein is a deletion mutant missing the first 210 amino-terminal amino acids including the PX domain. Our results suggest that, under basal conditions, the PLD1 PH domain and its fatty acylation account to a significant extent for the localization of the protein on membranes. However, it is also clear that those two membrane-targeting signals are not independent but rather constitute a hierarchy, with the PH domain allowing PLD1 to bind to membranes and the subsequent (or concurrent) fatty acylation serving as a means to stabilize this interaction and to provide specificity. To our knowledge this is the first example of a dual membrane-targeting motif involving a PH domain and its fatty acylation state. Antibodies, plasmids, and lipid mixtures for measuring PLD activity in immunoprecipitated samples have been reported previously (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The labeling protocol for [3H]palmitate, [3H]myristate, or35S-labeled TranSlabel (all radiochemicals from AmershamBiosciences) has been described before (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was done in duplicate as described, and in all cases, both independent mutant plasmids were expressed and their proteins assayed in COS-7 cells (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fractionation of transfected COS cells was done using a steel Dounce as described before, and subcellular fractions were stored at −70 °C until use (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy was done as described recently (8Lucocq J. Manifava M. Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fragments that initiate immediately before the PLD1 PH domain were amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotide CGCTCGAGCCTGTCTTTCATCCATGATTTGGGAC was used for 5′ amplification. It introduces a XhoI site for subcloning and initiates PLD1 from the sequence LSFIHD that starts at position 211 of the protein. For the isolated PH domain, the 5′-oligonucleotide was as above, whereas the 3′-nucleotide CAGGGGATCCTCTGGACTCAGCCACCAGTCTG terminates PLD1 with the sequence DWWLSPE at position 386. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum with addition of 10 mmNa-Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.35 mm proline. Primary smooth muscle cells from rabbit penile corpus cavernosum were established as follows: two cavernosal bodies from the penis of a New Zealand White rabbit were dissected in aseptic conditions, cut into pieces of 1 mm, and transferred into smooth muscle medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.2) in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. After 4 days of growth at 37 °C, the visible tissue pieces were detached by vigorous pipetting, while leaving the attached cells undisturbed. Once the cells reached 80% confluency, they were detached with trypsin-EDTA and plated at a confluency of 10% in fresh 10-cm plates. The identity of the smooth muscle cells (>99.95% if the tissue pieces had been removed on day 4) was verified by positive staining with a smooth muscle actin antibody (Sigma). Most cells used in this work were from passages two or three. We found that cells from later passages did not transfect well, although they continued to grow and stain positive for smooth muscle actin. COS-7 cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran as described previously (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CHO and smooth muscle cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the day of transfection, CHO cells were 70–80% confluent, whereas smooth muscle cells were 15% confluent. COS-7 cells were examined 40 h after transfection, whereas CHO and smooth muscle cells were examined 28 h after transfection. Membranes from transfected COS-7 cells containing similar amounts of PLD1 or C240–241S were thawed on ice and diluted 1:4 in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA plus various concentrations of detergent. The samples were kept on ice for 30 min and were subsequently spun in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For detecting Gβ we used a polyclonal antibody, a kind gift from Dr. Suzanne Mumby. The Profilescan server (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html) identified a PH domain in PLD1. This domain was superimposed on the known PH domain alignment PFAM (www.sanger.ac.uk/Pfam/). From this, the loop containing the palmitoylated amino acids was modeled using the program HOMOLOGY from Silicon Graphics. Finally, the putative PLD1 PH domain was modeled on the crystallographic structure of two PH domains from β-spectrin (1BTN) or phospholipase C-δ (1MAI) that included coordinates for bound ligand (in both casesd-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)) as described before (10Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PH domains from β-spectrin and phospholipase C-δ (PLCδ) crystallized in the presence of IP3 reveal two distinct ligand-binding arrangements: in the case of spectrin, IP3 lies on the surface of a positively charged region (20Hyvonen M. Macias M.J. Nilges M. Oschinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas for PLCδ the binding site for IP3 resembles a deep pocket that contains positively charged amino acids (21Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In the linear sequence, the positively charged region of spectrin is spatially distinguishable from that of PLCδ (Fig. 1). By comparing amino acid sequences we attempted to infer the arrangement of the putative lipid-binding pocket for the PLD1 PH domain in relation to that of spectrin or PLCδ. We found that it was impossible to distinguish between the two since PLD1 contains positively charged amino acids that could be involved in lipid binding at both positions (Fig. 1). We therefore mutagenized separately both regions of positively charged amino acids. In addition, we mutagenized the invariant tryptophan residue in the core of the α helical region of the PH domain; for PLD1, which has two adjacent tryptophan residues in that position (Fig.1), this meant a double mutation. All mutations were done in the wild type and in the palmitate-free (C240S/C241S) background and are summarized in Fig. 2. All mutants were expressed transiently in COS cells and examined for altered localization by indirect immunofluorescence. None of the mutants showed complete redistribution by immunofluorescence (data not shown), and their localization resembled to a large extent that of the PLD1 species from which they were derived. However, some subtle differences were apparent. Mutants that changed lysines 288 and 289 into alanines (modeled on the PH domain of spectrin) showed totally unaltered localization. Mutants that changed the invariant tryptophan (W318A/W319A) or those that changed lysine 252 and arginine 253 into alanines (modeled on the PH domain of PLCδ) showed partial redistribution into the cytosol. Interestingly, redistribution was stochastic but complete, i.e. a small percentage of cells (∼10%) showed complete redistribution, whereas for the rest distribution was unaltered (data not shown). We reasoned from the above that the PH domain of PLD1 resembles more that of PLCδ, but to disturb it completely more than one mutation was required. We therefore mutagenized simultaneously the invariant tryptophans and the positively charged residues at positions 252 and 253 in the wild type and in the palmitate-free background.Figure 2Mutants discussed in this work. The wild type PLD1 gene codes for a protein of 1074 amino acids. In the linear representation of the protein, regions corresponding to a PKC-interacting domain, the PX and PH domains, four regions of high conservation among PLD family members (I-IV) and the region implicated in PI(4,5)P2-regulated catalysis are boxed (see also Ref. 2Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). All point mutations within the PH domain and the palmitoylated region are listed, and mutants that are abbreviated in the text are indicated. Also shown schematically are the two fragments of PLD1 used in this work (Δ210 and PHPLD1-GFP) for which we also created the corresponding point mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the resultant mutant proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells, they showed a dramatic redistribution into a cytosolic-like staining pattern that was evident in all transfected cells (Fig.3, first two rows). Surprisingly, this redistribution was evident for the mutant derived from the wild type (Fig. 3, PH) as well as for that derived from the palmitate-free protein (Fig. 3,Palm-PH), i.e. it was independent of palmitoylation sites. We determined the localization of PLD1 and its relevant mutants in two additional cell lines to ensure that such altered localizations were not restricted to a specific cell type. In one set of experiments, the wild type PLD1, the palmitate-free C240S/C241S mutant, and both PH domain mutants were expressed in primary smooth muscle cells of low passage established in this laboratory. PLD1 in those cells was localized in a perinuclear punctate pattern, the palmitate-free mutant was largely detected on plasma membrane, and both PH domain mutants were cytosolic (Fig. 3,third row). Very similar distributions of the four proteins were seen in CHO cells, a well characterized immortal cell line (data not shown). We concluded from the above that the altered distributions of the mutants discussed here depend on cellular mechanisms that are common to many cell types. The distribution of the PH domain mutants in comparison to the parental proteins was also determined biochemically. As we have reported before, wild type PLD1 and the palmitate-free mutant are largely membrane-bound after subcellular fractionation (Fig. 4) (10Sugars J.M. Cellek S. Manifava M. Coadwell J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30023-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found here that both PH domain mutants showed a significant and reproducible redistribution into the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4, note percentages at the bottom of the gel). In addition, the electrophoretic mobility of the PH domain mutants was clearly different from that of the parental proteins in that the upper form normally seen with the wild type PLD1 was absent in the PH domain mutants (note PNS lanes in all four samples and also see Fig. 6). Zhang et al. have reported a fairly good correlation between membrane residence and the appearance of the upper band of PLD1 (22Zhang Y. Altshuller Y. Hammond S. Hayes F. Morris A. Frohman M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6339-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we think it likely that its absence from the PH domain mutants reflects their cytosolic redistribution.Figure 6In vitro activity of PLD1, Palm , and their corresponding PH domain mutants. Following transfection into COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitation, the PLD1-related protein content for all samples was estimated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. From this estimate, equal amounts of each protein were analyzed in parallel by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (A) as well as for activity against exogenous [14C]-labeled phosphatidylcholine with or without Arf (3 μg) as indicated (B). Note that to get equivalent amounts of protein for the PH domain mutants (A,lanes 3 and 4) more immunoprecipitate (reflected in the amount of IgG) had to be used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because redistribution into the cytosol was evident for both PH and Palm-PH mutants, we examined whether palmitoylation was affected once the PH domain was impaired in the wild type background. All three single PH domain mutants in the wild type background (K288A/K289A, K252A/R253A, W318A/W319A, see also Fig. 2) as well as the double PH domain mutants in both backgrounds were analyzed for incorporation of [35-S]methionine or [3H]palmitate after expression in COS-7 cells (Fig.5 A). The clear result was that the PH domain mutant in the wild type background (Fig. 5 A,PH) showed greatly reduced palmitoylation. Equally clear was the level of palmitoylation of the single PH domain mutants; those that by immunofluorescence revealed partial redistribution (K252A/R253A, W318A/W319A) also showed reduced palmitoylation, whereas the mutant that was indistinguishable in distribution from the wild type protein (WT(K/A)2) was comparable in palmitoylation to wild type PLD1. As was expected, the mutant missing the palmitoylation sites (Palm-PH) did not show any palmitoylation. It has been difficult, despite repeated attempts, to unambiguously identify the nature of the lipid label on PLD1 by mass spectrometry. A particular concern is the possibility that a catalytic intermediate with phosphatidic acid may be formed in vivo during catalysis, and this species would incorporate radiolabel not as a result of bona fide palmitoylation but because of the label on the substrate phospholipid. To explore this possibility, COS-7 cells expressing the wild type protein and various mutants were labeled in parallel with equal amounts of [3H]palmitate or [3H]myristate. Under these conditions, cellular phospholipids are labeled to the same extent, and equal amounts of the PLD product are formed (data not shown). Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed either by immunoblotting to ensure comparable expression or by autoradiography (Fig. 5 B). As shown by immunoblotting, expression was very similar (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). Labeling of PLD1 with [3H]palmitate was easily detected, whereas the S911A and the C240S/C241S mutants had undetectable label as we have reported before (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). For samples labeled with [3H]myristate, we detected weak labeling of PLD1 (∼15 times less than that seen with [3H]palmitate) and nearly undetectable labeling of the S911A and C240S/241S mutants (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). We believe that this experiment provides additional support for the idea that the label on PLD1 is due to palmitoylation and not to formation of a PLD-phosphatidic acid covalent intermediate. It was of interest to determine whether the mutants with impaired PH domain described here were catalytically active. In preliminary experiments, the PH domain mutants appeared to have reduced catalytic activityin vitro following expression and immunoprecipitation. However, we noted that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation for these mutants was also reduced by about 2–3-fold in comparison to the parental protein, and it was difficult by varying antibody amounts to produce immunoprecipitates with equivalent amount of protein. A different strategy was to immunoprecipitate with equivalent amounts of antibody, quantify the bound protein by immunoblotting, and use equal amounts for the PLD1 assay. When such corrected immunoprecipitates were used (Fig. 6 A, note increased IgG for PH and Palm-PH), we found that catalytic activity was unchanged for the PH domain mutants in comparison to the wild type protein (Fig. 6 B). We attempted to study the membrane-binding characteristics of the PLD1 PH domain in isolation by expressing in COS-7 cells fusion proteins between the isolated PH domain and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Placing the isolated PH domain at either the amino or carboxyl terminus of GFP resulted in proteins whose distribution was entirely distinct from that of the full-length protein. The PH-GFP protein was detected in a fine punctate distribution that did not co-localize with any endogenous organelle markers (data not shown). Furthermore, introducing mutations that have strong effects on the distribution of the intact protein (for example C240S/C241S or K252A/R253A/W318A/W319A, see Fig. 2) had no effects on the distributions of the GFP fusion constructs (data not shown). Finally, none of the GFP fusion proteins became palmitoylated (data not shown). We concluded from the above that it is not possible to study the PLD1 PH domain in isolation. In work reported previously we noted that it was not possible to detect fatty acylation of various PLD1-derived fragments expressed separately (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of these fragments in isolation showed that none co-localized with the intact protein. 2J. M. Sugars, S. Cellek, M. Manifava, J. Coadwell, and N. T. Ktistakis, unpublished results. Together with the results reported above with the isolated PH domain, it is clear that the various structural elements of PLD1 are difficult to study in isolation, although catalytic activity can be restored if N- and C-terminal fragments are co-expressed (23Xie Z. Ho W. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34769-34782Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because a functional PH domain seems to be critical for membrane localization, we investigated whether it also represented the minimal targeting determinant that could direct the rest of the protein to the proper subcellular compartment(s). We therefore constructed a mutant PLD1 that is missing the first 210 amino acids (including the PX domain), thus initiating immediately before the PH domain (Δ210, see Fig. 2), and studied its subcellular distribution. PLD1 owes its punctate distribution to its presence in both the intermediate endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi compartment and in early endosomes as revealed by counterstaining cells that express PLD1 with antibodies to the endogenous KDEL receptor (KDELR) and the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1, respectively (Ref. 8Lucocq J. Manifava M. Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Side by side comparisons of the wild type PLD1 and the Δ210 deletion mutant, showed similar accumulation of the two proteins in EEA1- and KDELR-positive compartments (Fig.7). We noted that in some cells the Δ210 mutant showed reduced punctate distribution, but it was not possible to quantitate this difference. In parallel experiments, we examined the fatty acylation of the Δ210 protein and various mutants that, in addition to the deletion, also contain amino acid substitutions in the PH domain or of the fatty acylation sites (see Fig. 2 for details). Labeling with [35S]methionine or [3H]palmitate revealed that the Δ210-derived mutants recapitulate the palmitate incorporation of their full-length counterparts (Fig.8 A). For example, the Δ210 protein contains similar amounts of palmitate label as the full-length protein (Fig. 8 A, compare lanes 1 and2), whereas Δ210 mutants with impaired palmitate sites show no palmitoylation (Fig. 8 A, lanes 3 and5). In addition, a mutant that changes serine 911 to alanine, which has been shown by us not to be labeled with palmitate (Fig. 5, lane 2) (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), is similarly palmitate-free in the Δ210 background (Fig. 8 A, lane 6). We noted however a single exception in the palmitate labeling of the Δ210-derived mutants: the PH domain mutant in the Δ210 background had considerably higher palmitate label than its wild type-derived counterpart (compare lanes 1 and 4 in Fig.8 A with lanes 1 and 6 in Fig. 5). In addition, side by side comparisons of the distribution of the four proteins after transfection into COS-7 cells showed that, whereas the PH mutant in the wild type background was devoid of any punctate staining, the same mutant in the Δ210 background showed some residual immunoreactivity in punctate structures (Fig. 8 B). Thus, although the Δ210 mutant can be considered the smallest PLD1 fragment that faithfully recapitulates membrane localization and fatty acylation, the missing sequence, including the PX domain, may have a role to play in modulating the function of the PH domain in the intact protein. PLD1 is a peripheral membrane protein that exhibits tight association with membranes without containing a membrane-spanning domain (24Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Lavie Y. Tang X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this work we have analyzed the mechanisms that allow such tight association by concentrating on three potential membrane-interacting determinants contained within the first 300 N-terminal amino acids of PLD1: a dual palmitoylation site, a PH domain, and a PX domain (Fig. 2). A mutagenesis strategy identified limited amino acid changes within the PH domain that resulted in redistribution of the protein from the membranes into the cytosol. However, we were unable to determine the relative contribution of the palmitoylation sites on membrane binding independently of the PH domain since we found that palmitoylation was significantly suppressed in the mutants with an impaired PH domain. Based on this we propose that the PLD1 PH domain and its palmitoylation constitute a hierarchy of membrane-targeting signals. The simplest view is that a functional PH domain is required for initial membrane targeting. Subsequent (or at least concurrent) palmitoylation stabilizes the PLD1-membrane interaction, and it also ensures that the protein is bound to the appropriate membrane. Once PLD1 is palmitoylated, this modification probably becomes the dominant contributor to membrane binding, overriding any other targeting determinants. The contribution of the PX domain to this mechanism must be minimal based on our observation that the Δ210 deletion mutant, which is missing the entire PX domain, exhibits normal levels of palmitoylation and normal subcellular localization on membranes of endocytic and secretory origin (Figs. 7and 8). Two recent reports have described results that are relevant to this work. Hodgkin et al. have proposed that the isolated PLD1 PH domain binds PI(4,5)P2 and, in the intact protein, is required for catalytic activity and membrane localization (25Hodgkin M. Masson M. Powner D. Saqib K. Ponting C. Wakelam M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 43-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our experiments with the isolated PH domain suggested that it does not recapitulate any of the properties of the intact protein in terms of localization or fatty acylation, and we did not examine its lipid-binding properties further. We were also unable to show any effects of PH domain mutations on catalytic activity, even for mutants that, in agreement to those described by Hodgkin et al., were redistributed to the cytosol and must therefore contain significant disruptions of the PH domain. Although phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, is absolutely required for PLD1 activity (26Brown A.H. Gutowski S. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 27Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a phosphoinositide-interacting site required for catalysis was recently identified in a region encompassing amino acids 668–712 of the protein, far removed from the PH domain (28Sciorra V. Rudge S. Prestwich G. Frohman M. Engebrecht J. Morris A. EMBO J. 1999; 20: 5911-5921Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We consider it likely that the PLD1 PH domain discussed here is not responsible for PI(4,5)P2-dependent stimulation of hydrolysis, in agreement with previous deletion analyses that did not assign catalytic significance to this region of PLD1 (29Sung T.C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Sung T.C. Altshuller Y.M. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 494-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Hoer A. Cetindag C. Oberdisse E. Bioch. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of PLD1 has also been investigated by Xie et al. who reported that its absence weakens the PLD1-membrane interaction (32Xie Z. Ho W. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In agreement with Xie et al., we have also found that palmitate-free PLD1 is extracted from membranes with detergents much more readily than the wild type protein (data not shown). Xie et al. have also reported that palmitoylation requires the association of N- and C-terminal sequences of PLD1in trans when the two halves of the protein are co-expressed from different plasmids. As speculated by Xie et al., this result could also explain the puzzling but consistent observation that the S911A mutant of PLD1 is not palmitoylated (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) since they find that the S911A mutation disrupts interdomain association (32Xie Z. Ho W. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this view, N- and C-terminal domain association in the intact protein may be sufficiently disrupted by the S911A mutation to lead to defects in palmitoylation. Our results differ from those of Xie et al.in that we were able to show that the Δ210 deletion mutant maintains normal palmitoylation levels (Fig. 8 A), whereas a Δ168 deletion mutant in rat PLD1 was reported to be devoid of palmitate labeling (32Xie Z. Ho W. Exton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This is a noteworthy difference since in our view the Δ210 deletion mutant contains the minimum of determinants required for proper localization under basal conditions. We think it unlikely that the difference is due to the fact that we use human PLD1, whereas Xie et al. investigate the rat enzyme. A more likely explanation may lie in the choice of the N-terminal starting sequence for these deletion mutants. We chose to end the deletion immediately upstream of the PH domain, whereas Xie et al. constructed their deletion within the PLD1 PX domain. Given the requirements for interdomain association, we consider it likely that the Δ168 mutant may disrupt not only the PX domain but also the folding of the entire protein such that palmitoylation is lost. It is interesting that the PH mutant in the Δ210 background contains significantly more palmitate label than the equivalent mutant in the intact protein, and it also exhibits some residual punctate distribution (Fig. 8). This result strengthens the correlation between palmitate labeling and localization on internal membranes for PLD1, but we do not understand its cause. It is possible that in the deletion mutant a region outside of the PH domain assumes a more important role in membrane targeting and/or fatty acylation. In general, we suspect on the basis of extensive mutagenesis studies on PLD1 undertaken by many groups that regions outside the PH domain can contribute significantly to membrane targeting, either directly or indirectly by influencing the overall structure of the protein. For example, mutations within the PI(4,5)P2-binding region affect membrane binding (33Vitale N. Caumont A. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V. Morris A. Frohman M. Bader M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and in addition, C′-terminal sequences can contribute to endosomal localization (34Hughes W. Parker P. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although palmitoylation state was not determined for either of the above mutants, it is possible that it was affected and that it in turn affected membrane binding. PH domains were originally implicated in membrane targeting because in some members of families of peripheral membrane proteins they appeared to substitute for fatty acylation sites that were evident in related members of the same family (35Lemmon M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, in some members of related families, PX domains have been found to replace PH domains (36Liu D. Yang X. Songyang Z. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PLD1 is the first, but perhaps not the only, example of a peripheral membrane protein that contains all three membrane-binding determinants. We believe that this complex array of domains reflects the possibility that PLD1 may function in (and must be targeted to) multiple cellular locations, under basal and signal-dependent conditions. We are grateful to Dr. Alex Brown for a gift of Arf protein."

BRFU/TFIIIB50 can be purified from human cells as part of a multisubunit complex, and functional data suggest that as yet unidentified additional TFIIIB50-associated subunits are also required for an in vitro 7SK transcription, reconstituted from partially purified components. However, recombinant BRFU alone is sufficient to support basal U6 transcription using a more defined and hence less complex system (15Chong S.S., Hu, P. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20727-20734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). BRFU/TFIIIB50, together with TBP and hB“/TFIIIB150, may constitute the minimal snRNA gene-specific TFIIIB activity (TFIIIB-α) that is required for transcription of U6 or 7SK genes in vertebrates (12Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human B“ is a large protein (1388 amino acid residues) that is similar to yeast scB” over an ∼300-amino acid residue stretch comprising the SANT domain (43% identity), which is essential for transcription in yeast, and N-terminal as well as C-terminal flanking segments (∼20% identity). The C-terminal domain consists of nine long repeats of a 55-amino acid motif, each of which can be divided into two divergent 26–28-amino acid parts with regularly spaced serine and threonine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites. An antibody raised against recombinant hB“ identifies an ∼160-kDa protein in HeLa cells, and hB”-immunodepleted HeLa nuclear extract is unable to support U6 and VA1 gene transcription, which can be both restored with bacteria-expressed hB“ (12Schramm L.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that exemplifies a class of pol III promoters whose essential elements are all located within the gene coding region. It is generally accepted that binding of TBP to the TATA box nucleates the formation of preinitiation complexes either through stepwise assembly of TFIIB and other basal factors or through recruitment of a holoenzyme (reviewed in Ref. 20Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Here we report on the formation of a minimal TFIIIB-α complex on TATA-containing snRNA promoters where hB“ can join a preassembled BRFU·TBP·DNA sub-complex. We find that the N-terminal region of BRFU, containing a zinc ribbon, inhibits the direct association of BRFU with hB” in solution. This autoinhibition is deactivated by TBP bridging, which promotes cooperative assembly of TFIIIB-α from recombinant TBP, BRFU, and B“ subunits. Such a mechanism may ensure creation of the “proper” architecture of the TFIIIB-α complex. Mutagenic selection, in vitro transcription, and binding assays, in addition to cross-linking experiments using human factors, indicate that binding of TFIIB to mRNA pol II promoters is highly asymmetrical (21Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 22Tsai F.T. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and dependent on a specific 7-bp TFIIB recognition element (BRE) immediately upstream of the TATA box (21Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Our previous study (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggests that the TFIIB-like factor BRFU makes contacts with sequences flanking the TATA box, which may instead be more extensive downstream. In the 7SK gene the sequence just downstream from the TATA box is GC-rich and recognizably resembles a “backward” BRE, suggesting it may play a role in BRFU·TBP·DNA interaction. We have investigated this possibility by studying the efficiency and accuracy of BRFU·TBP·DNA sub-complex formation and their consequences for assembling of the whole TFIIIB-α complex on snRNA promoters, transcribed by pol III, where this sequence has been mutated. The outcome of this analysis provides evidence for requirement of an intact GC-rich structure, designated as a BURE, for BRFU·TBP·DNA assembly at the first level. At the second level, the BURE influences the affinity of already assembled BRFU·TBP·DNA sub-complex for hB“. Transcription studies confirm the importance of the BURE for efficient transcription both in vivo andin vitro and for maintenance of polymerase specificity. Our data indicate that sequences located downstream from the TATA box can influence the assembly of TFIIIB-α in two unique ways to regulate the efficiency and specificity of basal pol III snRNA transcription. The plasmids encoding C-terminal histidine-tagged human BRFU and B“ proteins for bothin vitro transcription-translation and expression inEscherichia coli cells have been described previously (12Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase TBP was derived from in vitro transcription-translation construct pTβTBP (23Comai L. Zomerdijk J.C. Beckmann H. Zhou S. Admon A. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 266: 1966-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) by PCR amplification of the TBP-coding region and placing into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) using BamHI andEcoRI sites. Polyhistidine-tagged hBRFU and hB” were purified by nickel chelate affinity chromatography as described previously (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of isolated B“ with the anti-His6 antibody (Roche Diagnostics) was performed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturers. Purification of GST-BRFU and its deletion derivatives, Δ1–37, Δ72–157, Δ169–266, and Δ72–266, GST-TBP, and GST on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) has been described previously (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 7SKwt and 7SK TATA− transcription constructs are identical to O+P+ (9Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and O+P+T− (5Boyd D.C. Turner P.C. Watkins N.J. Gerster T. Murphy S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) construct, respectively. In the 7SK BURE− construct, the wild-type sequence between −19 and −14 was mutated to TTTTTT. The U2mTATA/7SK transcription construct contains U2 gene sequences −556 to +6 upstream from sequences +1 to +458 of the marked 7SK gene (9Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) between theEcoRI and PstI sites of pGEM4. The U2 sequence between −32 and −27 was mutated to TTTATA, and thus a minimal TATA box was introduced. In U2mTATA/BURE−/7SK the sequence between −23 and −14 was mutated to CTTGTGCGCC. The probes for EMSA studies were made from the above characterized templates as described previously (9Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the U2 TATA probe (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) the sequence between −26 and −18 was mutated to TTTATATAT as described by Lobo and Hernandez (7Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Probes for EMSA were prepared by end labeling double-stranded DNA with the Klenow enzyme and α-32P-labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Two binding and corresponding gel systems were used essentially as described previously (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The BRFU·TBP·DNA and B“·BRFU·TBP·DNA complexes were analyzed using the “TBE gel system.” Binding reactions contained 10 fmol of probe, 0.2 μg of poly(dG-dC), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 60 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of proteins, and mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The mixtures were electrophoresed on a 4% (37.5:1, acrylamide-bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel, with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) at 40 mA. For detection of the TBP·DNA complex, the “TGEM gel system” was employed. The untagged TBP was incubated with various probes for 40 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 0.2 μg of poly(dG-dC), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml. The binding reactions were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TGEM running buffer (50 mm Tris base, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) at 200 V. The [35S]Met-labeled full-length B“, BRFU, and TBP were produced using a TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). GST-BRFU, GST-TBP, and GST proteins bound to glutathione beads were rotated with 35S-labeled proteins in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg of ethidium bromide per ml) at 4 °C for 3 h. Where indicated, binding reactions were supplemented with 10 pmol of each E. coli expressed full-length TBP or core TBP. The beads were washed five times with binding buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and then pelleted, and the supernatant was loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide protein gel. The35S-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography or analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Human embryonic kidney 293 and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of snRNA gene promoter reporter construct and 0.25 μg of VA1 plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Total RNA was isolated using the TRI Reagent® (Sigma) and then analyzed by S1 assay (25Murphy S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sequences of S1 oligonucleotides for VA1, U2mTATA/7SK, and its BURE-deficient derivative were described previously (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nuclear extract was prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Twenty five-μl transcription reactions were carried out as described by Murphyet al. (27Murphy S. Tripodi M. Melli M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9243-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with 1 μg/ml α-amanitin, 250 ng of each 7SK template, and 2 ng of VA1 construct as an internal control. Following 1 h of incubation at 30 °C, the transcripts were analyzed by S1 analysis as described for RNA collected from transfected cells. The S1 oligonucleotide sequence for 7SK and its derivatives has been published previously (25Murphy S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2068-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that the snRNA-specific factor BRFU cooperates with TBP to create a relatively strong complex on TATA box containing pol III snRNA gene promoters. TBP and BRFU together with hB“ constitute the TATA-dependent snRNA-specific TFIIIB transcription activity, designated as TFIIIB-α (13Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether hB” could be selectively recruited to promoters by direct binding to DNA, DNA·TBP, or DNA·TBP·BRFU sub-complexes. Human B“ protein expressed in and purified from E. coli(Fig. 1A) was first assayed for DNA binding alone and in the presence of recombinant TBP (Fig.1B). In this electromobility shift assay, we have used a template derived from the TATA-containing, pol III-transcribed 7SK gene. TBP alone can be detected binding to this template only when a TGEM gel system is used but not in a TBE system (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). B” is unable to form a stable complex with DNA in the TGEM system either alone or in the presence of TBP (data not shown). Incubation of TBP, B“, and DNA did not result in the appearance of any B”-specific complex in the TBE gel system (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). We therefore tested the ability of B“ to interact with a BRFU·TBP·DNA complex. Indeed, in the presence of TBP, BRFU, and template DNA, the addition of B” results in the appearance of a slowly migrating complex on a TBE gel (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 4). To confirm this finding, we also used an another probe, prepared from a pol III-transcribed snRNA gene construct containing U2 promoter sequences with an introduced TATA box. Again, in addition to the DNA·TBP·BRFU complex (Fig. 1B, comparelanes 7 and 6) an additional slow migrating complex appears in the presence of B“ (lane 7). Taken together, these results suggest that we detect formation of a quaternary DNA·TBP·BRFU·B” complex. However, only a small amount of the input B“ appears to become associated with the DNA·TBP·BRFU complex (compare intensities of upper B”·BRFU·TBP·DNA band with the lower BRFU·TBP·DNA band in lanes 5 and 7; see also longer exposure inlanes 5′ and 7′). Thus, the quaternary complex may be relatively unstable to the gel conditions used or B“ may only be loosely associated within the complex. We observed another complex just above the DNA·TBP·BRFU complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7, marked by asterisk). As shown in Fig. 1A, hB” protein preparation contains an ∼67-kDa fragment, which was identified as a C terminus comprising part of B“. This B” fragment can also associate with the BRFU, TBP, and DNA to create a faster migrating complex. Inspection of the autoradiograms reveal 10% association of both B“ protein forms with the BRFU·TBP·DNA complex, from which full-length B” is responsible for 30% binding. We next explored whether a TBP·BRFU·B“ (TFIIIB-α) complex can form in the absence of DNA. Because recruitment of B” to the template is BRFU-dependent and BRFU recruitment to the template is TBP-dependent (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the possibility of direct interactions between B“ and BRFU and/or TBP were tested. For GST pull-down assays, BRFU and TBP were produced in E. coli as GST-tagged proteins and immobilized, together with GST alone, on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig.2B). As no appreciable interaction was observed between in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled B” protein and GST-BRFU (Fig.2A, lane 2), either conformational change of BRFU or an additional interaction with TBP may be necessary for B“ recruitment. Indeed, when the assay was performed in the presence of recombinant TBP, B” was retained on GST-BRFU beads (Fig. 2A,lane 4). Ethidium bromide was added to preclude the possibility that DNA might mediate interactions among these proteins. To understand further the TBP-dependent mechanism through which BRFU recruits B“, the 35S-labeled B” was incubated with the immobilized GST-TBP. As shown in Fig. 2A,lane 7, direct interaction between B“ and GST-TBP was detected. BRFU and TBP have also been shown to associate directlyin vitro (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The interaction between TBP and BRFU was confirmed in a reciprocal experiment in which 35S-BRFU was selectively retained by immobilized GST-TBP (Fig. 2A,lane 10) but not GST alone (Fig. 2A, lane 11). We have shown previously (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that the conserved C-terminal core domain of human TBP is sufficient for both interaction with BRFU and recruitment of BRFU to the TATA box containing snRNA gene templates. Therefore, we were interested to determine whether the C-terminal half of TBP, like full-length TBP (flTBP), is capable of recruiting B“ to the immobilized BRFU. For this purpose, equimolar amounts of flTBP and N-terminal truncated TBPΔ1–154 (cTBP) were included into binding reactions. As shown in Fig. 3,35S-B” is brought to the GST-BRFU beads by cTBP as efficiently as by flTBP (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and2). Together these data suggest that TBP is central for the assembly BRFU with B“, perhaps because TBP bridges, through its core domain, these two proteins by direct interactions. To gain a better understanding of the architecture of the TFIIIB-α complex, we focused our attention on the BRFU domain(s) responsible for TBP binding and B“ recruitment. We used a set of GST-BRFU protein mutants where important TFIIB-like domains (Fig.4A) were deleted (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). First, we compared the TBP binding abilities of equivalent amounts (as determined by quantitation of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel; data not shown) of GST-BRFUs that have been prebound to the beads (Fig. 4B). The outcome of this GST pull-down study confirms that 35S-TBP binds well to full-length BRFU (more than 3-fold of 10% input) (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Furthermore, deletion of repeat 1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4), repeat 2 (lane 5), and whole core (lane 6) resulted in an almost 50% reduction of BRFU·TBP binding, relative to full-length BRFU. Surprisingly, BRFU missing the first 37 amino acid residues interacts poorly with TBP (below 10% input) (Fig.4B, lane 3), suggesting that zinc ribbon plays an important, if not decisive, role in BRFU·TBP interaction in solution. Second, to address which of these BRFU mutants can recruit B“, the same amounts of GST-BRFUs used in the previous assay were incubated with35S-B” in the absence or presence of TBP (Fig.4C). Strikingly, whereas full-length as well as repeat 1, repeat 2, and whole core BRFU deletion mutants are capable of recruiting B“ only when TBP is present (Fig. 4C, comparelanes 2, 6, 8, and10 with lanes 3, 7, 9, and11, respectively), the BRFU mutant lacking the zinc ribbon appears to have B” binding affinity on its own (lane 4). This suggests that BRFU contains a built-in mechanism to down-regulate its direct binding to B“, which is counteracted by TBP bridging. The snRNA promoters transcribed by RNA pol III (U6 and 7SK) contain the sequence TTTATATA located around −25 (27Murphy S. Tripodi M. Melli M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9243-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Kunkel G.R. Maser R.L. Calvet J.P. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8575-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas the TATA box in mRNA promoters is often TATAAA. Thus, the pol III snRNA-type TATA box appears to be inverted with respect to mRNA promoters. A specific 7-bp TFIIB recognition element (BRE) is located immediately upstream of “mRNA” TATA boxes in some cases and consists of a stretch of mostly G and C nucleotides (21Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). BRFU shares sequence similarities with TFIIB (12Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and also interacts with TBP (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have noticed that a G/C-rich region that fits closely to the BRE consensus is located downstream from the inverted TATA boxes in the 7SK gene and fortuitously in the U2 TATA constructs (7Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) 2P. Čabart and S. Murphy, unpublished results. that are transcribed efficiently by pol III. Thus, this sequence may play a role in either BRFU recruitment and/or assembly of whole snRNA-specific TFIIIB and, consequently, modulation of pol III transcription. As a potential BRFU-binding site, we have tentatively named this region theBRFURecognitionElement (BURE). To investigate the role of this sequence, EMSA probes were constructed from two transcription templates. As depicted in Fig.5A, the minimal TATA element, TTTATA, was inserted into the U2/7SK hybrid construct (14Čabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig.5A, “wt”), and the 10-bp U2 region downstream of TATA box was mutated from GGCGCGAAGG to CTTGTGCGCC (Fig.5A, BURE −). The “wt” construct contains a region with remarkable similarity to an inverted ideal BRE: (G/C)(G/C)(G/A)CGCC (21Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) just downstream of the TATA box (Fig.5A, inv). The resulting “wild-type” (“wt”) and mutant (BURE−) probes were tested for their potential to recruit two different TBP·BRFU complexes where the BRFU is tagged with either GST or His. As shown in Fig. 5C, fewer BRFU·TBP complexes were detected using the BURE− probe (lanes 4 and 6) than the “wt” probe (lanes 3 and 5). Most important, this effect was not due to a reduction of TBP binding to the BURE− probe as verified in Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2. Interestingly, the BURE− probe is able to retain even more TBP in comparison to “wt” (Fig. 5C, lane 2 versus lane 1). Because no contacts outside the 8-bp TATA element have been observed in either structural or biochemical studies of TBP·DNA interactions (29Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Hoffman A. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), we would not expect the BURE sequence to simply modulate TBP binding. Similarly to sequences flanking the TATA box on mRNA genes (32Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6260-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the BURE may rather influence TBP stability by altering its off rate rather than the on rate. By having defined the BURE as an element required in addition to the TATA box for efficient recruitment of the pol III snRNA-specific TBP·BRFU sub-complex, we were interested to assess the effect of mutation of the BURE on transcription in vivo. The BURE mutant and parental U2mTATA/7SK constructs were transfected into 293 and HeLa cells, and total RNA was analyzed by S1 assay (Fig. 5,A and B).

Because the tRNA aminoacylation reaction is critical for the fidelity of translation of genetic information into the structure of a protein, aaRSs must have gained a high degree of substrate specificity for each heterogeneous substrate during evolution. Recent progress in x-ray crystallographic analysis has revealed that aaRSs can be classified into two groups according to their active site topology. Class I aaRSs possess a catalytic core composed of a Rossmann fold, whereas Class II aaRSs possess a catalytic core consisting of antiparallel β-sheets (1Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M.

AaRSs are considered to have emerged at an early stage in the development of the contemporary system of protein synthesis (3Schimmel P. Giegé R. Moras D. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Together, these results have led to the proposal that the modern aaRS evolved from a primordial ancestor that had either of the two types of the class-defining domains, by getting the idiosyncratic region of each aaRS (3Schimmel P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6321-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have revealed that an aaRS prepares a non-catalytic domain for the interaction with the anticodon stem/loop of the cognate tRNA and that each anticodon-binding domain shows considerable variation in its structure. Thus far, SerRS has been an exceptional case in which the anticodon stem/loop of the tRNA was not recognized by aaRS. In this system, the N-terminal non-catalytic domain interacts with an abnormally long variable arm of tRNASer(16Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the interface between the anticodon-binding domain and the catalytic domain plays an important role in the tRNA-dependent conformational change in the active site, not only in GlnRS, which requires the cognate tRNA for the amino acid activation reaction (17Sherman J.M. Thomann H.-U. Söll D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but also in MetRS, which does not require it (3Schimmel P. Giegé R. Moras D. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8763-8768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Alexader R.W. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16359-16365Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that an accurate anticodon-aaRS interaction was essential for enhancement of the catalytic constant of aminoacylation (10Steer B.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13644-13649Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Jahn M. Rogers M.J. Söll D. Nature. 1991; 352: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Pütz J.

Biol. 1999; 291: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest that in some aaRSs, the signal generated by the appropriate interaction between the anticodon of tRNA and the anticodon-binding domain was transmitted to the active site through either the aaRS or the tRNA molecule (10Steer B.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13644-13649Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Sherman J.M. Thomann H.-U. Söll D. J. Mol.

In contrast to the tRNA-dependent domain-domain interaction, the role of the interaction between the anticodon-binding domain and the catalytic domain has never been reported in the absence of tRNA. Thus far, only for dimeric HisRS (Class IIa), both the catalytic domain and the non-catalytic domain (this domain has not yet been proven to be the anticodon-binding domain) have been purified separately (7Augustine J. Francklyn C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this system, it was shown that in both the tRNA-independent amino acid activation and the aminoacylation reactions, the C-terminal non-catalytic domain contributed significantly to the stabilization of the transition state, but not to the ground state of substrate binding. In this case, however, because the catalytic domain of HisRS was purified as monomer, it was not clear whether the observed destabilization of the transition state upon deletion of the non-catalytic domain was because of the dissociation of the catalytic domain into a monomer or because of the loss of the interaction between the catalytic domain and the non-catalytic domain. In the course of the studies on B.s. LysRS (l-lysine:tRNALys ligase (AMP forming); EC6.1.1.6), a Class II enzyme, from Bacillus stearothermophilus (22Takita T. Ohkubo Y. Shima H. Muto T. Shimizu N.

In this study, we have succeeded in purifying CAT-CD as a dimer. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the interaction between the catalytic domain and the anticodon-binding domain in the tRNA-independent l-lysine activation reaction, and to elucidate the mechanism of the transition state stabilization in the enzymatic reaction. The recombinant form of wild-type B.sLysRS was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by the method reported previously (25Takita T. Shimizu N. Sukata T. Hashimoto S. Akita E. Yokota Y. Esaki N.

BIAcore chemical activation reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Sensor chips (BIAcore CM5 Research grade) and HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 mNaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) were the products of BIAcore.

LysRS were designed to be expressed in the form with an N-terminal T7 Tag sequence as TAB-ND and CAT-CD, respectively (Table I). Two sense N-terminal primers with BamHI restriction sites, 5′-TACCACGGATCCAAAGATATCGAGCAG-3′ (N1-primer) and 5′-AGGTGGATCCGGTATGAGCCATG-3′ (N2-primer), and two antisense C-terminal primers with BamHI restriction sites, 5′CGCAACAGGGGAGGATCCTGGTTA-3′ (C1-primer) and 5′-CGTGGGATCCTTACGGCAGCGGA-3′ (C2-primer), were synthesized.

The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and inserted into the corresponding site of the pET11a expression vector. After transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, the DNA sequences of the TAB-ND and CAT-CD genes were determined with an ABI PRISM 377 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Table IStructural information for B.s.

TAB-ND and CAT-CD were purified in the same manner as the intact enzyme until the ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation), except for omitting the heat treatment at 55 °C (25Takita T. Shimizu N. Sukata T. Hashimoto S. Akita E. Yokota Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Inouye K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The solution was loaded to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The CAT-CD fraction was loaded to a Gigapite column and eluted with a linear gradient of 10–400 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). On the other hand, the TAB-ND fraction was loaded to a Red Toyopearl column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl. Each dialyzed fraction was loaded to a Q-Sepharose HP column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl. After dialysis against 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), each fraction was applied to a TSK gel phenyl-5PW column in the high performance liquid chromatography system, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1.2 to 0 m. The TAB-ND and CAT-CD fractions were further applied to a TSK gel G3000 SWXL column equipped with TSK guard column SWXL. All operations were done at 4 °C except the high performance liquid chromatography operations that were carried out at room temperature. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Shrake A. Rupley J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as the standard. At pH 8.0 and 25 °C, the estimated ε280 values of the TAB-ND monomer (17,965 Da) and CAT-CD dimer (82,571 Da) were 5,200 and 45,000 m−1cm−1, respectively. The concentrations of the TAB-ND monomer and CAT-CD dimer were determined spectrophotometrically using these values. The amino acid sequences of the N termini of TAB-ND and CAT-CD were determined using a gas-phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 477A) with an on-line PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems model 120A). 200 ng of purified TAB-ND and CAT-CD were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% gradient gels at a constant current of 40 mA for 90 min, and visualized by Coomassie staining. The quaternary structures of TAB-ND and CAT-CD were investigated by size exclusion chromatography on a TSK gel G3000 SWXL column with a flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The running buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2. All measurements were done in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2. UV absorption spectra and far-UV CD spectra were measured at 25 °C with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer UV-2200 and a Shimadzu-Aviv circular dichroism spectrophotometer model 202, respectively. Fluorescence spectra were measured at 30 °C with a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer 850. Real-time interaction between TAB-ND and CAT-CD was detected with the guidance of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 25 °C using a BIAcore 2000. Activation of the carboxylmethylated dextran in the sensor chip was carried out by mixing equal volumes of 100 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide in water and 400 mm N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride in water, and injecting the mixture at 20 μl/min for 7 min. 50 μg/ml TAB-ND and 2,000 μg/ml CAT-CD dissolved in 10 mm acetic acid buffer (pH 5.0) were separately injected over the activated surface of the sensor chip for 7 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The unreacted sites of the sensor chip were masked by the injection for 7 min of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride adjusted to pH 8.5 using NaOH. The molecules that non-specifically bound to the sensor chip surface were removed by washing with HBS buffer until the value of RU became nearly constant. The signals obtained were ∼1,000 RU, which were in the permitted range for determining kinetic constants. In the present analysis, no regeneration procedure was applied because of a significant loss in the binding capacity of each domain of B.s. LysRS. Binding experiments were carried out by injecting CAT-CD in HBS buffer at 40 μl/min onto the sensor surface on which TAB-ND was immobilized, and vice versa. k a, k d, and K dwere estimated by assuming a simple bimolecular binding equilibrium (see Supplemental Materials). In the apparent association-reaction, the formation of the complex was represented as follows. R=ka[B]0Rmaxka[B]0+kd·(1−e−(ka[B]0+kd)·t)Equation 1 When R max is defined in RU as the maximum binding capacity of one domain (A) immobilized, which was determined by saturation with the other free domain (B), [AB] corresponds toR , which was the amount of bound domain B shown in RU at time t. The values ofk a[B]0 +k d andk a[B]0 R max were estimated by non-linear fitting of Equation 1. A linear plot ofk a[B]0 +k d versus [B]0yielded a slope of k a and an intercept ofk d. On the other hand, in the apparent dissociation reaction, the disappearance of the complex was represented as follows, lnR0Rn=kd(tn−t0)Equation 2 where R n was R at timet n, and R 0 is R at an arbitrary starting time, t 0. Thek d value was obtained as the linear slope of theln(R 0/R n)versus (t n-t 0) plot. The l-lysine activation reaction was measured by using thel-lysine-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction at pH 8.0, 37 °C, as reported previously (22Takita T. Ohkubo Y. Shima H. Muto T. Shimizu N.

Kinetic parameters were calculated by the nonlinear least-squares method with KaleidaGraph (Synergy software).K m,Lys was estimated over a range ofl-lysine concentrations from 10 to 200 μm, whereas K m,ATP was estimated over a range of ATP concentrations from 20 to 500 μm.K m,PPi was estimated over a range of PPi concentrations from 30 to 500 μm. In all cases, the initial concentration of the other two substrates was 1 mm. 1 mm might not be the saturating concentration for ATP (see Table II), but this concentration was chosen after considering the ratio of ATP to Mg2+. Enzyme concentrations were 5 nm B.s. LysRS, 500 nm CAT-CD, and 75 nm TAB-ND plus 5 nm CAT-CD.Table IIKinetic and static parameters of B.s.

The tRNA aminoacylation reaction was measured at pH 8.0, 37 °C, as reported previously (22Takita T. Ohkubo Y. Shima H. Muto T. Shimizu N. Sukata T. Ito H. Saito Y. Inouye K. Hiromi K. Tonomura B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119 (Correction): 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google ScholarJ. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1218Crossref Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained in 0.5 ml: 100 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, ATP,l-[3H]lysine (40 mCi/mmol), and 20A 260 units of E. coli tRNA.K m,Lys was estimated over a range ofl-lysine concentrations from 5 to 100 μm in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 20 A 260units of tRNA, whereas K m,ATP was estimated over a range of ATP concentrations from 50 to 300 μm in the presence of 1 mml-lysine and 20 A 260 units of tRNA. Enzyme concentrations were 0.5 nm B.s. LysRS, 300 nm CAT-CD, and 150 nm TAB-ND plus 10 nm CAT-CD. The radioactivity in both assays was measured in an Aloka Liquid Scintillation Counter LSC-5100. B.s LysRS consists of 493 amino acid residues and the amino acid sequence has relatively high homology (53%) toE. coli LysRS(U) (504 residues) (25Takita T. Shimizu N. Sukata T. Hashimoto S. Akita E. Yokota Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Inouye K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Therefore, to obtain information on the domain-domain interactions of B.s. LysRS, each contact area between the domains of E. coli LysRS(U) was estimated based on the 2–5 Å resolution structure of the complex with the substrate l-lysine (26Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). A dimer of E. coliLysRS(U) was chosen, and hydrogens were added to the groups ionized at pH 8. After removing the l-lysine substrate and water molecules, the accessible surface area of the free dimer enzyme was estimated with Insight II/Homology (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) by rolling a sphere of 1–4 Å radius corresponding to a water molecule around the enzyme (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same way, the accessible surface areas of NA, NB, CA, CB, (NA·CA), (NB·CB), (NA·CB), (NB·CA), and (NA·CA·NB·CB) were estimated, where the N-terminal domain (Phe14-Pro153) and C-terminal domain (Asp161-Pro502) in subunit A of the E. coli LysRS(U) dimer were denoted as NA and CA, respectively, and in subunit B as NB and CB. Both TAB-ND and CAT-CD were more highly expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells compared with the intact enzyme, and were purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Their migrations on SDS-PAGE were consistent with the molecular mass of TAB-ND, 17,965 Da, and that of CAT-CD, 41,286 Da (TableI). N-terminal amino acid sequences of TAB-ND and CAT-CD were determined as ASMTGGQQMGRGSGMSHEELand ASMTGGQQMGRGSKDIEQRY, respectively, in complete accordance with those expected from their DNA sequences (Table I). The underlined regions show the sequence from Ser1 to Leu5 of TAB-ND and from Lys151 to Tyr157 of CAT-CD. Size exclusion chromatography (Supplemental Materials) indicated that TAB-ND existed as a monomer but CAT-CD was a dimer under the conditions used, because the molecular masses of TAB-ND and CAT-CD were estimated to be 13,500 and 88,300 Da, respectively (Supplemental Materials). UV absorption spectra of TAB-ND, CAT-CD, and the intact B.s.LysRS are shown in the Supplemental Materials. The spectra of TAB-ND have a shoulder at 283 nm in analogy to tyrosine spectra. Estimated ε280 values at pH 8.0, 25 °C, 5,200m−1 cm−1 for the TAB-ND monomer and 45,000 m−1 cm−1 for the CAT-CD dimer were roughly consistent with 4,793 and 50,988m−1 cm−1, respectively, which were calculated by the numbers and ε280 values of the Phe, Tyr, and Trp residues. Fluorescence emission spectra of TAB-ND, CAT-CD, and the intact B.s. LysRS are shown in the Supplemental Materials. The emission spectra of TAB-ND at an excitation wavelength (λex) of 280 nm has a λmax value of 304 nm, corresponding to 306 nm ofN-acetyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester, whereas no appreciable fluorescence was observed at λex = 295 nm. These data were in accordance with the fact that TAB-ND contains Tyr residues but no Trp residues, as deduced from the primary structure ofB.s. LysRS (Table I). On the other hand, the emission spectra of CAT-CD at λex = 295 nm indicates the presence of Trp residues and that the λmax value of 336 nm was very close to the corresponding 335 nm of the intact B.s.LysRS (26Onesti S. Miller A.D. Brick P. Structure. 1995; 3: 163-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2063022584,"Although acetate, the main circulating volatile fatty acid in humans and animals, is metabolized at high rates by the renal tissue, little is known about the precise fate of its carbons and about the regulation of its renal metabolism. Therefore, we studied the metabolism of variously labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]acetate and [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate molecules and its regulation by alanine, which is also readily metabolized by the kidney, in isolated rabbit renal proximal tubules. With acetate as the sole substrate, 72% of the C-1 and 49% of the C-2 of acetate were released as CO<sub>2</sub>; with acetate plus alanine, the corresponding values were decreased to 49 and 25%. The only other important products formed from the acetate carbons were glutamine, and to a smaller extent, glutamate. By combining <sup>13</sup>C NMR and radioactive and enzymatic measurements with a novel model of acetate metabolism, fluxes through the enzymes involved were calculated. Thanks to its anaplerotic effect, alanine caused a stimulation of acetate removal and a large increase in fluxes through pyruvate carboxylase, citrate synthase, and the enzymes involved in glutamate and glutamine synthesis but not in flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. We conclude that the anaplerotic substrate alanine not only accelerates the disposal of acetate but also prevents the wasting of the latter compound as CO<sub>2</sub>."

In his Perspective, [Ballentine][1] argues that noble gases trapped in the silicate mantle may hold the key to resolving this question. Volatile-rich regions still exist in today's mantle, and knowledge of where and how the volatile-rich material in the mantle is preserved will be a crucial constraint in the formulation of future mantle models.

https://openalex.org/W1969333519,"Two hybrid versions ofEscherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase were studied to determine the influence of domain closure on the homotropic and heterotropic properties of the enzyme. Each hybrid holoenzyme had one wild-type and one inactive catalytic subunit. In the first case the inactive catalytic subunit had Arg-54 replaced by alanine. The holoenzyme with this mutation in all six catalytic chains exhibits a 17,000-fold reduction in activity, no loss in substrate affinity, and an R state structurally identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. In the second case, the inactive catalytic subunit had Arg-105 replaced by alanine. The holoenzyme with this mutation in all six catalytic chains exhibits a 1,100-fold reduction in activity, substantial loss in substrate affinity, and loss of the ability to be converted to the R state. Thus, the R54A substitution results in a holoenzyme that can undergo closure of the catalytic chain domains to form the high activity, high affinity active site and to undergo the allosteric transition, whereas the R105A substitution results in a holoenzyme that can neither undergo domain closure nor the allosteric transition. The hybrid holoenzyme with one wild-type and one R54A catalytic subunit exhibited the same maximal velocity per active site as the wild-type holoenzyme, reduced cooperativity, and normal heterotropic interactions. The hybrid with one wild-type and one R105A catalytic subunit exhibited significantly reduced maximal velocity per active site as compared with the wild-type holoenzyme, reduced cooperativity, and substantially reduced heterotropic interactions. Small angle x-ray scattered was used to verify that the R105A-containing hybrid could attain an R state structure. These results indicate the global nature of the conformational changes associated with the allosteric transition in the enzyme. If one catalytic subunit cannot undergo domain closure to create the active sites, then the entire molecule cannot attain the high activity, high activity R state.

N-(phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate the aspartate concentration at half-maximal observed specific activity catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase composed of three catalytic chains regulatory subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase composed of two regulatory chains the mutant catalytic subunit in which 6 aspartate residues have been added to the C terminus of each catalytic chain the reconstituted mutant holoenzyme in which 6 aspartate residues have been added to the C terminus of each catalytic chain mutant hybrid holoenzyme in which one catalytic subunit has Ala substituted in place of Arg-105 in each catalytic chain and the other catalytic subunit has 6 aspartic acid residues added to the C terminus of each catalytic chain mutant hybrid holoenzyme in which one catalytic subunit has Ala substituted in place of Arg-54 in each catalytic chain and the other catalytic subunit has 6 aspartic acid residues added to the C terminus of each catalytic chain The homotropic cooperativity in Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2) is directly related to the ability of the substrates to induce a structural and functional transition of the enzyme from a low activity low affinity T state to a high activity, high affinity R state (1Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Structurally the conversion of the enzyme from the T to the R state involves an elongation of the enzyme by 11 Å along the molecular 3-fold axis along with a twist of the two catalytic subunits of about 5° in opposite directions (2Ke H.-M. Lipscomb W.N. Cho Y. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This structural transition also results in a simultaneous rotation of each regulatory dimer about its own 2-fold axis. In addition to these quaternary structural changes, the T to R transition involves structural alterations on the tertiary level. For example, during the T to R transition each catalytic chain undergoes a domain closure in which the aspartate domain moves 3 Å toward the carbamoyl phosphate domain, resulting in a major reorganization of the interdomain interface. In addition to this tertiary rearrangement of domains, several loop regions in the catalytic chains undergo significant rearrangement. Specifically, the 80s loop in the carbamoyl phosphate domain rearranges from being held out of the active site in the T state to a new conformation that positions the side chains of Ser-80 and Lys-84 in contact with the substrates bound in the active site of an adjacent catalytic chain in the R state. The reorientation of the 240s loop containing residues 230–245 of the aspartate domain is intimately involved in the quaternary change. Residues within this loop region are involved in T state stabilizing interactions connecting the upper and lower catalytic subunits. These intersubunit interactions are absent in the R state, in which residues of this loop now form intrachain interactions with residues in the opposing carbamoyl phosphate domain (1Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Probing of these interactions in earlier studies through site-specific mutagenesis has shown them to be critical in attaining the full R state conformation (3Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In order to determine the influence of domain closure on the heterotropic and homotropic properties of aspartate transcarbamoylase in this work, we constructed two hybrid forms of the enzyme. Each of these hybrids has one wild-type catalytic subunit and one catalytic subunit in which each of the chains has a single amino acid substitution, rendering that subunit inactive. Therefore, by using these hybrid enzymes, we were able to measure the kinetic parameters due to the wild-type catalytic subunit within the context of the holoenzyme. In this fashion we can determine what effect if any the inactive subunit has on the wild-type subunit. The two inactive catalytic subunits used have mutations in the active site, R54A or R105A. As seen in Fig. 1, both Arg-54 and Arg-105 interact with the bisubstrate analog,N-phosphonoacetyl-l-aspartate (PALA),1 bound in the active site of the enzyme (4Jin L. Stec B. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although both the side chains of Arg-54 and Arg-105 interact with the carbamoyl phosphate portion of PALA, the kinetic consequences of these two mutations are quite different. Affinity for both carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate is little influenced by the R54A mutation, whereas the affinity for both substrates is reduced substantially for the R105A mutation (5Stebbins J.W., Xu, W. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2592-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The model of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate in the active site of the PALA-ligated structure (4Jin L. Stec B. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reveals that the interactions for the Arg-105 side chain to the tetrahedral intermediate are similar to those observed to PALA but change dramatically for the Arg-54 side chain. For the Arg-54 side chain, interactions to the tetrahedral intermediate occur only with the anhydride oxygen, not present in PALA. Functionally, the R54A enzyme exhibits a 17,000-fold reduction in maximal velocity as opposed to the R105A enzyme that exhibits only a 1,100-fold reduction in maximal velocity (5Stebbins J.W., Xu, W. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2592-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The model of the tetrahedral intermediate (4Jin L. Stec B. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 37: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggests that the role of Arg-54 is to stabilize the negative charge on the phosphate leaving group and is not involved in substrate binding. Not only are these mutations different functionally but structurally as well. In both cases x-ray structures of the mutant holoenzymes have been determined in the presence of PALA. The structure of the R54A holoenzyme in the presence of PALA is virtually identical to that of the wild-type R state except at the site of the amino acid substitution (6Stebbins J.W. Robertson D.E. Roberts M.F. Stevens R.C. Lipscomb W.N. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results for the R105A holoenzyme in the presence of PALA are much different. Although the enzyme was crystallized with 10 times as much PALA as the wild-type, the structure of the R105A enzyme was in the T state with no PALA bound at the active site (7Macol C.P. Tsuruta H. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus the amino acid substitution prevents the binding of PALA and the conversion of the enzyme into the R state. Hybrids constructed from one wild-type catalytic subunit and one R54A catalytic subunit, (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3, should interact with substrates in a much different fashion than the corresponding hybrid with the R105A catalytic subunit, (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3. In the case of the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid, the mutant catalytic subunit can bind substrates normally and undergo domain closure and the allosteric transition but contribute no significant catalytic activity, whereas in the case of the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid the mutant catalytic subunit cannot bind substrates and cannot undergo domain closure. These hybrids should be able to address directly the question of how independently the catalytic subunits function and whether the ability of one catalytic subunit to undergo domain closure can influence the function of the other catalytic subunit.

Cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.2, followed by sonication to lyse the cells. Two 65% ammonium sulfate fractionation steps were performed. Ion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin was used to purify the enzyme further (12Stebbins J.W. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14860-14864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After concentration, the purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205428) Google Scholar) and nondenaturing PAGE (14Davis B.J.

The aspartate transcarbamoylase regulatory subunit was overexpressed utilizing strain EK1104 containing plasmid pEK168 (10Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Bacteria were cultured at 37 °C with agitation in M9 media (11Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 368-369Google Scholar) containing 0.5% casamino acids, 12 μg/ml uracil, and 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.1m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.2, 0.1 mm zinc chloride followed by sonication to lyse the cells. Two 65% ammonium sulfate fractionation steps were performed. As described previously, ion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin was used to initially purify the regulatory subunit (16Dembowski N.J. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The regulatory chain was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using Source-Q. The Source-Q (1 × 10 cm) column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm zinc acetate. This was followed by a gradient (total volume of 10 column volumes) of 0–50% 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 1.0 mNaCl. After concentration of the appropriate fractions, the purity of the regulatory subunit was checked by SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205428) Google Scholar) and nondenaturing PAGE (14Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar, 15Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of purified R105A-C or R54A-C catalytic subunit and AT-C catalytic subunit were mixed with excess regulatory subunit and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm zinc acetate (17Sakash J.B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mixture was examined by nondenaturing PAGE to confirm the existence of the three holoenzyme species, (R105A-C)2R3, (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3, and (AT-C)2R3 or (R54A-C)2R3, (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3, and (AT-C)2R3. Separation of the species was performed using the UNO Q-1 column. The concentration of the wild-type regulatory subunit was determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients of 0.32 cm2 mg−1 (18Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of the mutant enzymes were determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford dye-binding assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211664) Google Scholar). Nucleotide concentrations were determined at pH 7.0 from absorbance measurements at the λmax using the respective molar extinction coefficients of the nucleotides. The aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was measured at 25 °C by the colorimetric method (20Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Saturation curves were performed in duplicate, and data points shown in the figures are the average values. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. Data analysis of the steady state kinetics was carried out as described previously (21Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fitting of the experimental data to theoretical equations was accomplished by non-linear regression. When substrate inhibition was negligible, data were fit to the Hill equation. If substrate inhibition was significant, data were analyzed using an extension of the Hill equation that included a term for substrate inhibition (22Pastra-Landis S.C. Evans D.R. Lipscomb W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4624-4630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide saturation curves were fit to a hyperbolic binding isotherm by non-linear regression. The small angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed on Beam Line 4–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (3.0 GeV, 50–100 mA). A significantly upgraded version of the small angle scattering instrument was used. The specimen-to-detector distance was 95 cm, and the x-ray wavelength was tuned to 1.381 Å using the Si(111) double-crystal monochromator (23Tsuruta H. Brennan S. Rek Z.U. Irving T.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 672-682Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A linear gas chamber detector filled with a xenon/CO2mixture was used in the experiment. Total counting rate on the detector was between 30,000 and 90,000 counts/s. The scattering curves are expressed as the momentum transfer h (h = 4π(sinθ)/λ), where 2θ and λ are the scattering angle and the wavelength of the x-ray beam, respectively) which was calibrated using the (100) reflection from a cholesterol myristate powder sample held at the specimen position. Sample solutions were maintained at 25 °C. All scattering curves were normalized to incident beam intensity integrated over the exposure time, and the corresponding solvent scattering was subtracted. The enzyme solution was diluted so that all the scattering curves were performed at an identical protein concentration. The hybrid holoenzyme containing one AT-C catalytic subunit and one R54A-C catalytic subunit was generated by mixing R54A-C and AT-C catalytic subunits with excess regulatory subunit. The resulting species were identified by nondenaturing PAGE, and the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3, (R54A-C)2R3, and (AT-C)2R3 holoenzymes were purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the aspartate saturation curves of the reconstituted hybrid holoenzymes, and the kinetic parameters calculated from these curves are given in TableI. The (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3holoenzyme exhibited a sigmoidal saturation curve with a Hill coefficient of 1.5. The lower Hill coefficient is expected due to the reduced number of active sites. The maximal velocity of the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme was 7.1 mmol·h−1·mg−1 and the [Asp]0.5 was 8.7 mm. This maximum velocity corresponds to 2.6 mmol·h−1·mg−1 per active site, the same value observed for the reconstituted (AT-C)2R3 enzyme.Figure 3Aspartate saturation curves of the (R105A-C)( AT-C )R3 (■), (R54A-C)( AT-C )R3(●), and ( AT-C )2R3 (○) holoenzymes.Velocity is reported in millimoles ofN-carbamoyl-l-aspartate formed per h per functional active site (see Table I).

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2592-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) for the mutant holoenzymes are presented for comparison. The influence of the heterotropic effectors ATP and CTP on the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3holoenzyme was determined at one-half the [Asp]0.5. This aspartate concentration was selected because the nucleotides exert a larger influence on the activity of the enzyme as the aspartate concentration is reduced (24Tauc P. Leconte C. Kerbiriou D. Thiry L. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based upon these nucleotide saturation curves, the maximal extent of activation or inhibition at infinite nucleotide concentration was determined. As seen in Fig.4, ATP activates the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme 356%, essentially the same activation as observed for the wild-type enzyme. CTP inhibits the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme to a residual activity of 35%, slightly less than the 20% residual activity observed for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). The hybrid (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 was generated by mixing R105A-C and AT-C catalytic subunits with excess regulatory subunit. The resulting species were identified by nondenaturing PAGE, and the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme was purified by anion-exchange chromatography (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows the aspartate saturation curves of the reconstituted hybrid enzymes, and the kinetic parameters calculated from these curves are given in Table I. The (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme exhibited a sigmoidal saturation curve with a Hill coefficient of 1.7, similar to the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme. The maximal velocity of (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme was 4.0 mmol·h−1·mg−1 with an [Asp]0.5 of 7.9 mm. This maximum velocity corresponds to 1.3 mmol·h−1·mg−1 per active site, only one-half the activity observed for the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 and (AT-C)2R3holoenzymes. However, the [Asp]0.5 was approximately the same for all three species (see Fig. 3). The influence of the heterotropic effectors ATP and CTP on the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3holoenzyme was determined at one-half the [Asp]0.5. Based upon these nucleotide saturation curves, the maximal extent of activation or inhibition at infinite nucleotide concentration was determined. As seen in Fig. 4, ATP activated the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme 164%, less than one-half the activation observed for the wild-type and (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3holoenzymes under the same conditions. CTP inhibited the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme to a residual activity of 85%, significantly less than the residual activity of 20% displayed by the wild-type enzyme and 35% residual activity displayed by the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme (Fig. 4). The influence of ATP was also determined at an aspartate concentration equal to four times [Asp]0.5. This concentration was used to determine whether the lower than expected activity observed for this holoenzyme was due to the inability of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate to bring about the full T to R transition. If the substrates were unable to bring about the full T to R transition, ATP may still be able to activate the enzyme at saturating aspartate concentrations. However, no activation was observed at this higher aspartate concentration (data not shown). Small angle x-ray scattering has been used extensively in studying aspartate transcarbamoylase because this technique allows rapid determination of the quaternary state of the enzyme in solution (25Fetler L. Tauc P. Hervé G. Moody M.F. Vachette P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Hervé G. Moody M.F. Tauc P. Vachette P. Jones P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The scattering pattern of the wild-type enzyme in the absence of PALA is characteristic of the T-structural state, whereas the pattern in the presence of PALA is characteristic of the R-structural state. To determine whether the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3holoenzyme could be converted to the R structural state, small angle x-ray scattering was performed in the absence and presence of PALA (Fig. 5). The change in scattering pattern observed upon addition of PALA to the hybrid enzyme established that it could be converted to the structural R state. The binding of PALA caused an increase in peak intensity and a shift in position of the first subsidiary maximum, two hallmarks of the T to R transition in wild-type aspartate transcarbamoylase (26Hervé G. Moody M.F. Tauc P. Vachette P. Jones P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the work reported here, two hybrid versions of aspartate transcarbamoylase were constructed and characterized to understand more fully how substrate binding and the subsequent tertiary movements in one catalytic subunit affect the other catalytic subunit in the holoenzyme, and how these tertiary movements are related to the global allosteric transition. To create the hybrid species, the wild-type catalytic subunit was engineered to carry six extra aspartic acid residues, which served as a chromatographic handle in the purification. Previous work (10Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has shown that the aspartate tail does not affect the structure or function of the catalytic subunit or the holoenzyme. The binding of aspartate to aspartate transcarbamoylase saturated with carbamoyl phosphate initiates a series of tertiary changes that induce the quaternary transition from the T to the R state (1Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Within the catalytic chain the tertiary structural changes associated with the transition include the closure of the carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate domains along with major reorientations of the 80s and 240s loops (1Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These conformational changes result in the repositioning of certain side chain residues that are critical for catalysis. In this study, we successfully applied the technology previously developed (10Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to create two hybrid enzymes, which allowed us to study how the aforementioned tertiary dynamics in one catalytic subunit affect catalysis and regulation in the other catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme. In each case, one of the two catalytic subunits is wild-type, whereas the other catalytic subunit has a single amino acid substitution that renders it inactive under the assay conditions used. The mutations, R54A and R105A, were selected because of the significantly different properties of the holoenzymes that have these mutations in all six catalytic chains (5Stebbins J.W., Xu, W. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2592-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Through comparing and contrasting of the kinetic properties of these two hybrid enzymes, we obtained a clearer view of how the two catalytic subunits of aspartate transcarbamoylase work in concert in the holoenzyme. Previous hybrid experiments have combined active and inactive subunits with wild-type regulatory subunits; however, these early hybrids were created and analyzed at a time when little structural data on the enzyme were available. As a result, the mutations made to inactivate one catalytic subunit most likely produced structural ramifications beyond the local site of the amino acid substitution or modification making the extension of the conclusions to the wild-type enzyme unclear. In their original hybrid study, Gibbons et al. (27Gibbons I. Yang Y.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4452-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) created the CNCPR3 hybrid enzyme, which consisted of a native catalytic subunit, CN, a pyridoxylated catalytic subunit, CP, and native regulatory subunits, R. The pyridoxylation of the catalytic subunit was the result of a specific reaction involving reduction of a Schiff's base formed between pyridoxyl 5′-phosphate and a lysine side chain on each of the catalytic chains. Although the exact site of this pyridoxylation was not known at the time, kinetic characterization of the holoenzyme in which all six chains were modified in this manner indicated that the reaction effectively inactivated the enzyme. It is now known that the residue pyridoxylated is Lys-84, a residue located on the flexible 80s loop. The role of this loop as well as this specific residue has been extensively characterized (28Macol C. Dutta M. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It has been shown that upon the T to R transition the 80s loop undergoes a dramatic rearrangement from being held out of the active site in the T state to being in the active site with residue 84 binding the substrate in the R state. If Lys-84 was modified by pyridoxylation, the R state conformation of active site would likely be unattainable with the 80s loop in an altered conformation in the CP subunit due to steric hindrance created by the pyridoxyl moiety. In another hybrid experiment, Gibbons et al. (29Gibbons I. Flatgaaard J.E. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4298-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) created the CNCMR3 hybrid enzyme consisting of a native catalytic subunit, a catalytic subunit carrying a mutated residue, CM, and native regulatory subunits, R. In this case, the mutation was the result of a missense mutation. Again it was unknown at the time the exact location of the mutation; however, kinetic characterization verified that the alteration was sufficient to inactivate the CMCMR3 holoenzyme. Subsequent studies on the CMCMR3holoenzyme identified the mutation as a Gly-128 being changed to an aspartic acid (30Wall K.A. Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11917-11926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Marked changes in the reactivity of several amino acid residues of the CMCMR3holoenzyme suggest that the single amino acid change in this location is sufficient to cause significant modification of the tertiary structure of the protein. Experimental data also revealed weakened subunit interactions in the mutant holoenzyme, suggesting an altered quaternary structure (31Wall K.A. Flatgaard J.E. Schachman H.K. Gibbons I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11910-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extraneous structural alterations in these hybrid systems prompted us to create carefully designed hybrids, which cause only the described local changes and thus could more accurately mimic the wild-type protein allowing an accurate assessment of how the two catalytic subunits of the molecule interact. As seen in Table I, both the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 and (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid holoenzymes have [Asp]0.5 values nearly identical to that observed for the wild-type holoenzyme. In the case of the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3enzyme, a higher [Asp]0.5 value would be expected should the R105A-C subunit contribute to the activity because of the extraordinarily high [Asp]0.5 induced by this mutation. Over the range of aspartate concentrations used in these experiments, the mutant catalytic subunit should contribute less than 0.33% of the total activity observed. Another similarity between the two hybrid holoenzymes is the observed decrease in cooperativity relative to the wild-type enzyme. This reduction is to be expected as the number of active sites has effectively been reduced by 50% and is reminiscent of the earlier active/inactive hybrids (27Gibbons I. Yang Y.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4452-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Striking differences between the two hybrid holoenzymes can be seen in the activity measured per active site and the regulation by the nucleotide effectors. The (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 species behaves as would be expected for an enzyme with half the number of active sites. The activity per active site is essentially equal to the activity per active site in the wild-type enzyme. A lack of catalysis in one-half of the enzyme appears to have no deleterious effects on the functional active sites in the other catalytic subunit. Similarly, the nucleotide effectors, ATP and CTP, are able to activate and inhibit, respectively, the (R54A-C)(AT-C)R3 enzyme to nearly wild-type levels. In contrast, the lack of bound substrates in the R105A-C subunit has a significant and negative effect on the functional active sites within the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid. Without the substrates binding to the R105A-C active sites, the resulting lack of domain and loop movements prevents the full catalytic potential of the wild-type active sites in the context of this hybrid holoenzyme. Furthermore, the lack of substrate binding to half of the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 holoenzyme reduces the ability of the regulatory nucleotides to modulate catalytic activity. Could these results be due in part to a failure of the enzyme to undergo the T to R transition? Previously it has been shown that substrate binding at only a fraction of the active sites, in fact less than three of the active sites, is sufficient to allow the full T to R transition (7Macol C.P. Tsuruta H. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering experiments performed on the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid established that PALA can induce the full quaternary conformational change from the T to the R state, similar to that observed for the wild-type enzyme. Thus, a more likely explanation for the negative complementation effects observed for the (R105A-C)(AT-C)R3 hybrid is that the improper formation of the R state active sites in the mutant subunit has a global effect on the ability of the active sites in the wild-type catalytic subunit from attaining their correct R state conformation. The data presented in this study suggest that there are no distinct catalytic units within the holoenzyme. Based upon these data and previous functional (1Kantrowitz E.R. Lipscomb W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 53-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and structural studies (32Lipscomb W.N. Adv. Enzymol. 1994; 68: 67-151PubMed Google Scholar), we can propose a model for how the domain closure and loop motions in the catalytic chains are related to the allosteric transition. The binding of aspartate to the enzyme saturated with carbamoyl phosphate induces the closure of the two domains of that particular active site. This closure of the domains breaks specific interactions between the upper and lower catalytic subunits, such as the interaction between Glu-239 to both Tyr-164 and Lys-165, thereby destabilizing the T state of the enzyme. The closure of the domains of the catalytic chains is directly linked to the quaternary structural reorganization of the enzyme, because it is sterically impossible for the two domains of the catalytic chains to attain their full-closed conformation without the quaternary elongation of the molecule. The final conformation of each active site is then achieved by the reorganization of the loops necessary to create the active site (33Fetler L. Vachette P. Hervé G. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15654-15660Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previous data have suggested that the domain closure caused by the binding of only one PALA molecule to the six active sites of the enzyme is sufficient to induce the global allosteric transition (7Macol C.P. Tsuruta H. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The data presented here also suggest that within the context of the holoenzyme, the domain closure and subsequent loop movements in each active site have a global and cumulative effect on the entire enzyme. The lack of substrate binding and domain closure in one subunit prevents the enzyme from being able to access the same structural R state as the wild-type enzyme. This study reinforces the importance of loop movement and domain closure for proper and efficient catalysis in aspartate transcarbamoylase.
