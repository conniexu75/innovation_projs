https://openalex.org/W2992820108,"Mountains are the water towers of the world, supplying a substantial part of both natural and anthropogenic water demands1,2. They are highly sensitive and prone to climate change3,4, yet their importance and vulnerability have not been quantified at the global scale. Here we present a global water tower index (WTI), which ranks all water towers in terms of their water-supplying role and the downstream dependence of ecosystems and society. For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas. Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world’s most important and vulnerable water towers. The worldwide distribution and water supply of water towers (snowy or glacierized mountain ranges) is indexed, showing that the most important water towers are also the most vulnerable to socio-economic and climate-change stresses, with huge potential negative impacts on populations downstream."

https://openalex.org/W2994464657,"Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification regulating protein function in almost all cellular processes. Although tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites have been identified in human cells, approaches to determine the functional importance of each phosphosite are lacking. Here, we manually curated 112 datasets of phospho-enriched proteins, generated from 104 different human cell types or tissues. We re-analyzed the 6,801 proteomics experiments that passed our quality control criteria, creating a reference phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. To prioritize functional sites, we used machine learning to identify 59 features indicative of proteomic, structural, regulatory or evolutionary relevance and integrate them into a single functional score. Our approach identifies regulatory phosphosites across different molecular mechanisms, processes and diseases, and reveals genetic susceptibilities at a genomic scale. Several regulatory phosphosites were experimentally validated, including identifying a role in neuronal differentiation for phosphosites in SMARCC2, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex."
https://openalex.org/W2992036306,"Versatile and precise genome modifications are needed to create a wider range of adoptive cellular therapies1–5. Here we report two improvements that increase the efficiency of CRISPR–Cas9-based genome editing in clinically relevant primary cell types. Truncated Cas9 target sequences (tCTSs) added at the ends of the homology-directed repair (HDR) template interact with Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to shuttle the template to the nucleus, enhancing HDR efficiency approximately two- to fourfold. Furthermore, stabilizing Cas9 RNPs into nanoparticles with polyglutamic acid further improves editing efficiency by approximately twofold, reduces toxicity, and enables lyophilized storage without loss of activity. Combining the two improvements increases gene targeting efficiency even at reduced HDR template doses, yielding approximately two to six times as many viable edited cells across multiple genomic loci in diverse cell types, such as bulk (CD3+) T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), γδ T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and primary and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived6 hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). Precise genome editing is made more efficient by stabilizing Cas9 and enhancing shuttling to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2993953026,"The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the main enzymatic subunit of the PRC2 complex, which catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) to promote transcriptional silencing. EZH2 is overexpressed in multiple types of cancer including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and high expression levels correlate with poor prognosis. Several EZH2 inhibitors, which inhibit the methyltransferase activity of EZH2, have shown promise in treating sarcoma and follicular lymphoma in clinics. However, EZH2 inhibitors are ineffective at blocking proliferation of TNBC cells, even though they effectively reduce the H3K27me3 mark. Using a hydrophobic tagging approach, we generated MS1943, a first-in-class EZH2 selective degrader that effectively reduces EZH2 levels in cells. Importantly, MS1943 has a profound cytotoxic effect in multiple TNBC cells, while sparing normal cells, and is efficacious in vivo, suggesting that pharmacologic degradation of EZH2 can be advantageous for treating the cancers that are dependent on EZH2. A hydrophobic tagging method is used to develop a selective degrader for the chromatin regulator EZH2, which inhibits proliferation of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2991853974,"The anticancer agent indisulam inhibits cell proliferation by causing degradation of RBM39, an essential mRNA splicing factor. Indisulam promotes an interaction between RBM39 and the DCAF15 E3 ligase substrate receptor, leading to RBM39 ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. To delineate the precise mechanism by which indisulam mediates the DCAF15-RBM39 interaction, we solved the DCAF15-DDB1-DDA1-indisulam-RBM39(RRM2) complex structure to a resolution of 2.3 Å. DCAF15 has a distinct topology that embraces the RBM39(RRM2) domain largely via non-polar interactions, and indisulam binds between DCAF15 and RBM39(RRM2), coordinating additional interactions between the two proteins. Studies with RBM39 point mutants and indisulam analogs validated the structural model and defined the RBM39 α-helical degron motif. The degron is found only in RBM23 and RBM39, and only these proteins were detectably downregulated in indisulam-treated HCT116 cells. This work further explains how indisulam induces RBM39 degradation and defines the challenge of harnessing DCAF15 to degrade additional targets."
https://openalex.org/W2991655268,"All viruses require strategies to inhibit or evade the immune pathways of cells that they infect. The viruses that infect bacteria, bacteriophages (phages), must avoid immune pathways that target nucleic acids, such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems, to replicate efficiently1. Here we show that jumbo phage ΦKZ segregates its DNA from immunity nucleases of its host, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by constructing a proteinaceous nucleus-like compartment. ΦKZ is resistant to many immunity mechanisms that target DNA in vivo, including two subtypes of CRISPR-Cas3, Cas9, Cas12a and the restriction enzymes HsdRMS and EcoRI. Cas proteins and restriction enzymes are unable to access the phage DNA throughout the infection, but engineering the relocalization of EcoRI inside the compartment enables targeting of the phage and protection of host cells. Moreover, ΦKZ is sensitive to Cas13a-a CRISPR-Cas enzyme that targets RNA-probably owing to phage mRNA localizing to the cytoplasm. Collectively, we propose that Pseudomonas jumbo phages evade a broad spectrum of DNA-targeting nucleases through the assembly of a protein barrier around their genome."
https://openalex.org/W2992003657,"Functional protein-coding small open reading frames (smORFs) are emerging as an important class of genes. However, the number of translated smORFs in the human genome is unclear because proteogenomic methods are not sensitive enough, and, as we show, Ribo-seq strategies require additional measures to ensure comprehensive and accurate smORF annotation. Here, we integrate de novo transcriptome assembly and Ribo-seq into an improved workflow that overcomes obstacles with previous methods, to more confidently annotate thousands of smORFs. Evolutionary conservation analyses suggest that hundreds of smORF-encoded microproteins are likely functional. Additionally, many smORFs are regulated during fundamental biological processes, such as cell stress. Peptides derived from smORFs are also detectable on human leukocyte antigen complexes, revealing smORFs as a source of antigens. Thus, by including additional validation into our smORF annotation workflow, we accurately identify thousands of unannotated translated smORFs that will provide a rich pool of unexplored, functional human genes."

https://openalex.org/W2995512584,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli have been historically managed with oral antibiotics including the cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The use of these agents is being compromised by the increase in extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, mostly caused by the emergence and clonal expansion of E. coli multilocus sequence typing (ST) 131. In addition, ESBL isolates show co-resistance to many of oral agents. Management of UTIs caused by ESBL and fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms is becoming increasingly challenging to treat outside of the hospital setting with clinicians having to resort to intravenous agents. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ESBL phenotypes and genotypes among UTI isolates of E. coli collected in the US during 2017 as well as the impact of co-resistance to oral agents such as the fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The national prevalence of ESBL phenotypes of E. coli was 15.7% and was geographically distributed across all nine Census regions. Levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistance rates were ≥ 24% among all isolates and this co-resistance phenotype was considerably higher among isolates showing an ESBL phenotype (≥ 59.2%) and carrying blaCTX-M-15 (≥ 69.5%). The agents with the highest potency against UTI isolates of E. coli, including ESBL isolates showing cross-resistance across oral agents, were the intravenous carbapenems. The results of this study indicate that new oral options with the spectrum and potency similar to the intravenous carbapenems would address a significant unmet need for the treatment of UTIs in an era of emergence and clonal expansion of ESBL isolates resistant to several classes of antimicrobial agents, including oral options."

https://openalex.org/W2993193059,"The post-genomic era has seen many advances in our understanding of cancer pathways, yet resistance and tumor heterogeneity necessitate multiple approaches to target even monogenic tumors. Here, we combine phenotypic screening with chemical genetics to identify pre-messenger RNA endonuclease cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3 (CPSF3) as the target of JTE-607, a small molecule with previously unknown target. We show that CPSF3 represents a synthetic lethal node in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Ewing's sarcoma cancer cell lines. Inhibition of CPSF3 by JTE-607 alters expression of known downstream effectors in AML and Ewing's sarcoma lines, upregulates apoptosis and causes tumor-selective stasis in mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, it prevents the release of newly synthesized pre-mRNAs, resulting in read-through transcription and the formation of DNA-RNA hybrid R-loop structures. This study implicates pre-mRNA processing, and specifically CPSF3, as a druggable target providing an avenue to therapeutic intervention in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2993322623,"Recent studies have implicated the nucleosome acidic patch in the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machines. We used a photocrosslinking-based nucleosome profiling technology (photoscanning) to identify a conserved basic motif within the catalytic subunit of ISWI remodelers, SNF2h, which engages this nucleosomal epitope. This region of SNF2h is essential for chromatin remodeling activity in a reconstituted biochemical system and in cells. Our studies suggest that the basic motif in SNF2h plays a critical role in anchoring the remodeler to the nucleosomal surface. We also examine the functional consequences of several cancer-associated histone mutations that map to the nucleosome acidic patch. Kinetic studies using physiologically relevant heterotypic nucleosomal substrates ('Janus' nucleosomes) indicate that these cancer-associated mutations can disrupt regularly spaced chromatin structure by inducing ISWI-mediated unidirectional nucleosome sliding. These results indicate a potential mechanistic link between oncogenic histones and alterations to the chromatin landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2994882189,"This study was conducted to assess the effects of dietary Clostridium butyricum on the growth, immunity, intestinal microbiota and disease resistance of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Three hundreds of tilapia (56.21 ± 0.81 g) were divided into 5 groups and fed a diet supplemented with C. butyricum at 0, 1 x 104, 1 x 105, 1 x 106 or 1 x 107 CFU g-1 diet (denoted as CG, CB1, CB2, CB3 and CB4, respectively) for 56 days. Then 45 fish from each group were intraperitoneally injected with Streptococcus agalactiae, and the mortality was recorded for 14 days. The results showed that dietary C. butyricum significantly improved the specific growth rate (SGR) and feed intake in the CB2 group and decreased the cumulative mortality post-challenge with S. agalactiae in the CB2, CB3 and CB4 groups. The serum total antioxidant capacity and intestinal interleukin receptor-associated kinase-4 gene expression were significantly increased, and serum malondialdehyde content and diamine oxidase activity were significantly decreased in the CB1, CB2, CB3 and CB4 groups. Serum complement 3 and complement 4 concentrations and intestinal gene expression of tumour necrosis factor α, interleukin 8, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 were significantly higher in the CB2, CB3 and CB4 groups. Intestinal toll-like receptor 2 gene expression was significantly upregulated in the CB3 and CB4 groups. Dietary C. butyricum increased the diversity of the intestinal microbiota and the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (such as Bacillus), and decreased the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (such as Aeromonas) in the CB2 group. These results revealed that dietary C. butyricum at a suitable dose enhanced growth performance, elevated humoral and intestinal immunity, regulated the intestinal microbial components, and improved disease resistance in tilapia. The optimal dose was 1 x 105 CFU g-1 diet."
https://openalex.org/W2994325682,"Background Limited information exist on tobacco and e-cigarette use patterns in cancer survivors. The purpose of this study is to report on use patterns in cancer survivors compared with non-cancer participants from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Methods Sociodemographic data and tobacco product use were analyzed for 32,244 adult participants from the PATH Study in 2013–2014 by cancer status and age. Logistic regression examined the patterns of and factors associated with tobacco use by cancer status. Results Overall, cancer survivors represented 7.1% (n = 1,527) of participants, were older, and had a higher proportion of females and non-Hispanic whites than non-cancer participants. In cancer survivors, current and former cigarette smoking was reported in 12.7% and 32.9% respectively, compared with 18.5% and 19.0% in non-cancer adults. Current e-cigarette use was reported by 3.8% of survivors compared with 5.7% of non-cancer participants. Dual tobacco use was reported by 25.0% and poly use by 6.9% of cancer survivors who currently smoked. All other forms of current tobacco use were individually reported by <5% of survivors. Young adult cancer survivors (aged 18–44) reported the highest rates of current cigarette smoking (27.9%) and current e-cigarette use (11.8%). The effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income on tobacco use status were comparable for cancer survivors and non-cancer participants. Cancer survivors who were younger, male, of lower educational attainment, and those diagnosed with a tobacco-related cancer were more likely to report current tobacco use. Conclusions Among cancer survivors, cigarette smoking remains the predominant form of tobacco use, although other tobacco/nicotine use and dual/poly use are common. The PATH Study provides detailed tobacco product use patterns in survivors, including their adoption of emerging alternative tobacco products."
https://openalex.org/W2995378687,"Well-characterized antibody reagents play a key role in the reproducibility of research findings, and inconsistent antibody performance leads to variability in Western blotting and other immunoassays. The current lack of clear, accepted standards for antibody validation and reporting of experimental details contributes to this problem. Because the performance of primary antibodies is strongly influenced by assay context, recommendations for validation and usage are unique to each type of immunoassay. Practical strategies are proposed for the validation of primary antibody specificity, selectivity, and reproducibility using Western blot analysis. The antibody should produce reproducible results within and between Western blotting experiments and the observed effect confirmed with a complementary or orthogonal method. Routine implementation of standardized antibody validation and reporting in immunoassays such as Western blotting may promote improved reproducibility across the global life sciences community."
https://openalex.org/W2996435621,"Iron is an essential nutrient for all living organisms. To acquire iron, many pathogens have developed elaborate systems to steal it from their hosts. The iron acquisition system in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus comprises nine proteins, called iron-regulated surface determinants (Isds). The Isd components enable S. aureus to extract heme from hemoglobin (Hb), transport it into the bacterial cytoplasm, and ultimately release iron from the porphyrin ring. IsdB and IsdH act as hemoglobin receptors and are known to actively extract heme from extracellular Hb. To limit microbial pathogenicity during infection, host organisms attempt to restrict the availability of nutrient metals at the host–pathogen interface. The human acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp) protects the host from oxidative damage by clearing hemoglobin that has leaked from red blood cells and also restricts the availability of extracellular Hb-bound iron to invading pathogens. To investigate whether Hp serves an additional role in nutritional immunity through a direct inhibition of IsdH-mediated iron acquisition, here we measured heme extraction from the Hp–Hb complex by UV-visible spectroscopy and determined the crystal structure of the Hp–Hb–IsdH complex at 2.9 Å resolution. We found that Hp strongly inhibits IsdH-mediated heme extraction and that Hp binding prevents local unfolding of the Hb heme pocket, leaving IsdH unable to wrest the heme from Hb. Furthermore, we noted that the Hp–Hb binding appears to trap IsdH in an initial state before heme transfer. Our findings provide insights into Hp-mediated IsdH inhibition and the dynamics of IsdH-mediated heme extraction."
https://openalex.org/W2991751070,"Both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and DNA epigenetic regulation are critical for maintaining stem cell phenotype and cancer progression. Whether and how ECM regulates epigenetic alterations to influence cancer stem cells (CSCs) remain to be explored. Here we report that ECM through laminin-integrin α6 upregulates ten-eleven translocation enzyme 3 (TET3) dioxygenase. TET3 in turn mediates DNA cytosine 5'-hydroxymethylation (5hmC) and upregulates genes critical for maintenance of glioma stem cells (GSCs). Activating integrin α6-FAK pathway increases STAT3 activity, TET3 expression and 5hmC levels in GSCs. Moreover, targeting STAT3 disrupts integrin α6-FAK signaling and inhibits TET3+ GSC maturation in vivo. STAT3 directly regulates TET3 expression and the two proteins are co-localized with 5hmC in GSC clusters. 5hmC is upregulated by STAT3 at the promoters of several tumorigenic genes, including c-Myc, known to be critical for GSCs. In vivo silencing of TET3 in GSC-enriched tumors reduces 5hmC accumulation and expression of the GSC critical genes, leading to tumor growth inhibition. TET3 expression and 5hmC accumulation also co-segregate with integrin α6 in patient malignant glioma. Thus, ECM- integrin α6-STAT3-TET3 axis regulates hydroxymethylation of genes important for GSCs, thereby increasing GSC tumorigenicity and resistance to therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2992804192,"Whereas scientists depend on the language of probability to relay information about hazards, risk communication may be more effective when embedding scientific information in narratives. The persuasive power of narratives is theorized to reside, in part, in narrative transportation.This study seeks to advance the science of stories in risk communication by measuring real-time affective responses as a proxy indicator for narrative transportation during science messages that present scientific information in the context of narrative.This study employed a within-subjects design in which participants (n = 90) were exposed to eight science messages regarding flood risk. Conventional science messages using probability and certainty language represented two conditions. The remaining six conditions were narrative science messages that embedded the two conventional science messages within three story forms that manipulated the narrative mechanism of character selection. Informed by the Narrative Policy Framework, the characters portrayed in the narrative science messages were hero, victim, and victim-to-hero. Natural language processing techniques were applied to identify and rank hero and victim vocabularies from 45 resident interviews conducted in the study area; the resulting classified vocabulary was used to build each of the three story types. Affective response data were collected over 12 group sessions across three flood-prone communities in Montana. Dial response technology was used to capture continuous, second-by-second recording of participants' affective responses while listening to each of the eight science messages. Message order was randomized across sessions. ANOVA and three linear mixed-effects models were estimated to test our predictions.First, both probabilistic and certainty science language evoked negative affective responses with no statistical differences between them. Second, narrative science messages were associated with greater variance in affective responses than conventional science messages. Third, when characters are in action, variation in the narrative mechanism of character selection leads to significantly different affective responses. Hero and victim-to-hero characters elicit positive affective responses, while victim characters produce a slightly negative response.In risk communication, characters matter in audience experience of narrative transportation as measured by affective responses."

The negative economic impact of malaria has encouraged a new control approach targeting companies. In this regard, a cross sectional study was conducted from February 2015 to June 2017 in 14 companies in the town of Douala. This study aimed at determining the prevalence, control practices of employees and identifying associated factors with malaria. A total of 2705 workers were interviewed and systematically screened for malaria using LED fluorescence microscopy (CyScope®). All positive cases were given a malaria treatment. The prevalence of malaria and asymptomatic malaria was 30.1% and 28.9% respectively; asymptomatic malaria accounted for 95.7% of all positive diagnostic test. Malaria infection was significantly higher in employees aged 36–60 years (30.5%) and having completed primary studies (36%). ITNs ownership and utilization were 86.36% and 77.23% respectively. The risk for malaria infection has significantly decreased with age and educational level while the employees’ level of education and size of households were significantly associated with the regular utilization of ITNs. This is the first study assessing malaria prevalence and risk factors in workplace in Cameroon and using a novel diagnostic tool. This study outlines a high prevalence of malaria infection, especially asymptomatic carriage, high rates of ITNs ownership and utilization, as well as the influence of level of education, age and household size as associated factors. Active case detection of asymptomatic carriers through systematic screening of employees at workplace and their treatment is feasible with the Cyscope microscope and could be a good complement to ongoing control strategies."

We found that relational leadership negatively correlates with the instrumental ethical climate, positively correlates with caring ethical climate, and exerts no significant impact on the rule ethical climate. Instrumental ethical climate and caring ethical climate mediate the relationship between relational leadership and employees’ unethical pro-organizational behavior. In addition, moral identity negatively moderates the relationship between instrumental ethical climate and employees’ unethical pro-organizational behavior, and between caring ethical climate and employees’ unethical pro-organizational behavior. Furthermore, moral identity positively moderates the relationship between a rule ethical climate and employees’ unethical, pro-organizational behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2994827484,"Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) plays a central role in the formation of presynaptic terminals, synaptic plasticity, and axonal growth and regeneration. During development, GAP-43 is found in axonal extensions of most neurons. In contrast, in the mature brain, its expression is restricted to a few presynaptic terminals and scattered axonal growth cones. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine proteinase that, upon binding to its receptor (uPAR), catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin and activates signaling pathways that promote cell migration, proliferation, and survival. In the developing brain, uPA induces neuritogenesis and neuronal migration. In contrast, the expression and function of uPA in the mature brain are poorly understood. However, recent evidence reveals that different forms of injury induce release of uPA and expression of uPAR in neurons and that uPA/uPAR binding triggers axonal growth and synapse formation. Here we show that binding of uPA to uPAR induces not only the mobilization of GAP-43 from the axonal shaft to the presynaptic terminal but also its activation in the axonal bouton by PKC-induced calcium-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-41 (pGAP-43). We found that this effect requires open presynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors but not plasmin generation. Furthermore, our work reveals that, following its activation by uPA/uPAR binding, pGAP-43 colocalizes with presynaptic vesicles and triggers their mobilization to the synaptic release site.

Seedlings were fed by exponential fertilization (EF) (nitrogen [N]-phosphorus [P]2O5-K2O, 10-7-9) at eight rates of 0 (control), 20 (E20), 40 (E40), 60 (E60), 80 (E80), 100 (E100), 120 (E120), and 140 (E140) mg N seedling-1 for four months through 16 fertilizer applications. The nutritional responses of Buddhist pine seedlings can be identified and classified into various stages in response to increasing doses, up to and over 120 N seedling-1. Morphological traits, i.e., the green color index and leaf area (LA) obtained by digital analysis and the fine root growth, all remained constant in response to doses that induced steady nutrient loading. LA had a positive relationship with most of the nutritional parameters. A dose range between 60 and 120 mg N seedling-1 was recommended for the culture of Buddhist pine seedlings. At this range of fertilizer doses, measuring the leaf area through digital scanning can easily and rapidly indicate the inherent nutrient status of the seedlings."

The acidic condition (pH 4–6) is an important character of skin surface.

In some species, such as goldfish and common carp, SAAs have a highly alkaline pI and present antimicrobial activity in vitro (16Kovacevic N. Belosevic M.

In vitro antibacterial assays at neutral pH do not reveal that human or mouse SAAs have bactericidal properties (6Erman A. Lakota K. Mrak-Poljsak K. Blango M.G. Krizan-Hergouth V.

However, overexpression of mouse SAA1 and SAA2 (mSAA1 and mSAA2) in cultured epithelial cell lines reduces co-cultured Escherichia coli via an undefined mechanism (18Eckhardt E.R. Witta J. Zhong J. Arsenescu R. Arsenescu V. Wang Y. Ghoshal S. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. de Villiers W.J. Intestinal epithelial serum amyloid A modulates bacterial growth in vitro and pro-inflammatory responses in mouse experimental colitis.BMC Gastroenterol. 2010; 10 (21067563): 13310.1186/1471-230X-10-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These works suggest that the local microenvironment of inflammatory foci may affect the bactericidal properties of SAA. In this study, we demonstrate that SAA exhibits direct antibacterial activity at low pH conditions through targeted disruption of bacterial membrane structures, which are negatively charged phospholipids. Intriguingly, SAA rapidly self-assembles with anionic phospholipids, forming small vesicles or micelles under mildly acidic pH conditions. Moreover, SAA was strongly induced in Staphylococcus aureus–infected skin and reduced bacteria burden in vivo. We first evaluated the expressions of SAA1/2/3 in an S. aureus cutaneous infected mouse model and found that mRNA levels of SAAs were significantly increased both in the skin and in the liver of the infected mice (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). The expression of SAA was also detected by immunohistochemical staining. We found that all three mice SAAs were abundantly expressed in cutaneous abscesses (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether SAA has a direct bactericidal effect, we tested the activity of SAA against E. coli and S. aureus, which are representatives of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains, respectively. We found that bactericidal activity of mSAA1 was pH-dependent (Fig. 1C), with higher activity at acidic pH. The survival rates of both E. coli and S. aureus declined by 90% after incubation with 2.5 μm mSAA1 at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1D). We also tested the antibacterial activity of hSAA1, hSAA2, mSAA2, and mSAA3, and the bactericidal activity of all of these proteins increased significantly at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1, E and F). To further validate the interaction between SAA and bacteria, we used serum from AgNO3-injected mice (endogenous mSAA) and the purified recombinant mSAA1 (exogenous) to incubate with E. coli and S. aureus at different pH conditions. The binding abilities of endogenous mSAA and the purified recombinant mSAA1 to E. coli and S. aureus at acidic pH (pH 5.5) were strongly enhanced (Fig. 2, A and B). The induced expression of recombinant SAA in bacteria causes bacterial cell lysis, suggesting the destructive effect of SAA on bacterial cell membranes (19Hirakura Y. Carreras I. Sipe J.D. Kagan B.L. Channel formation by serum amyloid A: a potential mechanism for amyloid pathogenesis and host defense.Amyloid. 2002; 9 (12000193): 13-2310.3109/13506120209072440Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate the direct interaction between SAA and bacteria, membrane integrity of mSAA1-treated bacterial cells was observed by using transmission EM. Drastic morphological changes in the bacterial cells were observed after incubating mSAA1 at low pH, and cell membrane damage and component leakage in both S. aureus and E. coli cells and cytoplasm condensation in E. coli cells were evident (Fig. 2, C–E).Figure 2SAA binds bacteria and disrupts its cell membrane at low pH.

After centrifugation, the supernatant (S) and the pellet (P) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.

Negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin, are abundantly present in bacterial cell membranes (21Liu X. Zhang Z. Ruan J. Pan Y. Magupalli V.G. Wu H. Lieberman J.

To further understand the interaction between SAA and bacterial cell membranes, unilamellar liposomes were used as an in vitro model. No phosphatidylcholine (PC)-only liposome leakage was observed with 5 μm mSAA1 and hSAA2 under neutral or acidic conditions, whereas 100% leakage in liposomes containing 20% cardiolipin (cardiolipin liposomes) and weaker leakage in liposomes containing 20% PG (PG liposomes) were observed with 5 μm mSAA1 and hSAA2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, mSAA1, mSAA2, hSAA1, and hSAA2 also induced negatively charged liposome disruption under acidic conditions. Moreover, 100% PG liposome leakage with a higher concentration of SAA proteins was evident (Fig. 3 (C and D) and Fig. S2A). To investigate the interaction between SAA and cardiolipin, we performed biolayer interferometry to explore the binding affinity of proteins and liposomes. The biotinylated SAA protein was immobilized on a streptavidin (SA) sensor, which was then flown through with the different liposomes. There was no observable binding to PC liposomes, but both mSAA1 and hSAA2 bound to cardiolipin liposomes were prominent (Fig. 3, E and F). As the cardiolipin could not dissociate from SAA proteins, we speculated that SAA formed a stable complex with cardiolipin at acidic pH. Consistent with the liposome leakage assays, no interactions between SAA and PC or cardiolipin at neutral pH were observed. To determine the exact interaction between SAA and liposomes, we performed transmission EM on negatively stained liposomes treated with mSAA1 at different pH conditions. We observed that SAA induced PG or cardiolipin liposome collapse at acidic pH. Furthermore, the SAAs rapidly formed small vesicles or micelles with large-scale disruption of the cardiolipin liposomes and PG liposomes under acidic conditions, and no significant morphological changes were observed in PG or cardiolipin liposomes at neutral pH and in PC liposome under both pH conditions (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2B). This indicated that SAA binds anionic phospholipids to form small vesicles or micelles and induce liposome leakage under acidic pH conditions. The crystal structures of hSAA1 and mSAA3 had been determined, and the known monomer structures of hSAA1 and mSAA3 are very similar, containing a cone with four α-helices and a tail (23Lu J. Yu Y.

By analyzing the surface hydrophobicity of SAA, a hypothetical model of SAA binding to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) suggested that helix 1 and helix 3 of SAA form a hydrophobic surface that binds to HDL (25Frame N.M. Gursky O. Structure of serum amyloid A suggests a mechanism for selective lipoprotein binding and functions: SAA as a hub in macromolecular interaction networks.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590 (26918388): 866-87910.1002/1873-3468.12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the N terminus of SAA is important for HDL binding, we speculated that the N-terminal region of SAA was also essential for its membrane disruption activity. A mutation with a 20-amino acid truncation of mSAA1 (ΔN20-mSAA1) was constructed. We found that the ΔN20-mSAA1 mutation did not induce PG and cardiolipin liposome leakage (Fig. 5, A–D). The negative stain EM also showed that the truncation mutation did not induce cardiolipin liposome disruption (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, the interaction with cardiolipin liposomes was detected by biolayer interferometry. It was also found that under acidic conditions, ΔN20-mSAA1 could not bind to cardiolipin liposomes (Fig. 5F). Consequently, the bactericidal activity of the truncation mutation was also significantly impaired (Fig. 5G). To further explore the role of SAA in host defense, we generated Saa1/2 double knockout mice (SAA1/2 DKO) and mice to test the function for endogenous SAAs in host defense against cutaneous bacterial infections. We verified that SAA1/2 was absent in the skin of SAA1/2 DKO mice (Fig. 6A) and showed that S. aureus infection led to higher numbers of cutaneous bacteria and a larger abscess area in the absence of SAA1/2 (Fig. 6, B and C). Because IL-6 is critical for the acute phase response and the production of acute reactive proteins including SAA in mice liver during bacterial infections (26Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Köhler G. Impaired immune and acute-phase responses in interleukin-6-deficient mice.Nature. 1994; 368 (8127368): 339-34210.1038/368339a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis of IL-6 also showed that mRNA levels for IL-6 were markedly increased in the infected skin (Fig. 6D). We assumed that the production of SAA in skin induced by S. aureus was IL-6–dependent. To test this hypothesis, we infected the WT and Il6−/− mice with S. aureus. Compared with the WT mice, mRNA levels of SAAs were significantly decreased in the skin of the infected Il6−/− mice (Fig. 6E). Taking these results together, we demonstrated that SAA has antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo and regulated by IL-6. SAA has long been recognized as a major acute-phase response protein in inflammatory diseases, but its molecular actions of innate immunity during bacterial infection remain largely unclear. In the current study, we demonstrated that SAA was abundantly expressed in cutaneous abscesses when infected with S. aureus. SAA not only binds to phospholipids of bacterial membranes through its hydrophobic N-terminal region, but exerts direct bactericidal by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane under acidic conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated the antimicrobial effects of SAA against skin bacterial infections in vivo, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for cutaneous bacterial infection. The SAA protein family is highly conserved, and the crystal structure reveals that SAA contains a four-alpha-helix bundle in which helix 1 and helix 3 form a hydrophobic surface that binds hydrophobic ligands, such as the phospholipids cholesterol and retinol (24Derebe M.G. Zlatkov C.M. Gattu S. Ruhn K.A. Vaishnava S. Diehl G.E. MacMillan J.B. Williams N.S. Hooper L.V.

Some conserved charged amino acid residues interact with polysaccharides and cell receptors (25Frame N.M. Gursky O.

SAA, during the acute phase, is primarily associated with HDL (27Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C.

A recent study also showed that SAA solubilized phospholipid bilayers to form lipoproteins that provided substrates for sPLA2 and effectively removed free fatty acids under acidic conditions (29Jayaraman S.

It has been reported that SAA is able to bind to Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria under neutral conditions and acts as an opsonin (32Shah C. Hari-Dass R. Raynes J.G. Serum amyloid A is an innate immune opsonin for Gram-negative bacteria.Blood. 2006; 108 (16735604): 1751-175710.1182/blood-2005-11-011932Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that SAAs bind both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, which in turn causes bacterial cell death under the mild acidic pH of the local inflammatory site. AMPs have three different strategies to insert and disrupt the cell membrane: by forming a barrel stave or toroidal pore to make the membrane permeable or by forming a “carpet model,” which causes the accumulation of peptides or proteins on the bilayer surface, leading to disruption of the bilayer in a detergent-like manner, eventually leading to the formation of micelles (33Brogden K.A.

We demonstrated that SAA was electrostatically attracted to the anionic phospholipid headgroups at the surface of the membrane and disrupted the cell membrane in a carpet-like manner by its hydrophobic surface under acidic pH conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2995537678,"Food borne illnesses have a world-wide economic impact and industries are continuously developing technologies to reduce the spread of disease caused by microorganisms. Antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) have been used to decrease microbiological infections in animals and their potential transfer to humans. In recent years there has been a global trend to remove AGPs from animal feed in an attempt to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistant genes into the human population. Phytobiotics, such as oregano powder, are one of the potential replacements for AGPs due to their well-established antimicrobial components. 16S rRNA gene amplicons were used to determine the effect of oregano powder (1% w/v) on the microbiota of mixed bacterial cell cultures, which were obtained from the ceca of traditionally grown meat chickens (broilers). Oregano powder had a mild effect on the microbial cell cultures increasing Enterococcus faecium, rearranging ratios of members in the genus Lactobacillus and significantly reducing the genus Streptococcus (p = 1.6e-3). Beneficial short chain fatty acids (SCFA), acetic and butyric acid, were also significantly increased in oregano powder supplemented cultures. These results suggest that oregano powder at a concentration of 1% (w/v) may have beneficial influences on mixed microbial communities and SCFA production."
https://openalex.org/W2995767111,"Undernutrition, as described by low body mass index (BMI), is a foremost risk factor for the progression of active Tuberculosis (TB). Undernutrition is also known to impact the baseline frequencies of innate and adaptive immune cells in animal models. To verify whether undernutrition has any influence on the baseline frequencies of immune cells in latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI), we examined the frequencies of T cell-, B cell, monocyte- and dendritic cell (DC)- subsets in individuals with LTBI and low BMI (LBMI) and contrasted them with LTBI and normal BMI (NBMI) groups. LBMI was characterized by decreased frequencies and absolute cell counts of T cells, B cells and NK cells in comparison with NBMI. LBMI individuals demonstrated significantly enhanced frequencies of naïve and effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and significantly decreased frequencies of central memory, effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells. Among B cell subsets, LBMI individuals demonstrated significantly diminished frequencies of naïve, immature, classical memory, activated memory, atypical memory and plasma cells. In addition, LBMI individuals showed significantly decreased frequencies of classical monocytes, myeloid DCs and plasmacytoid DCs and significantly increased frequencies of intermediate and non-classical monocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells. BMI exhibited a positive correlation with B cell and NK cell counts. Our data, therefore, demonstrates that coexistent undernutrition in LTBI is characterized by the occurrence of a significant modulation in the frequency of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2995239691,"This study aimed to compare and determine the prevalence of drug–drug interaction (DDI) and bleeding rate in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients receiving anticoagulants in a clinical setting. We used large claims data of AF patients obtained from the Japan Medical Data Center. The prevalence of DDIs and cases leading to bleeding events were surveyed clinically relevant DDIs extracted from 1) reported from a spontaneous adverse event reporting system (Japanese Adverse Drug Events Report system; JADER) ≥4 patients; 2) DDIs cited in the package inserts of each anticoagulant (each combination assessed according to “Drug interaction 2015” list; 3) warfarin and quinolone antibiotics DDIs. DDIs were categorized the mechanisms for pharmacokinetic DDI (Cytochrome P450 (CYP) or transporter etc. that modulate blood concentration of anticoagulants)/pharmacodynamic DDI (combination with similar pharmacological actions) or both in the analysis for each patients’ prescriptions obtained from a claims data. AF patients were compared between cases with and without bleeding after administered of anticoagulants. Bleeding was observed in 220/3290 (6.7%) AF patients. The bleeding rate in patients with both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic DDI mechanisms (26.3%) was higher than that in patients with either mechanism (8.6% and 9.2%, respectively) or without DDIs (4.9%). The odds ratio for bleeding in AF patients with both of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic was (7.18 [4.69–11.00], p<0.001). Our study concluded multi mechanism based DDIs leads serious outcome as compared to that of single mechanism based DDIs in AF patients. We determined the prevalence and frequency of bleeding for anticoagulant-related DDIs. To manage DDIs, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic DDI mechanisms should be closely monitored for initial symptoms of bleeding within the first 3 months."
https://openalex.org/W2995572205,"The socio-economic and demographic changes that occurred over the past 50 years have dramatically expanded urban areas around the globe, thus bringing urban settlers in closer contact with nature. Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2996071510,"Glycan biosynthesis relies on nucleotide sugars (NSs), abundant metabolites that serve as monosaccharide donors for glycosyltransferases. In vivo , signal-dependent fluctuations in NS levels are required to maintain normal cell physiology and are dysregulated in disease. However, how mammalian cells regulate NS levels and pathway flux remains largely uncharacterized. To address this knowledge gap, here we examined UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase (GALE), which interconverts two pairs of essential NSs. Using immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and LC-MS–based glycolipid and glycan profiling, we found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated GALE deletion in human cells triggers major imbalances in NSs and dramatic changes in glycolipids and glycoproteins, including a subset of integrins and the cell-surface death receptor FS-7-associated surface antigen. In particular, we observed substantial decreases in total sialic acid, galactose, and GalNAc levels in glycans. These changes also directly impacted cell signaling, as GALE −/− cells exhibited FS-7-associated surface antigen ligand-induced apoptosis. Our results reveal a role of GALE-mediated NS regulation in death receptor signaling and may have implications for the molecular etiology of illnesses characterized by NS imbalances, including galactosemia and metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2996317969,"Purpose To validate prognostic factors and determine the impact of obesity, hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus (DM) on risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Materials and methods We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients that underwent partial or radical nephrectomy at Weill Cornell Medicine for RCC and collected preoperative information on RCC risk factors, as well as pathological data. Cases were reviewed for radiographic evidence of RCC recurrence. A Cox proportional-hazards model was developed to determine the contribution of RCC risk factors to recurrence risk. Disease-free survival and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Results We identified 873 patients who underwent surgery for RCC between the years 2000–2015. In total 115 patients (13.2%) experienced a disease recurrence after a median follow up of 4.9 years. In multivariate analysis, increasing pathological T-stage (HR 1.429, 95% CI 1.265–1.614) and Nuclear grade (HR 2.376, 95% CI 1.734–3.255) were independently associated with RCC recurrence. In patients with T1-2 tumors, DM was identified as an additional independent risk factor for RCC recurrence (HR 2.744, 95% CI 1.343–5.605). Patients with DM had a significantly shorter median disease-free survival (1.5 years versus 2.6 years, p = 0.004), as well as median overall survival (4.1 years, versus 5.8 years, p<0.001). Conclusions We validated high pathological T-stage and nuclear grade as independent risk factors for RCC recurrence following nephrectomy. DM is associated with an increased risk of recurrence among patients with early stage disease."
https://openalex.org/W2995776930,"The deafness-associated m.12201T&gt;C mutation affects the A5-U68 base-pairing within the acceptor stem of mitochondrial tRNA His . The primary defect in this mutation is an alteration in tRNA His aminoacylation. Here, we further investigate the molecular mechanism of the deafness-associated tRNA His 12201T&gt;C mutation and test whether the overexpression of the human mitochondrial histidyl-tRNA synthetase gene ( HARS2 ) in cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cells carrying the m.12201T&gt;C mutation reverses mitochondrial dysfunctions. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the m.12201T&gt;C mutation perturbs the tRNA His structure and function, supported by decreased melting temperature, conformational changes, and instability of mutated tRNA. We show that the m.12201T&gt;C mutation-induced alteration of aminoacylation tRNA His causes mitochondrial translational defects and respiratory deficiency. We found that the transfer of HARS2 into the cybrids carrying the m.12201T&gt;C mutation raises the levels of aminoacylated tRNA His from 56.3 to 75.0% but does not change the aminoacylation of other tRNAs. Strikingly, HARS2 overexpression increased the steady-state levels of tRNA His and of noncognate tRNAs, including tRNA Ala , tRNA Gln , tRNA Glu , tRNA Leu(UUR) , tRNA Lys , and tRNA Met , in cells bearing the m.12201T&gt;C mutation. This improved tRNA metabolism elevated the efficiency of mitochondrial translation, activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, and respiration capacity. Furthermore, HARS2 overexpression markedly increased mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential and reduced production of reactive oxygen species in cells carrying the m.12201T&gt;C mutation. These results indicate that HARS2 overexpression corrects the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by the tRNA His mutation. These findings provide critical insights into the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disease and represent a step toward improved therapeutic interventions for mitochondrial disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2996518466,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key mediator of inflammation and immunity. Naturally-occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) binds and blocks the IL-1 receptor-1 (IL-1R1), preventing signaling. Anakinra, a recombinant form of IL-1Ra, is used to treat a spectrum of inflammatory diseases. However, anakinra is rapidly cleared from the body and requires daily administration. To create a longer-lasting alternative, PASylated IL-1Ra (PAS–IL-1Ra) has been generated by in-frame fusion of a long, defined-length, N-terminal Pro/Ala/Ser (PAS) random-coil polypeptide with IL-1Ra. Here, we compared the efficacy of two PAS–IL-1Ra molecules, PAS600–IL-1Ra and PAS800–IL-1Ra (carrying 600 and 800 PAS residues, respectively), with that of anakinra in mice. PAS600–IL-1Ra displayed markedly extended blood plasma levels 3 days post-administration, whereas anakinra was undetectable after 24 h. We also studied PAS600–IL-1Ra and PAS800–IL-1Ra for efficacy in monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced peritonitis. 5 days post-administration, PAS800–IL-1Ra significantly reduced leukocyte influx and inflammatory markers in MSU-induced peritonitis, whereas equimolar anakinra administered 24 h before MSU challenge was ineffective. The 6-h pretreatment with equimolar anakinra or PAS800–IL-1Ra before MSU challenge similarly reduced inflammatory markers. In cultured A549 lung carcinoma cells, anakinra, PAS600–IL-1Ra, and PAS800-IL-Ra reduced IL-1α–induced IL-6 and IL-8 levels with comparable potency. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, these molecules suppressed Candida albicans –induced production of the cancer-promoting cytokine IL-22. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed significant binding between PAS–IL-1Ra and IL-1R1, although with a slightly lower affinity than anakinra. These results validate PAS–IL-1Ra as an active IL-1 antagonist with marked in vivo potency and a significantly extended half-life compared with anakinra."
https://openalex.org/W2994598436,"In Cambodia, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) subtype viruses circulate endemically causing poultry outbreaks and zoonotic human cases. To investigate the genomic diversity and development of endemicity of the predominantly circulating clade 2.3.2.1c A(H5N1) viruses, we characterised 68 AIVs detected in poultry, the environment and from a single human A(H5N1) case from January 2014 to December 2016. Full genomes were generated for 42 A(H5N1) viruses. Phylogenetic analysis shows that five clade 2.3.2.1c genotypes, designated KH1 to KH5, were circulating in Cambodia during this period. The genotypes arose through multiple reassortment events with the neuraminidase (NA) and internal genes belonging to H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a, clade 2.3.2.1b or A(H9N2) lineages. Phylogenies suggest that the Cambodian AIVs were derived from viruses circulating between Cambodian and Vietnamese poultry. Molecular analyses show that these viruses contained the hemagglutinin (HA) gene substitutions D94N, S133A, S155N, T156A, T188I and K189R known to increase binding to the human-type α2,6-linked sialic acid receptors. Two A(H5N1) viruses displayed the M2 gene S31N or A30T substitutions indicative of adamantane resistance, however, susceptibility testing towards neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, lananmivir and peramivir) of a subset of thirty clade 2.3.2.1c viruses showed susceptibility to all four drugs. This study shows that A(H5N1) viruses continue to reassort with other A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) viruses that are endemic in the region, highlighting the risk of introduction and emergence of novel A(H5N1) genotypes in Cambodia."
https://openalex.org/W2991939048,"Introduction In order to improve the prediction accuracy of dengue fever incidence, we constructed a prediction model with interactive effects between meteorological factors, based on weekly dengue fever cases in Guangdong, China from 2008 to 2016. Methods Dengue fever data were derived from statistical data from the China National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System. Daily meteorological data were obtained from the China Integrated Meteorological Information Sharing System. The minimum temperature for transmission was identified using data fitting and the Ross-Macdonald model. Correlations and interactive effects were examined using Spearman’s rank correlation and multivariate analysis of variance. A probit regression model to describe the incidence of dengue fever from 2008 to 2016 and forecast the 2017 incidence was constructed, based on key meteorological factors, interactive effects, mosquito-vector factors, and other important factors. Results We found the minimum temperature suitable for dengue transmission was ≥18°C, and as 97.91% of cases occurred when the minimum temperature was above 18 °C, the data were used for model training and construction. Epidemics of dengue are related to mean temperature, maximum/minimum and mean atmospheric pressure, and mean relative humidity. Moreover, interactions occur between mean temperature, minimum atmospheric pressure, and mean relative humidity. Our weekly probit regression prediction model is 0.72. Prediction of dengue cases for the first 41 weeks of 2017 exhibited goodness of fit of 0.60. Conclusion Our model was accurate and timely, with consideration of interactive effects between meteorological factors."
https://openalex.org/W2994452978,"Aim Fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN) has proven to be a promising strategy in the identification of nonlinear systems. The network considers both global and local properties, deals with imprecision present in sensory data, leading to desired precisions. In this paper, we proposed a new FWNN model nominated “Fuzzy Jump Wavelet Neural Network” (FJWNN) for identifying dynamic nonlinear-linear systems, especially in practical applications. Methods The proposed FJWNN is a fuzzy neural network model of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type whose consequent part of fuzzy rules is a linear combination of input regressors and dominant wavelet neurons as a sub-jump wavelet neural network. Each fuzzy rule can locally model both linear and nonlinear properties of a system. The linear relationship between the inputs and the output is learned by neurons with linear activation functions, whereas the nonlinear relationship is locally modeled by wavelet neurons. Orthogonal least square (OLS) method and genetic algorithm (GA) are respectively used to purify the wavelets for each sub-JWNN. In this paper, fuzzy rule induction improves the structure of the proposed model leading to less fuzzy rules, inputs of each fuzzy rule and model parameters. The real-world gas furnace and the real electromyographic (EMG) signal modeling problem are employed in our study. In the same vein, piecewise single variable function approximation, nonlinear dynamic system modeling, and Mackey–Glass time series prediction, ratify this method superiority. The proposed FJWNN model is compared with the state-of-the-art models based on some performance indices such as RMSE, RRSE, Rel ERR%, and VAF%. Results The proposed FJWNN model yielded the following results: RRSE (mean±std) of 10e-5±6e-5 for piecewise single-variable function approximation, RMSE (mean±std) of 2.6–4±2.6e-4 for the first nonlinear dynamic system modelling, RRSE (mean±std) of 1.59e-3±0.42e-3 for Mackey–Glass time series prediction, RMSE of 0.3421 for gas furnace modelling and VAF% (mean±std) of 98.24±0.71 for the EMG modelling of all trial signals, indicating a significant enhancement over previous methods. Conclusions The FJWNN demonstrated promising accuracy and generalization while moderating network complexity. This improvement is due to applying main useful wavelets in combination with linear regressors and using fuzzy rule induction. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, the proposed FJWNN yielded better performance and, therefore, can be considered a novel tool for nonlinear system identification."
https://openalex.org/W2994767675,"Cellular membranes contain many lipids, some of which, such as sphingolipids, have important structural and signaling functions. The common sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is present in plants, fungi, and animals. As a major plant sphingolipid, GlcCer is involved in the formation of lipid microdomains, and the regulation of GlcCer is key for acclimation to stress. Although the GlcCer biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated, little is known about GlcCer catabolism, and a plant GlcCer-degrading enzyme (glucosylceramidase (GCD)) has yet to be identified. Here, we identified AtGCD3 , one of four Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of human nonlysosomal glucosylceramidase, as a plant GCD. We found that recombinant At GCD3 has a low K m for the fluorescent lipid C 6 -NBD GlcCer and preferentially hydrolyzes long acyl-chain GlcCer purified from Arabidopsis leaves. Testing of inhibitors of mammalian glucosylceramidases revealed that a specific inhibitor of human β-glucosidase 2, N -butyldeoxynojirimycin, inhibits At GCD3 more effectively than does a specific inhibitor of human β-glucosidase 1, conduritol β-epoxide. We also found that Glu-499 and Asp-647 in At GCD3 are vital for GCD activity. GFP- At GCD3 fusion proteins mainly localized to the plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. No obvious growth defects or changes in sphingolipid contents were observed in gcd3 mutants. Our results indicate that At GCD3 is a plant glucosylceramidase that participates in GlcCer catabolism by preferentially hydrolyzing long-acyl-chain GlcCers."
https://openalex.org/W2994995322,"Co-occurrence of aberrant hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways has been observed in advanced and metastatic prostate cancers. This co-occurrence positively correlates with prostate cancer progression and castration-resistant prostate cancer development. However, the biological consequences of these abnormalities in these disease processes remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the aberrant activation of HGF/MET and Wnt/β-catenin cascades in prostate tumorigenesis by using a newly generated mouse model in which both murine Met transgene and stabilized β-catenin are conditionally co-expressed in prostatic epithelial cells. These compound mice displayed accelerated prostate tumor formation and invasion compared with their littermates that expressed only stabilized β-catenin. RNA-Seq and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed increased expression of genes associated with tumor cell proliferation, progression, and metastasis. Moreover, Wnt signaling pathways were robustly enriched in prostate tumor samples from the compound mice. ChIP-qPCR experiments revealed increased β-catenin recruitment within the regulatory regions of the Myc gene in tumor cells of the compound mice. Interestingly, the occupancy of MET on the Myc promoter also appeared in the compound mouse tumor samples, implicating a novel role of MET in β-catenin-mediated transcription. Results from implanting prostate graft tissues derived from the compound mice and controls into HGF-transgenic mice further uncovered that HGF induces prostatic oncogenic transformation and cell growth. These results indicate a role of HGF/MET in β-catenin-mediated prostate cancer cell growth and progression and implicate a molecular mechanism whereby nuclear MET promotes aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling-mediated prostate tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2993952190,"Salmonella can appear in the bloodstream within CD18 expressing phagocytes following oral ingestion in as little as 15 minutes. Here, we provide evidence that the process underlying this phenomenon is reverse transmigration. Reverse transmigration is a normal host process in which dendritic cells can reenter the bloodstream by traversing endothelium in the basal to apical direction. We have developed an in vitro reverse transmigration assay in which dendritic cells are given the opportunity to cross endothelial monolayers in the basal to apical direction grown on membranes with small pores, modeling how such cells can penetrate the bloodstream. We demonstrate that exposing dendritic cells to microbial components negatively regulates reverse transmigration. We propose that microbial components normally cause the host to toggle between positively and negatively regulating reverse transmigration, balancing the need to resolve inflammation with inhibiting the spread of microbes. We show that Salmonella in part overcomes this negative regulation of reverse transmigration with the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 encoded type III secretion system, which increases reverse transmigration by over an order of magnitude. The SPI-2 type III secretion system does this in part, but not entirely by injecting the type III effector SpvC into infected cells. We further demonstrate that SpvC greatly promotes early extra-intestinal dissemination in mice. This result combined with the previous observation that the spv operon is conserved amongst strains of non-typhoidal Salmonella capable of causing bacteremia in humans suggests that this pathway to the bloodstream could be important for understanding human infections."
https://openalex.org/W2994843395,"Binge drinking, an increasingly common form of alcohol use disorder, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality; yet, its effects on the immune system's ability to defend against infectious agents are poorly understood. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis can occur in healthy humans, yet binge alcohol intoxication is increasingly being recognized as a major risk factor. Although our previous studies demonstrated that binge alcohol exposure increased B. pseudomallei near-neighbor virulence in vivo and increased paracellular diffusion and intracellular invasion, no experimental studies have examined the extent to which bacterial and alcohol dosage play a role in disease progression. In addition, the temporal effects of a single binge alcohol dose prior to infection has not been examined in vivo.In this study, we used B. thailandensis E264 a close genetic relative of B. pseudomallei, as useful BSL-2 model system. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were utilized in three distinct animal models to address the effects of 1) bacterial dosage, 2) alcohol dosage, and 3) the temporal effects, of a single binge alcohol episode. Alcohol was administered comparable to human binge drinking (≤ 4.4 g/kg) or PBS intraperitoneally before a non-lethal intranasal infection. Bacterial colonization of lung and spleen was increased in mice administered alcohol even after bacterial dose was decreased 10-fold. Lung and not spleen tissue were colonized even after alcohol dosage was decreased 20 times below the U.S legal limit. Temporally, a single binge alcohol episode affected lung bacterial colonization for more than 24 h after alcohol was no longer detected in the blood. Pulmonary and splenic cytokine expression (TNF-α, GM-CSF) remained suppressed, while IL-12/p40 increased in mice administered alcohol 6 or 24 h prior to infection. Increased lung and not intestinal bacterial invasion was observed in human and murine non-phagocytic epithelial cells exposed to 0.2% v/v alcohol in vitro.Our results indicate that the effects of a single binge alcohol episode are tissue specific. A single binge alcohol intoxication event increases bacterial colonization in mouse lung tissue even after very low BACs and decreases the dose required to colonize the lungs with less virulent B. thailandensis. Additionally, the temporal effects of binge alcohol alters lung and spleen cytokine expression for at least 24 h after alcohol is detected in the blood. Delayed recovery in lung and not spleen tissue may provide a means for B. pseudomallei and near-neighbors to successfully colonize lung tissue through increased intracellular invasion of non-phagocytic cells in patients with hazardous alcohol intake."
https://openalex.org/W2996718272,"Restricted and controlled drug delivery to the heart remains a challenge giving frequent off-target effects as well as limited retention of drugs in the heart. There is a need to develop and optimize tools to allow for improved design of drug candidates for treatment of heart diseases. Over the last decade, novel drug platforms and nanomaterials were designed to confine bioactive materials to the heart. Yet, the research remains in its infancy, not only in the development of tools but also in the understanding of effects of these materials on cardiac function and tissue integrity. Upconverting nanoparticles are nanomaterials that recently accelerated interest in theranostic nanomedicine technologies. Their unique photophysical properties allow for sensitive in vivo imaging that can be combined with spatio-temporal control for targeted release of encapsulated drugs. Here we synthesized upconverting NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanoparticles and show for the first time their innocuity in the heart, when injected in the myocardium or in the pericardial space in mice. Nanoparticle retention and upconversion in the cardiac region did not alter heart rate variability, nor cardiac function as determined over a 15-day time course ensuing the sole injection. Altogether, our nanoparticles show innocuity primarily in the pericardial region and can be safely used for controlled spatiotemporal drug delivery. Our results support the use of upconverting nanoparticles as potential theranostics tools overcoming some of the key limitations associated with conventional experimental cardiology."
https://openalex.org/W2996743810,"Gallus gallus (chicken) is phenotypically diverse, with over 60 recognized breeds, among the myriad species within the Aves lineage. Domestic chickens have been under artificial selection by humans for thousands of years for agricultural purposes. The North American Araucana (NAA) breed arose as a cross between the Chilean Collonocas that laid blue eggs and was rumpless and the Quetros that had unusual tufts but with tail. NAAs were introduced from South America in the 1940s and have been kept as show birds by enthusiasts since then due to several distinctive traits: laying eggs with blue eggshells, characteristic ear-tufts, a pea comb, and rumplessness. The population has maintained variants for clean-faced and tufted, as well as tailed and rumplessness traits making it advantageous for genetic studies. Genome resequencing of six NAA chickens with a mixture of these traits was done to 71-fold coverage using Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired-end reads. Trimmed and concordant reads were mapped to the Gallus_gallus-5.0 reference genome (galGal5), generated from a female Red Junglefowl (UCD001). To identify candidate genes that are associated with traits of the NAA, their genome was compared with the Korean Araucana, Korean Domestic and White Leghorn breeds. Genomic regions with significantly reduced levels of heterogeneity were detected on five different chromosomes in NAA. The sequence data generated confirm the identity of variants responsible for the blue eggshells, pea comb, and rumplessness traits of NAA and propose one for ear-tufts."
https://openalex.org/W2995791183,"Background Adherence in the context of patients with acute conditions is a major public health issue. It is neglected by the research community and no clinically validated generic scale exists to measure it. Objective To construct and validate a Global Adherence Scale usable in the context of Acute Conditions (GASAC) that takes into account adherence both to advice and to all types of prescriptions that the doctor may give. To measure adherence and to study its determinants. Materials and method We based the construction of the GASAC questionnaire on a theoretical model and a literature search. Then, between 2013 and 2014, we validated it in a prospective observational study in two hospital emergency departments. Patients were contacted by phone about one week after their consultation to answer several questionnaires, including GASAC and the Girerd self-administered questionnaire about medication adherence as a control. Results GASAC consists of four adherence subscales: drug prescriptions; blood tests/ radiography prescriptions; lifestyle advice and follow-up instructions. An analysis of the 154 sets of answers from patients showed that the GASAC drug subscale had satisfactory internal coherence (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.78) and was correlated with the Girerd score, as was GASAC as a whole (p<0.01). The median score was 0.93 IQR [0.78–1] for a maximum value of 1 (n = 154). In multivariaable analysis, infection was more conducive of good adherence (cut off at ≥ 0.8; n = 115/154; 74.7% [67.0–81.3]) than trauma (OR 3.69; CI [1.60–8.52]). The Doctor-Patient Communication score (OR 1.06 by score point, CI [1.02–1.10]) also influenced adherence. Conclusions GASAC is a generic score to measure all dimensions of patient adherence following emergency departments visits, for use in clinical research and the evaluation of clinical practice. The level of adherence was high for acute conditions and Doctor-Patient Communication was a major determinant of adherence."

Therefore, we aimed to identify genes in monocytes predictive of a new ischemic event in patients with CAD and/or discriminate between stable CAD and acute coronary syndrome. We included 66 patients with stable CAD, of which 24 developed a new ischemic event, and 19 patients with ACS. Circulating CD14+ monocytes were isolated with magnetic beads. RNA sequencing analysis in monocytes of patients with (n = 13) versus without (n = 11) ischemic event at follow-up and in patients with ACS (n = 12) was validated with qPCR (n = 85). MT-COI, STRN and COX10 predicted new ischemic events in CAD patients (power for separation at 1% error rate of 0.97, 0.90 and 0.77 respectively). Low MT-COI and high STRN were also related to shorter time between blood sampling and event. COX10 and ZNF484 together with MT-COI, STRN and WNK1 separated ACS completely from stable CAD patients. RNA expressions in monocytes of MT-COI, COX10, STRN, WNK1 and ZNF484 were independent of cholesterol lowering and antiplatelet treatment. They were independent of troponin T, a marker of myocardial injury. But, COX10 and ZNF484 in human plaques correlated to plaque markers of M1 macrophage polarization, reflecting vascular injury. Expression of MT-COI, COX10, STRN and WNK1, but not that of ZNF484, PBMCs paired with that in monocytes. The prospective study of relation of MT-COI, COX10, STRN, WNK1 and ZNF484 with unstable CAD is warranted."

A regression model based on environmental variables available for New Zealand was also determined to predict δ2H values measured from blackberry leaves without initially modelling the precipitation δ2H values. The three models were compared for their accuracy and precision when assigning 10 samples of blackberry leaves for their geographic location based on their measured δ2H values. One of the models based on a precipitation isoscape was similar in accuracy and precision of assignment to the model determined from the environmental variables and provides an approach for determining valid isoscapes for future plant materials."
https://openalex.org/W2995212562,"The present study addresses how task constraints and aging influence isometric force control. We used two tasks requiring either force maintenance (straight line target force) or force modulation (sine-wave target force) around different force levels and at different modulation frequencies. Force levels were defined relative the individual maximum voluntary contraction. A group of young adults (mean age ± SD = 25 ± 3.6 years) and a group of elderly (mean age = 77 ± 6.4 years) took part in the study. Age- and task-related effects were assessed through differences in: (i) force control accuracy, (ii) time-structure of force fluctuations, and (iii) the contribution of deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (noise-like) dynamic components to the expressed behavior. Performance-wise, the elderly showed a pervasive lower accuracy and higher variability than the young participants. The analysis of fluctuations showed that the elderly produced force signals that were less complex than those of the young adults during the maintenance task, but the reverse was observed in the modulation task. Behavioral complexity results suggest a reduced adaptability to task-constraints with advanced age. Regarding the dynamics, we found comparable generating mechanisms in both age groups for both tasks and in all conditions, namely a fixed-point for force maintenance and a limit-cycle for force modulation. However, aging increased the stochasticity (noise-driven fluctuations) of force fluctuations in the cyclic force modulation, which could be related to the increased complexity found in elderly for this same task. To our knowledge this is the first time that these different perspectives to motor control are used simultaneously to characterize force control capacities. Our findings show their complementarity in revealing distinct aspects of sensorimotor adaptation to task constraints and age-related declines. Although further research is still needed to identify the physiological underpinnings, the used task and methodology are shown to have both fundamental and clinical applications."

Objective To quantify changes in the ocular surface and tear film in dry cleaners exposed to organic solvents and associate these changes with ocular irritation as reported in a symptom questionnaire for dry eye diagnosis. Methods This was a case and control study in which the characteristics and eye-irritation symptoms were compared between two groups of 62 participants that were either exposed or not exposed to organic solvents. A general optometric examination and the following test were performed: lipid interferometry, Lissamine Green Stain, tear breakup time, Schirmer I, conjunctival impression cytology and the Donate dry eye symptoms questionnaire. Results Sixty-five percent of exposed workers obtained a higher score than 13 on the Donate dry eye symptoms questionnaire which indicated the presence of more irritation symptoms than those in the non- exposed group. A Chi-square analysis indicated the exposed group reported significantly higher incidences (P <0.005) for eye irritation symptoms of sandy sensation; tearing eyes sensation; foreign body sensation; tearing; dry eye; dryness; eyestrain and heavy eyelids. A Mann Whitney-U indicated greater severity only for symptoms relating to dry eye; sandy sensation; foreign body sensation, tearing; tearing eyes and dryness. There was a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) for Schirmer I; tear break up time; and the ocular surface assessed with Lissamine green staining and conjunctival impression cytology between groups. A reduction in the thickness of the lipid layer in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group was observed. Surprisingly, clinical test outcomes were not significantly correlated with dry eye symptoms nor years of exposure. Conclusion Workers in the dry-cleaning industry exposed to organic solvents are associated with changes in ocular surface and tear film generating irritation symptoms commonly present in evaporative dry eye."
https://openalex.org/W2994825595,"The basal body in the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei is structurally equivalent to the centriole in animals and functions in the nucleation of axonemal microtubules in the flagellum. T. brucei lacks many evolutionarily conserved centriolar protein homologs and constructs the basal body through unknown mechanisms. Two evolutionarily conserved centriole/basal body cartwheel proteins, TbSAS-6 and TbBLD10, and a trypanosome-specific protein, BBP65, play essential roles in basal body biogenesis in T. brucei , but how they cooperate in the regulation of basal body assembly remains elusive. Here using RNAi, endogenous epitope tagging, immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3D-structured illumination super-resolution microscopy, we identified a new trypanosome-specific protein named BBP164 and found that it has an essential role in basal body biogenesis in T. brucei . Further investigation of the functional interplay among BBP164 and the other three regulators of basal body assembly revealed that BBP164 and BBP65 are interdependent for maintaining their stability and depend on TbSAS-6 and TbBLD10 for their stabilization in the basal body. Additionally, TbSAS-6 and TbBLD10 are independent from each other and from BBP164 and BBP65 for maintaining their stability in the basal body. These findings demonstrate that basal body cartwheel proteins are required for stabilizing other basal body components and uncover that regulation of protein stability is an unusual control mechanism for assembly of the basal body in T. brucei ."
