https://openalex.org/W4281752653,"The nervous and immune systems are intricately linked1. Although psychological stress is known to modulate immune function, mechanistic pathways linking stress networks in the brain to peripheral leukocytes remain poorly understood2. Here we show that distinct brain regions shape leukocyte distribution and function throughout the body during acute stress in mice. Using optogenetics and chemogenetics, we demonstrate that motor circuits induce rapid neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues through skeletal-muscle-derived neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Conversely, the paraventricular hypothalamus controls monocyte and lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs and blood to the bone marrow through direct, cell-intrinsic glucocorticoid signalling. These stress-induced, counter-directional, population-wide leukocyte shifts are associated with altered disease susceptibility. On the one hand, acute stress changes innate immunity by reprogramming neutrophils and directing their recruitment to sites of injury. On the other hand, corticotropin-releasing hormone neuron-mediated leukocyte shifts protect against the acquisition of autoimmunity, but impair immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection. Collectively, these data show that distinct brain regions differentially and rapidly tailor the leukocyte landscape during psychological stress, therefore calibrating the ability of the immune system to respond to physical threats.

https://openalex.org/W4281664411,"The selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents ferroptosis by converting lipid peroxides into nontoxic lipid alcohols. GPX4 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but some cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition. Using a chemical-genetic screen, we identify LRP8 (also known as ApoER2) as a ferroptosis resistance factor that is upregulated in cancer. Loss of LRP8 decreases cellular selenium levels and the expression of a subset of selenoproteins. Counter to the canonical hierarchical selenoprotein regulatory program, GPX4 levels are strongly reduced due to impaired translation. Mechanistically, low selenium levels result in ribosome stalling at the inefficiently decoded GPX4 selenocysteine UGA codon, leading to ribosome collisions, early translation termination and proteasomal clearance of the N-terminal GPX4 fragment. These findings reveal rewiring of the selenoprotein hierarchy in cancer cells and identify ribosome stalling and collisions during GPX4 translation as ferroptosis vulnerabilities in cancer. LRP8 regulation of cellular selenium promotes ferroptosis resistance in cancer. Low selenium leads to ribosome stalling, ribosome collisions and early GPX4 translation termination."

https://openalex.org/W4281553578,"Mouse germline cysts, on average, develop into six oocytes supported by 24 nurse cells that transfer cytoplasm and organelles to generate a Balbiani body. We showed that between E14.5 and P5, cysts periodically activate some nurse cells to begin cytoplasmic transfer, which causes them to shrink and turnover within 2 days. Nurse cells die by a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway involving acidification, similar to Drosophila nurse cells, and only infrequently by apoptosis. Prior to initiating transfer, nurse cells co-cluster by scRNA-seq with their pro-oocyte sisters, but during their final 2 days, they cluster separately. The genes promoting oocyte development and nurse cell PCD are upregulated, whereas the genes that repress transfer, such as Tex14, and oocyte factors, such as Nobox and Lhx8, are under-expressed. The transferred nurse cell centrosomes build a cytocentrum that establishes a large microtubule aster in the primordial oocyte that organizes the Balbiani body, defining the earliest oocyte polarity."
https://openalex.org/W4281669454,"Epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between breast cancer (BC) and systemic dysregulation of glucose metabolism. However, how BC influences glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We show that BC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) suppress pancreatic insulin secretion to impair glucose homeostasis. EV-encapsulated miR-122 targets PKM in β-cells to suppress glycolysis and ATP-dependent insulin exocytosis. Mice receiving high-miR-122 EVs or bearing BC tumours exhibit suppressed insulin secretion, enhanced endogenous glucose production, impaired glucose tolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia. These effects contribute to tumour growth and are abolished by inhibiting EV secretion or miR-122, restoring PKM in β-cells or supplementing insulin. Compared with non-cancer controls, patients with BC have higher levels of circulating EV-encapsulated miR-122 and fasting glucose concentrations but lower fasting insulin; miR-122 levels are positively associated with glucose and negatively associated with insulin. Therefore, EV-mediated impairment of whole-body glycaemic control may contribute to tumour progression and incidence of type 2 diabetes in some patients with BC. Cao et al. show that miR-122 encapsulated in breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles targets PKM to downregulate β-cell insulin secretion, leading to dysregulated glucose homeostasis and enhanced tumour growth."

Here we describe Smart-seq3xpress, which miniaturizes and streamlines the Smart-seq3 protocol to substantially reduce reagent use and increase cellular throughput. Smart-seq3xpress analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in a granular atlas complete with common and rare cell types. Compared with droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing that sequences RNA ends, the additional full-transcript coverage revealed cell-type-associated isoform variation."

The study was aimed to evaluate whether vitamin D3 supplementation could prevent respiratory worsening among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.We designed a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, sequential, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study was conducted in 17 second and third level hospitals, located in four provinces of Argentina, from 14 August 2020 to 22 June 2021. We enrolled 218 adult patients, hospitalized in general wards with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and risk factors for disease progression. Participants were randomized to a single oral dose of 500 000 IU of vitamin D3 or matching placebo. Randomization ratio was 1:1, with permuted blocks and stratified for study site, diabetes and age (≤60 vs >60 years). The primary outcome was the change in the respiratory Sepsis related Organ Failure Assessment score between baseline and the highest value recorded up to day 7. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay; intensive care unit admission; and in-hospital mortality. Overall, 115 participants were assigned to vitamin D3 and 105 to placebo (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [10.7] years; 103 [47.2%] women). There were no significant differences in the primary outcome between groups (median [IQR] 0.0 [0.0-1.0] vs 0.0 [0.0-1.0], for vitamin D3 and placebo, respectively; p = 0.925). Median [IQR] length of hospital stay was not significantly different between vitamin D3 group (6.0 [4.0-9.0] days) and placebo group (6.0 [4.0-10.0] days; p = 0.632). There were no significant differences for intensive care unit admissions (7.8% vs 10.7%; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.70; p = 0.622), or in-hospital mortality (4.3% vs 1.9%; RR 2.24; 95% CI 0.44 to 11.29; p = 0.451). There were no significant differences in serious adverse events (vitamin D3 = 14.8%, placebo = 11.7%).Among hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and risk factors, a single high oral dose of vitamin D3 as compared with placebo, did not prevent the respiratory worsening.ClincicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04411446."

The entire FS protocol can be performed in ~4.5 hours, is simple to automate and can be easily miniaturized to decrease resource consumption. The FS protocol can also use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for molecule counting while displaying reduced strand-invasion artifacts. FS will be especially useful for characterizing gene expression at high resolution across multiple samples."
https://openalex.org/W4282012340,"The latency between acquisition of an initiating somatic driver mutation by a single-cell and clinical presentation with cancer is largely unknown. We describe a remarkable case of monozygotic twins presenting with CALR mutation-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (aged 37 and 38 years), with a clinical phenotype of primary myelofibrosis. The CALR mutation was absent in T cells and dermal fibroblasts, confirming somatic acquisition. Whole-genome sequencing lineage tracing revealed a common clonal origin of the CALR-mutant MPN clone, which occurred in utero followed by twin-to-twin transplacental transmission and subsequent similar disease latency. Index sorting and single-colony genotyping revealed phenotypic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as the likely MPN-propagating cell. Furthermore, neonatal blood spot analysis confirmed in utero origin of the JAK2V617F mutation in a patient presenting with polycythemia vera (aged 34 years). These findings provide a unique window into the prolonged evolutionary dynamics of MPNs and fitness advantage exerted by MPN-associated driver mutations in HSCs."

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) is essential for small-RNA-mediated immune response in plants but is absent in vertebrates. Here, we show that ectopic expression of plant RDR1 can generally inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In many human primary tumors, abnormal microRNA isoforms with 1-nt-shorter 3′ ends are widely accumulated. RDR1 with nucleotidyltransferase activity can recognize and modify the problematic AGO2-free microRNA duplexes with mononucleotides to restore their 2 nt overhang structure, which eventually rescues AGO2-loading efficiency and elevates global miRNA expression to inhibit cancer cell-cycle specifically. The broad antitumor effects of RDR1, which can be delivered by an adeno-associated virus, are visualized in multiple xenograft tumor models in vivo. Altogether, we reveal the widespread accumulation of aberrant microRNA isoforms in tumors and develop a plant RDR1-mediated antitumor stratagem by editing and repairing defective microRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W4281688870,"The first lineage choice in human embryo development separates trophectoderm from the inner cell mass. Naïve human embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass and offer possibilities to explore how lineage integrity is maintained. Here, we discover that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains naïve pluripotency and restricts differentiation to trophectoderm and mesoderm lineages. Through quantitative epigenome profiling, we found that a broad gain of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is a distinct feature of naïve pluripotency. We define shared and naïve-specific bivalent promoters featuring PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 concomitant with H3K4me3. Naïve bivalency maintains key trophectoderm and mesoderm transcription factors in a transcriptionally poised state. Inhibition of PRC2 forces naïve human embryonic stem cells into an 'activated' state, characterized by co-expression of pluripotency and lineage-specific transcription factors, followed by differentiation into either trophectoderm or mesoderm lineages. In summary, PRC2-mediated repression provides a highly adaptive mechanism to restrict lineage potential during early human development."

https://openalex.org/W4281917422,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) results from the accumulation of excessive liver lipids leading to hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis that greatly increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite the well-characterized clinical and histological pathology for NASH-driven HCC in humans, its etiology remains unclear and there is a deficiency in pre-clinical models that recapitulate the progression of the human disease. Therefore, we developed a new mouse model amenable to genetic manipulations and gene targeting that mimics the gradual NASH to HCC progression observed in humans. C57BL/6NJ mice were fed a Western high-fat diet and sugar water (HFD/SW) and monitored for effects on metabolism, liver histology, tumor development, and liver transcriptome for up to 54 weeks. Chronic HFD/SW feeding led to significantly increased weight gain, serum and liver lipid levels, liver injury, and glucose intolerance. Hepatic pathology progressed and mice developed hepatocellular ballooning, inflammation, and worse fibrosis was apparent at 16 weeks, greatly increased through 32 weeks, and remained elevated at 54 weeks. Importantly, hepatocellular cancer spontaneously developed in 75% of mice on HFD/SW, half of which were HCC, whereas none of the mice on the chow diet developed HCC. Chronic HFD/SW induced molecular markers of de novo lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, and accumulation of p62, all of which also participate in the human pathology. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed activation of HCC-related genes and signatures associated with poor prognosis of human HCC. Overall, we have identified a new preclinical model that recapitulates known hallmarks of NASH-driven HCC that can be utilized for future molecular mechanistic studies of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281978000,"Biological signal recording enables the study of molecular inputs experienced throughout cellular history. However, current methods are limited in their ability to scale up beyond a single signal in mammalian contexts. Here, we develop an approach using a hyper-efficient dCas12a base editor for multi-signal parallel recording in human cells. We link signals of interest to expression of guide RNAs to catalyze specific nucleotide conversions as a permanent record, enabled by Cas12's guide-processing abilities. We show this approach is plug-and-play with diverse biologically relevant inputs and extend it for more sophisticated applications, including recording of time-delimited events and history of chimeric antigen receptor T cells' antigen exposure. We also demonstrate efficient recording of up to four signals in parallel on an endogenous safe-harbor locus. This work provides a versatile platform for scalable recording of signals of interest for a variety of biological applications."
https://openalex.org/W4281739847,"This research compares four standard analytics metrics from Google Analytics with SimilarWeb using one year's average monthly data for 86 websites from 26 countries and 19 industry verticals. The results show statistically significant differences between the two services for total visits, unique visitors, bounce rates, and average session duration. Using Google Analytics as the baseline, SimilarWeb average values were 19.4% lower for total visits, 38.7% lower for unique visitors, 25.2% higher for bounce rate, and 56.2% higher for session duration. The website rankings between SimilarWeb and Google Analytics for all metrics are significantly correlated, especially for total visits and unique visitors. The accuracy/inaccuracy of the metrics from both services is discussed from the vantage of the data collection methods employed. In the absence of a gold standard, combining the two services is a reasonable approach, with Google Analytics for onsite and SimilarWeb for network metrics. Finally, the differences between SimilarWeb and Google Analytics measures are systematic, so with Google Analytics metrics from a known site, one can reasonably generate the Google Analytics metrics for related sites based on the SimilarWeb values. The implications are that SimilarWeb provides conservative analytics in terms of visits and visitors relative to those of Google Analytics, and both tools can be utilized in a complementary fashion in situations where site analytics is not available for competitive intelligence and benchmarking analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4281757551,"Ethiopia is recognized as a center of diversity for barley, and its landraces are known for the distinct genetic features compared to other barley collections. The genetic diversity of Ethiopian barley likely results from the highly diverse topography, altitude, climate conditions, soil types, and farming systems. To get detailed information on the genetic diversity a panel of 260 accessions, comprising 239 landraces and 21 barley breeding lines, obtained from the Ethiopian biodiversity institute (EBI) and the national barley improvement program, respectively were studied for their genetic diversity using the 50k iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A total of 983 highly informative SNP markers were used for structure and diversity analysis. Three genetically distinct clusters were obtained from the structure analysis comprising 80, 71, and 109 accessions, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed the presence of higher genetic variation (89%) within the clusters than between the clusters (11%), with moderate genetic differentiation (PhiPT = 0.11) and five accessions were detected as first-generation migrants using Monte Carlo resampling methods. The Mantel test revealed that the genetic distance between accessions is poorly associated with their geographical distance. Despite the observed weak correlation between geographic distance and genetic differentiation, for some regions like Gonder, Jimma, Gamo-Gofa, Shewa, and Welo, more than 50% of the landraces derived from these regions are assigned to one of the three clusters."
https://openalex.org/W4281674574,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in skeletal muscle development. In this study, we identified putative miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle between fetus (75 days of pregnancy) and lamb (1 day of age). We detected 1208 miRNAs, 313 of which were differentially expressed. In particular, we found that miR-145-5p was differentially and highly expressed in lamb skeletal muscle. In addition, our results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-145-5p inhibited the differentiation and apoptosis of goat primary myoblasts (GPMs), whereas knockdown of miR-145-5p had the opposite effect. The coding domain sequence (CDS) of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 13 (USP13) was predicted and validated as a target of miR-145-5p. We also demonstrated that the influence as a key regulator of GPMs differentiation is primarily mediated by targeting and inhibiting USP13. Taken together, these results revealed a novel pathway in skeletal muscle development in which miR-145-5p targets CDS region of USP13 to regulate differentiation and apoptosis of GPMs."
https://openalex.org/W4281756492,"Characterizing cerebral contributions to individual variability in pain processing is crucial for personalized pain medicine, but has yet to be done. In the present study, we address this problem by identifying brain regions with high versus low interindividual variability in their relationship with pain. We trained idiographic pain-predictive models with 13 single-trial functional MRI datasets (n = 404, discovery set) and quantified voxel-level importance for individualized pain prediction. With 21 regions identified as important pain predictors, we examined the interindividual variability of local pain-predictive weights in these regions. Higher-order transmodal regions, such as ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, showed larger individual variability, whereas unimodal regions, such as somatomotor cortices, showed more stable pain representations across individuals. We replicated this result in an independent dataset (n = 124). Overall, our study identifies cerebral sources of individual differences in pain processing, providing potential targets for personalized assessment and treatment of pain."

Targeted antibody-based therapy inter alia for PD-1 / PD-L1 axis shows promising results, but whether PD-L1 expression varies between the subentities remains unclear. The expression pattern of PD-L1 (EPR19759 antibody, Abcam, Berlin, Germany) and p16 (CINtech® Histology Kit, Ventana, Oro Valley, USA) was determined immunohistochemically and analyzed by HALO™ Image Analysis Software (Indica Lab, Albuquerque, USA). For PD-L1, combined positivity score (CPS), tumor proportion score (TPS) and histoscore, were assessed and results correlated with epidemiological data. In total, 161 patients (OSCC: n = 78, OPSCC: n = 83) were included. A mean of 43.6% (±34.0%) of the specimen showed increased PD-L1 expression that did not differ quantitatively between subentities (TPS: p = 0.159, CPS: p = 0.078), but qualitatively (histoscore: p = 0.003). In the mean follow-up period (45.6 months), contrary to age (p = 0.006) and advanced T-Status (p = 0.018), PD-L1 expression did not correlate with overall (OS, p = 0.191) and recurrence free survival (RFS: p = 0.193) in both subentities. No correlation of p16 and PD-L1 expression was found (p = 0.844). PD-L1 is differentially expressed between OSCC and OPSCC, however without influence on OS. Furthermore, p16 status was not related to PD-L1 expression. This may have implications for future (immune) therapeutical approaches for oral cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4282052909,"Global survival studies have shown favorable development in most cancers but few studies have considered laryngeal cancer, particularly over extended periods or in populations for which medical care is essentially free of charge. We analyzed laryngeal and lung cancer incidence and survival in Finland (FI) and Sweden (SE) over a 50-year period (1970-2019) using data and statistical tools from the Nordcan database. Laryngeal cancer reached an incidence maximum in FI men in 1965, which in SE men occurred over 10 years later and peaking at 42% of the FI maximum. The FI incidence halved in 20 years while halving of the SE rate took almost twice as long. At maximum the male rate exceeded the female rate 20 times in FI and 10 times in SE. Incidence rates for lung cancer were approximately 10 times higher than those for laryngeal cancer, and they peaked 5 to 10 years after laryngeal cancer in both countries. The female lung cancer rates increased through the follow-up time but laryngeal cancer rates were relatively stable. Relative 1-year survival data for laryngeal cancer remained at around 85% through 50 years, and 5-year survival lagged constantly around 65%. For lung cancer 1-year survival improved and reached about 50% by 2019. Even 5-year survival improved reaching 20 to 30%, except for FI men. Incidence rates for laryngeal and lung cancers have drastically decreased in FI and SE men parallel to reduced smoking prevalence. In females, rates have clearly increased in lung but not in FI laryngeal cancer. This finding warrants further investigations into possible contributing factors, other than smoking. Survival in laryngeal cancer has not improved compared to the positive development in lung cancer. Historical smoking prevalence was unrelated of survival trends. As long-term survival in these cancers remains discouraging, the most efficient way to fight them is to target the main cause and promote non-smoking."
https://openalex.org/W4281382617,"The myosin II motors are ATP-powered force-generating machines driving cardiac and muscle contraction. Myosin II heavy chain isoform-beta (β-MyHC) is primarily expressed in the ventricular myocardium and in slow-twitch muscle fibers, such as M. soleus. M. soleus-derived myosin II (SolM-II) is often used as an alternative to the ventricular β-cardiac myosin (βM-II); however, the direct assessment of biochemical and mechanical features of the native myosins is limited. By employing optical trapping, we examined the mechanochemical properties of native myosins isolated from the rabbit heart ventricle and soleus muscles at the single-molecule level. We found purified motors from the two tissue sources, despite expressing the same MyHC isoform, displayed distinct motile and ATPase kinetic properties. We demonstrate βM-II was approximately threefold faster in the actin filament-gliding assay than SolM-II. The maximum actomyosin (AM) detachment rate derived in single-molecule assays was also approximately threefold higher in βM-II, while the power stroke size and stiffness of the ""AM rigor"" crossbridge for both myosins were comparable. Our analysis revealed a higher AM detachment rate for βM-II, corresponding to the enhanced ADP release rates from the crossbridge, likely responsible for the observed differences in the motility driven by these myosins. Finally, we observed a distinct myosin light chain 1 isoform (MLC1sa) that associates with SolM-II, which might contribute to the observed kinetics differences between βM-II and SolM-II. These results have important implications for the choice of tissue sources and justify prerequisites for the correct myosin heavy and light chains to study cardiomyopathies."

EGF repeats are small protein domains of ∼40 amino acids with a characteristic fold due to the presence of six conserved Cys residues that form three conserved disulfide bonds (C1-C3, C2-C4, and C5-C6). The O-fucose is added in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) to the sequence C2-X-X-X-X-(S/T)-C3 (Fig. 1A) (14Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W.

The O-fucose on selected EGF repeats can then be extended in the Golgi by one of three Fringe GlcNAc-transferases, Lunatic, Manic, or Radical Fringe (LFNG, MFNG, or RFNG), forming a GlcNAcβ1-3Fucose disaccharide (4Kakuda S.

KO of Pofut1 in mice results in embryonic lethality with a Notch signaling defective phenotype (17Shi S. Stanley P.

While LFNG and MFNG both enhance N1 signaling from DLL1 but inhibit signaling from JAG1, RFNG enhances signaling from both (4Kakuda S. Haltiwanger R.S.

Mass spectral analysis of the N1 ECD overexpressed in HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of exogenous Fringes showed that the majority of EGF repeats with the O-fucose consensus sequence are modified with O-fucose at high stoichiometry, but Fringes modify O-fucose only on some of those EGF repeats. In particular, LFNG modified O-fucose on N1 EGF repeats 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 26, 27, 30, 35, and 36; MFNG modified the same N1 EGF repeats except for EGF12; and RFNG modified a subset of these EGF repeats 8, 12, 16, and 26 (4Kakuda S.

Elimination of single O-fucose sites independently by mutagenesis revealed that Fringe modifications on EGF8 and EGF12 (both in the ligand-binding domain), enhance the ability of DLL1 to bind to and activate N1, while LFNG or MFNG modifications at EGF6 and EGF36 (not in the ligand-binding domain) inhibit N1 activation by JAG1 in a dominant fashion (4Kakuda S.

Cell. 2017; 40: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The fact that RFNG did not modify EGF6 or EGF36 when overexpressed in HEK293T cells may provide an explanation for why RFNG does not inhibit activation of N1 by JAG1 in cell-based assays (Fig. 1B).Addition of O-fucose to Notch is directly involved in Notch–ligand interactions. Elimination of O-fucose sites on N1 EGF repeats 8 or 12 reduces N1 binding to Delta and Jagged ligands, as well as reduces N1 activation by these ligands in cell-based assays (4Kakuda S.

N1-DLL4 fragments in a cocrystal provided a molecular explanation for these findings by showing that the O-fucose on N1 EGF12 (Thr466) is in direct contact with DLL4 at the N-terminal module termed MNNL (29Luca V.C.

Modeling of a GlcNAc onto EGF12 O-fucose in the N1-DLL4 X-ray structure suggests enhanced interactions with the DLL4 MNNL domain (29Luca V.C. Jude K.M. Pierce N.W. Nachury M.V. Fischer S. Garcia K.C. Structural biology. Structural basis for Notch1 engagement of Delta-like 4.Science. 2015; 347: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A subsequent N1-JAG1 fragment cocrystal structure showed that the O-fucose residues on both EGF8 and EGF12 were in direct contact with JAG1 (30Luca V.C. Kim B.C. Ge C. Kakuda S. Wu D.

Effects of varying Notch1 signal strength on embryogenesis and vasculogenesis in compound mutant heterozygotes.BMC Dev.

Similarly, eliminating the O-fucose site on EGF12 of Drosophila Notch resulted in embryonic lethality with a neurogenic phenotype, and elimination of O-fucose on EGF8 or EGF12 reduced Fringe-dependent wing vein development (34Pandey A.

Here, for the first time, we sought to analyze the site-specific O-fucose and Fringe modifications on endogenous N1 from a physiologically relevant system. We chose T cells due to the fact that Fringes affect their differentiation in vivo (28Song Y. Kumar V. Wei H.-X. Qiu J. Stanley P. Lunatic, manic, and radical fringe each promote T and B cell development.J.

Kumar V. Wei H.-X. Qiu J. Stanley P. Lunatic, manic, and radical fringe each promote T and B cell development.J. Immunol. 2016; 196: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous site mapping studies using overexpressed N1 ECD, endogenous N1 from activated T cells was modified at many predicted sites with O-fucose. Surprisingly, we did not detect Fringe extension of O-fucose on EGF8 or 12 within the ligand-binding domain of N1 but rather on EGF 6, 16, 26, and 27. Mutation of the O-fucose sites on EGF16 and 27 reduced the ability of Fringe to enhance binding to DLLs using cell-based assays.ResultsA method to evaluate site-specific O-fucose and Fringe modifications of endogenous mouse NOTCH1We previously developed methods to determine Fringe modifications of overexpressed, secreted mouse N1 (mN1) EGF1-36-Myc-His6 coexpressed with or without LFNG, MFNG, or RFNG in HEK293T cells, and purified from conditioned media using nitrilotriacetic acid–agarose chromatography (4Kakuda S. Haltiwanger R.S. Deciphering the fringe-mediated notch code: identification of activating and inhibiting sites allowing discrimination between ligands.Dev. Cell. 2017; 40: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To analyze endogenous N1, we had to identify an antibody that could efficiently immunoprecipitate N1. The antibody also needed to be covalently coupled to magnetic beads so that elution from immunoglobulin G (IgG) did not interfere with downstream mass spectral analysis. Full-length mN1 was expressed in HEK293T cells with or without LFNG, and several commercial anti-N1 antibodies were tested for efficient immunoprecipitation. Fig. S1A shows that a sheep anti-mN1 polyclonal antibody against the ECD of mN1 efficiently immunoprecipitated N1, whether expressed with or without LFNG. N1 eluted from beads was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) as described in Experimental procedures. An extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of the glycoforms of a peptide that includes the O-fucose site in EGF12 showed that mN1 overexpressed without cotransfected Lfng had only the monosaccharide O-fucose modification, while Lfng cotransfection resulted in extension of the O-fucose, generating O-fucose disaccharide and tetrasaccharide glycoforms (Fig. S1B and Table S1). Therefore, immunoprecipitation from cell lysates of full-length mN1, with or without modification by LFNG, could be used to evaluate Fringe modification in T cells using EICs.We tested the method to analyze endogenous mN1 using an immortalized mouse pre-T cell line, preT 2017 (36Spolski R.

Endogenous mN1 in preT 2017 cell lysates was efficiently recovered by immunoprecipitation (Fig. S2A). The purified mN1 was divided into three portions, digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or V8 proteases, and the resulting peptides analyzed by MS, as described in Experimental procedures. All three proteases are required to identify peptides containing all of the O-fucose modification sites in mN1 (4Kakuda S. Haltiwanger R.S. Deciphering the fringe-mediated notch code: identification of activating and inhibiting sites allowing discrimination between ligands.Dev. Cell. 2017; 40: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). mN1 has 20 predicted O-fucose sites, and peptides containing 16 of these sites were identified (Fig. 2A and Table S2). Peptides containing the O-fucose consensus sequence from EGF24, EGF30, EGF31, and EGF32 were not detected (Fig. 2A). Peptide searches showed the O-fucose monosaccharide modification on all of the detected peptides with an O-fucose consensus site, except for EGF18, which was unmodified (Fig. 2A and Table S2). Only EGF16 had an extended O-fucose on a small proportion of O-fucosylated peptides. EICs of peptides from EGF12 and EGF16 showed a small amount of trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide on EGF16 but only O-fucose monosaccharide on EGF12 (Figs. 2B and S10). O-fucosylation at both sites was at high stoichiometry. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of preT 2017 RNA and RNA from activated mouse T cells showed that both expressed equivalent levels of Pofut1, Mfng, and Rfng (Fig. S3). However, activated T cells had relatively more Lfng transcripts than preT 2017 cells (Fig. S3).Figure 2Endogenous N1 from preT 2017 cells was modified by O-fucose at high stoichiometry, but only the EGF16 O-fucose was extended by Fringes.

This peptide is usually modified by an O-fucose monosaccharide and an O-glucose trisaccharide in overexpressed N1 from HEK293T cells, as shown in Fig. S1B (4Kakuda S. Haltiwanger R.S.

However, the EGF12 peptide from preT 2017 cells was poorly modified with an O-glucose monosaccharide (Fig. 2B). O-glucose is added by POGLUT1, and Poglut1 expression is two orders of magnitude lower than Pofut1 expression in preT 2017 cells (Fig. S3). POGLUT1 contributes to N1 trafficking in mammalian cells (39Takeuchi H. Yu H. Hao H. Takeuchi M. Ito A.

However, without the strong support and involvement of local people, it is not easy to achieve the stated goals. This study aimed to understand the local people's perception of the impacts and importance of ecotourism. We conducted a semi-structured interview of 167 respondents from Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal's prime center for ecotourism. The result revealed that more than 70% of respondents are interested in ecotourism activities, and their interests are significantly affected by their age, academic qualification, and occupation. Local people from the study area perceived that infrastructure development and increase in the knowledge base are significant impacts of ecotourism. The study showed that local people's socioeconomic and demographic characteristics significantly influenced their perceived impacts of ecotourism. Detailed understanding and consideration of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics can contribute to effective outreach and planning process, potentially resulting in the higher promotion of ecotourism."
https://openalex.org/W4281680075,"In an effort to gauge the global pandemic's impact on social thoughts and behavior, it is important to answer the following questions: (1) What kinds of topics are individuals and groups vocalizing in relation to the pandemic? (2) Are there any noticeable topic trends and if so how do these topics change over time and in response to major events? In this paper, through the advanced Sequential Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, we identified twelve of the most popular topics present in a Twitter dataset collected over the period spanning April 3rd to April 13th, 2020 in the United States and discussed their growth and changes over time. These topics were both robust, in that they covered specific domains, not simply events, and dynamic, in that they were able to change over time in response to rising trends in our dataset. They spanned politics, healthcare, community, and the economy, and experienced macro-level growth over time, while also exhibiting micro-level changes in topic composition. Our approach differentiated itself in both scale and scope to study the emerging topics concerning COVID-19 at a scale that few works have been able to achieve. We contributed to the cross-sectional field of urban studies and big data. Whereas we are optimistic towards the future, we also understand that this is an unprecedented time that will have lasting impacts on individuals and society at large, impacting not only the economy or geo-politics, but human behavior and psychology. Therefore, in more ways than one, this research is just beginning to scratch the surface of what will be a concerted research effort into studying the history and repercussions of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4281939089,"Inositol phosphate signaling in plants is of substantial agricultural interest, with a considerable focus on the inositol tris/tetrakisphosphate kinase (ITPK) family of inositol phosphate kinases. Historically, the 4–6 isoforms of ITPKs that higher plants each express have been studied for their multiplexing a metabolic pathway to synthesize inositol hexakisphosphate (ie InsP6 or phytate), through the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of multiple inositol phosphates, including Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate). A more recent discovery is ITPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of InsP6 to inositol pyrophosphates, which regulate plant immunity and phosphate homeostasis. However, a molecular-based explanation for these alternate catalytic activities has been missing, because no plant ITPK structure has previously been solved. Herein, we provide biochemical and structural analyses of ITPKs from Zea mays and Glycine max. For this work we introduce a simple, enzyme-coupled microplate-based assay of InsP6 kinase activity that should promote more general access to this important field. Furthermore, a ZmITPK1/InsP6 crystal complex is described at a resolution of 2.6 Å, which identifies a number of catalytically important residues; their functionality is confirmed by mutagenesis. We further demonstrate that ZmITPK1 adds a β-phosphate to the 3-position of Ins(1,2,3,4,5)P5, yielding a candidate signal for regulating phosphate homeostasis. An impactful discovery is our description of a 29-residue catalytic specificity element; by interchanging this element between GmITPK1 and GmITPK2, we demonstrate how its isoform-specific sequence specifically determines whether the host protein phosphorylates InsP6, without substantially affecting Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 metabolism. Our structural rationalization of key catalytic differences between alternate ITPK isoforms will complement future research into their functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4281685133,"Inhibition of gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans, a versatile model organism for studying the genetics of development and aging, is achievable by feeding nematodes with bacteria expressing specific dsRNAs. Overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (hif-1) or heat-shock factor 1 (hsf-1) by conventional transgenesis has previously been shown to promote nematodal longevity. However, it is unclear whether other methods of gene overexpression are feasible, particularly with the advent of CRISPR-based techniques. Here, we show that feeding C. elegans engineered to stably express a Cas9-derived synthetic transcription factor with bacteria expressing promoter-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) also allows activation of gene expression. We demonstrate that CRISPR activation via ingested sgRNAs specific for the respective promoter regions of hif-1 or hsf-1 increases gene expression and extends lifespan of C. elegans. Furthermore, and as an in silico resource for future studies aiming to use CRISPR activation in C. elegans, we provide predicted promoter-specific sgRNA target sequences for >13,000 C. elegans genes with experimentally defined transcription start sites. We anticipate that the approach and components described herein will help to facilitate genome-wide gene overexpression studies, for example, to identify modulators of aging or other phenotypes of interest, by enabling induction of transcription by feeding of sgRNA-expressing bacteria to nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W4281393132,"Bacteria adapt to utilize the nutrients available in their environment through a sophisticated metabolic system composed of highly specialized enzymes. Although these enzymes can metabolize molecules other than those for which they evolved, their efficiency toward promiscuous substrates is considered too low to be of physiological relevance. Herein, we investigated the possibility that these promiscuous enzymes are actually efficient enough at metabolizing secondary substrates to modify the phenotype of the cell. For example, in the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (ADP1), panD (coding for l-aspartate decarboxylase) encodes the only protein known to catalyze the synthesis of β-alanine, an obligate intermediate in CoA synthesis. However, we show that the ADP1 ΔpanD mutant could also form this molecule through an unknown metabolic pathway arising from promiscuous enzymes and grow as efficiently as the wildtype strain. Using metabolomic analyses, we identified 1,3-diaminopropane and 3-aminopropanal as intermediates in this novel pathway. We also conducted activity screening and enzyme kinetics to elucidate candidate enzymes involved in this pathway, including 2,4-diaminobutyrate aminotransferase (Dat) and 2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase (Ddc) and validated this pathway in vivo by analyzing the phenotype of mutant bacterial strains. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that this novel metabolic route is not restricted to ADP1. We propose that the occurrence of conserved genes in hundreds of genomes across many phyla suggests that this previously undescribed pathway is widespread in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W4281636687,"High mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 3 (HMGN3), a member of the HMGN family, modulates the structure of chromatin and regulates transcription through transcription factors. HMGN3 has been implicated in the development of various cancers; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that the high expression of HMGN3 correlated with the metastasis of liver fluke infection-induced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in patients in northeastern Thailand. The knockdown of HMGN3 in CCA cells significantly impaired the oncogenic properties of colony formation, migration, and invasion. HMGN3 inhibited the expression of and blocked the intracellular polarities of epithelial regulator genes, such as the CDH1/E-cadherin and TJAP1 genes in CCA cells. A chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed that HMGN3 required the transcription factor SNAI2 to bind to and repress the expression of epithelial regulator genes, at least in part, due to histone deacetylases (HDACs), the pharmacological inhibition of which reactivated these epithelial regulators in CCA, leading to impairing the cell migration capacity. Therefore, the overexpression of HMGN3 represses the transcription of and blocks the polarities of epithelial regulators in CCA cells in a manner that is dependent on the SNAI2 gene and HDACs."
https://openalex.org/W4281646308,"Epidemiological and animal experimental studies suggest an association between gestational cholestasis and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Here, we explored the mechanism through which gestational cholestasis induced IUGR. To establish gestational cholestasis model, pregnant mice were subcutaneously injected with 17α-Ethynylestradiol (E2) on gestational day 13 (GD13)-GD17. Some pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected with 4μ8C on GD13-GD17. The results found that the apoptosis of trophoblast cells was elevated in placentas of mice with gestational cholestasis and in deoxycholic acid (DCA)-treated human trophoblast cell lines and primary mouse trophoblast cells. Correspondingly, the levels of placental cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were increased, while placental Bcl2 level was decreased in mice with gestational cholestasis and in DCA-treated trophoblast cells. Further analysis found that placental IRE1α pathway was activated in mice with gestational cholestasis and in DCA-treated trophoblast cells. Interestingly, 4μ8C, an IRE1α RNase inhibitor, significantly inhibited caspase-3 activity and apoptosis of trophoblast cells in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, 4μ8C rescued gestational cholestasis-induced placental insufficiency and IUGR. Furthermore, a case-control study demonstrated that placental IRE1α and caspase-3 pathways were activated in cholestasis cases. Our results provide evidence that gestational cholestasis induces placental insufficiency and IUGR may be via triggering IRE1α-mediated apoptosis of placental trophoblast cells."
https://openalex.org/W4281650632,"Data-nulling superimposed pilot (DNSP) effectively alleviates the superimposed interference of superimposed training (ST)-based channel estimation (CE) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, while facing the challenges of the estimation accuracy and computational complexity. By developing the promising solutions of deep learning (DL) in the physical layer of wireless communication, we fuse the DNSP and DL to tackle these challenges in this paper. Nevertheless, due to the changes of wireless scenarios, the model mismatch of DL leads to the performance degradation of CE, and thus faces the issue of network retraining. To address this issue, a lightweight transfer learning (TL) network is further proposed for the DL-based DNSP scheme, and thus structures a TL-based CE in OFDM systems. Specifically, based on the linear receiver, the least squares estimation is first employed to extract the initial features of CE. With the extracted features, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the solutions of DL-based CE and the CE of DNSP. Finally, a lightweight TL network is constructed to address the model mismatch. To this end, a novel CE network for the DNSP scheme in OFDM systems is structured, which improves its estimation accuracy and alleviates the model mismatch. The experimental results show that in all signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions, the proposed method achieves lower normalized mean squared error (NMSE) than the existing DNSP schemes with minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based CE. For example, when the SNR is 0 decibel (dB), the proposed scheme achieves similar NMSE as that of the MMSE-based CE scheme at 20 dB, thereby significantly improving the estimation accuracy of CE. In addition, relative to the existing schemes, the improvement of the proposed scheme presents its robustness against the impacts of parameter variations."
https://openalex.org/W4281734822,"Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). As the sole methyl-donor for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, SAM levels affect gene expression by changing methylation patterns. Expression of MAT2A, the catalytic subunit of isozyme MAT2, is positively correlated with proliferation of cancer cells; however, how MAT2A promotes cell proliferation is largely unknown. Given that the protein synthesis is induced in proliferating cells and that RNA and protein components of translation machinery are methylated, we tested here whether MAT2 and SAM are coupled with protein synthesis. By measuring ongoing protein translation via puromycin labeling, we revealed that MAT2A depletion or chemical inhibition reduced protein synthesis in HeLa and Hepa1 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of MAT2A enhanced protein synthesis, indicating that SAM is limiting under normal culture conditions. In addition, MAT2 inhibition did not accompany reduction in mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activity but nevertheless reduced polysome formation. Polysome-bound RNA sequencing revealed that MAT2 inhibition decreased translation efficiency of some fraction of mRNAs. MAT2A was also found to interact with the proteins involved in rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis; depletion or inhibition of MAT2 reduced 18S rRNA processing. Finally, quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that some translation factors were dynamically methylated in response to the activity of MAT2A. These observations suggest that cells possess an mTOR-independent regulatory mechanism that tunes translation in response to the levels of SAM. Such a system may acclimate cells for survival when SAM synthesis is reduced, whereas it may support proliferation when SAM is sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W4281382264,"Fungal infection has long been a chronic and even life-threatening problem for humans. The demand for new antifungal drugs has increased dramatically as fungal infections have continued to increase, yet no new classes of drugs have been approved for nearly 15 years due to either high toxicity or development of drug resistance. Thus, validating new drug targets, especially fungus-specific targets, may facilitate future drug design. Here, we report the crystal structure of yeast Hos3 (ScHos3), a fungus-specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) that plays an important role in the life span of fungi. As acetylation modifications are important to many aspects of fungal infection, the species specificity of Hos3 makes it an ideal target for the development of new antifungal drugs. In this study, we show that ScHos3 forms a functional homodimer in solution, and key residues for dimerization crucial for its deacetylation activity were identified. We used molecular dynamics simulation and structural comparison with mammalian hHDAC6 to determine unique features of the ScHos3 catalytic core. In addition, a small-molecule inhibitor with a preference for ScHos3 was identified through structure-based virtual screening and in vitro enzymatic assays. The structural information and regulatory interferences of ScHos3 reported here provide new insights for the design of selective inhibitors that target fungal HDAC with high efficiency and low toxicity or that have the potential to overcome the prevailing problem of drug resistance in combination therapy with other drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4281662430,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the factors influencing China’s new retail industry on corporate performance. We mainly design the adjustment effect of the internationalization of its new retail industry on corporate performance and proprietary assets. Design/Methodology/Approach The framework is based on dynamic panel data of 590 listed companies in China’s new retail industry from 2007 to 2019. Findings We apply the concept of big data for the analysis and investigation, including the DOI explanatory variable for the degree of internationalization, Tobin’s Q explained variable, and adjusted variable of proprietary assets (R&amp;D intensity RDI, marketing intensity MI, and capital intensity CI). We found that the degree of internationalization of the new retail industry has a positive impact on corporate performance. Research limitations/implications The resultant findings only reflect the setting of China’s new retail marketplace. With the research model developed here in, future research can target cross-country studies of various forms of online and offline market sites to determine regional differences in the development of new retail activities. Originality/Value The results show that the major new retail industry is a multi-channel concept that affects overall corporate performance. The authors focus on corporate performance, which is a moderating effect based on proprietary assets."
https://openalex.org/W4281711455,"The consideration of individual equivalence provides an essential alternative to average equivalence in two-group comparative studies. A common procedure for declaring individual equivalence adopts the tolerance intervals of the designated proportions of measurement differences. This statistical practice is a direct generalization of the widely used two one-sided tests (TOST) for average equivalence. Such TOST extensions often do not have adequate control of Type I error and result in excessively conservative tests. To signify and resolve the underlying issues of existing methods, this paper presents exact tests for assessing individual equivalence between two treatments under parallel group and crossover designs. Rigorous evaluations are conducted to clarify the discrepancy of critical values and Type I error probabilities between the equivalence procedures. The findings elucidate the shortcoming of the TOST technique and the advantage of the proposed approach. The associated power and sample size calculations are also justified through simulation studies."
https://openalex.org/W4281771442,"The type IIa family of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), including Lar, RPTPσ and RPTPδ, are well-studied in coordinating actin cytoskeletal rearrangements during axon guidance and synaptogenesis. To determine whether this regulation is conserved in other tissues, interdisciplinary approaches were utilized to study Lar-RPTPs in the Drosophila musculature. Here we find that the single fly ortholog, Drosophila Lar (Dlar), is localized to the muscle costamere and that a decrease in Dlar causes aberrant sarcomeric patterning, deficits in larval locomotion, and integrin mislocalization. Sequence analysis uncovered an evolutionarily conserved Lys-Gly-Asp (KGD) signature in the extracellular region of Dlar. Since this tripeptide sequence is similar to the integrin-binding Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, we tested the hypothesis that Dlar directly interacts with integrin proteins. However, structural analyses of the fibronectin type III domains of Dlar and two vertebrate orthologs that include this conserved motif indicate that this KGD tripeptide is not accessible and thus unlikely to mediate physical interactions with integrins. These results, together with the proteomics identification of basement membrane (BM) proteins as potential ligands for type IIa RPTPs, suggest a complex network of protein interactions in the extracellular space that may mediate Lar function and/or signaling in muscle tissue."
https://openalex.org/W4281898179,"Workplace violence in healthcare settings has long been studied in scientific literature, particularly in the nursing profession. Research has explored mostly user violence probably for its high prevalence and impact on health and job satisfaction. Yet this focus may overshadow another dangerous type of workplace violence: coworker violence. Exerted by co-workers with similar status, lateral violence differs from that yielded by a co-worker with a higher rank, known as vertical. This study aims to deepen the knowledge about lateral violence perceived by nurses and its interaction with other variables commonly associated with workplace violence in healthcare: burnout, job satisfaction, and self-perceived health.A random block sampling was performed, prompting a total sample of 925 nursing professionals from 13 public hospitals located in the southeast of Spain. The sample distribution (mean and standard deviation) and the response percentages according to the study variables of the ad-hoc questionnaire were analyzed and classified with cluster analysis.Through the cluster analysis, two subgroups were obtained: Cluster 1, composed of 779 participants, with low scores in the variables used for the classification, high levels of both extrinsic and intrinsic satisfaction, low levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism, and low rates of somatization, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression; and Cluster 2, composed of 115 participants and characterized by moderate-high scores in the variables used for the classification, moderate extrinsic satisfaction, and low intrinsic satisfaction, high emotional exhaustion and cynicism and lower somatization, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression scores. Excluded cases amounted to 31.Nursing professionals who experience lateral violence reveal a lower intrinsic satisfaction, feeling less self-accomplished in their job, and less positive work experience. Emotional exhaustion rises as a concerning progressive and long-term outcome of experiencing this type of violence."

https://openalex.org/W4282037958,"Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a serum biomarker of excretory renal function which consistently correlates with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) across multiple species including rats, dogs, and humans. In human and veterinary clinical settings SDMA demonstrates enhanced sensitivity for detection of declining renal function as compared to other serum biomarkers, but application in preclinical study designs thus far has been limited. The purpose of this study was to determine the performance of serum SDMA in a rat passive Heyman nephritis model of glomerulopathy. In addition to SDMA other biomarkers of excretory renal function were measured including serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and cystatin C along with creatinine clearance. Urinary renal biomarkers including microalbumin (μALB), clusterin (CLU), cystatin C, kidney injury marker-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and osteopontin (OPN) were also measured. PHN was induced using commercial sheep anti-Fx1A serum. Tissue, serum, and urine were collected from groups of control and anti-Fx1A-treated animals for biomarker evaluation, hematology, urinalysis, serum biochemistry, and histologic examination of kidney. Over the course of a 28-day study, concentrations of the urinary biomarkers μALB, CLU, cystatin C, NGAL, KIM-1 and the serum biomarker cystatin C increased significantly in anti-Fx1A-treated rats as compared to controls but no significant increase in serum SDMA, sCr, BUN, or creatinine clearance were noted in anti-Fx1A-treated rats. Given lack of direct GFR measurement or significant change in the renal function biomarkers sCr, BUN, and creatinine clearance, it is unclear if GFR differed significantly between control and anti-Fx1A-treated rats in this study, though urinary biomarkers and histopathologic findings supported renal injury in anti-Fx1A-treated rats over the time course investigated. This study is among the first to investigate serum SDMA in a rat model relevant to preclinical safety assessment and serves to inform future experimental designs and biomarker selection when evaluation of glomerular injury is of priority."
https://openalex.org/W4281396785,"Major depressive disorder is a critical public health problem with a lifetime prevalence of nearly 17% in the United States. One potential therapeutic target is the interaction between hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and an auxiliary subunit of the channel named tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b). HCN channels regulate neuronal excitability in the mammalian hippocampus, and recent work has established that antagonizing HCN function rescues cognitive impairment caused by chronic stress. Here, we utilize a high-throughput virtual screen to find small molecules capable of disrupting the TRIP8b-HCN interaction. We found that the hit compound NUCC-0200590 disrupts the TRIP8b-HCN interaction in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a compelling strategy for developing new small molecules capable of disrupting the TRIP8b-HCN interaction."

https://openalex.org/W4281655311,"Tumor volume is controversially discussed as a prognostic factor in dogs treated with radiation therapy for sinonasal tumors. Dogs' body sizes vary widely and relative rather than absolute tumor volume might provide better prognostic information. Our hypothesis was that relative rather than absolute tumor volume (gross tumor volume, GTV) influences time to progression (TTP) and that a larger tumor volume is correlated with a higher tumor stage. We retrospectively investigated possible correlations of initial GTV to weight, body surface area (BSA), nasal cavity size and the tumor stage in 49 dogs with sinonasal tumors. Here, also presumed sinonasal tumors, esthesioneuroblastomas and histologically benign tumors were included. The possible impact of absolute and relative GTV on response and outcome were assessed according to imaging findings in 34 dogs with available follow-up computed tomographies (CTs) after definitive-intent radiation therapy with either a regular (10x4.2 Gy) or a simultaneously- integrated boost protocol (SIB; GTV boosted to 10x4.83 Gy). In contrast to absolute GTV (p<0.001), the relative GTVs were not correlated with dogs' body sizes. Absolute GTV, GTV relative to weight and BSA were not associated with TTP based on CT imaging. However, GTV relative to nasal cavity showed a prognostic influence with a hazard ratio of 10.97 (95%CI:1.25-96.06). When looking at GTV relative to nasal cavity, stage 3 and 4 tumors were significantly larger than stage 1 and 2 tumors (p = 0.005). Our results suggest that GTV relative to nasal cavity could be prognostic for TTP and a larger tumor volume relative to nasal cavity is correlated with a higher tumor stage."

https://openalex.org/W4281750131,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19-the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2-a pandemic. Since then, the majority of countries-including Spain-have imposed strict restrictions in order to stop the spread of the virus and the collapse of the health systems. People's health care-seeking behavior has exhibited a change, not only in those months when the COVID-19 control measures were strictest, but also in the months that followed. We aimed to examine how the trends in ophthalmological emergencies changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in one of the largest tertiary referral hospitals in Spain. To this end, data from all the patients that attended the ophthalmological emergency department during the pandemic period-March 2020 to February 2021-were retrospectively collected and compared with data from the previous year. Moreover, a comparison between April 2020-when the restrictions were most severe-and April 2019 was made. A total of 90,694 patients were included. As expected, there was a decrease in the number of consultations. There was also a decrease in the frequency of conjunctival pathology consultations. These changes may bring to light not only the use that people make of the emergency department, but also the new trends in ophthalmological conditions derived from the hygienic habits that the COVID-19 pandemic has established."
https://openalex.org/W4281903426,"Background The prevalence of stunting among under- three Indian children though decreased, still it is considered to be alarmingly high. In most of the previous studies, traditional (linear and logistic) regression analyses were applied. They were limited to encapsulated cross-distribution variations. The objective of the current study was to examine how the different determinants were heterogeneous in various percentiles of height for age (HAZ) distribution. Methods and findings This article examined the change in the HAZ distribution of children and examined the relationships between the key co-variate trends and patterns in HAZ among children aged &lt;3 years over a period of 24 years. Four successive rounds of the National Family Health Survey data 1992–93, 1998–99, 2005–06, and 2015–16 were used for analysis. The final study included 206579 children aged &lt;3 years (N = 106136 male, 100443 female). To explain and analyse differences in the HAZ distribution, the lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method was used. Trends in height for age (HAZ) distribution over time were analysed using separate gender-stratified quantile regression (QR). The selected socio-economic, demographic and other predictors were considered for this analysis. The quantile regressions have indicated that mothers who have higher than primary level education were more proactive in mitigating malnutrition among children at the lower end of the distribution. The age, birth order, mother’s body-mass-index (BMI) and economic status, among children, were some more determining factors for HAZ. Results of selected quantile regression were estimated at the 5 th , 10 th , 25 th , 50 th , 75 th , 90 th , and 95 th quantiles. Conclusions The outcome of various covariates working differently across the HAZ distribution was suggested by quantile regression. The major discrepancies in different aspects were underlined by socioeconomic and demographic aspects among the Indian population. The heterogeneity of this effect was shown using quantile regression. Policymakers may choose to concentrate on the most important factors when formulating policies to lessen the prevalence of stunting in India."
