https://openalex.org/W3045910546,"Abstract The human and mouse genomes contain instructions that specify RNAs and proteins and govern the timing, magnitude, and cellular context of their production. To better delineate these elements, phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project has expanded analysis of the cell and tissue repertoires of RNA transcription, chromatin structure and modification, DNA methylation, chromatin looping, and occupancy by transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins. Here we summarize these efforts, which have produced 5,992 new experimental datasets, including systematic determinations across mouse fetal development. All data are available through the ENCODE data portal ( https://www.encodeproject.org ), including phase II ENCODE 1 and Roadmap Epigenomics 2 data. We have developed a registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis -regulatory elements, covering 7.9 and 3.4% of their respective genomes, by integrating selected datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server (SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org ) to provide flexible, user-defined access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes."
https://openalex.org/W3046003662,"Many proteins regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific regions encoded in the genome1. Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs."

https://openalex.org/W3045946041,"The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has established a genomic resource for mammalian development, profiling a diverse panel of mouse tissues at 8 developmental stages from 10.5 days after conception until birth, including transcriptomes, methylomes and chromatin states. Here we systematically examined the state and accessibility of chromatin in the developing mouse fetus. In total we performed 1,128 chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays for histone modifications and 132 assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) assays for chromatin accessibility across 72 distinct tissue-stages. We used integrative analysis to develop a unified set of chromatin state annotations, infer the identities of dynamic enhancers and key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the relationship between chromatin state and accessibility during developmental gene regulation. We also leveraged these data to link enhancers to putative target genes and demonstrate tissue-specific enrichments of sequence variants associated with disease in humans. The mouse ENCODE data sets provide a compendium of resources for biomedical researchers and achieve, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive view of chromatin dynamics during mammalian fetal development to date."
https://openalex.org/W3046196569,"Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3-6. However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor-DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W3045947152,"Quantifying signals and uncertainties in climate models is essential for the detection, attribution, prediction and projection of climate change1-3. Although inter-model agreement is high for large-scale temperature signals, dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation are very uncertain4. This leads to low confidence in regional projections, especially for precipitation, over the coming decades5,6. The chaotic nature of the climate system7-9 may also mean that signal uncertainties are largely irreducible. However, climate projections are difficult to verify until further observations become available. Here we assess retrospective climate model predictions of the past six decades and show that decadal variations in North Atlantic winter climate are highly predictable, despite a lack of agreement between individual model simulations and the poor predictive ability of raw model outputs. Crucially, current models underestimate the predictable signal (the predictable fraction of the total variability) of the North Atlantic Oscillation (the leading mode of variability in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation) by an order of magnitude. Consequently, compared to perfect models, 100 times as many ensemble members are needed in current models to extract this signal, and its effects on the climate are underestimated relative to other factors. To address these limitations, we implement a two-stage post-processing technique. We first adjust the variance of the ensemble-mean North Atlantic Oscillation forecast to match the observed variance of the predictable signal. We then select and use only the ensemble members with a North Atlantic Oscillation sufficiently close to the variance-adjusted ensemble-mean forecast North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach greatly improves decadal predictions of winter climate for Europe and eastern North America. Predictions of Atlantic multidecadal variability are also improved, suggesting that the North Atlantic Oscillation is not driven solely by Atlantic multidecadal variability. Our results highlight the need to understand why the signal-to-noise ratio is too small in current climate models10, and the extent to which correcting this model error would reduce uncertainties in regional climate change projections on timescales beyond a decade."
https://openalex.org/W3103560508,"Models of light–matter interactions in quantum electrodynamics typically invoke the dipole approximation1,2, in which atoms are treated as point-like objects when compared to the wavelength of the electromagnetic modes with which they interact. However, when the ratio between the size of the atom and the mode wavelength is increased, the dipole approximation no longer holds and the atom is referred to as a ‘giant atom’2,3. So far, experimental studies with solid-state devices in the giant-atom regime have been limited to superconducting qubits that couple to short-wavelength surface acoustic waves4–10, probing the properties of the atom at only a single frequency. Here we use an alternative architecture that realizes a giant atom by coupling small atoms to a waveguide at multiple, but well separated, discrete locations. This system enables tunable atom–waveguide couplings with large on–off ratios3 and a coupling spectrum that can be engineered by the design of the device. We also demonstrate decoherence-free interactions between multiple giant atoms that are mediated by the quasi-continuous spectrum of modes in the waveguide—an effect that is not achievable using small atoms11. These features allow qubits in this architecture to switch between protected and emissive configurations in situ while retaining qubit–qubit interactions, opening up possibilities for high-fidelity quantum simulations and non-classical itinerant photon generation12,13. Superconducting giant atoms are realized in a waveguide by coupling small atoms to the waveguide at multiple discrete locations, producing tunable atom–waveguide coupling and enabling decoherence-free interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3045513545,"In the regime of deep strong light–matter coupling, the coupling strength exceeds the transition energies of the material1,2,3, fundamentally changing its properties4,5; for example, the ground state of the system contains virtual photons and the internal electromagnetic field gets redistributed by photon self-interaction1,6. So far, no electronic excitation of a material has shown such strong coupling to free-space photons. Here we show that three-dimensional crystals of plasmonic nanoparticles can realize deep strong coupling under ambient conditions, if the particles are ten times larger than the interparticle gaps. The experimental Rabi frequencies (1.9 to 3.3 electronvolts) of face-centred cubic crystals of gold nanoparticles with diameters between 25 and 60 nanometres exceed their plasmon energy by up to 180 per cent. We show that the continuum of photons and plasmons hybridizes into polaritons that violate the rotating-wave approximation. The coupling leads to a breakdown of the Purcell effect—the increase of radiative damping through light–matter coupling—and increases the radiative polariton lifetime. The results indicate that metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for an entire class of materials with extreme light–matter interaction, which will find application in nonlinear optics, the search for cooperative effects and ground states, polariton chemistry and quantum technology4,5."
https://openalex.org/W3046151504,"Abstract Physical interactions between distal regulatory elements have a key role in regulating gene expression, but the extent to which these interactions vary between cell types and contribute to cell-type-specific gene expression remains unclear. Here, to address these questions as part of phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we mapped cohesin-mediated chromatin loops, using chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and analysed gene expression in 24 diverse human cell types, including core ENCODE cell lines. Twenty-eight per cent of all chromatin loops vary across cell types; these variations modestly correlate with changes in gene expression and are effective at grouping cell types according to their tissue of origin. The connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with housekeeping genes having few contacts, and dosage-sensitive genes being more connected to enhancer elements. This atlas of chromatin loops complements the diverse maps of regulatory architecture that comprise the ENCODE Encyclopedia, and will help to support emerging analyses of genome structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W3045696640,"The Encylopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project launched in 2003 with the long-term goal of developing a comprehensive map of functional elements in the human genome. These included genes, biochemical regions associated with gene regulation (for example, transcription factor binding sites, open chromatin, and histone marks) and transcript isoforms. The marks serve as sites for candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that may serve functional roles in regulating gene expression1. The project has been extended to model organisms, particularly the mouse. In the third phase of ENCODE, nearly a million and more than 300,000 cCRE annotations have been generated for human and mouse, respectively, and these have provided a valuable resource for the scientific community. The authors summarize the history of the ENCODE Project, the achievements of ENCODE 1 and ENCODE 2, and how the new data generated and analysed in ENCODE 3 complement the previous phases."
https://openalex.org/W3045864178,"During mammalian embryogenesis, differential gene expression gradually builds the identity and complexity of each tissue and organ system1. Here we systematically quantified mouse polyA-RNA from day 10.5 of embryonic development to birth, sampling 17 tissues and organs. The resulting developmental transcriptome is globally structured by dynamic cytodifferentiation, body-axis and cell-proliferation gene sets that were further characterized by the transcription factor motif codes of their promoters. We decomposed the tissue-level transcriptome using single-cell RNA-seq (sequencing of RNA reverse transcribed into cDNA) and found that neurogenesis and haematopoiesis dominate at both the gene and cellular levels, jointly accounting for one-third of differential gene expression and more than 40% of identified cell types. By integrating promoter sequence motifs with companion ENCODE epigenomic profiles, we identified a prominent promoter de-repression mechanism in neuronal expression clusters that was attributable to known and novel repressors. Focusing on the developing limb, single-cell RNA data identified 25 candidate cell types that included progenitor and differentiating states with computationally inferred lineage relationships. We extracted cell-type transcription factor networks and complementary sets of candidate enhancer elements by using single-cell RNA-seq to decompose integrative cis-element (IDEAS) models that were derived from whole-tissue epigenome chromatin data. These ENCODE reference data, computed network components and IDEAS chromatin segmentations are companion resources to the matching epigenomic developmental matrix, and are available for researchers to further mine and integrate."
https://openalex.org/W3045747015,"Abstract Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that have key roles in gene regulation 1,2 . Genome-wide occupancy maps of transcriptional regulators are important for understanding gene regulation and its effects on diverse biological processes 3–6 . However, only a minority of the more than 1,600 transcription factors encoded in the human genome has been assayed. Here we present, as part of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, data and analyses from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP–seq) experiments using the human HepG2 cell line for 208 chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs). These comprise 171 transcription factors and 37 transcriptional cofactors and chromatin regulator proteins, and represent nearly one-quarter of CAPs expressed in HepG2 cells. The binding profiles of these CAPs form major groups associated predominantly with promoters or enhancers, or with both. We confirm and expand the current catalogue of DNA sequence motifs for transcription factors, and describe motifs that correspond to other transcription factors that are co-enriched with the primary ChIP target. For example, FOX family motifs are enriched in ChIP–seq peaks of 37 other CAPs. We show that motif content and occupancy patterns can distinguish between promoters and enhancers. This catalogue reveals high-occupancy target regions at which many CAPs associate, although each contains motifs for only a minority of the numerous associated transcription factors. These analyses provide a more complete overview of the gene regulatory networks that define this cell type, and demonstrate the usefulness of the large-scale production efforts of the ENCODE Consortium."
https://openalex.org/W3045703643,"Abstract Cytosine DNA methylation is essential for mammalian development but understanding of its spatiotemporal distribution in the developing embryo remains limited 1,2 . Here, as part of the mouse Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, we profiled 168 methylomes from 12 mouse tissues or organs at 9 developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. We identified 1,808,810 genomic regions that showed variations in CG methylation by comparing the methylomes of different tissues or organs from different developmental stages. These DNA elements predominantly lose CG methylation during fetal development, whereas the trend is reversed after birth. During late stages of fetal development, non-CG methylation accumulated within the bodies of key developmental transcription factor genes, coinciding with their transcriptional repression. Integration of genome-wide DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin accessibility data enabled us to predict 461,141 putative developmental tissue-specific enhancers, the human orthologues of which were enriched for disease-associated genetic variants. These spatiotemporal epigenome maps provide a resource for studies of gene regulation during tissue or organ progression, and a starting point for investigating regulatory elements that are involved in human developmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3046689344,"Obesity and related metabolic disorders are associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, disrupted intestinal barrier, and chronic inflammation. Neohesperidin (Neo), a natural polyphenol abundant in citrus fruits, is known for its preventative and therapeutic effects on numerous diseases. Here, we report that Neo administration attenuates weight gain, low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance in mice fed high-fat diet (HFD). Also, Neo administration substantially restores gut barrier damage, metabolic endotoxemia, and systemic inflammation. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in fecal samples revealed that Neo administration reverses HFD-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis: an increase in the diversity of gut microbiota and alteration in the composition of intestinal microbiota (particularly in the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes). Furthermore, systemic antibiotic treatment abolishes the beneficial effects of Neo in body weight control, suggesting that the effect of Neo on obesity attenuation largely depends on the gut microbiota. More importantly, we demonstrate that the impact of Neo on the regulation of obesity could be transferred from Neo-treated mice to HFD-fed mice via fecal microbiota transplantation. Collectively, our data highlight the efficacy of Neo as a prebiotic agent for attenuating obesity, implying a potential mechanism for gut microbiota mediated the beneficial effect of Neo."
https://openalex.org/W3098411885,"Globular clusters are some of the oldest bound stellar structures observed in the Universe1. They are ubiquitous in large galaxies and are believed to trace intense star-formation events and the hierarchical build-up of structure2,3. Observations of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and a wide variety of other galaxies, have found evidence for a ‘metallicity floor’, whereby no globular clusters are found with chemical (metal) abundances below approximately 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of that of the Sun4–6. The existence of this metallicity floor may reflect a minimum mass and a maximum redshift for surviving globular clusters to form—both critical components for understanding the build-up of mass in the Universe7. Here we report measurements from the Southern Stellar Streams Spectroscopic Survey of the spatially thin, dynamically cold Phoenix stellar stream in the halo of the Milky Way. The properties of the Phoenix stream are consistent with it being the tidally disrupted remains of a globular cluster. However, its metal abundance ([Fe/H] = −2.7) is substantially below the empirical metallicity floor. The Phoenix stream thus represents the debris of the most metal-poor globular clusters discovered so far, and its progenitor is distinct from the present-day globular cluster population in the local Universe. Its existence implies that globular clusters below the metallicity floor have probably existed, but were destroyed during Galactic evolution. The Phoenix stream in the Milky Way halo is shown to be a tidally disrupted remnant of an unusually metal-poor globular cluster, which was possibly destroyed during Galactic evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3046028838,"Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are recommended for the treatment of heart failure and hypertension, mainly due to their natriuretic and anti-fibrotic mode of action. Rodent studies have shown that MRAs can prevent adverse metabolic consequences of obesity but an elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms is missing. Here, we investigated metabolic effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (FIN) in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and the signaling pathways activated by MR antagonism at level of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). C57BL/6J male mice were fed a normal diet or a HFD (with60% kcal from fat) containing or not FIN for 3 months. Metabolic parameters, adipose tissue morphology, gene and protein expression analysis were assessed. We also used brown adipocyte cultures (T37i cells) to investigate the effects of FIN-mediated MR antagonism upon lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. HFD + FIN-treated mice showed improved glucose tolerance together with increased multilocularity and higher expression of thermogenic markers at the level of iBAT, without differences in white adipose depots, suggesting an iBAT-specific effect of FIN. Mechanistically, FIN increased activation of AMP-activated protein kinase which, in turn, stimulated adipose triglyceride lipase activation, with subsequent increased expression of uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3046599782,"Increasing evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating microRNAs (miRs) and mRNAs during breast cancer (BC) progression. Based on the in silico analysis of circRNA/miR/mRNA in BC, we aim to define an important role of circRNA_000554 in BC in relation to miR-182 and zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36). Low expression of circRNA_000554 and ZFP36, and high miR-182 expression were determined in the clinical BC tissues. CircRNA_000554 acted as a sponge of miR-182, and miR-182 directly targeted ZFP36. After that, in order to evaluate the effects of circRNA_000554, miR-182, and ZFP36 on cellular process, we evaluated in vitro epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in vivo tumor growth after delivering a series of overexpression plasmids, mimic, inhibitor, or shRNAs into BC cells. Increasing circRNA_000554 suppressed EMT, cell invasion and migration during BC by depleting miR-182 and increasing ZFP36. The inhibitory effect of circRNA_000554 on tumor growth was validated in vivo. Taken together, the present study confirms that circRNA_000554 functioned as an inhibitor of EMT in BC and suggests a molecular mechanism that circRNA_000554 bound to miR-182 to upregulate ZFP36 in this process."
https://openalex.org/W3045517287,"Hypoxia is a key pathogenetic characteristic of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Klotho has renoprotective effect and its expression is commonly suppressed in CKD patients. We showed that chronic hypoxia in unilateral ureteral obstruction model mice is associated with renal Klotho promoter methylation and expression silencing. Administration of low-dose of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) effectively ameliorated renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the mouse model by demethylating Klotho promoter and restoring its expression. Mechanistically, hypoxia microenvironment in CKD reduced cellular oxygen availability and Fe2+ concentration, and led to impaired activity of ten-eleven translocation (TET), which is critical in maintaining Klotho promoter demethylation status. NaHS treatment greatly improved hypoxia condition, restored TET activity, reversed DNA methylation, and thus, increased Klotho expression. Our results strongly suggested that correcting hypoxia condition to restore TET activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy against CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3045846170,"Circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), widely studied as a disease biomarker, comprises of mtDNA located within mitochondria, indicative of mitochondrial function, and cell-free (cf) mtDNA linked to inflammation. The purpose of this study was to determine the ranges of, and relationship between, cellular and cf mtDNA in human blood. Whole blood from 23 controls (HC) and 20 patients with diabetes was separated into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, and serum. Total DNA was isolated and mtDNA copy numbers were determined using absolute quantification. Cellular mtDNA content in PBMCs was higher than in peripheral blood and a surprisingly high level of cf mtDNA was present in serum and plasma of HC, with no direct relationship between cellular and cf mtDNA content within individuals. Diabetes patients had similar levels of cellular mtDNA compared to healthy participants but a significantly higher cf mtDNA content. Furthermore, only in patients with diabetes, we observed a correlation between whole blood and plasma mtDNA levels, indicating that the relationship between cellular and cf mtDNA content is affected by disease status. In conclusion, when evaluating mtDNA in human blood as a biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction, it is important to measure both cellular and cf mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W3046709137,"Context The increase in the population aging has brought more significant concern about how proper care will be provided to the elderly in the future. Thus, the development of technological solutions for the health domain has gained more prominence. Joining this scenario to the growing use of mobile devices for daily activities, several mobile applications focused on the elderly healthcare have been developed with healthcare and software engineer professionals involved. However, there is no survey to help both professionals to take decisions on the target of application, elderly profile, empirical validation techniques, among others. Thus, the following question arises: how have mobile applications for elderly healthcare been addressed in the literature in the past years? Objective To identify the state of the art in the literature concerned with the development of mobile applications for elderly healthcare, considering healthcare and software Engineering viewpoints. Method We performed a systematic mapping conducted by health and software engineering researchers to provide an interdisciplinary investigation of the papers that address mobile applications for elderly healthcare, summarizing the data collected under the following classification: target of application, older adult profile, spatial-temporal distribution, techniques for empirical validation and type of software engineering research. Results We found a total of 2533 papers and, after applying our eligibility criteria, we got 149. We observed aspects related to the digital health initiative type, using the classification proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the elderly profile prioritized by the application, the spatial-temporal distribution of the studies, the empirical validation type, and the research contribution of each analyzed paper to the software engineering area. Conclusions Regarding the WHO classification, we noticed that two categories were more frequently found, Clients and Data Services, and that none of the mobile apps were classified in the Health System Manager category. The data extraction result also reveals that most of the applications found in the literature focused on the independent elderly. Moreover, we observed that most of the studies were proposals of solutions for elderly health and the validation process of these solutions generally consisted of controlled experiments and usability evaluations. At last, the research focused on mobile applications for elderly healthcare has been performed mostly by developed countries."
https://openalex.org/W3046120867,"Although it is known that zinc has several beneficial roles in the context of gut inflammation, the underlying mechanisms have not been extensively characterized. Zinc (Zn) is known to be the primary physiological inducer of the expression of the metallothionein (MT) superfamily of small stress-responsive proteins. The expression of MTs in various tissues is induced or enhanced (including the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)) by a variety of stimuli, including infection and inflammation. However, the MTs' exact role in inflammation is still subject to debate. In order to establish whether or not MTs are the sole vectors in the Zn-based modulation of intestinal inflammation, we used transcriptomic and metagenomic approaches to assess the potential effect of dietary Zn, the mechanisms underlying the MTs' beneficial effects, and the induction of previously unidentified mediators. We found that the expression of endogenous MTs in the mouse GIT was stimulated by an optimized dietary supplementation with Zn. The protective effects of dietary supplementation with Zn were then evaluated in mouse models of chemically induced colitis. The potential contribution of MTs and other pathways was explored via transcriptomic analyses of the ileum and colon in Zn-treated mice. The microbiota's role was also assessed via fecal 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that high-dose dietary supplementation with Zn induced the expression of MT-encoding genes in the colon of healthy mice. We next demonstrated that the Zn diet significantly protected mice in the two models of induced colitis. When comparing Zn-treated and control mice, various genes were found to be differentially expressed in the colon and the ileum. Finally, we found that Zn supplementation did not modify the overall structure of the fecal microbiota, with the exception of (i) a significant increase in endogenous Clostridiaceae, and (ii) some subtle but specific changes at the family and genus levels. Our results emphasize the beneficial effects of excess dietary Zn on the prevention of colitis and inflammatory events in mouse models. The main underlying mechanisms were driven by the multifaceted roles of MTs and the other potential molecular mediators highlighted by our transcriptomic analyses although we cannot rule out contributions by other factors from the host and/or the microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3047396682,"Developing professional identity is a vital part of health professionals’ education. In Auckland four tertiary institutions have partnered to run an interprofessional simulation training course called Urgent and Immediate Patient Care Week (UIPCW) which is compulsory for Year Five medical, Year Four pharmacy, Year Three paramedicine and Year Three nursing students. We sought to understand student experiences of UIPCW and how those experiences informed student ideas about professional identity and their emergent practice as health professionals within multidisciplinary teams. In 2018, we commenced ethnographic research involving participant observation, field notes, interviews, photography and observational ethnographic film. A total of 115 students participated in this research. The emergent findings concern the potentially transformative learning opportunity presented within high fidelity multi-disciplinary simulations for students to develop their professional identity in relation to peers from other professions. Our work also exposes the heightened anxiety and stress which can be experienced by students in such interdisciplinary simulations. Student experience suggests this is due to a range of factors including students having to perform in front of peers and staff in such simulation scenarios when their own professional identity and capabilities are still in emergent stages. Staff-led simulation debriefs form a critical success factor for transformative learning to be able to occur in any such simulations so that students can reflect on, and move beyond, the emotion and uncertainty of such experiences to develop future-focused concepts of professional identity and strategies to support effective interprofessional teamwork."
https://openalex.org/W3046771566,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) infections affect millions of people worldwide, cause serious mortality and represent a major economic burden. Despite recent successes due to pneumococcal vaccination and antibiotic use, Pneumococcus remains a significant medical problem. Airway epithelial cells, the primary responders to pneumococcal infection, orchestrate an extracellular antimicrobial system consisting of lactoperoxidase (LPO), thiocyanate anion and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). LPO oxidizes thiocyanate using H2O2 into the final product hypothiocyanite that has antimicrobial effects against a wide range of microorganisms. However, hypothiocyanite's effect on Pneumococcus has never been studied. Our aim was to determine whether hypothiocyanite can kill S. pneumoniae. Bactericidal activity was measured in a cell-free in vitro system by determining the number of surviving pneumococci via colony forming units on agar plates, while bacteriostatic activity was assessed by measuring optical density of bacteria in liquid cultures. Our results indicate that hypothiocyanite generated by LPO exerted robust killing of both encapsulated and nonencapsulated pneumococcal strains. Killing of S. pneumoniae by a commercially available hypothiocyanite-generating product was even more pronounced than that achieved with laboratory reagents. Catalase, an H2O2 scavenger, inhibited killing of pneumococcal by hypothiocyanite under all circumstances. Furthermore, the presence of the bacterial capsule or lytA-dependent autolysis had no effect on hypothiocyanite-mediated killing of pneumococci. On the contrary, a pneumococcal mutant deficient in pyruvate oxidase (main bacterial H2O2 source) had enhanced susceptibility to hypothiocyanite compared to its wild-type strain. Overall, results shown here indicate that numerous pneumococcal strains are susceptible to LPO-generated hypothiocyanite."

https://openalex.org/W3046773884,"Objectives To quantify the link between four different types of social ties and objective measures of abdominal and general obesity, and to explore their inter-relationships in association with obesity using a gender-sensitive analysis. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of 28,238 adults (45–85 years) from the baseline Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging Comprehensive cohort (2012–15). Social ties (marital status, living arrangement, social network size, and social participation) and measured anthropometry (body mass index, waist circumference) were analyzed using linear and logistic regression models with interaction terms conditioned on known confounders. Results We found that being single, widowed or divorced/separated was associated with worse anthropometric outcomes in women, including higher odds of both abdominal and general obesity, and that associations were enhanced when combined with limited social participation, lone-living and greater social network size. Few clear associations were observed in men. Limited social participation (no social activities at least once/month) among women was associated with larger waist circumference (+4.19 cm [95% CI: 1.86, 6.52]) and higher odds of both abdominal and general obesity. By contrast, associations appeared to be reversed in men: lone-living and smaller social networks were associated with lower odds of obesity, compared to co-living and larger social networks. We also found that more regular social participation can potentially mitigate the adverse associations between non-partnership (single, divorced) and obesity in women. Overall, the combined influence of two types of social tie deficits on excess weight measures was more pronounced in women than men. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of considering how the role of social ties for obesity prevention may differ for women and men. Frequent social participation and number of social contacts may matter for assessing whether divorced, single or lone-living older women are at risk of obesity while living arrangement and social contacts may matter for obesity in men."
https://openalex.org/W3046889901,"Mammalian cardiomyocytes exit the cell cycle shortly after birth. As a result, an occurrence of coronary occlusion-induced myocardial infarction often results in heart failure, postinfarction LV dilatation, or death, and represents one of the most significant public health morbidities worldwide. Interestingly however, the hearts of neonatal pigs have been shown to regenerate following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) occuring on postnatal day 1 (P1); a recovery period which is accompanied by an increased expression of markers for cell-cycle activity, and suggests that early postnatal myocardial regeneration may be driven in part by the MI-induced proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. In this study, we identified signaling pathways known to regulate the cell cycle, and determined of these, the pathways persistently upregulated in response to MI injury. We identified five pathways (mitogen associated protein kinase [MAPK], Hippo, cyclic [cAMP], Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription [JAK-STAT], and Ras) which were comprehensively upregulated in cardiac tissues collected on day 7 (P7) and/or P28 of the P1 injury hearts. Several of the initiating master regulators (e.g., CSF1/CSF1R, TGFB, and NPPA) and terminal effector molecules (e.g., ATF4, FOS, RELA/B, ITGB2, CCND1/2/3, PIM1, RAF1, MTOR, NKF1B) in these pathways were persistently upregulated at day 7 through day 28, suggesting there exists at least some degree of regenerative activity up to 4 weeks following MI at P1. Our observations provide a list of key regulators to be examined in future studies targeting cell-cycle activity as an avenue for myocardial regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3046400263,"Mature sorghum herbage is known to contain several water-soluble secondary metabolites (allelochemicals). In this study, we investigated quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with allelochemical characteristics in sorghum using linkage mapping and linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based association mapping. A sorghum diversity research set (SDRS) of 107 accessions was used in LD mapping whereas, F2:3 lines derived from a cross between Japanese and African landraces were used in linkage mapping. The QTLs were further confirmed by positional (targeted) association mapping with Q+K model. The inhibitory effect of water-soluble extracts (WSE) was tested on germination and root length of lettuce seedlings in four concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). A Significant range of variations was observed among genotypes in both types of mapping populations (P < 0.05). A total of 181 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) derived from antecedently reported map have been used for genotyping of SDRS. A genetic linkage map of 151 sorghum SSR markers was also developed on 134 F2 individuals. The total map length was 1359.3 cM, with an average distance of 8.2 cM between adjacent markers. LD mapping identified three QTLs for inhibition effect on germination and seven QTLs for root length of lettuce seedlings. Whereas, a total of six QTLs for inhibition of germination and ten QTLs for root length were detected in linkage mapping approach. The percent phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 6.9% to 27.3% in SDRS and 9.9% to 35.6% in F2:3 lines. Regional association analysis identified four QTLs, three of them are common in other methods too. No QTL was identified in the region where major gene for sorgoleone (SOR1) has been cloned previously on chromosome 5."
https://openalex.org/W3046857905,"Background Periodontitis is a multifactorial inflammatory disease of tooth supporting tissues caused by oral biofilms, influenced by environmental and genetic factors, among others. Ethanol consumption has been considered a factor that enhances alveolar bone loss, especially in high doses. The present study aims to investigate the changes promoted by ethanol binge drinking per se or associated with ligature-induced periodontal breakdown on alveolar bone loss. Materials and methods Thirty-two Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control (C), ethanol (3g/kg/day; 3 days On-4 days Off protocol by gavage for 28 days, EtOH), experimental periodontitis (EP) and experimental periodontitis plus ethanol administration (EP+EtOH). On day 14th, periodontitis was induced by ligatures that were placed around the lower first molars. On day 28th, the animals were euthanized and mandibles were submitted to stereomicroscopy for exposed root area analysis and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) for the evaluation of alveolar bone loss and microstructural parameters. Results The results revealed that ligature-induced alveolar bone loss is aggravated by ethanol binge drinking compared to controls (1.06 ± 0.10 vs 0.77 ± 0.04; p<0.0001). In addition, binge drinking per se altered the alveolar bone quality and density demonstrating a reduction in trabecular thickness, trabecular number parameter and bone density percentual. Periodontal disorder plus ethanol binge drinking group also demonstrated reduction of the quality of bone measured by trabecular thickness. Conclusions In conclusion, intense and episodic ethanol intake decreased alveolar bone quality in all microstructural parameters analyzed which may be considered a modifying factor of periodontitis, intensifying the already installed disease."
https://openalex.org/W3046466380,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in low and middle-income countries. Substance use negatively affects TB treatment outcomes. Our recent study has found that khat use predicted poorer adherence to anti-TB medications. However, there is scarce longitudinal study on predictors of khat use among outpatients with TB, and this study aimed at addressing this research gap. Methods From October 2017 to October 2018, 268 outpatients with tuberculosis on DOTs were enrolled in a longitudinal study from 26 health institutions in Southwest Ethiopia. Structured questionnaires translated into local languages (Afaan Oromoo and Amharic) were used to assess khat use. Patients were followed for six months, and data were collected on three occasions during the follow-up. A generalized linear mixed model was used to identify the relation between khat use and predictors. Model fitness was checked using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were used to describe the strength of association between the outcome variable and predictors. Results The overall prevalence of khat use at baseline and first follow up was 39.2% while it was 37.3% at second follow up. Of this, 77.1% and 96.2% of them believed that khat use reduces the side effects of anti-TB medications and symptoms of tuberculosis respectively. In the final model, being male (aOR = 7.0, p-value = 0.001), being government employee (aOR = 0.03, p-value≤0.001) and presence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) (aOR = 2.0, p-value≤0.001) predicted khat use among outpatients with tuberculosis. Conclusion A considerable proportion of patients with TB used khat throughout DOTs and wrongly perceived that it had health benefits. The finding implies that all patients diagnosed with TB should be screened for khat use, and a particular emphasis should be given to males and individuals with a history of alcohol use. Moreover, further studies are needed to assess patients’ beliefs regarding the benefits of khat use so that interventions can be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3045690613,"Glucose is a major energy substrate for the fetus, including liver, heart, and brain metabolism. The umbilical vein (UV) blood flow supplies the fetal liver directly from the placenta, whereas a fraction is shunted via ductus venosus (DV) to the fetal systemic circulation bypassing the fetal liver. We hypothesized UV glucose concentration to be a major regulator of the distribution of glucose supply between the fetal liver and DV, and explored the influence of maternal metabolic status on this distribution. We included 124 healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies, scheduled for elective cesarean section. UV and DV blood flow measurements were performed by Doppler ultrasound immediately before, and blood samples were obtained during surgery. UV blood flow was significantly correlated with DV blood flow, liver blood flow, and the DV shunting fraction, while UV glucose concentration was not. For normal-weight mothers, the maternal-fetal glucose gradient was positively correlated with DV shunting fraction, and negatively with liver blood flow. For the fetuses of the overweight mothers no such correlation was found. This indicates that within the normal physiological range the human fetus makes adaptations of blood flow to ensure individual needs related to the offered maternal energy supply."
https://openalex.org/W3045939142,"Thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (thermoTRPV2) is a nonselective Ca2+ -permeable cation channel broadly expressed, and is implicated in the pathology of diseases such as diabetes and pancreatitis. However, the physiological and pharmacological functions of TRPV2 channels have not been extensively investigated because of the absence of specific modulators. In this study, we report a pair of natural coumarin derivative enantiomers (-)-murraxocin (B304-1) and (+)-murraxocin (B304-2) from Murraya exotica for their selective inhibition of TRPV2 channels expressed in HEK293 cells and native TRPV2 currents in differentiated brown adipocytes. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings confirmed the enantiomers B304-1 and B304-2 could selectively inhibit the agonist mediated activation of TRPV2 current with IC50 values of 22.2 ± 7.8 μM and 3.7 ± 0.7 μM, respectively. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a key residue I600 of TRPV2 critical for the binding of the enantiomers. Furthermore, B304-1 and B304-2 significantly reversed TRPV2 agonist-induced inhibition of mouse brown adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our identification of two natural coumarin enantiomers provides valuable tools and chemical leads for further elucidation of TRPV2 channel function, and pharmacological modulation of thermoTRPV2 in brown adipocytes may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of energy imbalance or metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3046553950,"Obligate symbiosis evolved from free-living individuals most likely via the intermediate stage of facultative symbiosis. However, why should facultative symbionts, who can live independently but also benefit from their partners if these are available, give up this best of both worlds? Using the adaptive dynamics approach, we analyse a simple model, focusing on one partner of the symbiosis, to gain more insight into the selective forces that make individuals forgo the ability to reproduce in the free-living state. Our results suggest that, similar to the parasitism-mutualism continuum, the free-living way of life and obligate symbiosis are two extremes of a continuum of the ability to reproduce independently of a partner. More importantly, facultative symbiosis should be the rule as for many parameter combinations completely giving up independent reproduction or adopting a pure free-living strategy is not so easy. We also show that if host encounter comes at a cost, individuals that put more effort into increasing the chances to meet with their partners are more likely to give up the ability to reproduce independently. Finally, our model does not specify the ecological interactions between hosts and symbionts but we discuss briefly how the ecological nature of an interaction can influence the transition from facultative to obligate symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3046573639,"The injection of laboratory animals with pathogenic microorganisms poses a significant safety risk because of the potential for injury by accidental needlestick. This is especially true for researchers using invertebrate models of disease due to the required precision and accuracy of the injection. The restraint of the greater wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) is often achieved by grasping a larva firmly between finger and thumb. Needle resistant gloves or forceps can be used to reduce the risk of a needlestick but can result in animal injury, a loss of throughput, and inconsistencies in experimental data. Restraint devices are commonly used for the manipulation of small mammals, and in this manuscript, we describe the construction of two devices that can be used to entrap and restrain G. mellonella larvae prior to injection with pathogenic microbes. These devices reduce the manual handling of larvae and provide an engineering control to protect against accidental needlestick injury while maintaining a high rate of injection."
https://openalex.org/W3046803821,"The purpose of this paper was to investigate the effects of risk-taking, exploitation, and exploration on creativity by taking a model-based computational approach to both divergent and convergent thinking as primary ingredients of creativity. We adopted a reinforcement learning framework of Q learning to provide a simple, rigorous account of behavior in the decision-making process and examined the determinants of divergent and convergent thinking. Our findings revealed that risk-taking has positive effects on divergent thinking, but not related to convergent thinking. In particular, divergent thinkers with a high learning capacity were more likely to engage in risk-taking when facing losses than when facing gains. This risk-taking behavior not only contributes to the rapid achievement of learning convergence, but is also associated with high performance in divergent thinking tasks. Conversely, both exploitation and exploration had no significant effects on creativity once these risk attitudes were considered. Moreover, while convergent thinking relied on personality characteristics, it was not associated with risk-taking, exploitation, or exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3046278153,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to reconfirm the association between the risk of fracture and proton pump inhibitor use and to establish evidence for defining a high-risk group of patients among proton pump inhibitor users. Methods A nested case-control study was performed using data from the National Health Insurance Sharing Service database from the period January 2007 to December 2017. The study population included elderly women aged ≥65 years with claims for peptic ulcer or gastro-esophageal reflux disease. The cases were all incidental osteoporotic fractures, and up to two controls were matched to each case by age, osteoporosis, and Charlson comorbidity index. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of 21,754 cases were identified, and 43,508 controls were matched to the cases. The adjusted odds ratio of osteoporotic fractures related to the use of proton pump inhibitors was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.11–1.20). There was a statistically significant interaction between proton pump inhibitor and bisphosphonate use (p<0.01). The risk of fracture in patients using proton pump inhibitors was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.08–1.92) in bisphosphonate users and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03–1.20) in bisphosphonate non-users. Conclusion Concomitant use of bisphosphonates and proton pump inhibitors will likely increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in women aged 65 and over, and caution should be exercised in this high-risk group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3046546183,"Little is known of how hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material onto tropical forest floors influences the soil microbial communities involved in decomposition of these materials. In this study, to identify how soil bacterial and fungal communities might change after a hurricane, and their possible roles in the C and N cycles, soils were collected from five 2000 m2 permanent plots in Lowland, Upland and Riparian primary forests in Costa Rica 3 months before and 7 months after Hurricane Otto damaged the forests. The soil Water, inorganic N and Biomass C increased and total organic C decreased Post-Hurricane, all of which best predicted the changes in the Post-Hurricane soil microbial communities. Post-Hurricane soils from all forest types showed significant changes in community composition of total bacteria, total fungi, and five functional groups of microbes (i.e., degrading/lignin degrading, NH4+-producing, and ammonium oxidizing bacteria, and the complex C degrading/wood rot/lignin degrading and ectomycorrhizal fungi), along with a decrease in richness in genera of all groups. As well, the mean proportion of DNA sequences (MPS) of all five functional groups increased. There were also significant changes in the MPS values of 7 different fungal and 7 different bacterial genera that were part of these functional groups. This is the first evidence that hurricane-induced deposition of canopy material is stimulating changes in the soil microbial communities after the hurricane, involving changes in specific taxonomic and functional group genera, and reduction in the community richness while selecting for dominant genera possibly better suited to process the canopy material. These changes may represent examples of taxonomic switching of functionally redundant microbial genera in response to dramatic changes in resource input. It is possible that differences in these microbial communities and genera may serve as indicators of disturbed and recovering regional soil ecosystems, and should be evaluated in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3046573692,"High myopia and the subsequent degenerative changes of the retina, choroid, and sclera, known as myopic maculopathy (MM), are a serious visual problem in many Asian countries, and are beginning to be so in the south of Europe, especially in the Mediterranean. It is therefore necessary to carry out genetic and environmental studies to determine the possible causes of this disease. This study aims to verify if the genetic factors that have been most related to Asian populations are also associated in two Spanish cohorts. Eight SNPs from six genes (PAX6, SCO2, CCDC102B, BLID, chromosome 15q14, and COL8A1) along with demographic, ophthalmic and environmental factors were analysed in two cohorts from a total of 365 highly myopic subjects and 177 control subjects. The genetic analysis showed that COL8A1 SNP rs13095226 was associated with the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and also seems to play an important role in the increase of axial length. The SNP rs634990 of chromosome 15q14 also showed a significant association with MM, although this was lost after the Bonferroni correction. Additional demographic and environmental factors, namely age, sex, smoking status, and pregnancy history, were also found to be associated with MM and CNV in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3046649035,"Botswana's Okavango Delta is a World Heritage Site and biodiverse wilderness. In 2016-2018, following arrival of the annual flood of rainwater from Angola's highlands, and using continuous oxygen logging, we documented profound aquatic hypoxia that persisted for 3.5 to 5 months in the river channel. Within these periods, dissolved oxygen rarely exceeded 3 mg/L and dropped below 0.5 mg/L for up to two weeks at a time. Although these dissolved oxygen levels are low enough to qualify parts of the Delta as a dead zone, the region is a biodiversity hotspot, raising the question of how fish survive. In association with the hypoxia, histological samples, collected from native Oreochromis andersonii (threespot tilapia), Coptodon rendalli (redbreast tilapia), and Oreochromis macrochir (greenhead tilapia), exhibited widespread hepatic and splenic inflammation with marked granulocyte infiltration, melanomacrophage aggregates, and ceroid and hemosiderin accumulations. It is likely that direct tissue hypoxia and polycythemia-related iron deposition caused this pathology. We propose that Okavango cichlids respond to extended natural hypoxia by increasing erythrocyte production, but with significant health costs. Our findings highlight seasonal hypoxia as an important recurring stressor, which may limit fishery resilience in the Okavango as concurrent human impacts rise. Moreover, they illustrate how fish might respond to hypoxia elsewhere in the world, where dead zones are becoming more common."

https://openalex.org/W3046301846,"Past research has largely ignored children’s ability to conjointly manipulate spatial and temporal information, but there are indications that the capacity to do so may provide important support for reasoning about causal processes. We hypothesised that spatial-temporal thinking is central to children’s ability to identify the invisible mechanisms that tie cause and effect together in continuous casual processes, which are focal in primary school science and crucial to understanding of the natural world. We investigated this in two studies (N = 107, N = 124), employing two methodologies, one shorter, the other more in depth. Further tasks assessed spatial-temporal (flow of liquid, extrapolation of relative speed, distance-time-velocity), spatial (two mental rotation, paper folding), verbal (expressive vocabulary), and nonverbal (block design) ability. Age dependent patterns were detected for both causal and predictor tasks. Two spatial-temporal tasks were unique and central predictors of children’s causal reasoning, especially inference of mechanism. Nonverbal ability predicted the simpler components of causal reasoning. One mental rotation task predicted only young children’s causal thinking. Verbal ability became significant when the sample included children from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Causal reasoning about continuous processes, including inferences of causal mechanism, appears to be within the reach of children from school entry age, but mechanism inference is uncommon. Analytic forms of spatial-temporal capacity seem to be important requirements for children to progress to this rather than merely perceptual forms."
https://openalex.org/W3046628915,"Intelligent systems in nature like the mammalian nervous system benefit from adaptable inputs that can tailor response profiles to their environment that varies in time and space. Study of such plasticity, in all its manifestations, forms a pillar of classical and modern neuroscience. This study is concerned with a novel form of plasticity in the olfactory system referred to as induction. In this process, subjects unable to smell a particular odor, or unable to differentiate similar odors, gain these abilities through mere exposure to the odor(s) over time without the need for attention or feedback (reward or punishment). However, few studies of induction have rigorously documented changes in olfactory threshold for the odor(s) used for “enrichment.” We trained 36 CD-1 mice in an operant-olfactometer (go/no go task) to discriminate a mixture of stereoisomers from a lone stereoisomer using two enantiomeric pairs: limonene and carvone. We also measured each subject’s ability to detect one of the stereoisomers of each odor. In order to assess the effect of odor enrichment on enantiomer discrimination and detection, mice were exposed to both stereoisomers of limonene or carvone for 2 to 12 weeks. Enrichment was effected by adulterating a subject’s food (passive enrichment) with one pair of enantiomers or by exposing a subject to the enantiomers in daily operant discrimination testing (active enrichment). We found that neither form of enrichment altered discrimination nor detection. And this result pertained using either within-subject or between-subject experimental designs. Unexpectedly, our threshold measurements were among the lowest ever recorded for any species, which we attributed to the relatively greater amount of practice (task replication) we allowed our mice compared to other reports. Interestingly, discrimination thresholds were no greater (limonene) or only modestly greater (carvone) from detection thresholds suggesting chiral-specific olfactory receptors determine thresholds for these compounds. The super-sensitivity of mice, shown in this study, to the limonene and carvone enantiomers, compared to the much lesser acuity of humans for these compounds, reported elsewhere, may resolve the mystery of why the former group with four-fold more olfactory receptors have tended, in previous studies, to have similar thresholds to the latter group. Finally, our results are consistent with the conclusion that supervised-perceptual learning i.e. that involving repeated feedback for correct and incorrect decisions, rather than induction, is the form of plasticity that allows animals to fully realize the capabilities of their olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W3046786513,"The affective appraisal of odors is known to depend on their intensity (I), familiarity (F), detection threshold (T), and on the baseline affective state of the observer. However, the exact nature of these relations is still largely unknown. We therefore performed an observer experiment in which participants (N = 52) smelled 40 different odors (varying widely in hedonic valence) and reported the intensity, familiarity and their affective appraisal (valence and arousal: V and A) for each odor. Also, we measured the baseline affective state (valence and arousal: BV and BA) and odor detection threshold of the participants. Analyzing the results for pleasant and unpleasant odors separately, we obtained two models through network analysis. Several relations that have previously been reported in the literature also emerge in both models (the relations between F and I, F and V, I and A; I and V, BV and T). However, there are also relations that do not emerge (between BA and V, BV and I, and T and I) or that appear with a different polarity (the relation between F and A for pleasant odors). Intensity (I) has the largest impact on the affective appraisal of unpleasant odors, while F significantly contributes to the appraisal of pleasant odors. T is only affected by BV and has no effect on other variables. This study is a first step towards an integral study of the affective appraisal of odors through network analysis. Future studies should also include other factors that are known to influence odor appraisal, such as age, gender, personality, and culture."

Several science policy organisations give recommendations on how to structure doctoral education. However, there is little research on to what extent these recommendations find their way into practice. In our study, we first compared European and German recommendations on doctoral education with, second, the institutional regulations of structured doctoral programmes (N = 98) in the life sciences at twelve different German universities. Additionally, we third asked doctoral graduates (N = 1796) of these structured doctoral programmes and graduates of individual doctoral studies about their experience in doctoral education. Fourth, we contrasted the regulations of structured doctoral programmes with the reported experiences of their graduates. We found significant deviations of the reported practices of graduates from the regulations of their organisations, regarding the student admission, supervision and curricular activities of doctoral candidates. The efficacy of structured versus traditional doctoral education should be examined based on reported practice rather than on the respective written regulations."
https://openalex.org/W3046341155,"Fluid overload is common in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (DM and CKD; DMCKD) and can lead to structural and functional cardiac abnormalities including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). Fluid overload represents a crucial step in the pathophysiological pathways to chronic heart failure in patients with end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the impact of fluid overload on cardiac alterations in patients with diabetes and non-dialysis-dependent CKD stage 5 (DMCKD5-ND) without intrinsic heart disease.Bioimpedance spectroscopy, echocardiography, and N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement were performed in 135 consecutive patients on the same day. Patients were divided into groups by tertiles of overhydration/extracellular water (OH/ECW) per bioimpedance spectroscopy.Fluid balance markers including OH/ECW and NT-proBNP were significantly higher in the LVDD+LVH group. OH/ECW and its exacerbation were positively associated with the ratio between early mitral inflow and annular early diastolic velocities (E/e' ratio) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). The prevalence of LVH progressively increased across increasing tertiles of OH/ECW. In multiple regression analyses, OH/ECW as a continuous and categorical variable was independently associated with the E/e' ratio and LVMI after adjustment for multiple confounding factors.Fluid overload was independently associated with LVDD and LVH in patients with DMCKD5-ND. Our study suggests that structural and functional cardiac abnormalities and volume status should be evaluated simultaneously in patients with early-stage DMCKD rather than only DMCKD5-ND, in addition to intensive blood pressure and glycemic control, regardless of evident cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3046755101,"Objective The risk loci for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) consist of extended haplotypes that include functional elements in addition to canonical coding genes. As with most autoimmune diseases, the risk haplotypes for JIA are highly enriched for H3K4me1/H3K27ac histone marks, epigenetic signatures that typically identify poised or active enhancers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that genetic risk for JIA is exerted through altered enhancer-mediated gene regulation. Methods We mined publically available HiC and other chromatin conformation data to determine whether H3K27ac-marked regions in 25 JIA risk loci showed physical evidence of contact with gene promoters. We also used in vitro reporter assays to establish as proof-of-concept the idea that genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with GWAS-identified tag SNPs alter enhancer function. Results All 25 loci examined showed multiple contact sites in the 4 different cell lines that we queried. These regions were characterized by HiC-defined loop structures that included 237 immune-related genes. Using in vitro assays, we found that a 657 bp, H3K4me1/H3K27-marked region within the first intron of IL2RA shows enhancer activity in reporter assays, and this activity is attenuated by SNPs on the IL2RA haplotype that we identified using whole genome sequencing of children with JIA. Similarly, we identified a 1,669 bp sequence in an intergenic region of the IL6R locus where SNPs identified in children with JIA increase enhancer function in reporter assays. Conclusions These studies provide evidence that altered enhancer function contributes to genetic risk in JIA. Further studies to identify the specific target genes of genetically altered enhancers are warranted."

MARCKS supports development, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration after injury. MARCKS binds with its functionally essential effector domain (ED) to polysialic acid. A 25-mer peptide comprising the ED of MARCKS stimulates neuritogenesis of primary hippocampal neurons after addition to the culture. This motivated us to investigate whether ED peptide has similar effects in spinal cord injury. ED peptide supported recovery and regrowth of monoaminergic axons in female, but not in male mice. Sex-specific differences in response to ED peptide application also occurred in cultured neurons. In female but not male neurons, the ED peptide enhanced neurite outgrowth that could be suppressed by inhibitors of the estrogen receptors α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, protein kinase C, and matrix metalloproteinase 2. In addition, we observed female-specific elevation of phosphorylated MARCKS levels after ED peptide treatment. In male neurons, the ED peptide enhanced neuritogenesis in the presence of an androgen receptor inhibitor to the extent seen in ED peptide-treated female neurons. However, inhibition of androgen receptor did not lead to increased phosphorylation of MARCKS. These results provide insights into the functions of a novel compound contributing to gender-dependent regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2952791409,"A minimum cost spanning tree problem analyzes the way to efficiently connect individuals to a source. Hence the question is how to fairly allocate the total cost among these agents. Our approach, reinterpreting the spanning tree cost allocation as a claims problem defines a simple way to allocate the optimal cost with two main criteria: (1) each individual only pays attention to a few connection costs (the total cost of the optimal network and the cost of connecting himself to the source); and (2) an egalitarian criteria is used to share costs. Then, using claims rules, we define an egalitarian solution so that the total cost is allocated as equally as possible. We show that this solutions could propose allocations outside the core, a counter-intuitive fact whenever cooperation is necessary. Then we propose a modification to get a core selection, obtaining in this case an alternative interpretation of the Folk solution."
