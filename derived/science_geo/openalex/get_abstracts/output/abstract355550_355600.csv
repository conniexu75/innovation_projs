https://openalex.org/W2154896031,"Targets for drugs have so far been predicted on the basis of molecular or cellular features, for example, by exploiting similarity in chemical structure or in activity across cell lines. We used phenotypic side-effect similarities to infer whether two drugs share a target. Applied to 746 marketed drugs, a network of 1018 side effect-driven drug-drug relations became apparent, 261 of which are formed by chemically dissimilar drugs from different therapeutic indications. We experimentally tested 20 of these unexpected drug-drug relations and validated 13 implied drug-target relations by in vitro binding assays, of which 11 reveal inhibition constants equal to less than 10 micromolar. Nine of these were tested and confirmed in cell assays, documenting the feasibility of using phenotypic information to infer molecular interactions and hinting at new uses of marketed drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2158778721,"To find inherited causes of autism-spectrum disorders, we studied families in which parents share ancestors, enhancing the role of inherited factors. We mapped several loci, some containing large, inherited, homozygous deletions that are likely mutations. The largest deletions implicated genes, including PCDH10 ( protocadherin 10 ) and DIA1 ( deleted in autism1 , or c3orf58) , whose level of expression changes in response to neuronal activity, a marker of genes involved in synaptic changes that underlie learning. A subset of genes, including NHE9 ( Na + /H + exchanger 9 ), showed additional potential mutations in patients with unrelated parents. Our findings highlight the utility of âhomozygosity mappingâ in heterogeneous disorders like autism but also suggest that defective regulation of gene expression after neural activity may be a mechanism common to seemingly diverse autism mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2125095601,"Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus yields newly born granule cells that receive synaptic inputs from existing neurons. Characterizing morphological and functional features of newborn neurons in adult mice, Toni et al. demonstrate the functional maturation of their synaptic output onto the appropriate target cells in the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb of the mammalian CNS. Recent studies have demonstrated that newborn granule cells of the adult hippocampus are postsynaptic targets of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but evidence of synapse formation by the axons of these cells is still lacking. By combining retroviral expression of green fluorescent protein in adult-born neurons of the mouse dentate gyrus with immuno-electron microscopy, we found output synapses that were formed by labeled terminals on appropriate target cells in the CA3 area and the hilus. Furthermore, retroviral expression of channelrhodopsin-2 allowed us to light-stimulate newborn granule cells and identify postsynaptic target neurons by whole-cell recordings in acute slices. Our structural and functional evidence indicates that axons of adult-born granule cells establish synapses with hilar interneurons, mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells and release glutamate as their main neurotransmitter."

These are planar waveguides with a thin-film organic coating on the face and inorganic solar cells attached to the edges. Light is absorbed by the coating and reemitted into waveguide modes for collection by the solar cells. We report single- and tandem-waveguide organic solar concentrators with quantum efficiencies exceeding 50% and projected power conversion efficiencies as high as 6.8%. The exploitation of near-field energy transfer, solid-state solvation, and phosphorescence enables 10-fold increases in the power obtained from photovoltaic cells, without the need for solar tracking."
https://openalex.org/W2060945380,"The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are a family of anti-apoptotic regulators found in viruses and metazoans. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are recruited to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated complexes where they can regulate receptor-mediated signaling. Both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 have been implicated in TNFalpha-stimulated NF-kappaB activation. However, individual c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 gene knock-outs in mice did not reveal changes in TNF signaling pathways, and the phenotype of a combined deficiency of c-IAPs has yet to be reported. Here we investigate the role of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 in TNFalpha-stimulated activation of NF-kappaB. We demonstrate that TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation is severely diminished in the absence of both c-IAP proteins. In addition, combined absence of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 rendered cells sensitive to TNFalpha-induced cell death. Using cells with genetic ablation of c-IAP1 or cells where the c-IAP proteins were eliminated using IAP antagonists, we show that TNFalpha-induced RIP1 ubiquitination is abrogated in the absence of c-IAPs. Furthermore, we reconstitute the ubiquitination process with purified components in vitro and demonstrate that c-IAP1, in collaboration with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) enzyme UbcH5a, mediates polymerization of Lys-63-linked chains on RIP1. Therefore, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are required for TNFalpha-stimulated RIP1 ubiquitination and NF-kappaB activation."

https://openalex.org/W2014952988,"The methods producing cold molecules from cold atoms tend to leave molecular ensembles with substantial residual internal energy. For instance, cesium molecules initially formed via photoassociation of cold cesium atoms are in several vibrational levels ν of the electronic ground state. We applied a broadband femtosecond laser that redistributes the vibrational population in the ground state via a few electronic excitation/spontaneous emission cycles. The laser pulses are shaped to remove the excitation frequency band of the ν = 0 level, preventing re-excitation from that state. We observed a fast and efficient accumulation (∼70% of the initially detected molecules) in the lowest vibrational level, ν = 0, of the singlet electronic state. The validity of this incoherent depopulation pumping method is very general and opens exciting prospects for laser cooling and manipulation of molecules."

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in alert macaques, we identified three discrete regions of highly face-selective cortex in ventral prefrontal cortex, one of which was strongly lateralized to the right hemisphere. These prefrontal face patches may constitute dedicated modules for retrieving and responding to facial information."
https://openalex.org/W2053070706,"DARPP-32 is a dual-function protein kinase/phosphatase inhibitor that is involved in striatal signaling. The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at threonine 34 is essential for mediating the effects of both psychostimulant and antipsychotic drugs; however, these drugs are known to have opposing behavioral and clinical effects. We hypothesized that these drugs exert differential effects on striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, which comprise distinct output pathways of the basal ganglia. To directly test this idea, we developed bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that allowed the analysis of DARPP-32 phosphorylation selectively in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons. Using this new methodology, we found that cocaine, a psychostimulant, and haloperidol, a sedation-producing antipsychotic, exert differential effects on DARPP-32 phosphorylation in the two neuronal populations that can explain their opposing behavioral effects. Furthermore, we found that a variety of drugs that target the striatum have cell type-specific effects that previous methods were not able to discern."
https://openalex.org/W1969658400,"The bacterium Proteus mirabilis is capable of movement on solid surfaces by a type of motility called swarming. Boundaries form between swarming colonies of different P. mirabilis strains but not between colonies of a single strain. A fundamental requirement for boundary formation is the ability to discriminate between self and nonself. We have isolated mutants that form boundaries with their parent. The mutations map within a six-gene locus that we term ids for identification of self. Five of the genes in the ids locus are required for recognition of the parent strain as self. Three of the ids genes are interchangeable between strains, and two encode specific molecular identifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2022976733,"The crystal structure of the high-affinity Escherichia coli MetNI methionine uptake transporter, a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family, has been solved to 3.7 angstrom resolution. The overall architecture of MetNI reveals two copies of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) MetN in complex with two copies of the transmembrane domain MetI, with the transporter adopting an inward-facing conformation exhibiting widely separated nucleotide binding domains. Each MetI subunit is organized around a core of five transmembrane helices that correspond to a subset of the helices observed in the larger membrane-spanning subunits of the molybdate (ModBC) and maltose (MalFGK) ABC transporters. In addition to the conserved nucleotide binding domain of the ABC family, MetN contains a carboxyl-terminal extension with a ferredoxin-like fold previously assigned to a conserved family of regulatory ligand-binding domains. These domains separate the nucleotide binding domains and would interfere with their association required for ATP binding and hydrolysis. Methionine binds to the dimerized carboxyl-terminal domain and is shown to inhibit ATPase activity. These observations are consistent with an allosteric regulatory mechanism operating at the level of transport activity, where increased intracellular levels of the transported ligand stabilize an inward-facing, ATPase-inactive state of MetNI to inhibit further ligand translocation into the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2082194420,"The positions of Laurentia and other landmasses in the Precambrian supercontinent of Rodinia are controversial. Although geological and isotopic data support an East Antarctic fit with western Laurentia, alternative reconstructions favor the juxtaposition of Australia, Siberia, or South China. New geologic, age, and isotopic data provide a positive test of the juxtaposition with East Antarctica: Neodymium isotopes of Neoproterozoic rift-margin strata are similar; hafnium isotopes of ∼1.4-billion-year-old Antarctic-margin detrital zircons match those in Laurentian granites of similar age; and a glacial clast of A-type granite has a uraniun-lead zircon age of ∼1440 million years, an epsilon-hafnium initial value of +7, and an epsilon-neodymium initial value of +4. These tracers indicate the presence of granites in East Antarctica having the same age, geochemical properties, and isotopic signatures as the distinctive granites in Laurentia."
https://openalex.org/W2005159276,"In the vasculature, nitric oxide (NO) is generated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent reaction. With oxidative stress, the critical cofactor BH(4) is depleted, and NADPH oxidation is uncoupled from NO generation, leading to production of (O(2)*). Although phosphorylation of eNOS regulates in vivo NO generation, the effects of phosphorylation on eNOS coupling and O(2)* generation are unknown. Therefore, we phosphorylated recombinant BH(4)-free eNOS in vitro using native kinases and determined O(2)* generation using EPR spin trapping. Phosphorylation of Ser-1177 by Akt led to an increase (>50%) in maximal O(2)* generation from eNOS. Moreover, Ser-1177 phosphorylation greatly altered the Ca(2+) sensitivity of eNOS, such that O(2)* generation became largely Ca(2+)-independent. In contrast, phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-495 by protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) had no effect on maximum activity or calcium sensitivity but decreased calmodulin binding and increased association with caveolin. In endothelial cells, eNOS-dependent O(2)* generation was stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor that induced phosphorylation of Ser-1177. With PKC activation that led to phosphorylation of Thr-495, no inhibition of O(2)* generation occurred. As such, phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 is pivotal in the direct regulation of O(2)* and NO generation, altering both the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the enzyme and rate of product formation, whereas phosphorylation of Thr-495 indirectly affects this process through regulation of the calmodulin and caveolin interaction. Thus, Akt-mediated phosphorylation modulates eNOS uncoupling and greatly increases O(2)* generation from the enzyme at low Ca(2+) concentrations, and PKCalpha-mediated phosphorylation alters the sensitivity of the enzyme to other negative regulatory signals."
https://openalex.org/W1992578464,"Several membrane channels, like aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the RhAG protein of the rhesus complex, were hypothesized to be of physiological relevance for CO(2) transport. However, the underlying assumption that the lipid matrix imposes a significant barrier to CO(2) diffusion was never confirmed experimentally. Here we have monitored transmembrane CO(2) flux (J(CO2)) by imposing a CO(2) concentration gradient across planar lipid bilayers and detecting the resulting small pH shift in the immediate membrane vicinity. An analytical model, which accounts for the presence of both carbonic anhydrase and buffer molecules, was fitted to the experimental pH profiles using inverse problems techniques. At pH 7.4, the model revealed that J(CO2) was entirely rate-limited by near-membrane unstirred layers (USL), which act as diffusional barriers in series with the membrane. Membrane tightening by sphingomyelin and cholesterol did not alter J(CO2) confirming that membrane resistance was comparatively small. In contrast, a pH-induced shift of the CO(2) hydration-dehydration equilibrium resulted in a relative membrane contribution of about 15% to the total resistance (pH 9.6). Under these conditions, a membrane CO(2) permeability (3.2 +/- 1.6 cm/s) was estimated. It indicates that cellular CO(2) uptake (pH 7.4) is always USL-limited, because the USL size always exceeds 1 mum. Consequently, facilitation of CO(2) transport by AQP1, RhAG, or any other protein is highly unlikely. The conclusion was confirmed by the observation that CO(2) permeability of epithelial cell monolayers was always the same whether AQP1 was overexpressed in both the apical and basolateral membranes or not."

https://openalex.org/W2074531905,"Snow slab avalanches are believed to begin by the gravity-driven shear failure of weak layers in stratified snow. The critical crack length for shear crack propagation along such layers should increase without bound as the slope decreases. However, recent experiments show that the critical length of artificially introduced cracks remains constant or, if anything, slightly decreases with decreasing slope. This surprising observation can be understood in terms of volumetric collapse of the weak layer during failure, resulting in the formation and propagation of mixed-mode anticracks, which are driven simultaneously by slope-parallel and slope-normal components of gravity. Such fractures may propagate even if crack-face friction impedes downhill sliding of the snowpack, indicating a scenario in which two separate conditions have to be met for slab avalanche release."
https://openalex.org/W2021234912,"Accumulation of indigestible lipofuscin and decreased mitochondrial energy production are characteristic age-related changes of post-mitotic retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the human eye. To test whether these two forms of age-related impairment have interdependent effects, we quantified the ATP-dependent phagocytic function of RPE cells loaded or not with the lipofuscin component A2E and inhibiting or not mitochondrial ATP synthesis either pharmacologically or genetically. We found that physiological levels of lysosomal A2E reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of RPE cells. Furthermore, in media with physiological concentrations of glucose or pyruvate, A2E significantly inhibited phagocytosis. Antioxidants reversed these effects of A2E, suggesting that A2E damage is mediated by oxidative processes. Because mitochondrial mutations accumulate with aging, we generated novel genetic cellular models of RPE carrying mitochondrial DNA point mutations causing either moderate or severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Exploring these mutant RPE cells we found that, by itself, only the severe but not the moderate OXPHOS defect reduces phagocytosis. However, sub-toxic levels of lysosomal A2E are sufficient to reduce phagocytic activity of RPE with moderate OXPHOS defect and cause cell death of RPE with severe OXPHOS defect. Taken together, RPE cells rely on OXPHOS for phagocytosis when the carbon energy source is limited. Our results demonstrate that A2E accumulation exacerbates the effects of moderate mitochondrial dysfunction. They suggest that synergy of sub-toxic lysosomal and mitochondrial changes in RPE cells with age may cause RPE dysfunction that is known to contribute to human retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2041339830,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that signals in response to extracellular calcium and regulates parathyroid hormone secretion. The CaR is also expressed on normal mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), where it has been shown to inhibit secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and participate in the regulation of calcium and bone metabolism during lactation. In contrast to normal breast cells, the CaR has been reported to stimulate PTHrP production by breast cancer cells. In this study, we confirmed that the CaR inhibits PTHrP production by MMECs but stimulates PTHrP production by Comma-D cells (immortalized murine mammary cells) and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We found that changes in intracellular cAMP, but not phospholipase C or MAPK signaling, correlated with the opposing effects of the CaR on PTHrP production. Pharmacologic stimulation of cAMP accumulation increased PTHrP production by normal and transformed breast cells. Inhibition of protein kinase A activity mimicked the effects of CaR activation on inhibiting PTHrP secretion by MMECs and blocked the effects of the CaR on stimulating PTHrP production in Comma-D and MCF-7 cells. We found that the CaR coupled to Galphai in MMECs but coupled to Galphas in Comma-D and MCF-7 cells. Thus, the opposing effects of the CaR on PTHrP production are because of alternate G-protein coupling of the receptor in normal versus transformed breast cells. Because PTHrP contributes to hypercalcemia and bone metastases, switching of G-protein usage by the CaR may contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2057552543,"Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, is activated at inflammatory sites by proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular N terminus by trypsin-like enzymes, exposing a tethered, receptor-activating ligand.

PAR2 contributes to inflammation through activation of NF-κB-regulated genes; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown.

In general, PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4 are targeted by thrombin; PAR2 responds to trypsin and trypsin-like serine proteases, including mast cell tryptase, tissue kallikreins, and coagulation factors VIIa and Xa. These serine proteases cleave PARs irreversibly at a specific site in the extracellular N terminus to expose a tethered “neo-ligand” that, in turn, binds intramolecularly to PARs to trigger receptor autoactivation. Synthetic peptides that correspond to the sequences of the tethered neo-ligands can also activate uncleaved PARs (except in the case of PAR3) and serve as valuable experimental tools to study the consequence of PAR activation in the absence of exogenous proteases. To date, it has been widely reported that the activation of PARs by serine proteases contributes to normal physiology as well as to various pathophysiological states, including autoimmunity, cancer, tissue injury and repair, infection, and inflammation (reviewed in Refs. 3Macfarlane S.R.

The house dust mite allergens, Der p3 and Der p9 serine proteases, also induce pro-inflammatory responses in human airway epithelial cells via PAR2 activation (19Sun G. Stacey M.A. Schmidt M. Mori L.

Thus, PAR2 is involved in the innate immune response at anatomic sites that interact with protease-rich environments, such as the gut lumen and respiratory tract. Consequently, several microbes evade PAR2-mediated immune surveillance by directly disabling the receptor. For example, proteases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21Dulon S. Leduc D. Cottrell G.S. D'Alayer J. Hansen K.K. Bunnett N.W. Hollenberg M.D. Pidard D. Chignard M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important sentinels of the innate immune response through their ability to respond to PAMPs (e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS), double-stranded RNA, flagellin, and unmethylated CpG DNA) (reviewed in Refs. 14Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6107) Google Scholar, 22Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6625) Google Scholar). TLRs are germ line-encoded, evolutionarily conserved type I transmembrane glycoproteins and represent a family of closely related PRRs that respond to many different microbial PAMPs. More recently, TLRs have also been implicated in the response to endogenous molecules released by damaged cells or chemical substances generated during tissue injury or highly inflammatory processes (reviewed in Refs. 23Rifkin I.R. Leadbetter E.A. Busconi L. Viglianti G. Marshak-Rothstein A. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 204: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Mollen K.P. Anand R.J. Tsung A. Prince J.M. Levy R.M.

In particular, TLR4 responds not only to bacterial LPS but also to an array of other exogenous and endogenous agonists, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus F protein, chlamydial heat-shock protein 60, fibrinogen, surfactant protein A, murine β-defensin 2, and the serine protease elastase (reviewed in Refs. 24Mollen K.P.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To date, 10 functional murine and 9 functional human TLRs have been identified. Direct or indirect interaction of TLR ectodomains with cognate ligands results in receptor oligomerization leading to conformational changes within intra-cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor resistance (TIR) domains that create docking platforms for the recruitment of TIR-containing adapter proteins and downstream kinases (22Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6625) Google Scholar). TLR4 is the only known TLR that is capable of recruiting all four adapter proteins (i.e. myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TIR domain-containing adapter protein/MyD88-adapter-like (TIRAP/Mal), TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF), and TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM)) through TIR-TIR interactions. TLR4 engagement by its prototype agonist, LPS, results in the activation of two major signaling pathways, i.e. “MyD88-dependent” and “MyD88-independent” (reviewed in Refs. 22Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6625) Google Scholar, 31Doyle S.L. O'Neill L.A. Biochem.

Activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway results predominantly in the “early” nuclear translocation of NF-κB that is required for expression of most pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. In contrast, the MyD88-independent pathway activates a “delayed” NF-κB response, as well as rapid activation of another key transcription factor, IRF-3, that up-regulates transcription of IRF-3-responsive genes, e.g. RANTES and IFN-β. Inflammation caused by C. rodentium infection has been reported to depend on both TLR4 (33Khan M.A. Ma C. Knodler L.A. Valdez Y. Rosenberger C.M. Deng W. Finlay B.B. Vallance B.A. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 2522-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and PAR2 (16Hansen K.K. Sherman P.M. Cellars L. Andrade-Gordon P. Pan Z. Baruch A. Wallace J.L. Hollenberg M.D. Vergnolle N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8363-8368Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Given that PAR2 has been recently associated with several infectious and noninfectious models leading to inflammation (reviewed in Refs. 4Ramachandran R. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J.

Mucosal Immunol. 2008; 1: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PAR2 might interact with TLR4, perhaps at the level of cross-talk between signaling pathways. Indeed, several studies have investigated the possible connection between PAR2- and TLR4-mediated signaling pathways. For example, concurrent activation of PAR2 and TLR4 by PAR2 AP and LPS, respectively, amplifies NF-κB activation and IL-6 production in endothelial cells (37Chi L. Li Y. Stehno-Bittel L. Gao J. Morrison D.C. Stechschulte D.J. Dileepan K.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inflammatory response induced by Aspergillus infection involves TLR4-mediated suppression of PAR2 signaling (36Moretti S. Bellocchio S. Bonifazi P. Bozza S. Zelante T. Bistoni F. Romani L. Mucosal Immunol. 2008; 1: 156-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, signaling cross-talk between PAR2 and TLR4 has the potential to augment or mitigate an ongoing inflammatory response when both receptors are accessible. In this study, we demonstrate PAR2 activation by its AP, as measured by ELAM (NF-κB)- or RANTES (IRF-3)-reporter activation and IL-8 secretion, in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. PAR2-induced NF-κB activation by AP was MyD88-independent but TRIF- and TRAM-dependent. Moreover, a synergistic response to PAR2 AP was observed when PAR2 was co-expressed with the TLR4 receptor complex (TLR4/MD-2/CD14), despite the fact that AP exhibited no TLR4 activity. The observed synergy was fully MyD88-dependent. These results suggest that PAR2 and TLR4 interact functionally at the level of intracellular adapter utilization for the activation of NF-κB. Co-immunoprecipitation of PAR2 and TLR4 in HEK293T transfectants was observed only in the presence of AP. In contrast to wild-type macrophages, macrophages derived from TLR4–/– mice responded poorly to PAR2 AP to elicit IL-1β mRNA, and conversely, PAR –/–2 macrophages exhibited a significant down-regulation of iNOS gene expression induced by LPS. The colonic epithelial cell line, SW620, responded synergistically to AP and LPS, further supporting the conclusion that functional synergy also occurs in nontransfected cells. Collectively, these data support a novel model of heterophilic receptor interaction between TLR4 and PAR2 that centers on shared utilization of TLR adapter proteins, leading to enhanced NF-κB activation upon PAR2 engagement. The findings in this study also imply a previously under-appreciated role of PARs as an additional level of the innate immune defense, apart from classical pattern-recognition receptors.

In addition, we observed that glycosylation of HMW1 is essential for HMW1 tethering to the bacterial surface, a prerequisite for HMW1-mediated adherence to host epithelium. In this study, we examined HMW1 proteolytic fragments by mass spectrometry, achieved 89% amino acid sequence coverage, and identified 31 novel modification sites. All of the modified sites were asparagine residues, in all but one case in the conventional consensus sequence of N-linked glycans, viz. NX(S/T). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis using a hybrid linear quadrupole ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometer, accurate mass measurements, and deuterium exchange studies established that the modifying glycan structures were mono- or dihexoses rather than the N-acetylated chitobiosyl core that is characteristic of N-glycosylation.

Until recently, glycosylation of proteins was believed to be limited to eukaryotes. However, glycoproteins are now being recognized increasingly in prokaryotes as well, including a variety of pathogenic bacteria. Examples of bacterial glycoproteins include the flagellins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli; the type IV pili of P. aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis; and non-pilus adhesins in Chlamydia trachomatis, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and diffusely adhering E. coli (1Brimer C.

Nonencapsulated (nontypeable) strains of Haemophilus influenzae are a common cause of human respiratory tract disease and initiate infection by colonizing the upper respiratory tract. Approximately 75–80% of isolates express two related high molecular weight proteins called HMW1 and HMW2 that promote efficient adherence to respiratory epithelial cells and facilitate the process of colonization (10St. Geme III, J.W.

Immun. 1998; 66: 364-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins are encoded by highly homologous chromosomal loci that appear to represent a gene duplication event and contain three genes, designated hmw1A, hmw1B, and hmw1C and hmw2A, hmw2B, and hmw2C, respectively (12Barenkamp S.J.

Following translocation across the outer membrane, the mature HMW1 and HMW2 proteins remain noncovalently associated with the bacterial surface, with small amounts released into the culture supernatant (15Grass S.

Further analysis revealed that glycosylation of HMW1 appears to protect against premature degradation, analogous to some eukaryotic proteins. In addition, glycosylation appears to influence HMW1 tethering to the bacterial surface, a prerequisite for HMW1-mediated adherence. Based on composition analysis, HMW1 carbohydrate modification includes glucose, galactose, and possibly mannose and corresponds to ∼7–8 kDa of the molecular mass. In this study, we analyzed HMW1 glycosylation using MALDI-MS/MS 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-MS/MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometryLCliquid chromatographyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-MS/MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometryLCliquid chromatographyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. and nano-LC-linear quadrupole ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron MS of endoprotease digests. We obtained 89% sequence coverage of HMW1 and found 31 asparagine residues that were modified with either one or two hexose molecules, including 30 modification sites within sequons that are required for protein N-glycosylation in plant and mammalian cells. The unusual linkage of hexose molecules at asparagine residues suggests that HMW1 glycosylation requires a unique glycosyltransferase with a novel activity. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometry liquid chromatography 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem mass spectrometry liquid chromatography 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography. Protein Purification—The H. influenzae HMW1 protein was purified from a derivative of strain 12 that lacks expression of HMW2. HMW1 was extracted from the bacterial surface as described previously (20Barenkamp S.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was then injected onto a Source 15S column in 20 mm MES (pH 6.0). Following elution with an NaCl gradient, fractions containing HMW1 were pooled and then injected onto a butyl 14FF-Sepharose column in 700 mm NH4SO4 and 20 mm MES (pH 6.0). HMW1 was eluted with 400–500 mm NH4SO4 and consolidated for further analysis. Peptide N-Glycosidase F Treatment of HMW1—A 25-μg aliquot of purified HMW1 was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with or without 2 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (Glyko, San Leandro, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and samples were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Fetuin (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Protease Digestion of HMW1—A 1-μg aliquot of purified HMW1 was precipitated using a 2D Clean Up kit (GE Healthcare). Tryptic Digest—The precipitated sample was solubilized in 40 μl of 2 m urea and 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and subsequently incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μg of trypsin (Sigma). Glu-C Digest—The precipitated sample was solubilized in 1 m urea, 100 mm Tris 8.5, and 5% acetonitrile and incubated overnight at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μg of Glu-C (Roche Applied Science). Lys-C Digest—The precipitated sample was solubilized in 8 m urea and 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μg of Lys-C (Roche Applied Science). Trypsin/Glu-C Double Digest—20 μl of the tryptic digest was transferred to a new tube containing 2 μl of acetonitrile, 18 μl of deionized water, and 1 μg of Glu-C and then incubated overnight at 30 °C. All digestions were acidified to 5% formic acid, and desalted peptides were prepared using a NuTip carbon tip (Glygen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peptides were eluted from the tip using 10 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid, and samples were then dried and redissolved in 1% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid for MS analysis. Mass Spectrometry—The nano-LC-linear quadrupole trap Fourier transform instrument used for these experiments was described in detail elsewhere (21King J.B. Gross J. Lovly C.M. Rohrs H. Piwnica-Worms H. Townsend R.R. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22King J.B. Gross J. Lovly C.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Townsend R.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 21: 3443-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). MS was performed using a linear ion trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (LTQ-FTMS, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The instrument was equipped with a PicoView nanocapillary source (New Objective, Woburn, MA) and was hooked up to a one-dimensional Proteomics Plus NanoLC system (Eksigent, Livermore, CA). The source voltage was set to 2200 V with a capillary voltage of 43 V and a capillary temperature of 200 °C, and the tube lens was 105 V. Fourier Transform Parameters—The MS mass range was 250–2000 m/z. We employed one full microscan and a full maximum ion time of 1000 ms. Ion Trap—We used seven MSn microscans in parallel with the full Fourier transform microscan with an MSn maximum ion time of 100 ms. Autosampler and Liquid Chromatography—A spark autosampler (Endurance, Spark, Plainsboro, NJ) with a 10-μl loop was used for all sample injections. The solvent system consisted of 0.3% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient employed showed an increase of 2% solvent B/min at a flow rate of 200 nl/min, a starting point of 5% solvent B, and a run time of 60 min. The injected sample amount was 5 μl. A C18 PicoFrit column (peptide II from New Objective) with a column length of 10 cm and an inner diameter of 75 μm was employed for all experiments. MALDI-MS/MS—All MALDI experiments were performed on the 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). MS spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode using the reflectron. The mass range was set to m/z 800–4000 with a focus mass of 1650 Da. 1000 spectra were summed up for each MS spectrum with a set laser energy of 4250 (arbitrary unit). The detection multiplier was set to 1.0 kV, and the final detector voltage was 2.0 kV. The MS/MS spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode using the metastable suppressor. The parent ion selector was set to ±11 Da. 12,500 individual laser shots were summed up for each MS/MS spectrum with the laser energy set to 5450 (arbitrary unit). The detector multiplier was set to 1.0 kV, and the final detector voltage was 2.225 kV. Deuterium Replacement Experiment—The deuterium replacement experiments were performed as described previously using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the MALDI matrix (23Gross J. Leisner A. Hillenkamp F. Hahner S. Karas M. Schäfer J. Lützenkirchen F. Nordhoff E. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Gross J. Hillenkamp F. Wan K.X. Gross M.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Analysis of Carbohydrate Composition—To determine the identity of the modifying sugar, a representative tryptic glycopeptide was purified by HPLC using a C18 separation column and was then analyzed for monosaccharide composition by preparing the trimethylsilyl derivative of the methyl glycoside and performing combined gas chromatography-MS analysis as described previously (12Barenkamp S.J. St. Geme III, J.W. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis was performed at the University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (Athens, GA). HMW1 Peptides Contain a 162-Da Modification—As a first step toward defining the nature of HMW1 glycosylation, we incubated purified HMW1 with peptide N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that releases asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F resulted in a significant decrease in the apparent molecular mass of fetuin as assessed by SDS-PAGE, consistent with deglycosylation. In contrast, there was no effect on the apparent molecular mass of HMW1, suggesting O-linkage or an unusual N-linkage of the HMW1 carbohydrate. As a second step, we digested purified HMW1 with trypsin and then analyzed the resulting peptide fragments by LC-MS/MS. Initially, we used the NCBI nr data base and MASCOT software (Matrix Science, San Jose) and allowed for variable modifications of Met residues (oxidation) and all Ser and Thr residues with HexNAc. Using this approach, we found no carbohydrate modifications. However, when we examined the LC-MS/MS results manually, we identified a number of peptides that shared the HMW1 sequence but had a mass 162 Da greater than the calculated mass for the unmodified peptide. As an example, the peptide INITK has a measured mass of the doubly charged peptide of 375.7162 Da, whereas the expected mass of the doubly charged unmodified peptide is 294.6897 Da, consistent with a modification of 162.0532 Da (supplemental Fig. 2). To calculate the chemical formula for modification of 162.0532 Da, we used Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), setting the mass tolerance at 3 ppm and considering the elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. The molecular formulas that agreed with the observed mass ±3 ppm included C6H10O5 (2 ppm) and C5H4N7 (2 ppm). However, C5H4N7 is not a likely chemical formula, leaving C6H10O5, a hexose. Consistent with this conclusion, simulation of the isotopic distribution of peptide INITK modified by a single hexose using IsoPro 3.0 software revealed a good match with the experimentally determined isotopic distribution (supplemental Fig. 2). To determine the identity of the modifying hexose, we purified the NVTNNNITSHK glycopeptide by HPLC and performed carbohydrate composition analysis by combined gas chromatography-MS. Consistent with our previous examination of mature HMW1 (19Grass S. Buscher A.Z. Swords W.E. Apicella M.A. Barenkamp S.J. Ozchlewski N. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 737-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), this analysis revealed the presence of glucose (supplemental Fig. 3). At this point, it is difficult to know whether the glucose peak represents the modifying hexose or contaminating sugar. The 162-Da Modifications of HMW1 are N-Linked at Consensus Sites—To identify the modification sites in HMW1, we examined the tryptic digests by MS/MS. As shown in Fig. 1, the MS/MS spectrum of peptide INITK was dominated by the neutral loss of modification of both the precursor ion and the fragment ions. [M - 162 + 2H]2+ and [M - 162 + H]+ were particularly prominent. Neutral loss of the modification site could also be observed for the fragment ions b2 (b2 - 162) and y4 (y4 - 162). However, the presence of ions b2 and y4 carrying the modification allowed identification of the modification site as the asparagine residue. Interestingly, this residue is part of the consensus sequence that is required for protein N-linked glycosylation, viz. NX(S/T), with X being any amino acid except proline and with the amino acid at position 3 being either serine or threonine. As summarized in Table 1, analysis of the MS/MS spectrum of each of the other modified tryptic peptides also revealed glycosylation of an asparagine residue at a consensus sequence. The only exception was peptide DTTFNVER, which contains a hexose linked to the asparagine at position 5 (NVE).TABLE 1Analysis of the MS/MS spectrum of each of the modified tryptic peptidesSequencePositionNo. of hexosesFragment ionsCalculated m/zPDNVSINAETAGRAsn4440, 1b3, y11753.3575TTLTNTTLESILKAsn4841, 2y9, y9798.9326 + 879.9590GTFVNITANQRAsn4971, 2y7, y7691.8492 + 772.8756GANLTIYSGGWVDVHKAsn5461b3, y14939.9652NISLGAQGNINITAKAsn560, Asn5701, 1b2, y5919.4731FNNVSLNGTGSGLQFTTKAsn605, Asn6091, 1b3, y121105.029FNNVSLNGTGSGLQFTTKAsn605, Asn6091, 2(b4), y121186.0554FEGTLNISGKAsn6361, 2(b6), y5, y5614.3080 + 695.3352VNISMVLPKAsn6421, 2b2, y8, y8581.8230 + 662.8494YFNVSTGSSLRAsn7731, 2b3, y9, (b3), y9696.8357 + 777.8621DTTFNVERAsn7091b5, y4572.2619DLTLNATGGNITLLQVEGTDGMIGKAsn801, Asn8061, 1y16, y211428.2075DLTLNATGGNITLLQVEGTDGMIGKAsn801, Asn8061, 2y161590.2604KNITFEGGNITFGSRAsn828, Asn8351, 1b9, y14982.976KNITFEGGNITFGSRAsn828, Asn8351, 2b9, y7, y141064.0024AITNFTFNVGGLFDNKAsn9121, 2(y14, b5), (b5, more b ions)960.4729 + 1041.4993GNSNISIAKAsn9281y6533.2748NLSITTNSSSTYRAsn9521, 2b7, y7, b7, y7803.3838 + 884.4102NLSITTNSSSTYRAsn946, Asn9521, 2b2, y7965.44TIISGNITNKAsn9641, 2b6, y5, b6, y5611.8299 + 692.8563NGDLNITNEGSDTEMQIGGDVSQKAsn9731b61342.5956EGNLTISSDKAsn9950, 1b3, y8613.2933INITKAsn10041b2, y4375.7158AGVDGENSDSDATNNANLTIKAsn10291, 2b17, y5, y51134.5091 + 1215.5355LTQDLNISGFNKAsn10441, 2b6, y7, y7756.3830 + 837.4094NVTVNNNITSHKAsn11310, 1, 2y6, y6751.8759 + 832.9023ITTKTGTTINATTGNVEAsn11561, 2y8, b10, y8942.4758 + 1023.5023AANVTLNTTGTLTTVKAsn1348, Asn13521, 1(b3), b4, y142+, y152+, y10964.9992GSNINATSGTLVINAKAsn13662y12942.4758This table lists all peptides with identified modification sites.

The table also lists the observed fragments ions that allow the localization of the modification The N-Linked 162-Da Modifications of HMW1 Are Hexose Units—Typically, carbohydrates linked to asparagine residues are N-acetylated. Accordingly, to confirm that the 162-Da modification in HMW1 is truly a hexose unit, we focused on peptide NVTVNNNITSHK and attempted to exchange all active protons for deuterons, performing MALDI-MS and MS/MS analysis before and after deuteration. All together, there are 32 exchangeable protons available in peptide NVTVNNNITSHK: four in the N-terminal asparagine, one in each of the valines, two in each of the threonines, three in each of the other asparagines, one in the isoleucine, two in the serine, two in the histidine, four in the C-terminal lysine, and four in the putative hexose modification (highlighted in Fig. 2A). One proton needs to be added for the positive charge, and one proton needs to be subtracted for the linkage of the hexose to asparagine residues. As shown in Fig. 2B, 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF analysis of the deuterated peptide compared with the native peptide demonstrated a mass shift of 32 Da, exactly as predicted. The decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of the mass spectrum after deuteration can be explained by sample loss due to the repetitive redissolvation of the MALDI matrix/analyte mixture on the MALDI target with deuterium oxide to ensure a deuteration yield in excess of 98%. To verify that the signal with m/z 1534.87 was indeed the modified peptide of interest, we performed MS/MS analysis of both the native sample and the deuterated sample. As shown in Fig. 3, this analysis confirmed that the deuterated peptide was NVTVNNNITSHK. Of note, the MS/MS spectrum of the deuterated species again had a lower signal-to-noise ratio caused by the repeated redissolvation of the MALDI preparation in deuterium oxide. The modification site in this peptide was the asparagine residue at position 7, in an N-linked consensus sequence, as is evident from the sequence ions, y6 and b7. Furthermore, examination of the neutral loss of the modification from the parent ion revealed a loss of 165 Da and a further loss of 20 Da. The further loss of 20 Da is due to water loss (D2O) from the C terminus. Thus, the number of protons that were exchanged with deuterons is in agreement with the proposed presence of a hexose in the modified peptide NVTVNNNITSHK. Some Glycan Units in HMW1 Are Dihexoses—In an effort to assess the entire HMW1 sequence, we digested purified HMW1 with Lys-C, Glu-C, or both trypsin and Glu-C and then analyzed the resulting peptide fragments by LC-MS/MS. Examination of these digests in combination with the tryptic digest identified peptides accounting for ∼89% of the HMW1 sequence and revealed 31 modification sites. In considering the total carbohydrate modification of HMW1, we wondered whether there might be peptides with multiple sites of modification or with multiple hexose units at a single site. To address this possibility, we examined peptide fragments for 324-, 486-, and 648-Da modifications and found several additional peptides. As an example, we found that peptide TTLTNTTLESILK contains two hexose moieties at the Asn, within an N-linked consensus sequence (Fig. 4). In an effort to confirm Asn modification in this dihexosylated peptide, we compared the MS/MS spectrum of the modified peptide (Fig. 4A) with the MS3 spectrum on a fragment ion that had undergone neutral loss of 162 Da (Fig. 4B) and the MS3 spectrum on a fragment that had undergone neutral loss of 2 × 162 Da (Fig. 4C). Fragment ions unique to one MSn spectrum were ions with the modification. All together, the 31 modification sites carry 47 hexose units. In this study, we established that the H. influenzae HMW1 adhesin is glycosylated at multiple asparagines, in all but one case within the well recognized consensus sequence for N-linked glycans, viz. NX(S/T). Interestingly, the modifying carbohydrates at these sites are hexose or dihexose sugars rather than N-acetylated sugars, revealing an unusual carbohydrate modification and suggesting a glycosyltransferase with a novel enzymatic activity capable of transferring hexose moieties to asparagine residues. Upon initiating MS analysis of HMW1 peptide fragments with the intent to identify glycosylation sites, we encountered two unexpected results. First, we were unable to detect oxonium ions (m/z 163 and m/z 204), the traditional approach used to identify glycopeptides. Second, we found that the hexose units in the glycosylated peptides were very labile under MS conditions, especially in peptides with multiple glycosylation sites. To circumvent these challenges, we performed MS3 experiments driven by the neutral loss of 81 Da (one hexose, doubly charged ion) and 162 Da (two hexoses, doubly charged ion, or one hexose, singly charged ion). Comparing the MSn spectra of peptides carrying a decreasing number of hexoses, we were able to detect fragment ions that were unique and contained the modification site. Combining this technique with the creation of the custom modification of hexose/hexoses bound to asparagine for MASCOT Database searches, we found 47 hexose units. In considering glycoproteins in general, two types of glycosylation exist, defined on the basis of the glycan linkage. In particular, carbohydrate modifications are either O- or N-linked. O-Linkage occurs at the hydroxyl oxygen on the side chain of a serine or threonine residue (or rarely a tyrosine residue), whereas N-linkage occurs at the amide nitrogen on the side chain of an asparagine residue. O-Linked carbohydrates are either hexose or N-acetylated amino sugars. In contrast, in all cases in eukaryotes and with rare exceptions in prokaryotes, N-linked carbohydrates contain N-acetylated sugars (25Kupcu Z. Marz L. Messner P. Sletyr U.B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Messner P. Sletyr U.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the glycosylation of HMW1 is distinctly unusual, consisting of N-linked hexose units at asparagine residues. It will be especially intriguing to identify the glycosyltransferase responsible for this novel modification. It is interesting that all but one of the glycosylated asparagine residues in HMW1 reside in a consensus sequon, flanked by any amino acid except proline and then either threonine or serine (NX(S/T)). In the case of the exception, the glycosylated asparagine is flanked by a valine and then a glutamic acid, representing a new glycosylation sequon. In future studies, we will examine whether the same glycosylation machinery is involved in modifying this site. In a recent study, Kowarik et al. (27Kowarik M. Young N.M. Numao S. Schulz B.L. Hug I. Callewaert N. Mills D.C. Watson D.C. Hernandez M. Kelly J.F. Wacker M. Aebi M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) reported that the sequon for N-glycosylation of the C. jejuni AcrA glycoprotein by the PglB oligosaccharyltransferase is (D/E)YNX(S/T), corresponding to the consensus sequon with an N-terminal extension. Review of the modification sites in HMW1 reveals no example of modification at the (D/E)YNX(S/T) sequon. Furthermore, there is significant variability in the residues N- and C-terminal to the NX(S/T) sequon at modification sites in HMW1, arguing against a clear consensus extension. In earlier work (19Grass S. Buscher A.Z. Swords W.E. Apicella M.A. Barenkamp S.J. Ozchlewski N. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 737-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we found that insertional inactivation of either the hmw1C or pgmB gene resulted in elimination of HMW1 glycosylation and a decrease in quantity of HMW1 and tethering of HMW1 to the bacterial surface, dramatically reducing HMW1-mediated adherence. In this context, it is interesting that HMW1 glycosylation involves modification with 47 hexose units at 31 different sites in the protein, roughly accounting for the change in molecular mass associated with HMW1C function. At this point, it remains unclear whether HMW1 stability and tethering to the bacterial surface require modification at all of these sites or at only a subset. As a corollary, it is unclear whether modification at some sites is required for HMW1 stability and modification at other sites is required for HMW1 tethering to the bacterial surface. The HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins were first identified based on their role as major targets of the serum antibody response during acute infection. With this information in mind, Barenkamp (20Barenkamp S.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) examined the utility of these proteins as potential vaccine antigens. In studies using the chinchilla acute otitis media model, he observed that immunization with purified HMW1 resulted in partial protection against middle ear infection with H. influenzae. In ongoing work, we are comparing the immunogenicity and protective effect of glycosylated and nonglycosylated HMW1. In summary, we have established that glycosylation of the H. influenzae HMW1 adhesin involves an unusual carbohydrate modification and presumably requires a glycosyltransferase with a novel enzymatic activity. We anticipate that further characterization of HMW1 glycosylation will provide important insights into glycoproteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W1990750894,"Epigenetic control of liver proliferation involves cooperation between transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling proteins. In this work, we found that the levels of HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) are increased in quiescent livers of old mice. The elevation of HDAC1 in liver is mediated by the RNA-binding protein CUGBP1. We found that the age-associated CUGBP1-eIF2 complex binds to the 5' region of HDAC1 mRNA and increases translation of HDAC1 in the liver. Further analyses showed that CUGBP1 also increases expression of HDAC1 in cultured cells, in the livers of CUGBP1 transgenic mice, and in the livers of mice injected with cyclin D3, which enhances the formation of the CUGBP1-eIF2 complex. In livers of old mice, HDAC1 interacts with the transcription factor C/EBPalpha and is recruited by this protein to E2F-dependent promoters as a component of high M(r) C/EBPalpha-Brm complexes. The recruitment of HDAC1 to c-Myc and FoxM1B promoters leads to deacetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 on these E2F-dependent promoters. We show that HDAC1 is an important mediator of growth-inhibitory activity of C/EBPalpha and that small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of HDAC1 reduces the ability of C/EBPalpha to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, we have found that both elevation of HDAC1 and interaction of C/EBPalpha with HDAC1 are controlled by cyclin D3-dependent mechanisms. Treatment of old mice with growth hormone, which reduces cyclin D3 levels, leads to the reduction of the CUGBP1-eIF2 complex, normalization of HDAC1 levels, and inhibition of interactions of HDAC1 with C/EBPalpha-Brm complexes. Thus, our data demonstrate that translational elevation of HDAC1 in livers of old mice is involved in the assembly of high M(r) protein-protein complexes that inhibit liver proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1996410160,"Many cytosolic proteins are recruited to the plasma membrane (PM) during cell signaling and other cellular processes. Recent reports have indicated that phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) that are present in the PM play important roles for their specific PM recruitment. To systematically analyze how these lipids mediate PM targeting of cellular proteins, we performed biophysical, computational, and cell studies of the Ca2+-dependent C2 domain of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) that is known to bind PS and phosphoinositides. In vitro membrane binding measurements by surface plasmon resonance analysis show that PKCα-C2 nonspecifically binds phosphoinositides, including PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but that PS and Ca2+ binding is prerequisite for productive phosphoinositide binding. PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 augments the Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding of PKCα-C2 by slowing its membrane dissociation. Molecular dynamics simulations also support that Ca2+-dependent PS binding is essential for membrane interactions of PKCα-C2. PtdIns(4,5)P2 alone cannot drive the membrane attachment of the domain but further stabilizes the Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding. When the fluorescence protein-tagged PKCα-C2 was expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, mutations of phosphoinositide-binding residues or depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from PM did not significantly affect the PM association of the domain but accelerated its dissociation from PM. Also, local synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the PM slowed membrane dissociation of PKCα-C2. Collectively, these studies show that PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 augment the Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding of PKCα-C2 by elongating the membrane residence of the domain but cannot drive the PM recruitment of PKCα-C2. These studies also suggest that effective PM recruitment of many cellular proteins may require synergistic actions of PS and phosphoinositides.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 alone cannot drive the membrane attachment of the domain but further stabilizes the Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding. When the fluorescence protein-tagged PKCα-C2 was expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, mutations of phosphoinositide-binding residues or depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from PM did not significantly affect the PM association of the domain but accelerated its dissociation from PM. Also, local synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the PM slowed membrane dissociation of PKCα-C2. Collectively, these studies show that PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 augment the Ca2+- and PS-dependent membrane binding of PKCα-C2 by elongating the membrane residence of the domain but cannot drive the PM recruitment of PKCα-C2. These studies also suggest that effective PM recruitment of many cellular proteins may require synergistic actions of PS and phosphoinositides. One of the hallmarks of cell signaling proteins is their reversible recruitment to the plasma membrane (PM) 5The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membraneBtkBruton tyrosine kinaseCBLcalcium binding loopCF-InpCFP-FK505-binding protein-Inp54pCF-iSHCFP-FKBP-PtdInsP 3-kinase p85 subunitCF-PIPKCFP-FKBP-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinaseCFPcyan fluorescence proteinLyn11-FRBLyn11-rapamycin-binding proteinMDmolecular dynamicsPAprincipal axisPHpleckstrin homologyPtdInsPphosphoinositidePtdIns(4,5)P2phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphatePtdIns(3,4,5)P3phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphatePLCphospholipase CPOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePOPI1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositolPOPS1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserineRFPred fluorescence proteinPSphosphatidylserineSPRsurface plasmon resonanceInp54pinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatasePKCprotein kinase C. in response to receptor activation (1Teruel M.N.

Although some of these proteins are known to translocate to the PM through protein-protein interactions, a large number of proteins are recruited to the PM by directly interacting with lipids present in the PM (4Cho W. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : pe7Google Scholar). The inner leaflet of the PM of mammalian cells is known to be rich in anionic phospholipids, PS (about 20 mol %) (5Vance J.E. Steenbergen R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and inositol phospholipids, including PtdIns(4,5)P2 (about 1 mol %) (6Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R.

A series of in vitro membrane binding and cellular translocation studies of various proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC) (9Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), have indicated that PS-selective proteins are targeted to the PM through direct interactions with PS in the PM. More recently, two independent studies have tried to determine the relative contribution of PS and phosphoinositides (PtdInsPs) to specific PM targeting of cytosolic proteins by means of elegant lipid depletion and sensing methods; however, these studies have produced conflicting results. On one hand, Heo et al. (12Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) reported that the PM targeting of small G proteins with polybasic clusters requires the presence of both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and that the interaction with PS does not provide a driving force for their membrane targeting. On the other hand, Yeung et al. (13Yeung T. Gilbert G.E. Shi J. Silvius J. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Science. 2008; 319: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) reported that PS binding is important for PM targeting of cytosolic proteins with polybasic motifs, including small G proteins. It has been reported that monovalent PS and multivalent PtdInsPs can generate distinct electrostatic fields (7McLaughlin S. Murray D. Nature. 2005; 438: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). However, there is little mechanistic information as to how differently PS and PtdInsPs contribute to the PM targeting of cytosolic proteins. The present study was designed to provide such mechanistic insight through extensive computational, biophysical, and cell studies of the C2 domain of PKCα that has been reported to bind both PS (11Stahelin R.V.

C2 (protein kinase C conserved 2) domains are small (about 120 amino acids) modular lipid-binding domains that have been identified in various signaling and membrane trafficking proteins, including PKCs (19Cho W.

High-resolution crystal structures determined for the isolated C2 domains of various proteins have shown that the domains have a common fold of 8-stranded anti-parallel β-sandwich connected by variable loops. Many C2 domains bind to the membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner via the three calcium-binding loops (CBL) that are located at one end of the β-sandwich (see Fig. 2B). Ca2+ binding can drive the association of different C2 domains to different membranes (23Murray D. Honig B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Also, most C2 domains contain a cationic patch in the concave face of the β-sandwich, known as the β-groove, which may interact with anionic lipids (22Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2B). The PKCα C2 domain is known to bind two Ca2+ ions and a PS molecule in its CBLs (see Fig. 2, A and B) (14Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that Ca2+ and PS are necessary and sufficient for specific targeting of PKCα-C2 to the PM (11Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have suggested that binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to the cationic β-groove of PKCα-C2 is critical for the PM translocation (15Sanchez-Bautista S. Marin-Vicente C. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Evans J.H. Murray D. Leslie C.C. Falke J.J. Mol. Biol.

Because PKCα-C2 is a prototype PS-specific protein that is recruited to the PM, these findings challenge the notion that PS binding can drive the PM targeting of cellular proteins. This controversy as well as a wealth of structural and functional information make PKCα-C2 an excellent model to systematically investigate the differential roles of PS and PtdInsPs in the PM targeting of cellular proteins. In this study, we performed in vitro membrane binding and cellular translocation measurements as well as atomistic level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of PKCα-C2 and mutants under various conditions. Results from these studies provide new insight into the differential roles of PS, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in membrane targeting of this C2 domain, which also bears implication for the PM targeting of other C2 domains and other lipid-binding domains and proteins. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoinositol (POPI), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All PtdInsPs were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). Lyn11-rapamycin-binding protein (FRB) (Lyn11-FRB), cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)-FK505-binding protein (FKBP)-Inp54p (CF-Inp), CFP-FKBP-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (CF-PIPK), CFP-FKBP-PtdInsP 3-kinase p85 subunit (CF-iSH), and yellow fluorescence protein-phospholipase Cδ-pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (YFP-PLCδ1-PH) constructs were generous gifts of Dr. Tobias Meyer. The mKate-C vector was a generous gift of Dr. Akihiro Kusumi. Rapamycin and LY294002 (PtdInsP 3-kinase Inhibitor) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Ionomycin was from Invitrogen. PKCα-C2 domain and its N189A and K209A/K211A mutants were prepared as described (11Stahelin R.V. Rafter J.D. Das S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12452-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These genes were subcloned between EcoRI and KpnI sites of either the mKate-C or the mCerulean-C1 vector to yield C2 domains with a C-terminal red fluorescence protein (RFP) tag or CFP, respectively. The fluorescence protein-tagged PH domain constructs of phospholipase C (PLC) δ and Btk were prepared as described (24Manna D. Albanese A. Park W.S. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32093-32105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recombinant PKCα-C2 proteins with C-terminal His6 tags were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (25Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements of the PKCα C2 Domain—All SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C using a lipid-coated L1 chip in the BIACORE X system as described previously (26Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the sensor chip surface with the running buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl), POPC/POPE/PtdInsP (77:20:3) and POPC/POPE (80:20) vesicles were injected at 5 μl/min to the active surface and the control surface, respectively, to give the same resonance unit values. The level of lipid coating for both surfaces was kept at the minimum that is necessary for preventing the nonspecific adsorption to the sensor chips. This low surface coverage minimized the mass transport effect and kept the total protein concentration (P0) above the total concentration of protein binding sites on vesicles (M0) (27Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The control surface was also coated with 40 μl of bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml in the running buffer) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min before the injection of C2 domains to minimize nonspecific adsorption of C2 domains to the control surface. All SPR measurements were done at the flow rate of 5 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the R values of the association phase to reach near-equilibrium values (Req) (5Vance J.E. Steenbergen R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). After sensorgrams were obtained for 5 or more different concentrations of each protein within a 10-fold range of Kd, each of the sensorgrams was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it. Assuming a Langmuir-type binding between the protein (P) and protein binding sites (M) on vesicles (i.e. P + M ↔ PM) (27Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), Req values were then plotted versus P0, and the Kd value was determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis of the binding isotherm using equation, Req = Rmax/(1 + Kd/P0) (27Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each data set was repeated three or more times to calculate average and standard deviation values. For kinetic SPR measurements, the flow rate was maintained at 30 μl/min for both association and dissociation phases. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH-3T3 cells were seeded into 8 wells of a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass plate, which was filled with 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. For transfection cells were incubated for 3 h with various constructs (0.5 μg of total DNA/well) in the presence of the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Co-transfection of cells with Lyn11-FRB, CF-Inp, and YFP-PLCδ1-PH was performed with three corresponding plasmids in a 4:4:1 ratio to balance the emission intensities of fluorophores. The same protocol was used for the co-transfection of Lyn11-FRB, CF-Inp (or other constructs; CF-iSH and CF-PIPK), and PKCα-C2-mKate (or its mutants). Cells were then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum overnight. Typically, 50–80% of cells were transfected with all three cDNAs. 10–30% of these cells underwent cell death presumably due to the cytotoxicity of overexpressed Inp54p. Thus, cells with the moderate expression level of CF-Inp were selected for measurements. Live Cell Confocal Imaging—Immediately before imaging, the induction media was removed and the cells were washed and then overlaid with 400 μl of HBSS buffer (4.2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.7 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 138 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.3 K2HPO4, 5.6 mm d-glucose). Live cell dual-color imaging was performed on a four-channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. All measurements were carried out with a ×63, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective, at a minimal laser power and exposure time to reduce photobleaching. Proper filter sets for CFP/YFP and CFP/RFP duel-color images had been used to minimize fluorescence overlaps. Images were taken every 15 s at room temperature during the translocation assay. After initial imaging the translocation of CF-Inp, CF-PIPK, or CF-iSH was monitored in the presence of 5 μm rapamycin (0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide) and/or 50 μm LY294002 (0.0025% dimethyl sulfoxide). The PM translocation of PKCα-C2-RFP and its mutants were then triggered by adding 100 μm ATP (final concentration). The membrane translocation of the N189A mutant was induced by adding 10 μm ionomycin (final concentration). Images were analyzed using the analysis tool provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. Intensities of fluorescence proteins were determined in selected areas in the cytosol and PM and averaged (n > 10) at each time frame. The fluorescence intensity ratio, which indicates the relative abundance of fluorescence proteins at PM versus cytosol, was then calculated as PM/(PM + cytosol) and plotted as a function of time. System Model—A POPC patch of dimensions 80 Å × 80 Å (in xy plane) was created using the “membrane” plug-in in VMD (28Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27-38): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar) that left a margin of at least 15 Å on each side after the protein was placed in the vicinity of the upper layer (called the positive layer). For CA+PS+PIP2-, 10 POPC molecules in the middle of the upper layer were replaced with 10 POPS molecules ensuring that the protein had enough POPS molecules in which to interact. Similarly, for simulations involving both PS and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (i.e. CA+PS+PIP2+), 10 POPC molecules were removed, and 8 POPS and 2 PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecules were introduced, whereas only 2 POPC molecules were replaced with 2 PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecules for CA+PS-PIP2+. PtdIns(4,5)P2 was introduced in the middle of the bilayer falling directly below the β3–4 hairpin of the protein where it has been proposed to interact with the protein (16Evans J.H. Murray D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4972-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The proportion of POPS and PtdIns(4,5)P2 molecules in the membrane patch used in this study are also biologically relevant (7McLaughlin S. Murray D. Nature. 2005; 438: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 30Hauser H. Poupart G. Yeagle P. The Structure of Biological Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 3-71Google Scholar). Additionally, under our experimental conditions, the Ca2+ equilibration with the bilayer is not necessary as Ca2+ is pre-coordinated in the Ca2+ binding site of the C2 domain. Force-Field Parameters—Non-standard lipids such as POPS and PtdIns(4,5)P2 together with POPC were parameterized using the Antechamber tool (31Wang J. Wang W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2006; 25: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (3576) Google Scholar) from Amber 7 (32Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B.

Antechamber assigns atomic and bond types based on electronic and structural properties of the connected atoms, such as atomic hybridization type, electron donor, or acceptor capability, atomic number, number of connected atoms, number of attached hydrogen atoms, atomic property, which refers to ring properties, aromatic properties, and subtle chemical environments.

Initial structures of POPS and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were taken from previous works (36Mukhopadhyay P. Monticelli L. Tieleman D.P. Biophys.

The parameters used in this study are available at the membrane targeting domain resource, MeTaDor (39Bhardwaj N. Stahelin R.V. Zhao G. Cho W. Lu H. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 3110-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Due to a high heterogeneity because of the presence of two or three different kinds of lipids and unavailability of experimental data about the area per lipid for POPS and PtdIns(4,5)P2, simulations of the bilayer were performed with NTP ensemble with the T = 300 K. The Langevin piston method (40Feller S.E. Zheng Y.H. Pastor R.W. Brooks B.R. J. Comp. Phys. 1995; 103: 4613-4621Google Scholar) was used to impose a constant pressure p = 1 atm. The PME method was used for computation of the electrostatic forces (41Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (16022) Google Scholar, 42Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar) with grid spacing below 1.0 Å. The van der Waals interactions were cut off at 12 Å using a switching function starting at 10 Å. No bonds were restrained including the hydrogen bonds and a time step of 1 fs was used in all simulations. Statistical Ensemble—Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the xy directions to simulate an infinite planar layer and in the z direction to simulate a multilayer system. Due to the negative charge moiety of POPS and PtdIns(4,5)P2, the appropriate number of Na+ ions was added to neutralize the system. The initial translation and rotation of the additional lipid molecules (POPS and/or PtdIns(4,5)P2) with respect to the membrane were optimized to avoid large steric clashes. The system was then subjected to 10,000 steps of conjugate-gradient energy minimization to remove remaining steric overlaps. This was followed by 100 ps of dynamical run. Docking of Protein on the Membrane Surface—The starting relative orientation of the protein with respect to the membrane was its binding orientation as proposed by theory and validated by experiments (14Verdaguer N.

In simulations with POPS, phosphorus atoms from one of the POPS heads was made to overlap with that solved with the crystal structure of the domain (Fig. 2a) (14Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S.

The penetration of protein into the membrane was also carefully emulated by translation of the protein along the z axis. Additional water was added on the top of the protein-lipid system to create a layer of 15 Å above the protein and appropriate counterions were added. Poor contacts were removed by minimizing the energy of the system by 10,000 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization followed by a dynamic run of 1 to 10 ns. Computing Observables from MD Simulation—Various properties were calculated for observing the subsequent events compared in different cases. To monitor the movement of the protein, a “membrane surface” was defined as the surface layer in the xy plane with z coordinate equal to the average of z coordinates of phosphorus atoms present in the positive layer of that system. The movement of the protein with respect to this membrane was observed as the change in the difference of the z coordinate of the center of mass of the protein and that of the membrane surface. The initial value of this difference was translated to a value of zero such that the positive value of this distance would indicate the movement of the protein away from the layer as compared with the initial configuration and a negative value would mean its movement toward the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2054545020,"The degree of lymph-node metastasis in prostate cancer is crucial for both staging the disease and planning treatment. Here, Burton and colleagues describe a one-step, non-invasive imaging technology using prostate-specific adenoviral vectors that express imaging reporter genes. This set-up specifically and accurately detects lymph-node metastases in a model of human prostate cancer and eliminates the need for invasive lymphadenectomy required by the current lymphoscintigraphy method. The accurate assessment of nodal involvement in prostate cancer is crucial to planning treatment, yet there is a shortage of noninvasive imaging techniques capable of visualizing nodal lesions directly. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using recombinant human adenoviral vectors to detect nodal metastases in a human prostate cancer model. This was achieved by the prostate-restricted expression of optical and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging reporter genes by the viral vector coupled with the innate lymphotropic properties of adenovirus. We show that peritumoral administration of these vectors results in the direct detection of reporter gene expression in metastatic lesions within sentinel lymph nodes. Notably, this approach parallels the current lymphoscintigraphy method but enables the direct PET visualization of sentinel lymph node metastases, eliminating the need for invasive lymphadenectomy. These findings may lead to more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for individuals with advanced-stage prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2080577208,"Secretory and membrane proteins carry amino-terminal signal sequences that, in cotranslational targeting, are recognized by the signal recognition particle protein SRP54 without sequence specificity. The most abundant membrane proteins on Earth are the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCPs). They are synthesized in the cytoplasm, imported into the chloroplast, and posttranslationally targeted to the thylakoid membrane by cpSRP, a heterodimer formed by cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. We present the 1.5 angstrom crystal structure of cpSRP43 characterized by a unique arrangement of chromodomains and ankyrin repeats. The overall shape and charge distribution of cpSRP43 resembles the SRP RNA, which is absent in chloroplasts. The complex with the internal signal sequence of LHCPs reveals that cpSRP43 specifically recognizes a DPLG peptide motif. We describe how cpSPR43 adapts the universally conserved SRP system to posttranslational targeting and insertion of the LHCP family of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996444327,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and the related α-crystallins are ubiquitous chaperones linked to neurodegenerative diseases, myopathies, and cataract. To better define their mechanism of chaperone action, we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry (HXMS) to monitor conformational changes during complex formation between the structurally defined sHSPs, pea PsHsp18.1, and wheat TaHsp16.9, and the heat-denatured model substrates malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and firefly luciferase. Remarkably, we found that even when complexed with substrate, the highly dynamic local structure of the sHSPs, especially in the N-terminal arm (>70% exchange in 5 s), remains unchanged. These results, coupled with sHSP-substrate complex stability, indicate that sHSPs do not adopt new secondary structure when binding substrate and suggest sHSPs are tethered to substrate at multiple sites that are locally dynamic, a feature that likely facilitates recognition and refolding of sHSP-bound substrate by the Hsp70/DnaK chaperone system. Both substrates were found to be stabilized in a partially unfolded state that is observed only in the presence of sHSP. Furthermore, peptide-level HXMS showed MDH was substantially protected in two core regions (residues 95–156 and 228–252), which overlap with the MDH structure protected in the GroEL-bound MDH refolding intermediate. Significantly, despite differences in the size and structure of TaHsp16.9-MDH and PsHsp18.1-MDH complexes, peptide-level HXMS patterns for MDH in both complexes are virtually identical, indicating that stabilized MDH thermal unfolding intermediates are not determined by the identity of the sHSP.

Biol. 2005; 12: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In addition to attaining high levels of expression during high temperature stress, sHSPs are induced by other stresses (i.e. oxidative stress, heavy metals, ischemic injury) and are constitutive components of specific tissues in many different organisms. sHSPs have been found to modulate a wide range of biological processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell differentiation, aging, and apoptosis (3Dierick I.

The mechanism of sHSP chaperone action and interaction with substrates, therefore, has wide-ranging implications for understanding cellular stress and disease processes.The sHSPs are defined by a signature α-crystallin domain of ∼100 amino acids, flanked by a short C-terminal extension and an N-terminal arm of variable length and divergent sequence (1Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). sHSP monomers range from ∼12 to 42 kDa, but in their native state, the majority of sHSPs form oligomers of 12 to >32 subunits. X-ray crystallographic structures of the 24-subunit Methanococcus jannaschii sHSP, MjHsp16.5 (10Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) and dodecameric Triticum aestivum (wheat) TaHsp16.9 (11Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) reveal that the α-crystallin domain comprises a β-sandwich with topology identical to the Hsp90 co-chaperone p23, and participates in strand exchange to form a dimeric building block. A conserved IX(I/V) motif in the C-terminal extension makes essential oligomeric contacts by “patching” one edge of the α-crystallin β-sandwich. All of the N-terminal arms in the MjHsp16.5 structure were disordered (10Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), as were six in TaHsp16.9, but the remaining six had helical structure and were entwined to stabilize the oligomer (11Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Remarkably, although sHSPs are observed as stable oligomeric structures by many analytical techniques, kinetic studies reveal the oligomers undergo rapid subunit exchange (12Bova M.P. Ding L.-L.

Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar,2Haslbeck M. Franzmann T. Weinfurtner D. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). sHSPs bind denaturing substrate proteins in an ATP-independent fashion and have a very high substrate capacity, binding up to an equal weight of some proteins. Proteins bound in the resulting high molecular weight sHSP-substrate complexes can be refolded by the ATP-dependent chaperone action of the Hsp70/DnaK system, assisted by Hsp100/ClpB and GroEL in cells/compartments where these latter chaperones co-occur (15Lee G.J.

Interaction with substrate is believed to involve hydrophobic binding sites on the sHSP, which are exposed by an increased rate of subunit exchange, by heat or phosphorylation-induced shift of the sHSP oligomer equilibrium to a dimeric form, or through more subtle structural rearrangements.Defining the chaperone mechanism of sHSPs requires a more complete understanding of how sHSPs recognize and bind substrates. Detailed study, however, of the sHSP-substrate interaction is challenging, because of the difficulties associated with investigating heterogeneous protein mixtures exemplified by sHSP-substrate complexes (1Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Haslbeck M. Franzmann T. Weinfurtner D. Buchner J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Both the N-terminal arm and β-4 strand of the α-crystallin domain have been implicated as sHSP substrate binding sites, but overlap of proposed binding sites with structural elements required for sHSP oligomerization (and therefore structural integrity) complicates data interpretation (18Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39943-39952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Giese K.C. Basha E. Catague B.Y. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Virtually nothing is known about sHSP structural rearrangements that must accompany formation of sHSP-substrate complexes. sHSP subunit exchange can continue in the presence of bound substrate (12Bova M.P.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), although a recent study indicates that protease sites on the sHSP N-terminal arm are protected in substrate complexes (23Aquilina J.A. Watt S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There is more, though still limited, information about organization of the denatured substrate. The structure of substrates associated with sHSPs has been monitored by fluorescence dye binding, intrinsic fluorescence, CD, 1H NMR, and spin labeling, primarily using proteins that aggregate upon reduction, such as the insulin β-chain and α-lactalbumin, but heat aggregation of rhodanese, carbonic anhydrase, and other proteins have also been investigated (1Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 24Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. Lyon C. Canet D. Hernandez H. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. J. Mol.

Results generally agree that substrates bind when in an aggregation-prone, partially unfolded molten globule form, although both early and late unfolding intermediates have been identified as binding structures.To gain more detailed insight into sHSP-substrate interactions, we have employed solution phase hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the conformational changes of sHSPs and model substrates in sHSP-substrate complexes. The ability to perform HXMS with complex mixtures in physiological buffers and with minimal material make this a valuable approach to structural studies of systems not amenable to other high resolution techniques, and it is now being used to probe amyloid and other complex structures (26Carulla N.

The rate of exchange depends on amide hydrogen access to D2O and involvement in internal hydrogen bonds (29Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Comparison of exchange rates for proteins in different states can reveal differences in protein conformation, and importantly, by measuring HX at the peptide level by MS, structural differences can be located to specific protein regions (30Komives E.A.

Results here provide novel insights into how sHSPs affect the structure of denaturing substrates and how sHSPs bind substrate in a manner that may facilitate release to other chaperones.MATERIALS AND METHODSPig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science, PDB 1MLD) and firefly luciferase (Promega, PDB 1LCI) were purchased from the manufacturer and used without further purification.Protein Purification—Triticum aestivum (wheat) TaHsp16.9 (PDB 1GME) and Pisum sativum (pea) PsHsp18.1 (GenBank™ accession no. P19243) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (33Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated extinction coefficient of E280 = 16500 m-1 cm-1 for both proteins. The expected molecular masses of both proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry.Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—sHSPs and substrate proteins were incubated at concentrations, temperatures, and times specified in the figure legends or text. Protein mixtures were cooled on ice after heating and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant (100 μl) was loaded onto a Bio-Sil SEC 400-5 column (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase used in all the experiments was 25 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5. Standards for chromatography were: thyroglobulin 670 kDa, γ-globulin 158 kDa, ovalumin 44 kDa, carbonic anhydrase 29 kDa, and myoglobin 17 kDa (Bio-Rad).Peptide Mapping of MDH and sHSPs by HPLC-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—To map the peptides produced by digestion of sHSPs and MDH with pepsin, a total of 100 pmol of protein stock was diluted into 25 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm KCl in H2O (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 20 μm, followed by addition of 25% formic acid to adjust the pH to pH 2.5 (by pH paper). The sample was applied to a column of immobilized pepsin (2 mm × 50 mm, packed in-house (34Wang L. Pan H. Smith D.L. Mol. Cell Proteom. 2002; 1: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), using water and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The protein digest was collected by a micropeptide trap (Michrome BioResources, Auburn, CA) and washed for 2 min at a flow rate of 300 μl/min. Peptides in the trap were then eluted onto a microbore C-18 HPLC column (1 mm × 50 mm, Micro-Tech Scientific, Vista, CA) coupled to a Waters micro Q-TOF (Milford, MA) with a typical ESI voltage of 3 kV for accurate parent mass measurements (35Cheng G. Wysocki V.H. Cusanovich M.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Cheng G. Cusanovich M.A. Wysocki V.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11744-11751Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted from the column over 12 min. using a gradient of 15–45% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The micropeptide trap and HPLC column were immersed in ice water during the entire process. The same experiment was repeated using a Finnigan LCQ Classic quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in data-dependent mode to acquire product (tandem) MS spectra. The typical ESI voltage used in LCQ was 4.5 kV. Both parent mass and tandem mass spectra were used for peptide identification. The Waters micro Q-TOF was subsequently used for all H/D exchange measurements.Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange (HX)—HX exchange experiments were initiated by diluting the protein sample (∼20-fold) into the labeling solution (D2O, 25 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm KCl, pD 7.5). Incubation times are specified in the text. All pH and pD values reported were taken directly from the pH meter and were not corrected for isotope effects (37Englander J.J. Rogero J.R. Englander S.W. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At each time point, an aliquot of 200 μl of protein was taken out of the exchange tube and quenched by mixing the solution with 25% D2 formic acid in D2O to pD 2.5 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The amount of formic acid required to achieve the desired pD was first estimated by titrating 20 ml of protein buffer with 25% formic acid to pH 2.5 using a pH meter. The required aliquots of 25% D2 formic acid in D2O were then added to individual quenching tubes for direct mixing with protein exchange samples, followed by a pH reading using pH paper. After freezing in liquid N2, quenched samples were transferred to a -80 °C freezer and stored until analysis. All samples were analyzed within 24 h of the HX experiments. Frozen samples were transferred to a dry ice container and removed directly prior to LC-MS analysis. Individual 200-μl samples were defrosted within <1 min at 37 °C before loading directly onto the pepsin column. It is important to note that the pH of the quenched samples was kept at ∼pH 2.5. This pH is maintained during the HPLC step by using 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid as the modifier. In addition, the temperature of the whole digestion/separation setup was maintained at ∼4 °C, by immersion of peptide/protein trap, LC column, and the connecting tubings in an ice bath to further decrease exchange rate. It is well documented that the combination of low pH and low temperature decreases the exchange reaction rate by five orders of magnitude compared with that at neutral pH and 25 °C (29Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 37Englander J.J. Rogero J.R. Englander S.W. Anal.

Furthermore, correction for back-exchange during the LC-MS step can be done using a fully deuterated controlled sample, as described below.HX Analysis by HPLC-ESI—Samples for peptide analysis were treated as described for unlabeled protein in the peptide mapping section. Intact protein samples were analyzed similarly to the protein digest, with three exceptions. The pepsin column was not used for the MS experiment with intact protein, the micropeptide trap was replaced by a microprotein trap (Michrom BioResources), and 60% acetonitrile was used for protein elution. Mass spectrometry analyses of all samples within each comparison set were done on the same day with the same instrumental conditions. Deconvolution of intact protein spectra was performed with the program MaxEnt1 (Waters, MA). The mass of each peptide was taken as the centroid mass of the isotopic envelope with the program MagTran (39Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar).To account for the exchange of deuterium during the HPLC step (back exchange), and the use of only 20-fold excess D2O during the labeling step, which limits the forward exchange reaction, an experimental correction was applied. A 100% deuterated protein control (100D reference) was prepared by fully denaturing the sHSPs or substrates in 6 m GuDCl and diluting 20-fold into D2O for >24 h prior to mass determination. The corrected extent of deuterium incorporation was then calculated according to Equation 1 (38Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J.

MDH has been used extensively as a model substrate for the chaperone GroEL (41Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39943-39952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). sHSP-MDH complexes were formed by incubating either 24 μm PsHsp18.1 or TaHsp16.9 with MDH at an sHSP/MDH molar ratio of 2.4:1 or 3:1, respectively, at 45 °C for 0–120 min (Fig. 1, a and b). These sHSP/MDH ratios were chosen because they afford complete protection of MDH from heat insolubilization, and on a molar basis PsHSP18.1 is more effective than TaHsp16.9 (18Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39943-39952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Accumulation of high molecular weight complexes comprising MDH with either sHSP increased over time at 45 °C as observed by size exclusion chromatography performed at room temperature. When MDH was heated in the absence of sHSPs, the protein aggregated, as shown by the gradual decrease in the MDH native peak (Fig. 1c). In contrast, when the sHSPs are heated alone, the majority of the sHSP elutes identically to unheated protein at the position of the dodecamer, with a minor fraction in the case of TaHsp16.9 eluting at position predicting to be a dimer (supplemental Fig. S1).Although both sHSPs fully protect MDH, there are significant differences in the sHSP-substrate complexes formed. PsHsp18.1-MDH complexes eluted later, corresponding to an apparent size of 600–700 kDa, while TaHsp16.9-MDH complexes eluted in the void volume (>1000 kDa), consistent with previous observations (18Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39943-39952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Increasing the ratio of TaHsp16.9 to MDH did not reduce apparent complex size (not shown). In addition, while virtually all of the MDH and sHSP in the PsHsp18.1 samples are incorporated into the complex peak after 2 h at 45°C, after the same treatment, significant TaHsp16.9 elutes at the position of free sHSP, with no change on further heating (not shown). Thus, TaHsp16.9 either initially associates less effectively with MDH or is less stably complexed with MDH and dissociates prior to or during chromatography. Both sHSP-substrate complexes are heterogeneous in size and/or shape, based on the broadness of the complex peak. Altogether the stoichiometry of protection and the nature of the complexes formed suggest that TaHsp16.9 and PsHsp18.1 have somewhat different modes of interaction with MDH.HX of sHSP in the sHSP-Substrate Complex—To monitor structural changes during heat-induced sHSP-substrate complex formation, we used the protocol for HX as diagramed in Fig. 2a. Each protein mixture was heated at 45 °C for 0–120 min. Samples were removed every 30 min, cooled to 25 °C, and then subjected to 5-s pulse labeling in D2O. The HX information of both partners in the sHSP-substrate complexes can be monitored simultaneously by MS, because of their significant difference in monomeric mass. The HX data for PsHsp18.1 and TaHsp16.9 in the presence of MDH are shown in Fig. 2b. In the native state, prior to heating, both sHSPs exchanged 58% of backbone hydrogens. Surprisingly, throughout the heating time course, the extent of HX remained at 58% for both PsHsp18.1 and TaHsp16.9. If the interactions between the sHSPs and MDH leave a “fingerprint” by HX, one would expect to observe a two-population pattern for sHSP as more and more sHSP interacts with heat-denaturing MDH, but this was not observed.FIGURE 2Global HXMS of sHSP and substrate. a, experimental scheme for examining HX during sHSP-MDH complex formation.

At an sHSP to substrate ratio of 4 to 1, PsHsp18.1 fully protects Luc from insolubilization, and the vast majority of both sHSP and Luc are complexed (supplemental Fig. S2a). TaHsp16.9 does not protect or form stable complexes with Luc at this temperature (18Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39943-39952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), again indicating differential interaction with substrate compared with PsHsp18.1, and was therefore not used in this experiment.

https://openalex.org/W1975307961,"HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) regulates a number of biological processes in cells. Our previous studies revealed that HDAC1 inhibits proliferation of the livers in old mice. We have surprisingly observed that HDAC1 is also increased in young livers proliferating after partial hepatectomy (PH) and in human liver tumors. Increased levels of HDAC1 after PH lead to its interaction with a member of the C/EBP family, C/EBPbeta, which is also elevated after PH. At early time points after PH, the HDAC1-C/EBPbeta complex binds to the C/EBPalpha promoter and represses expression of C/EBPalpha. A detailed analysis of the role of HDAC1 and C/EBPbeta proteins in the regulation of C/EBPalpha promoter showed that, whereas C/EBPbeta alone activates the promoter, HDAC1 represses the promoter in a C/EBPbeta-dependent manner. The inhibition of HDAC1 in the livers of young mice inhibits liver proliferation after PH, which is associated with high levels of C/EBPalpha. Consistent with the positive role of HDAC1-C/EBPbeta complexes in liver proliferation, we have found that the CUGBP1-HDAC1-C/EBPbeta pathway is activated in human tumor liver samples, suggesting that HDAC1-C/EBPbeta complexes are involved in the development of liver tumors. The causal role of the CUGBP1-HDAC1 pathway in liver proliferation was examined in CUGBP1 transgenic mice, which display high levels of the CUGBP1-eIF2 complex. We have demonstrated that elevation of the HDAC1-C/EBPbeta complexes in CUGBP1 transgenic mice reduces expression of C/EBPalpha and increases the rate of liver proliferation. Thus, these studies have identified a new pathway that promotes liver proliferation in young mice and might contribute to the malignant transformations in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2011480706,"Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is critically modulated by kinases via the phosphorylation of its Ser(1179) (bovine) or Ser(1177) (human) residue. Reactive oxygen species such as H(2)O(2) was reported to activate Akt, leading to increased eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation and activity. But reactive oxygen species are also known to attenuate eNOS function in cardiovascular diseases. Prior studies showing H(2)O(2)-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation were performed on serum-starved cells, and only the short term effect of H(2)O(2) was examined. Here we found that the effects of H(2)O(2) on eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation and function were bidirectional. With endothelial cells cultured with serum, H(2)O(2) initially raised eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation and activity. However, after the peak increase at 30 min, eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation dramatically declined. Parallel to the alterations of eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation, Akt was transiently activated by H(2)O(2) and subsequently became dormant. In contrast, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was progressively activated in H(2)O(2)-treated cells. Blocking Akt activation abolished the initial rise of eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation after H(2)O(2) treatment. In long term H(2)O(2)-treated cells where Akt was deactivated, significant amounts of Ser(1179)-phosphorylated eNOS remained. AMPK inhibition eradicated the remaining eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation. Taken together, these studies revealed that Akt and AMPK orchestrated a bidirectional action on eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation in H(2)O(2)-treated cells. Long term H(2)O(2) exposure decreased eNOS Ser(1179) phosphorylation, and this might account for the loss of eNOS function in cardiovascular diseases where chronic oxidative injury occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1993850699,"Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity is increased in heart failure (HF), a syndrome characterized by markedly increased risk of arrhythmia. Activation of CaMKII increases peak L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) and slows I(Ca) inactivation. Whether these events are linked mechanistically is unknown. I(Ca) was recorded in acutely dissociated subepicardial and subendocardial murine left ventricular (LV) myocytes using the whole cell patch clamp method. Pressure overload heart failure was induced by surgical constriction of the thoracic aorta. I(Ca) density was significantly larger in subepicardial myocytes than in subendocardial/myocytes. Similar patterns were observed in the cell surface expression of alpha1c, the channel pore-forming subunit. In failing LV, I(Ca) density was increased proportionately in both cell types, and the time course of I(Ca) inactivation was slowed. This typical pattern of changes suggested a role of CaMKII. Consistent with this, measurements of CaMKII activity revealed a 2-3-fold increase (p < 0.05) in failing LV. To test for a causal link, we measured frequency-dependent I(Ca) facilitation. In HF myocytes, this CaMKII-dependent process could not be induced, suggesting already maximal activation. Internal application of active CaMKII in failing myocytes did not elicit changes in I(Ca). Finally, CaMKII inhibition by internal diffusion of a specific peptide inhibitor reduced I(Ca) density and inactivation time course to similar levels in control and HF myocytes. I(Ca) density manifests a significant transmural gradient, and this gradient is preserved in heart failure. Activation of CaMKII, a known pro-arrhythmic molecule, is a major contributor to I(Ca) remodeling in load-induced heart failure."

The lack of h2-calponin also significantly increased macrophage phagocytotic activity, suggesting a novel mechanism to regulate phagocyte functions. Leukocytes are mobile cells and their actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in the locomotion, transmigration, and phagocytosis. These activities are essential for the function of myeloid cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, in defensive and autoimmune responses (1Jones G.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 593-602PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the significant biological and medical importance, the regulation of actin cytoskeleton in myeloid cells is not well understood. Calponin is an actin filament-associated protein of 34–37 kDa (292–330 amino acids) found in smooth muscle (2Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kobuku T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The three isoforms of calponin have distinct theoretical isoelectric points (pI values): H1-calponin is basic (pI 9.4), h2-calponin is near neutral (pI 7.5), whereas the acidic calponin has a lower pI of 5.2. H1-calponin is the predominant isoform specifically expressed in differentiated smooth muscle cells and its role in regulating smooth muscle contractility (9Walsh M.P. Biochem.

The majority of previous structural and functional studies of calponin were obtained from chicken gizzard calponin that is equivalent to the mammalian h1-calponin. The acidic calponin has been found in smooth muscle (16Applegate D. Feng W. Green R.S. Taubman M.B. J. Biol.

We further found that h2-calponin is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, lung alveolar epithelial cells, and fibroblasts and plays a role in stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. The expression and degradation of h2-calponin are both under the regulation of cytoskeletal tension built by myosin motors (3Hossain M.M. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. Lin J.J.-C. Jin J.-P. J. Biol.

Cloning of Mouse Cnn2 Genomic DNA—From a 129SvJ strain mouse genomic DNA library in λ DASHII phage vector (20Gao J. Hwang J.M. Jin J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Huang Q.-Q. Chen A. Jin J.-P. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 229: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), clones bearing genomic DNA segments containing the h2-calponin gene were isolated using 32P-labeled mouse h2-calponin cDNA probe. The plating of λ phage, making of nylon membrane replicas, hybridization, and autoradiography were carried out as described previously (21Huang Q.-Q. Chen A. Jin J.-P. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 229: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The plaque-purified positive phages were amplified in XL-1B MFA P2 Escherichia coli and purified by centrifugation through CsCl density gradients. The recombinant phage DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and subcloned into plasmid vectors as overlapping restriction endonuclease fragments. Restriction mapping, Southern analysis, and partial sequencing were carried out to verify the cloned Cnn2 genomic DNA in comparison with the mouse genomic DNA sequence in the data base (Gene ID MGI: 105093). Development of H2-Calponin Gene Knock-out Mice—A mouse Cnn2-targeted conditional mutagenesis construct was generated using the pPNT4 vector (22Conrad M. Brielmeier M. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. BioTechniques. 2003; 34 (1140): 1136-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Marcus Conrad, Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology and Tumor Genetics GSF-Research Centre for Environment and Health, Germany). In the Cnn2 gene targeting construct, two loxP sequences were inserted in intron 1 and intron 2 in tandem orientation to allow Cre recombinase-catalyzed deletion of exon 2. The deletion of exon 2 not only removes a portion of the coding sequence but also results in a reading frameshift in the downstream mRNA after codon number 21. The shifted reading frame is terminated by a stop codon after encoding 11 missense amino acids. This Cre-mediated deletion of exon 2 can be induced in whole animals as well as in tissues or in cultured cells. A neoR cassette adjacent to the downstream loxP sequence as constructed in the pPNT4 vector was inserted into intron 2 of the Cnn2 targeting construct for neomycin selection of the transfected ES cells. The neoR cassette is flanked by two frt sequences and can be deleted by FLP1-catalyzed recombination (23Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). This mechanism allows the removal of the neoR cassette after establishing the targeted loxP mutagenesis to avoid the effect of neoR insertion on h2-calponin expression. The induction of neoR removal can be done in whole animals, tissues, or cells. Long flanking arms (4.6 and 5.5 kb) were placed in the gene targeting construct to provide sufficient regions for homologous recombination. Transfection of mouse HM-1 ES cells (x,y) with the h2-calponin gene targeting DNA construct using electroporation was carried out at the Northwestern University Transgenic and Targeted Mutagenesis Laboratory. Colonies of the transfected ES cells were selected by the acquisition of neomycin resistance conferred by the gene targeting construct. Genomic DNA from the drug-resistant ES cell colonies was extracted by protease K digestion and screened by Southern blotting using cloned 5′- and 3′-flanking genomic DNA probes for the homologous recombination generated change of BamHI restriction pattern. Ten μg each of the ES cell genomic DNA was digested by BamHI, separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to the nylon membrane by capillary action using standard Southern blotting method. The membrane was prehybridized at 55 °C for 2 h in 0.25 m Na2HPO4, 14 mm H3PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml mechanically sheared salmon sperm DNA, 20% formamide. The 5′ and 3′ DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP, heat-denatured, and added to the rolling hybridization flask together with 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate for incubation at 55 °C for 16 h. The membrane was then washed repeatedly by 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA to gradually reach 60 °C and examined by autoradiography. Two original Cnn2-targeted mouse ES cell clones identified by Southern screening, 21C7 and 21H2, were used to produce chimeric mice. The blastocyst injection and embryo re-implantation were carried out at the Northwestern University Gene Targeting and Transgenic Core Facility. The 129SvJ-originated (albino) ES cells are injected into C57BL/6 (black) mouse blastocysts to produce chimeras. High chimerism males from the two targeted ES cell lines were mated with C57BL/6 females to test germ line transmission. The ES cell-originated offspring was first selected by the brown coat color in contrast to the pure C57BL/6 black littermates. The presence of the targeted Cnn2 allele in the ES cell-originated pups was then genotyped by PCR on genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies. Two pairs of PCR primers were designed to identify the presence of the upstream loxP and the neoR cassette, respectively. Mice bearing the targeted Cnn2 allele were selected to mate with C57BL/6 for 7 to 9 generations to obtain a uniformed genetic background. Disruption of the h2-calponin gene through deletion of the exon 2 region was obtained by crossing the Cnn2-flox mouse line with the Zp3-cre mouse line (The Jackson Laboratory) that expresses Cre recombinase in the female germ line. Removal of the neoR cassette inserted in intron 2 was achieved by crossing the Cnn2-flox-neo line with a Gt(ROSA)26Sor-FLP transgenic mouse line (The Jackson Laboratory) that expresses FLP1 recombinase in most tissue types, including the developing germ line. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Representative tissue samples were obtained from adult (4–5 months old) wild type and Cnn2-targeted mice. Immediately after euthanasia, tissues were rapidly dissected on ice and briefly rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total proteins were extracted from the tissues by mechanical homogenization in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS and heated at 80 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE samples of isolated or cultured cells were prepared similarly, omitting the mechanical homogenization step. The protein extracts were examined by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system and Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Duplicate gels were electrically blotted on nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer apparatus for Western analysis. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin or 5% powdered skim milk in Tris-buffered saline, the membrane was incubated with a rabbit antiserum, RAH2, which was raised against mouse h2-calponin immunogen and has a weak cross-reaction to h1-calponin (24Nigam R.

As described previously (4Hossain M.M. Smith P.G. Wu K. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15670-15683Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Sigma). After the final washes, the blots were processed for 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chromogenic substrate reaction (4Hossain M.M. Smith P.G. Wu K. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15670-15683Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Densitometry analysis of SDS gels and Western blots were performed on digital images scanned at 600 dots/inch using the NIH Image software version 1.61. Quantification of the SDS gel and Western blots was done by normalization to the amount of actin, total cellular protein, or histones determined in parallel SDS gels. InVitro Differentiation of Human Peripheral Monocytes into Macrophages—Human monocytes were isolated by elutriation from peripheral blood of anonymous healthy donors to start primary cell cultures. This investigation was determined to be exempted research by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. The purified peripheral monocytes were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and allowed to adhere to cell culture dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h before change to medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml of polymyxin B. The adherent cells were allowed to differentiate into macrophages in culture for up to 7 days as described previously (27Huang Q.-Q. Ma Y.Y. Adebayo A. Pope R.M.

Collection and Immunophenotyping of Mouse Peritoneal Cells—Peritoneal residential cells were lavaged with PBS from wild type and h2-calponin knock-out mice. Mouse peritoneal cells were also elicited by injection of 2 ml of 3% thioglycollate broth 12 and 72 h prior to lavage. A fixed volume (8 ml) of PBS was used for each animal so the total number of cells lavaged could be compared. Cell types are identified by immunophenotyping with florescence-conjugated antibodies recognizing specific cell surface markers of myeloid cell (Mac-1), macrophage (F4/80), and granulocyte (Gr-1) followed by flow cytometry analysis. 5 × 105 cells from each mouse were first incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (BD Biosciences) to block the cell surface Fc III/II receptor and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-Mac1 (Mac1-FITC, Serotec), allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-F4/80 (F4/80-allophycocyanin, Serotec), and phycoerythrin-Cy7 (PEcy7)-conjugated anti-Gr1 (Gr1-PEcy7, eBioscience, CA) antibodies at room temperature for 30 min. After washing away the unbound antibodies, the cells were analyzed using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with BD FACSDIVA software. Using the FCS Express software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA), macrophages were identified as strong Mac1-positive, F4/80-positive, and Gr1-negative, whereas granulocytes were identified as strong Mac1-positive, F4/80-negative, and Gr1-positive. In Vitro Wound Healing Assay—Residential mouse peritoneal cells were collected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and seeded in 12-well culture plates at 1 × 106 per well to allow high density adhesion of macrophages. After removing the floating cells, the adherent cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h to form a confluent monolayer. The macrophage monolayer was wounded by scratching with a thin pipette tip and examined at a series of time points under a phase-contrast microscope. The width of the wounds was measured from photographs to evaluate the rate of cell migration during the course of healing. In Vitro Proliferation of Mouse Bone Marrow Cells—Bone marrow cells were flushed out from femora and tibias of 3-month-old wild type and h2-calponin knock-out mice. The cells were induced to differentiate into macrophages in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 20% L929 cell-conditioned media (34Davies J.Q. Gordon S. Helgason C.D. Miller C.L. Basic Cell Culture Protocols. Third Edition. 290. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 91-103Google Scholar), 5% horse serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 4 days of culture, the adherent cells were collected with a cell scraper and re-seeded in 96-well plates at 2.5 × 103 cells per well in 200 μl of the same media. The rate of cell proliferation in culture was examined in quadruplet wells at a series of time points by Crystal Violet staining of nuclei as described previously (18Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y.

Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two μg of DNA in 50 μl of DMEM was mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min before being gently mixed with 5 ml of DMEM and added to the RAW264.7 cell culture. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h, 5 ml of DMEM containing 20% FBS was added to the dish and the culture was further incubated for 18 h before change to fresh media. To establish RAW264.7 cell lines stably expressing h2-calponin, the transfected cells were selected by G418 (300 μg/ml) and drug-resistant single colonies were individually picked as described previously (18Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The integration of the sense and antisense h2-calponin cDNA transgenes in the stably transfected RAW cell lines was verified by PCR. The expression of h2-calponin in the sense cDNA-transfected cells was examined by Western blotting using the RAH2 antibody. RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with sense and antisense h2-calponin cDNA and non-transfected cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at 1 × 103 cells per well for cell proliferation assay as described above. Multiple stable transfected cell lines were examined to avoid line to line differences. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To examine the cellular localization of h2-calponin in macrophages and the effect of Cnn2 knock-out on the structure of macrophage actin cytoskeleton, residential mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured as a monolayer on glass coverslips for 24 h and stained with anti-h2-calponin antibody RAH2 and normal rabbit serum control, followed by TRITC- or FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (Sigma) as described previously (18Hossain M.M. Hwang D.-Y. Huang Q.-Q. Sasaki Y. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C156-C167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Actin filaments were stained with TRITC-phalloidin. Tropomyosin was stained with mAb CG3 (36Lin J.J.-C. Chou C.-S. Lin J.L.-C.

After opsonization by incubation in 50% pooled normal mouse serum diluted in Krebs-Ringer PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min, red fluorescence carboxyl microspheres (1.0 μm diameter, excitation/emission maxima at 580 nm/605 nm, Molecular Probes) were incubated with mouse residential and elicited peritoneal cells (1 × 106) at a particle to cell ratio of 50:1 in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing a final concentration of 5% mouse serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. The cells were then thoroughly washed with PBS four times to remove the free and extracellularly bound particles and immediately stained with F4/80-allophycocyanin and Gr1-PEcy7 antibodies as above. After washing to remove the unbound antibodies, the cells were fixed with 1% formalin in PBS. Uptake of the fluorescent beads was measured using a BD FACSArray flow cytometer at 532 nm laser excitation. Phagocytotic activity was analyzed by the FCS Express software. Data Analysis—All quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.D. or S.E. as noted in the figure legends. Statistical analysis was done with Student's t test using Microsoft Excel (two-tail assays unless noted in the figure legends). Significant Levels of H2-calponin in Myeloid Cells—We found that h2-calponin is highly expressed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 (ATCC CCL-243), and human monocyte line THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) (Fig. 1A). Although h2-calponin is minimally detectable in undifferentiated human promyeloblast line HL-60 (ATCC CCL-240), the expression is significantly up-regulated 5 days after dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation in culture (41Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). In contrast, h2-calponin is not detectable by RAH2 polyclonal antibody in the human T lymphocyte line Jurkat (ATCC TIB-152), mouse T lymphocyte line BW5147 (ATCC TIB-47), mouse plasmacytoma cell line T1165 (42Le J.

https://openalex.org/W2022355487,"Although degradation of cartilage matrix has been suggested to be a rate-limiting step for endochondral ossification during skeletal development, little is known about the transcriptional regulation. This study investigated the involvement of KLF5 (Krüppel-like factor 5), an Sp/KLF family member, in the skeletal development. KLF5 was expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts but not in osteoclasts. The heterozygous deficient (KLF5+/-) mice exhibited skeletal growth retardation in the perinatal period. Although chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation were normal, cartilage matrix degradation was impaired in KLF5+/- mice, causing delay in replacement of cartilage with bone at the primary ossification center in the embryonic limbs and elongation of hypertrophic chondrocyte layer in the neonatal growth plates. Microarray analyses identified MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) as a transcriptional target, since it was strongly up-regulated by adenoviral transfection of KLF5 in chondrogenic cell line OUMS27. The KLF5 overexpression caused gelatin degradation by stimulating promoter activity of MMP9 without affecting chondrocyte differentiation or vascular endothelial growth factor expression in the culture of chondrogenic cells; however, in osteoclast precursors, it affected neither MMP9 expression nor osteoclastic differentiation. KLF5 dysfunction by genetic heterodeficiency or RNA interference was confirmed to cause reduction of MMP9 expression in cultured chondrogenic cells. MMP9 expression was decreased in the limbs of KLF5+/- embryos, which was correlated with suppression of matrix degradation, calcification, and vascularization. We conclude that KLF5 causes cartilage matrix degradation through transcriptional induction of MMP9, providing the first evidence that transcriptional regulation of a proteinase contributes to endochondral ossification and skeletal development."

Here, we investigated the requirement for ligand activation of PPARγ in fat cell differentiation, taking advantage of a natural mutant of this receptor that does not bind or become activated by any known natural or synthetic ligand. When ectopically expressed in PPARγ-null fibroblasts, this Q286P allele was able to strongly promote morphological adipogenesis, without any significant difference compared with wild-type PPARγ. In addition, no significant differences were found in the expression of several adipogenic genes between the wild-type and Q286P mutant alleles. To extend our studies to an in vivo setting, we performed subcutaneous injections of PPARγ-expressing fibroblasts into nude mice. We found that both wild-type and Q286P mutant-expressing fibroblasts were able to generate fat pads in the mice.

Nuclear hormone receptors, a family of >48 different proteins in humans, are transcription factors that can alter patterns of gene expression in response to extracellular stimuli. Examples include receptors for steroid hormones, vitamin D, and thyroid hormones. Other members of this family, identified on the basis of structural similarities, are so-called orphan receptors: their endogenous ligands are unknown. A subclass of these orphans is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 2The abbreviations used are:PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorHAhemagglutinin. family, consisting of three members: PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ.

Like many other nuclear hormone receptors, it functions as an obligate heterodimer with retinoid X receptors. PPARγ shares structural similarities with its family members, most notably a C-terminal ligand-binding domain with a hydrophobic pocket, terminated by an α-helix, termed an AF-2 domain, which serves as a docking platform for co-activator binding. In the classic “mousetrap” model of nuclear hormone receptor function, binding of an agonist to the ligand-binding domain causes a structural shift that alters the position of the AF-2 domain in such a way that co-activator binding is enhanced (reviewed in Ref. 16Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Several structurally distinct agonists for PPARγ have been described. These include the antidiabetic thiazolidinedione drugs, including troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which function as agonist ligands of PPARγ with binding affinities in the mid-nanomolar range (17Lehmann J.M.

In fact, it is most likely that these drugs act primarily by activating PPARγ in adipose tissue. In addition, N-aryl tyrosine derivatives can act as powerful agonists of PPARγ (18Brown K.K.

However, a high affinity endogenous ligand has yet to be isolated and identified as playing a physiological role in adipogenesis.

Outside of its role in adipogenesis, PPARγ has been implicated as a tumor suppressor (21Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J. Zhang M. Fletcher C. Singer S. Spiegelman B.M. Mol.

A screen of human colon cancer samples revealed a mutation in PPARγ, Q286P, in the backbone helix of the ligand-binding domain (24Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutant protein is unable to bind to either thiazolidinediones or 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2. Therefore, this version of the receptor became an important tool to determine the role of ligand binding in the adipogenic function of PPARγ. In this study, we show that PPARγ Q286P, although resistant to ligand activation, is fully adipogenic. These results surprisingly suggest that ligand binding is not a requirement for PPARγ function in fat cell differentiation. Transcription Reporter Assays—293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The following day, the cells were transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Each well contained 50 ng of pDR-1 (3×, based on the UCP1 PPARγ recognition site)-luciferase reporter plasmid, 250 ng of pMSCV-PPARγ expression plasmid, and 25 ng of pRL-renillin plasmid for normalization. Following an overnight transfection, the cells were treated with PPARγ-activating ligands (or dimethyl sulfoxide as a control) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and 15 μl of each lysate was assayed for luciferase and renillin activity with the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to renillin activity. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate. Retroviral Infection and Differentiation of Cells—PPARγ-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (8Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbec-co's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. Retroviruses expressing FLAG-HA-PPARγ, FLAG-HA-PPARγ Q286P, and FLAG-HA-PPARγ E499Q were produced by standard methods using the pMSCV plasmid (Clontech). Following infection of the cells with the retrovirus, cells expressing the ectopic protein were selected by incubation with 2 μg/ml puromycin. The fibroblasts were grown to confluence and then subjected to a hormone mixture to induce adipogenic differentiation. This treatment consisted of 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 5 μg/ml insulin for 48 h, followed by 5 μg/ml insulin for the remaining course of differentiation. Lipid accumulation in the cells was detected by Oil Red O staining. Immunoblotting—Cells grown on 10-cm culture dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in 0.5 ml of high salt lysis buffer (400 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). The cells were lysed for 30 min on ice and then microcentrifuged to remove debris. Protein content was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce), and 25-μg aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with an anti-PPARγ monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; E8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Dura reagents (Pierce) and autoradiographed to detect PPARγ protein. Measurement of Adipogenic Gene Expression—Cells were grown to confluence and then induced to undergo differentiation using the hormone mixture described above. At each day of differentiation, total RNA was purified from cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the levels of adipogenic mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR using the SYBR reagent (Applied Biosystems). Expression was normalized to 18 S RNA levels. The PCR primers used are listed in the supplemental table. In Vivo Generation of Adipocytes—PPARγ-null cells ectopically expressing the different PPARγ mutants (as described above) were cultured on 15-cm plates at low density, trypsinized, and counted. 200-μl aliquots of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 × 107 cells were implanted subcutaneously at the sterna of male NU/NU-nuBr athymic “nude” mice. 6 weeks after injection, mice were killed, and the skin covering the sternum was removed and inspected for the presence of a fat pad. Cross-sections of this skin were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard methods. The Q286P Mutant of PPARγ Is Not Activated by Known Agonists—As a nuclear hormone receptor, PPARγ contains a canonical ligand-binding domain at its C terminus. A screen of human colon cancer samples revealed a mutation that results in a glutamine-to-proline mutation at residue 286 of the protein (24Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). According to published crystal structures, this mutation occurs in the middle of α-helix 3 of the ligand-binding domain, which forms the backbone of the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 1A) (25Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of PPARγ Q286P suggested that this mutant was unable to bind to and be activated by some PPARγ ligands (24Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We have extended these studies to demonstrate that the Q286P mutation renders PPARγ impervious to activation by virtually all known agonists. PPARγ agonists fall into three structurally distinct categories: thiazolidinediones (including the antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone), fatty acids and their oxidized derivatives, and N-aryl tyrosine derivatives. The ability of these compounds to activate PPARγ was tested in transcription assays based on PPARγ expression with a DR-1-luciferase reporter (Fig. 1B). As expected, wild-type PPARγ was activated by agonists from all three classes. However, PPARγ Q286P produced no significant activation when treated with any of the agonists. Interestingly, without agonist treatment, wild-type PPARγ and PPARγ Q286P both displayed significant and similar transcriptional activity. Like other nuclear hormone receptors, the C-terminal α-helix of the ligand-binding domain contains the AF-2 activation region. This domain serves as a docking site for PPARγ co-activators. Disruption of this α-helix by introducing a glutamate-to-glutamine mutation at residue 499 renders PPARγ resistant to rosiglitazone activation (26Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). PPARγ E499Q was also resistant to activation by other agonists (Fig. 1B). In addition, PPARγ E499Q displayed a much lower level of basal transcriptional activity compared with wild-type PPARγ or PPARγ Q286P. PPARγ Q286P Is Fully Adipogenic—Previous experiments have shown that immortalized fibroblasts derived from embryonic mice lacking PPARγ are completely unable to differentiate into adipocytes (8Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). However, ectopic expression of PPARγ in these fibroblasts restores their adipogenic potential. Therefore, we used these PPARγ-null cells to test the ability of the Q286P mutant to induce adipogenesis because the confounding effects of the endogenous PPARγ protein would be avoided. Retroviruses expressing wild-type PPARγ, PPARγ Q286P, and PPARγ E499Q were used to infect PPARγ-null cells. Expression of the proteins was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A), and all three PPARγ proteins were expressed at levels equivalent to those seen in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Following infection, cells were grown to confluence and then induced to undergo differentiation using a standard hormone treatment consisting of insulin, a glucocorticoid, and a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. As expected, control cells infected with an empty viral vector showed no lipid accumulation associated with adipogenesis (Fig. 2B). Cells expressing wild-type PPARγ demonstrated a large lipid accumulation, as evidenced by the red color produced by Oil Red O staining. Surprisingly, cells ectopically expressing the PPARγ Q286P mutant also accumulated extensive amounts of lipid when exposed to the hormone differentiation mixture. The lipid levels in wild-type PPARγ and PPARγ Q286P cells appeared to be virtually identical. Conversely, the PPARγ-null cells ectopically expressing PPARγ E499Q were completely resistant to lipid accumulation following hormone treatment. These data suggest that a functional AF-2 domain in PPARγ is still required for adipogenesis. To determine the adipogenic potential of PPARγ Q286P at a molecular level, the expression of mRNAs characteristic of mature fat cells was followed during the time course of differentiation. These mRNAs encode proteins involved in transcriptional control (SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c), PGC-1β (PPARγ co-activator-1β)), lipid synthesis (fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase), lipid uptake (lipoprotein lipase, aP2), insulin action (Glut4 (glucose transporter-4)), and the “endocrine” function of adipocytes (adiponectin, adipsin). In every case, these mRNA levels in PPARγ Q286P cells closely matched those seen in wild-type PPARγ cells (Fig. 2C). Therefore, there appeared to be no significant molecular differences between adipocytes produced by wild-type PPARγ and those produced by PPARγ with a mutant ligand-binding domain. However, PPARγ E449Q was unable to induce expression of any of these characteristic adipocyte mRNAs, again confirming the requirement for a functional AF-2 domain in the receptor for adipogenesis. The ability of PPARγ Q286P to induce adipogenesis in cell culture led us to question whether a similar effect could be seen in vivo, where differentiation would be regulated more physiologically rather than as a response to an artificial hormone treatment. Previous experiments have shown that the subcutaneous injection of undifferentiated preadipocytes into immunocompromised nude mice can result in the formation of a distinct fat pad (27Mandrup S. Loftus T.M. MacDougald O.A. Kuhajda F.P. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4300-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Green H. Kehinde O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, we injected the cells ectopically expressing these different PPARγ mutants into the skin above the sterna of nude mice (where there is little naturally occurring subcutaneous fat). 6 weeks after the injection, mice injected with cells expressing the wild-type PPARγ protein formed a distinct fat pad around the site of injection (Fig. 2D). Notably, a similar effect was seen with cells expressing the PPARγ Q286P protein. The fat pads from the wild-type PPARγ cells and the PPARγ Q286P cells expressed equivalent levels of aP2 mRNA, characteristic of mature adipocytes (data not shown). Cells without PPARγ and cells expressing the PPARγ E499Q protein were unable to form a fat pad when injected into the immunocompromised mice. These results suggest that a mutant ligand-binding domain that lacks a functional response to known ligands is not required for adipogenesis in response to either a hormone mixture or normal physiological signals. Nevertheless, an intact AF-2 domain is still required for adipogenesis in vivo. Despite intense efforts, the identity of a high affinity endogenous ligand for PPARγ that regulates adipogenesis remains unknown. Soon after the role of PPARγ in adipogenesis was first recognized (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar), 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 was identified as a powerful natural agonist for this receptor (19Forman B.M.

However, it is doubtful that there is a biologically sufficient level of this prostanoid present in adipocytes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can also activate PPARγ, albeit weakly. Therefore, these lipids are often invoked as a potential endogenous PPARγ ligand, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Fatty acid derivatives such as lysophosphatidic acid (29Zhang C. Baker D.L.

Oxidized lipids such as hydroxylated fatty acids 1-O-hexadecyl-2-azelaoylphosphatidylcholine (33Davies S.S. Pontsler A.V. Marathe G.K. Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. Hinshaw J.C. Prestwich G.D.

However, the role that any of these compounds play in the development of adipocytes is not known. This lack of success in identifying biologically relevant agonists led us to investigate whether the binding of a ligand to PPARγ is, in fact, required for this receptor's adipogenic activity. To test this notion, we took advantage of a naturally occurring PPARγ mutant that contains a glutamine-to-proline shift in the α-helix backbone of the ligand-binding domain. The introduction of a proline into an α-helix introduces a bend in the secondary structure (34Visiers I. Braunheim B.B. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The orientation and rotation of the post-proline α-helix are also shifted. In addition, Gln286 has been directly implicated in at least some ligand-binding structures (25Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar, 35Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). When tested for its ability to respond to PPARγ agonists, the Q286P mutant was completely resistant, making it an ideal tool for investigating the importance of ligand binding for PPARγ function. Surprisingly, when tested for its ability to promote adipogenesis, the PPARγ Q286P protein proved to be just as competent as its wild-type counterpart. No significant differences were observed in either morphological or gene expression or lipid characteristics of differentiation. In vivo, the PPARγ Q286P-expressing fibroblasts were able to differentiate into adipocytes. These results suggest that a functional ligand-binding domain, as defined by normal criteria, is not necessary for the adipogenic function of PPARγ. These data can be interpreted in several different ways. First, it is possible that PPARγ binds a ligand, both in cell culture and in vivo, in such a way that it can still activate the Q286P form of the receptor protein. Such a ligand is not known but cannot be entirely ruled out. Second, it is possible that a ligand is present during adipogenesis but produces a quantitative rather than qualitative effect. In the experiments presented here, PPARγ protein was expressed at levels equivalent to those seen in mature adipocytes rather than at levels found in preadipocytes, which are 10–20-fold lower. Because differentiation is initiated in preadipocytes, the higher levels of PPARγ protein expressed in our experiments may relieve the requirement for ligand activation. Last, although wild-type PPARγ may contain ligand-binding activity, it may not be required for the process of adipogenesis. The hormone treatment required to stimulate fat cell differentiation through PPARγ may trigger the induction of a co-activator protein. Although many co-activators require ligand binding to allow receptor docking, others, such as PGC-1α and pCAF, can activate nuclear hormone receptors, including PPARγ, in the absence of ligand binding. The ability to distinguish between these explanations will require further investigation. We thank members of the Spiegelman laboratory for helpful discussions, especially Drs. J. Ruas, W. Yang, S.

Overexpression of several ADAMs has been reported in human cancer, and we recently described the involvement of ADAM12 in liver injury (Le Pabic, H., Bonnier, D., Wewer, U.

In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library from human hepatocellular carcinoma to analyze binding partners of ADAM12. We identify RACK1, a receptor for activated protein kinase C (PKC), as a new ADAM12 interacting protein. RACK1 is up-regulated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and is highly expressed by activated hepatic stellate cells. We demonstrate the involvement of RACK1 in mediating the PKC-dependent translocation of ADAM12 to membranes of activated hepatic stellate cells. In particular, treatment of cells with phorbol esters enhances ADAM12 immunostaining in the membrane fractions and the co-immunoprecipitation of ternary complexes containing RACK1, ADAM12, and PKC. By using RNA interference, we demonstrate that inhibition of RACK1 expression diminishes the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent translocation of ADAM12 to membranes of hepatic stellate cells. Finally, hepatic stellate cells cultured on coated type I collagen induces relocalization of ADAM12 in the membrane, suggesting that this major matrix component in liver cancer and fibrogenesis might stimulate ADAM12 translocation to the cell membrane where its shedding activity takes place.

In addition, the ADAM12 tail interacts with eve-1, a EEN binding protein that acts as an adaptor module to inhibit the Ras stimulating activity of Sos2 (24Yam J.W. Jin D.Y. So C.W. Chan L.C.

More recently, the role of ADAM12 in modulating the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway has been suggested by the interaction of ADAM12 with both FLRG (follistatin-related gene), binding proteins to transforming growth factor-β superfamily members (26Bartholin L. Destaing O. Forissier S. Martel S. Maguer-Satta V. Jurdic P. Rimokh R. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the transforming growth factor type II receptor (TβRII) leading to an increase in transforming growth factor-β-dependent transcriptional activity (27Atfi A. Dumont E. Colland F. Bonnier D. L'Helgoualc'h A. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Clement B. Wewer U.M. Theret N. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, we screened a human hepatocellular carcinoma cDNA two-hybrid library using ADAM12 as bait, and identified RACK1 (Receptor of activated protein kinase C 1) as a new partner of ADAM12 in liver cancer. RACK1 is an homologue of the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (28Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), involved in membrane anchorage of multiple proteins including protein kinase C (29Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 30Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that, similarly to ADAM12, the mRNA steady state level of RACK1 was increased in hepatocellular carcinomas and the underlying fibrotic livers. In addition we showed that interaction between endogenous ADAM12 and RACK1 occurred in hepatic stellate cells. We further demonstrated that RACK1 is required for the PKCϵ dependent-translocation of ADAM12 to the hepatic stellate cell membrane. Evidence for the role of type I collagen as a potential physiological inducer of ADAM12 translocation strongly suggested that the extracellular matrix environment modulates ADAM12 activity during liver injury. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Full-length cDNA of ADAM12 was prepared as bait by PCR amplification and cloned into the pGBKT7 vector, which contains the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. For screening, a cDNA library from a pool of 10 human hepatocellular carcinomas was constructed in the EcoRI site of the pGADT7 vector, which includes the Gal4 activation domain. A total of 4 × 106 independent cDNA clones with an average insert size of ∼1.45 kb pairs (range of 0.5–4.0 kb pairs) were obtained. An aliquot of the resulting plasmid cDNA library was then transformed into AH109 yeast cells that had been transformed with pGBKT7 containing a full-length ADAM12 bait fused to the 1–147 amino acids of the GAL4 protein and screened on selection plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). After 3–5 days of incubation, positive clones were picked, and plasmid DNA was retransformed into Escherichia coli strain DH10B for further cloning and sequencing. GST Fusion Protein Binding Assay—Cultures of E. coli BL21 containing pGEX RACK1 plasmids were incubated with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 25 °C and GST fusion proteins were purified as previously described (31Chang B.Y. Chiang M. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20346-20356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Purified GST-RACK1 was incubated with in vitro translated ADAM12 products for 3 h at 4 °C and protein complexes were collected with addition of glutathione beads, washed three times in wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride (NaCl), and 0.02% Tween, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In Vitro Translation of Proteins—cDNA encoding full-length human ADAM12S and ADAM12L, cDNA encoding the prodomain, the metalloprotease domain, and the disintegrin domain (A12-PMD) (amino acids 1–512), cDNA encoding the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain (A12-PM) (amino acids 1–419), and cDNA encoding the disintegrin, the cysteine-rich domain, and the EGF-like domain (A12-DC) (amino acids 417–707) (32Wewer U.M.

In vitro translated products labeled or not with EasyTag™ l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were incubated with 1 μg of purified GST-RACK1 or GST as described above. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells were isolated from histologically normal specimens of partial hepatectomy from patients undergoing hepatic resection for liver metastases. Hepatocytes, activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and enriched fractions in liver macrophages were isolated as previously described (1Le Pabic H. Bonnier D. Wewer U.M. Coutand A. Musso O. Baffet G. Clement B. Theret N. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) were maintained in Williams' E medium containing 0.1% albumin, 1 mm l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, hydrocortisone, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human hepatic stellate cells and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Human hepatic stellate cells were transfected using AMAXA technologies (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pmax GFP-green vector encoding GFP (Amaxa) was used to monitor transfection efficiency. When specified, cells were plated on collagen type I dishes or on laminin, fibronectin, and collagen type IV-coated multiwell plates (BD Biosciences). All expression constructs for wild-type ADAM12 and chimeras of ADAM12 and enhanced green fluorescene protein (pEGFP-N1, Clontech) were prepared as previously described (33Hougaard S. Loechel F. Xu X. Tajima R. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The expression vector for HA-RACK1 was a gift from Dr. Cartwright (Stanford University). To knock down RACK1 expression, a pool of 3 chemically synthesized double-stranded RACK1 siRNA were used, these 3 target-specific siRNAs and control siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Tissue Samples—Liver tissue samples were obtained from 27 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing surgical resection of the tumor as previously described (34Theret N. Musso O. Turlin B. Lotrian D. Bioulac-Sage P. Campion J.P. Boudjema K. Clement B. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The intensity of necroinflammatory lesions were graded according to the METAVIR score: AO, no activity; A1, mild; A2, moderate; A3, severe. All tissue sections were routinely analyzed after staining with hematoxylin-eosin-saffran and Sirius red. Access to this material was in agreement with French laws and satisfied the requirements of the local Ethics Committee. Antibodies—For RACK1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody H-187 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunoprecipitation and a mouse monoclonal antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) was used for immunoblot analyses. Mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing the ADAM12 disintegrin domain (6E6, 8F8, 6C10) or polyclonal antibodies against the prodomain (rb132), the metalloprotease domain (rb128), or the cysteine-rich domain (rb122) were a gift from Prof. U. Wewer (Department of Biomedicine and BRIC, University of Copenhagen, Denmark). Rabbit antibodies against PKCϵ, HA peptides, and mouse monoclonal antibodies to Hsc70, actin, and β1-integrin-blocking antibody (P5D2) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit antibodies against C termini of Delta-like 1 (Dll1) were a generous gift from Prof. Logeat (35Six E.M. Ndiaye D. Sauer G. Laabi Y. Athman R. Cumano A. Brou C. Israel A. Logeat F. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Hepatic stellate cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors or siRNAs by the AMAXA method and cultured for 36 h. After one night in serum-starved medium, cells were treated for 15 min with 0.1 μm PMA and then lysed at 4 °C in RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% deoxycholate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Membrane fraction enrichment was performed as previously described (36Sundberg C. Thodeti C.K. Kveiborg M. Larsson C. Parker P. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51601-51611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into buffer (16.8 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.88 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors), homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer on ice, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting membrane-enriched pellets were dissolved in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were preincubated for 1 h with Sepharose-coupled protein-G beads (Amersham Biosciences) alone to reduce non-specific protein binding and followed by adsorption overnight to Sepharose-coupled protein G prebound with 2 μg of specific or control rabbit IgG. The beads were washed five times in buffer and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the appropriate antibodies. The bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Pierce) or anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) IgG antibodies using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Hepatic stellate cells, treated or not with PMA for 15 min at 4 °C were further incubated with 1 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin; Sigma), and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular proteins scraped into RIPA buffer (1 ml to a 100-mm Petri dish) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with streptavidin beads (Mag Select SA, Sigma). The magnetic beads were washed five times with extraction buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunostaining and Imaging—To detect ADAM12, hepatic stellate cells were plated on Permanox chamber slides supporting cell attachment (NUNC, Rochester, NY) for 24 h. Cells were treated with PMA for the indicated time, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. When indicated, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and further incubated with ADAM12 polyclonal antisera (rb122). The bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Pierce). For immunofluorescence studies, 48 h post-transfection, COS7 cells or subconfluent hepatic stellate cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-HA antibodies and then for 90 min with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The coverslips were washed, mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol and 1 mg/ml diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and viewed on a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope or the Automated microscope Leica DMRXA2 equipped with Photometrics CoolSnapES N&B camera driven by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Immunohistochemistry in liver tissues was performed on frozen sections with either ADAM12 antibodies common to the long and short variants as described (7Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), or RACK1 monoclonal antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories) as described (37Zindy P. Andrieux L. Bonnier D. Musso O. Langouet S. Campion J.P. Turlin B. Clement B. Theret N. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, incubated for 5 min in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and then transferred to 4 °C. After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with ADAM12 antibodies (rb122) or isotype controls for 30 min. Cells were washed and incubated with phycoerythrin conjugates for 20 min and finally rinsed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and used for flow cytometry analyses by using FACS ARIA (BD Biosciences). Real Time PCR—Total RNA were extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride method and first strand cDNA synthesis was achieved with SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed by the fluorescent dye SYBR Green methodology using the qPCR™ Core Kit for SYBR™ Green I from Eurogentec and the ABI Prism 7700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primer pairs for target genes were RACK1, sense 5′-TGGGATGGAACCCTGCG-3′, antisense 5′-GTATGGCCCACCAATCGCC-3′; ADAM12, sense 5′-GTTTGGCTTTGGAGGAAGCACAG-3′ and antisense 5′-TGCAGGCAGAGGCTTCTGAGG-3′; 18S, sense 5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3′; antisense 5′-TTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTC-3′. Using the comparative Ct method, the amount of target sequence in unknown samples normalized to the 18S reference, was expressed relative to a calibrator (mean of control in our assay). Identification of RACK1 as a Binding Partner of ADAM12—Using the full-length of human ADAM12 as bait, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cDNA library. An homology search in GenBank™ using the blast program showed that the cDNA fragments from several positive clones encode polypeptides containing 244 amino acid residues spanning five of the seven WD domains of GNB2L1, guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit β2-like 1 (GenBank accession number BC032006, 100% identity) (Fig. 1A). GNB2L1, also named RACK1 has been involved in intracellular signaling by recruiting and anchoring many proteins in specific subcellular compartments facilitating protein interaction in signaling complexes. To confirm the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid assay, we investigated the ADAM12-RACK1 interaction with in vitro binding experiments. RACK1 was expressed as a bacterial fusion protein with GST, purified on glutathione-agarose beads, and incubated with the in vitro translated transmembrane form, ADAM12L (110 and 90 kDa for the pro- and processed forms, respectively) and the spliced secreted form, ADAM12S (90 and 68 kDa for the pro- and processed forms, respectively). We observed that GST-RACK1 bound in vitro translated ADAM12S and ADAM12L, whereas the GST control did not (Fig. 1B, upper panel). These in vitro binding studies demonstrated that RACK1 interacts with ADAM12 and that the interaction did not involve the cytoplasmic tail. To further define the ADAM12 domains involved in RACK1 interaction, we generated different peptides including the prodomain, metalloprotease domain, and disintegrin domain (A12-PMD) (amino acids 1–512), the prodomain and the metalloprotease domain (A12-PM)(amino acids 1–419), or the disintegrin, the cysteine-rich domain, and the EGF-like domain (A12-DC) (amino acid 417–707) as previously described (32Wewer U.M. Morgelin M. Holck P. Jacobsen J. Lydolph M.C. Johnsen A.H. Kveiborg M. Albrechtsen R. J. Biol.

Couchman J.R. Wewer U.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The A12-PMD, A12-PM, and A12-DC peptides did not show significant interaction with GST-RACK1 suggesting that specific structural conformation of the protein combining at least metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine domains is required (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). In accordance with this observations, a fragment of ADAM12, which includes the metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains (amino-acids 142–739), was tagged with FLAG and cotransfected into COS7 cells alone or in combination with HA-RACK1. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG revealed that RACKI can interact with ADAM12 (Fig. 1C). To provide further evidence that ADAM12 interacts with RACK1, we examined their colocalization by immunofluorescence in cells coexpressing GFP-ADAM12 and HA-RACK1. As previously described (27Atfi A. Dumont E. Colland F. Bonnier D. L'Helgoualc'h A. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Clement B. Wewer U.M. Theret N. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), ADAM12 is localized predominantly in patched areas in the cell. Interestingly, we found that RACK1 extensively colocalized with ADAM12 (Fig. 1D). To show whether the interaction between ADAM12 and RACK1 occurs under physiological conditions, we used activated HSC previously described to express detectable endogenous ADAM12 (1Le Pabic H. Bonnier D. Wewer U.M. Coutand A. Musso O. Baffet G. Clement B. Theret N. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In immunoprecipitates prepared with preimmune antisera, no ADAM12 was coprecipitated. However, in the anti-RACK1 immunoprecipitates, we could clearly detect ADAM12 coprecipitating with RACK1, indicating that interaction can occur with physiological levels of these proteins (Fig. 1E). Accordingly, RACK1 and ADAM12 exhibited regions of colocalization within the cytoplasm as demonstrated by immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. 1F). Up-regulation of RACK1 and ADAM12 in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinomas and Association with Fibrogenesis—The finding of interaction between ADAM12 and RACK1 in human hepatic stellate cells and the previous observation of association of ADAM12 expression with fibrogenesis and liver cancer raised the question of whether the expression of RACK1 is induced in liver cancers because activated hepatic stellate cells play a key role in host-stroma response and contribute to matrix remodeling, facilitating tumor invasion (34Theret N. Musso O. Turlin B. Lotrian D. Bioulac-Sage P. Campion J.P. Boudjema K. Clement B. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2007466398,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. There is indirect and conflicting evidence about whether CFTR exists in cell membranes as monomers, dimers, or higher order oligomers. We measured fluorescence intensities and photobleaching dynamics of distinct fluorescent spots in cells expressing functional CFTR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras. Intensity analysis of GFP-labeled CFTR in live cells showed single-component distributions with mean intensity equal to that of purified monomeric GFP, indicating monomeric CFTR in cell membranes. Fluorescent spots showed single-step photobleaching, independently verifying that CFTR is monomeric. Results did not depend on whether GFP was added to the CFTR N terminus or fourth extracellular loop or on whether CFTR chloride conductance was stimulated by cAMP agonists. Control measurements with a CFTR chimera containing two GFPs showed two-step photobleaching and a single-component intensity distribution with mean intensity twice that of monomeric GFP. These results provide direct evidence for monomeric CFTR in live cells."

Sumoylation is thought to regulate the subcellular localization, stability, DNA binding, and/or transcriptional ability of its target proteins such as PML, Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP)1, IκBα, and heat shock transcription factor 2 (11Kim K.I.

Virtually As2O3, a chemotherapeutic agent clinically used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, induces PML sumoylation. Increased PML sumoylation induced by As2O3 treatment leads to the restoration of NBs disrupted by PML-RARα and then is followed by apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, which results in prolonged remission of the disease (12Muller S.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, a promising class of targeted anticancer agents, can block proliferation and induce cell death in a wide variety of transformed cells (16Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors block the activity of class I and II HDACs and induce histone acetylation, which leads to the relaxation of chromatin structure, enhanced accessibility of transcription machinery to DNA, and increased gene transcription (17Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors also induce acetylation of transcription factors, which alters their activities and the expression of their target genes (18Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that p53 acetylation induced by a HDAC inhibitor leads to expression of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax, PIG3, and NOXA (19Bandyopadhyay D. Mishra A. Medrano E.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Terui T. Murakami K. Takimoto R. Takahashi M. Takada K. Murakami T. Minami S. Matsunaga T. Takayama T. Kato J. Niitsu Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8948-8954PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of p53-independent apoptosis by HDAC inhibitor remain largely unknown. Here, we report PML acetylation as its novel post-transcriptional modification. PML acetylation is induced by trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor. This enhanced acetylation leads to increased PML sumoylation and may play a key role in TSA-induced apoptosis. This work provides new insights into the functional regulation of PML and the therapeutic mechanisms of treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Cell Culture—The sources of antibodies and plasmids and the cell culture conditions are detailed in the supplemental data. Transient Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, Immunofluorescence, and in Vitro and in Vivo Acetylation Assays—These were performed as described previously (21Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L.

Antibody Array Assay and Detection and Quantification of Apoptosis—These are also detailed in the supplemental data. In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—The in vitro sumoylation assay was performed essentially as described previously (21Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), except recombinant SUMO E1 ligase purchased from BIOMOL International was used instead of HeLa cell lysate. Cell Sorting—Cell sorting was performed using BD FACSAria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PML Exists as an Acetylated Protein in HeLa Cells Treated with Trichostatin A—HDAC inhibitors including TSA induce differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition to their effects on histones, HDAC inhibitors increase the acetylation level of several non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, and molecular chaperones, which are important for their effects on cancer cells (18Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to screen new acetylation targets of TSA with an antibody array assay combined with in vivo labeling of acetylated proteins with [14C]acetate. Seven spots indicating possible targets of TSA-induced acetylation were detected (supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 1A). We focused on one of these targets, PML, a multifunctional protein that is involved in apoptosis, tumor suppression, and cell cycle regulation (2Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). We set out to confirm whether PML was acetylated in vivo. The same anti-PML antibody as used in the antibody array assay immunoprecipitated an ∼79-kDa acetylated protein from lysates of TSA-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that PML existed as an acetylated protein in them. Of note, the antibody we used detected only a single band of PML, although PML has seven isoforms. The antibody was confirmed to be able to detect all PML isoforms, suggesting that this PML was the main one expressed in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1). PML Is Acetylated by p300 and GCN5 in Vitro—To test whether known histone acetyltransferases (HATs), p300 and GSN5, can acetylate PML, we performed an in vitro acetylation assay using GST-PML as a substrate. Both HATs acetylated PML in vitro (Fig. 2A), and we focused on the acetylation by p300 that occurred with higher efficiency. Use of a series of PML subdomains in the in vitro p300 acetylation assay indicated that PML would be acetylated on the C-terminal domain, amino acids 448–560 (supplemental Fig. S2). Inspection of the PML sequence in this region revealed the presence of 7 lysine residues (supplemental Fig. S2); therefore, we introduced a series of arginine substitutions to map the acetylation sites. Within the C-terminal domain of PML, only the substitution of arginine for lysine 487 (K487R) measurably reduced acetylation of PML by p300 among all the individual substitutions (Fig. 2B; mutations are designated by the codon number between Lys and Arg). When arginine substitutions for other lysines were combined with K487R, a further reduction of acetylation was observed with K515R (Fig. 2C). Acetylation of full-length PML was impaired by substitutions of K487R and K487R/K515R similarly to that of the C-terminal domain of PML (Fig. 2D). Our results indicate that the principal sites of p300 acetylation in PML will be lysines 487 and 515. PML Acetylation Is Increased in Response to TSA Treatment—We examined whether PML acetylation by p300 occurred in vivo at the same sites as identified in vitro. Wild-type PML and PML with the K487R/K515R mutations were designated as PML W and PML M, respectively. Coexpression of p300 enhanced PML W acetylation, whereas acetylation PML M was weak in the basal state and showed no significant response to p300 coexpression (Fig. 3A, top panel). The efficiency of immunoprecipitation was the same for all samples (Fig. 3A, middle panel), and the increase in acetylation of a 17-kDa protein by coexpression of p300, which suggested the induction of histone acetylation, was equal between transfectants with PML W and PML M (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). These results suggest that p300 acetylates PML in vivo at the same sites as identified in vitro. Next, we tested whether PML acetylation is induced by TSA. Similarly to the case of p300 coexpression, TSA treatment enhanced PML W acetylation, whereas acetylation of PML M was significantly reduced and showed no significant response to TSA treatment (Fig. 3B, top panel). Our results suggest that PML is an acetylation target of TSA and that PML acetylation in response to TSA largely occurs at the sites of acetylation by p300. Acetylation of PML in Response to TSA Is Associated with Enhanced PML Sumoylation—Because one of the PML acetylation sites, lysine 487, is located in the putative nuclear localization signal (amino acids 476–490), we first examined whether PML acetylation affected its nuclear localization to see the effect of acetylation on PML function. However, TSA treatment and the acetylation-defective mutation did not obviously affect PML nuclear localization or accumulation to NBs in immunofluorescent staining (supplemental Fig. S3). We next investigated whether PML acetylation affected its sumoylation, which is required for PML to exercise many of its functions. We set up an in vivo sumoylation system in which conjugation of SUMO to PML could be detected by Western analysis, resulting in the appearance of a novel 100-kDa protein expected to be sumoylated PML (21Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this system, coexpression of p300 and exposure to TSA resulted in a significant increase in sumoylation of PML W, whereas sumoylation of PML M was weak and not obviously affected by these treatments (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest the possibility that PML acetylation at lysines 487 and 515 enhances its sumoylation. Next, to verify that acetylated PML is directly sumoylated, we set up an in vitro sumoylation system in which recombinant HA-tagged PML protein was incubated with recombinant SUMO E1 and E2 ligase and SUMO with or without a prior acetylation reaction using [14C]acetyl-CoA. Autoradiography visualizing only acetylated PML demonstrated that acetylated PML was efficiently sumoylated (Fig. 4C, upper panel). Of note, sumoylation efficiency observed in the autoradiograph was much higher than that in immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody where acetylated and nonacetylated PML were visualized (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lane 2 versus lower panel, lane 2). These results indicate that acetylated PML may be preferentially sumoylated in vitro. PML Acetylation May Play an Important Role in TSA-induced Apoptosis—TSA treatment induces apoptosis in HeLa cells by unknown mechanisms (16Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In our previous study, PML sumoylation plays an important role in As2O3-induced apoptosis (21Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Given our findings that PML acetylation is associated with increased PML sumoylation, this may represent one of the mechanisms of TSA-induced apoptosis. We first examined whether PML was involved in TSA-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, we established HeLa cells stably transfected with an expression vector for small hairpin RNA against PML and an empty control vector and designated them as PML KD HeLa and control KD HeLa, respectively. Successful knocking down of PML was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-PML antibody (supplemental Fig. S4). TSA treatment caused the appearance of a sub-G1 peak in cell cycle analysis, a marker of apoptosis, in both cells. However, the ratio of apoptotic cells was reduced by ∼60% in PML KD HeLa compared with control KD HeLa, suggesting the involvement of PML in TSA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S5). We examined further using PML–/– MEFs. Notably, overexpression of PML W in PML–/– MEFs substantially increased TSA-induced apoptosis relative to cells transfected with an empty vector, whereas, PML M displayed an impaired ability to mediate apoptosis in response to TSA (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S6). An equal expression level of PML between PML W and PML M transfectants was confirmed (supplemental Fig. S6). These results further support the involvement of PML in TSA-induced apoptosis and suggest the importance of PML acetylation in conferring apoptosis by TSA. Next, we investigated the effect of PML sumoylation on PML-mediated apoptosis in response to TSA. Cotransfection of expression vectors for SUMO and Ubc9 further sensitized PML W transfectants to TSA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C, third and fourth lanes), whereas the proapoptotic effects of SUMO and Ubc9 were greatly reduced in control and PML M transfectants (Fig. 5C, first and second lanes and fifth and sixth lanes). Enhanced sumoylation of PML W induced by TSA and impaired sumoylation of PML M were observed also in PML–/– MEFs (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that sumoylation enhances PML-mediated apoptosis in response to TSA. To test this hypothesis, we created an expression vector for the PML-3K mutant, which had lysine-to-arginine mutations at all three PML sumoylation sites and cannot be sumoylated (22Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PML-3K in either the presence or absence of SUMO and Ubc9 had little or no effect on TSA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C, seventh and eighth lanes), indicative of a requirement for PML sumoylation in TSA-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest the hypothesis that enhanced PML sumoylation through PML acetylation is one of the mechanisms of TSA-induced apoptosis. Finally, to investigate the generality of the effects of TSA on PML among HDAC inhibitors, we used depsipeptide, another HDAC inhibitor that belongs to a different class. Depsipeptide enhanced acetylation and sumoylation of PML, and its apoptotic effect was increased by PML expression similarly to TSA (supplemental Fig. S8). These results further support the hypothetical importance of PML acetylation in HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis. The data presented here demonstrate that acetylation of PML may enhance its sumoylation and play an important role in the control of PML-dependent apoptosis in response to TSA exposure. Sumoylation of PML is necessary for NB formation (5Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss III, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 10Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the apoptotic effects of PML may be dependent on NB formation (see Introduction). Given our findings that PML acetylation is associated with increased PML sumoylation, this sumoylation-dependent NB formation may represent one of the mechanisms by which PML acetylation can enhance apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that coexpression of SUMO and Ubc9 enhances PML-dependent apoptosis by TSA, that acetylation-defective mutants of PML exhibit defects in sumoylation and apoptosis in response to TSA treatment, and that a sumoylation-impaired PML mutant (PML-3K) is also defective in TSA-mediated apoptosis. It should be noted that PML–/– MEF cells are still sensitive to apoptosis by TSA, although at a much reduced level compared with cells expressing PML. There may also be PML-independent apoptotic mechanisms that respond to TSA. This is not surprising, considering that TSA alters the expressions of various genes by the acetylation of histones and many kinds of transcription factors such as p53 (see Introduction). More work will be required to determine the individual contributions of these different actions of TSA on the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of cells. Acetylation of lysine leads to loss of its positive charge. In some cases, arginine, a positive charged amino acid, and glutamine, a noncharged one, are reported to mimic nonacetylated and acetylated lysine, respectively. We examined whether glutamine substitution at acetylation sites, lysines 487 and 515, had an enhancing effect on PML sumoylation. The PML mutant with glutamine substitution, however, showed impaired sumoylation in HeLa cells similarly to the one with arginine substitution (data not shown). Effects of acetylation other than the loss of positive charge or subtle differences of amino acid structure between lysine and glutamine may be important for PML sumoylation. Recent studies reveal that increasing numbers of proteins are targeted by both acetylation and sumoylation. However, the correlation between these modifications has hardly been investigated except the cases where both modifications competitively target the same lysine residue such as the cases of HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer 1) and MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) (23Stankovic-Valentin N. Deltour S. Seeler J. Pinte S. Vergoten G. Guerardel C. Dejean A. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2661-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Gregoire S. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2273-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This is the first report that suggests acetylation-dependent enhancement of sumoylation. Phosphorylation has been reported to regulate sumoylation. Recently, the classical sumoylation consensus motif (ψKXE) with an adjacent proline-directed phosphorylation motif (SP), ψKXEXXSP motif where ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and X is any residue, has been proposed as a phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif (25Hietakangas V. Anckar J. Blomster H.A. Fujimoto M. Palvimo J.J. Nakai A. Sistonen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 26Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 779-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Between the two acetylation sites, lysines 487 and 515, lysine 487 is the major acetylation site, and K487R affects sumoylation more than K515R (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). PML sumoylation is reported to occur at three lysine residues, lysine 65, 160, and 490 (22Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to discover whether acetylation at lysine 487 specifically affects sumoylation at any of these lysine residues, especially at the adjacent lysine 490. p53 also has a similar sequence where an acetylated lysine lies adjacent to a sumoylated lysine (supplemental Fig. S9), although the correlation between acetylation and sumoylation has not been investigated (27Kwek S.S. Derry J. Tyner A.L. Shen Z. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). KψψKXE might be a motif of acetylation-dependent sumoylation. In summary, our studies provide evidence for a new post-transcriptional modification of PML and a new mechanism of regulation of PML sumoylation, and establish a novel relationship between PML and TSA-induced apoptosis. This work provides new insights into the regulation of PML function and the control of protein sumoylation. Considering the large number of binding partners of PML and the key contributions of PML to the stability and function of the NBs, PML acetylation is likely to modulate multiple cell activities beyond apoptosis through regulation of recruitment or release of NBs components.

https://openalex.org/W2027180727,"Outer membrane-specific lipoproteins of Escherichia coli are released from the inner membrane through the action of Lol-CDE, which leads to the formation of a complex between the lipoprotein and LolA, a periplasmic chaperone. LolA then transfers lipoproteins to LolB, a receptor in the outer membrane. The structures of LolA and LolB are very similar, having an incomplete β-barrel covered with an α-helical lid forming a hydrophobic cavity inside. The cavity of LolA, but not that of LolB, is closed and thus inaccessible to the bulk solvent. Previous studies suggested that Arg at position 43 of LolA is critical for maintaining this closed structure. We show here, through a crystallographic study, that the cavity of the LolA(R43L) mutant, in which Leu replaces Arg-43, is indeed open to the external milieu. We then found that the binding of a fluorescence probe distinguishes the open/close state of the cavity. Furthermore, it was revealed that the hydrophobic cavity of LolA opens upon the binding of lipoproteins. Such a liganded LolA was found to be inactive in the release of lipoproteins from the inner membrane. On the other hand, the liganded LolA became fully functional when lipoproteins were removed from LolA by detergent treatment or transferred to LolB. Free LolA thus formed was inaccessible to a fluorescence probe. These results, taken together, reveal the LolA cycle, in which the hydrophobic cavity undergoes opening and closing upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively.

Periplasmic molecular chaperone LolA (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) binds to bacterial lipoproteins released from the inner membrane through the action of an ATP-binding cassette transporter LolCDE complex (2Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and then transfers lipoproteins to receptor LolB in the outer membrane (3Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). LolA thus transports hydrophobic acylated proteins from the inner to the outer membrane through the hydrophilic periplasm. About 80 species of Escherichia coli lipoproteins are sorted to the outer membrane by the Lol system composed of LolCDE, LolA, and LolB (4Tokuda H. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1693: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 1-6Google Scholar). Only the step catalyzed by the LolCDE complex requires ATP, the transfer of lipoproteins from LolA to LolB and LolB to the outer membrane efficiently occurring without energy input, and an intermediate LolA-lipoprotein complex is not detected in the periplasm under normal conditions. In contrast, the LolA(R43L) mutant causes periplasmic accumulation of lipoproteins, because it can bind to lipoproteins but cannot transfer them to LolB (6Miyamoto A. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of LolA and LolB are very similar to each other despite their dissimilar sequences (7Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both proteins comprise an incomplete β-barrel with an α-helical lid, which together form a hydrophobic cavity. The cavity is most likely the binding site for the acyl chains of lipoproteins. The crystal structure of LolA revealed an interesting function of the Arg at position 43, which was mutated to Leu in the LolA(R43L) mutant. Arg-43 is located in the loop connecting the β2 and β3 strands, and forms hydrogen bonds with some residues in the α-helical lid. Therefore, Arg-43 is speculated to play a critical role in the closing of the hydrophobic cavity of LolA. On the other hand, such a residue is not present in LolB, the hydrophobic cavity of which is open to the external milieu. From these observations, it seemed likely that the opening and closing of the LolA lid plays a critical role in the efficient energy-independent lipoprotein transfer to LolB (7Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we mutated Arg-43 to other residues and examined the activities of the resultant derivatives. The results were unexpected; Arg-43 was found to be dispensable for the release of lipoproteins from the inner membrane but important for the transfer of lipoproteins to LolB. Arg-43 weakens the hydrophobic interaction between LolA and lipoproteins. In contrast, Leu in place of Arg-43 causes a significant increase in the strength of the hydrophobic interaction with lipoproteins, thereby inhibiting the lipoprotein transfer to LolB (8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because Val or Ile could replace Arg-43 with only a marginal effect, the importance of hydrogen bonding between Arg-43 and lid residues was not clarified. Moreover, it has not yet been demonstrated that the LolA lid undergoes opening and closing upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively, although it was recently suggested that the efficient lipoprotein transfer to LolB is hindered by mutations affecting the possible lid motion of LolA (9Watanabe S Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Formation of the LolA(R43L)-lipoprotein complex required ATP hydrolysis by LolCDE as the formation of the LolA-lipoprotein complex did (8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, lipoproteins dissolved in a detergent did not form a complex with LolA or LolA(R43L) when the detergent was removed by rapid dilution or dialysis, or when LolA or LolA(R43L) was denatured and re-natured in the presence of lipoproteins. 4N. Yokota and H. Tokuda, unpublished observation. 4N. Yokota and H. Tokuda, unpublished observation. These observations suggest that the hydrophobic cavity is closed even in the LolA(R43L) mutant and that its opening is essential for lipoprotein binding. To elucidate the dynamic properties of the cavity lid, we solved the crystal structure of LolA(R43L) and then established an assay system that can distinguish the open/close state of the LolA hydrophobic cavity. Materials—Talon Co2+ affinity resin (Clontech) was used to purify hexahistidine-tagged proteins. Antibodies against LolA (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and Lpp (10Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5177-5182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were raised in rabbits as described. Tran35S-label (a mixture of 70% [35S]Met and 20% [35S]Cys, 1000 Ci/mol) was obtained from MP Biochemicals. IgGsorb was purchased from Enzyme Center Inc. Bacterial Strains and Media—E. coli K-12 strains, XL1-Blue (Stratagene), MC4100 (11Casadaban M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), and TT016 (6Miyamoto A. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), were used. The last strain carried the chromosomal lolA gene under the control of the lactose promoter-operator. E. coli B strain BL21(DE3) (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used for high level expression of His-tagged LolA proteins. Cells were grown on LB broth (Difco) or 2×YT broth (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). When required, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml spectinomycin, or 50 μg/ml ampicillin was added. Construction of Plasmids—For fluorescent bis-ANS 5The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acidsucrose monocaprateβ-d-fructopyranosyl-α-d-glucopyranosidemonodecanoateIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. binding assays, plasmids allowing higher level expression of His-tagged LolA(R43L) were constructed. For this, the R43L mutation was introduced into LolA-His by means of PCR with pSS2 (PT7lac-lolA-His) (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as a template and a pair of primers, R43L-F (5′-cagggcgatctgtgggtgaaaTTGccaaacttattcaactggcat-3′) and R43L-R (5′-atgccagttgaataagtttggCAAtttcacccacagatcgccctg-3′), in which the uppercase letters denote Leu. The mutant plasmid, pYOR43L (PT7lac-lolA(R43L)-His), thus constructed was amplified in E. coli XL1-Blue, and then the mutation was confirmed by sequencing of both strands. 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid β-d-fructopyranosyl-α-d-glucopyranosidemonodecanoate isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification of LolA Proteins—For crystallographic studies, His-tagged LolA(R43L) was overexpressed in TT016 cells harboring pAMR43L, which carried the gene for LolA(R43L)-His under the control of the arabinose promoter, and then purified as described previously (6Miyamoto A. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on LB-broth supplemented with 1 mm IPTG and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the A660 reached 0.8, LolA(R43L) was induced by the addition of 0.2% arabinose. Cells were grown for 2 h and then converted to spheroplasts according to the reported method (14Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Periplasmic fractions were obtained as spheroplast supernatants and then applied to a Talon column. The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 300 mm NaCl, and 2.0% sucrose monocaprate to remove lipoproteins associated with LolA(R43L) (9Watanabe S Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The lipoproteinfree LolA(R43L) was then eluted with buffer A supplemented with 150 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). The eluate containing LolA(R43L) was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 8 h. The purified LolA(R43L) was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and used for the crystallographic study. In later experiments for assaying of bis-ANS binding, Histagged LolA proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells harboring pSS2 (PT7lac-lolA-His) or pYOR43L (PT7lac-lolA(R43L)-His). The cells were grown on 2×YT broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml spectinomycin at 37 °C. When the culture A660 reached 0.8, the cells were induced for 1.5 h by the addition of 50 μm IPTG. Purification of LolA proteins on a Talon affinity column was performed as described above. The eluate was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) overnight at 4 °C, and then applied to a Mono Q column, which had been equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m). The fractions containing His-tagged LolA proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and then dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) overnight at 4 °C. The LolA-His and LolA(R43L)-His thus purified were used for bis-ANS binding. Determination of the LolA(R43L) Crystal Structure—The R43L derivative was crystallized in two crystal forms under the same crystallization conditions of 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.5), and 20% (v/v) glycerol at 20 °C. Diffraction experiments were performed at the RIKEN BL44B2 beam line of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) at -180 °C. The trigonal crystal form belongs to the space group P3221 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 61.0 Å, c = 78.8 Å (see Table 1), and is almost isomorphous with the crystal of the wild-type LolA. Another crystal form belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 35.9 Å, b = 63.0 Å, c = 40.7 Å, β = 100.1°. Both structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using the structure of wild-type LolA as an initial model. To reduce model bias, phases were improved by the single isomorphous replacement method with anomalous scattering of platinum atoms and the subsequent density modification method. The structures in the trigonal and monoclinic crystals were refined to resolutions of 2.35 and 1.85 Å, respectively. The coordinates and structural factors for crystals of LolA(R43L) mutant (trigonal and monoclinic forms) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org) under accession numbers P3221: 2ZPC and P21: 2ZPD, respectively.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics Values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell. r.m.s., root mean square.Rsym = ΣhklΣi|Ihkl,i – 〈Ihkl〉|/ΣhklΣiIhkl,i, Rwork = Σhkl|Fobs – Fcalc|/Σ|Fobs|, and Rfree was calculated with the 5% of the reflections not included for refinement as a test set Open table in a new tab Rsym = ΣhklΣi|Ihkl,i – 〈Ihkl〉|/ΣhklΣiIhkl,i, Rwork = Σhkl|Fobs – Fcalc|/Σ|Fobs|, and Rfree was calculated with the 5% of the reflections not included for refinement as a test set Purification of Liganded LolA Proteins—Liganded LolA proteins were prepared according to the method developed recently (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pSS9 (PT7lac-lolA-FLAG-Pal-His) or pYORP (PT7lac-lolA(R43L)-FLAG-Pal-His) were grown on 2×YT medium and induced for 1.5 h by the addition of 50 μm IPTG. These two plasmids encode FLAG-tagged LolA proteins and His-tagged Pal, each under the control of both the T7 promoter and lac operator (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Construction of pYORP was performed by the introduction of the R43L mutation into the lolA-FLAG gene on pSS9, as described above for the construction of pYOR43L. Liganded LolA proteins were obtained from the periplasm, as described for the purification of free LolA proteins, and then purified on a Talon affinity column and a gel filtration column (Superdex 75). Purification of mLolB—A soluble derivative of LolB, mLolB (3Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), was purified from the periplasm of E. coli MC4100 cells harboring pYKT102 (Ptac-mlolB). The cells were grown on 2× YT broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the culture A660 reached 0.8, the cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 1.5 h. Purification of mLolB was carried out on a cation exchange Mono S column, which had been equilibrated with 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). The column was developed with a linear gradient of NaCl. Fractions containing mLolB were then applied on an anion exchange Mono Q column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Purified mLolB was obtained in the pass-through fraction and then dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2). Preparation of Free LolA Proteins from Liganded LolA Proteins—Free LolA proteins were generated from FLAG-tagged LolA proteins complexed with His-tagged Pal by a detergent wash or incubation with mLolB. To remove Pal by washing with a detergent, the liganded LolA was incubated with 2% sucrose monocaprate at 30 °C for 1 h. To transfer Pal to mLolB, the LolA-Pal complex was incubated with a double amount of mLolB at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were then passed through a Talon column. Free LolA was purified from the Talon column-unbound fractions on a Mono Q column as described for the purification of His-tagged LolA proteins. Release of Lpp from Spheroplasts—The release of the major outer membrane lipoprotein, Lpp, from spheroplasts was examined as reported (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli MC4100 cells were converted into spheroplasts in the presence of 1 mm EDTA and 33 μg/ml lysozyme. The spheroplast suspension (300 μl) was kept on ice for 3 min with the specified LolA proteins. M63 minimal medium (750 μl) comprising 0.25 m sucrose, 20 μg/ml thiamine, 20 μg/ml thymine, 40 μg/ml each of all amino acids except Met and Cys, and 10 μCi of Tran35S-label was then added for 2-min labeling at 30 °C. The labeling was chased for 2 min by the addition of non-radioactive Met and Cys (each at 12 mm). The release reaction was terminated by chilling the reaction mixture in ice water, followed by fractionation into spheroplasts and medium by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min, and then analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as reported (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Binding of bis-ANS—LolA proteins at the specified concentrations were incubated in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) in the presence of 5 μm bis-ANS for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was then measured with a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer RF-5000. The dye was excited at the wavelength of 390 nm. Emission spectra were collected in the range of 420–620 nm. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) or, in the case of Lpp, Hussain et al. (10Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5177-5182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric quantification was performed with an ATTO Densitograph. Structure of the LolA(R43L) Derivative—Two forms of LolA(R43L) crystals, trigonal and monoclinic ones (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively), were obtained under the same conditions, and the structures were refined to resolutions of 2.35 and 1.85 Å (Table 1), respectively. The structure of the trigonal crystal of R43L was almost identical to that of LolA. The value of the root mean square deviation against the trigonal crystal of LolA (PDB ID: 1UA8) was 0.52 Å. Therefore, the trigonal crystal of LolA(R43L) was a closed form. The strands forming the molecular framework of the monoclinic crystal of LolA(R43L) could be well superimposed on those of the trigonal form of LolA(R43L), whereas the positions of the α2 and α3 helices of the two crystals were significantly different (Fig. 1, C and D). In particular, the α2 helix plugging the cavity had moved outward by ∼6 Å in the monoclinic form (Fig. 1E), indicating that this crystal is an open form. The loop connecting the β8 and β9 strands (loop 8–9) also showed a large deviation of ∼5 Å. Aromatic residues (Phe-20, Phe-47, Trp-49, Phe-90, Trp-101, Tyr-104, Phe-127, Phe-140, and Tyr-152) cluster around the entrance to the cavity of LolA (Fig. 2, A and B). These residues are significantly conserved among LolA homologues (7Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the closed form, Phe-90 located in the α2 helix interacts with other aromatic residues in the β-sheet region such as Phe-47 and Trp-49 (Fig. 2A). Consequently, the entrance is shielded from the bulk solvent by these residues. On the other hand, these interactions are abolished in the open state (Fig. 2B), rendering the cavity open to the external milieu. Irrespective of whether LolA was the closed or open form, the peptide bond between Leu-43 and Pro-44 remained in the cis-type conformation (Fig. 2, C and D), which places the side chain of Arg-43 inside of the wild-type LolA molecule (7Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, because the side chain of Leu-43 with no polar atoms cannot fix the helices through hydrogen bonding, the temperature factors for the main-chain atoms exhibited significant deviations (data not shown). Thus, the crystal structure of LolA(R43L) revealed that Arg-43 indeed plays an important role in the closing of the hydrophobic cavity of LolA, as previously speculated. However, because R43L also existed in the closed form, residues other than Arg-43 also contribute to the formation of a closed form. Binding of bis-ANS in the Hydrophobic Cavity of LolA—The crystal structure of LolA(R43L) revealed that the derivative exists in not only a closed conformation but also an open conformation (Figs. 1 and 2). On the other hand, the formation of the LolA(R43L)-lipoprotein complex required the lipoprotein release reaction involving LolCDE as the formation of the LolA-lipoprotein complex did (8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, the physiological significance of the open form of LolA(R43L) remained unclear. To establish an assay system that can easily distinguish the open/close structures of LolA and LolA(R43L), we examined the binding of some fluorescent probes and found that the binding of bis-ANS was significantly different between LolA and LolA(R43L). The fluorescence of bis-ANS has been reported to significantly increase when it binds to a hydrophobic environment (16Pastukhov A.V. Ropson I.J. Proteins. 2003; 53: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS was very low in the absence of LolA proteins (Fig. 3A, inset). Moreover, the emission maximum was observed at different wavelengths in the presence and absence of LolA proteins. The increase in the bis-ANS fluorescence was only marginal with wild-type LolA, whereas it was remarkable with the LolA(R43L) derivative (Fig. 3A), indicating that bis-ANS can gain access to the hydrophobic cavity of LolA(R43L) but not that of LolA. We previously reported large scale preparation of the LolA-lipoprotein complex (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine whether or not the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS is affected by lipoprotein binding to LolA proteins, homogenous LolA-Pal and LolA(R43L)-Pal complexes were purified (Fig. 3B). The fluorescence intensity was then examined in the presence of these complexes (Fig. 3A). Both complexes significantly increased the bis-ANS fluorescence to essentially the same level. Moreover, the fluorescence intensities with these complexes were almost the same as that with free LolA(R43L) (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that the major fraction of LolA(R43L) exists in the open conformation. Moreover, because the fluorescence intensities induced by LolA(R43L) were essentially the same whether Pal was bound or not, it is clear that bis-ANS binds to the same site of LolA(R43L) irrespective of the presence or absence of Pal. It should be worthy of note that the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the LolA-Pal complex was unchanged even after 1-h incubation, indicating that bis-ANS binds to the hydrophobic cavity but does not compete with lipoproteins for the binding site. Regeneration of the Closed Conformation of LolA Proteins—Because the homogenous LolA-lipoprotein complex was prepared only recently, it was not known whether or not a liganded LolA is active in the lipoprotein release reaction. Furthermore, it was also unknown whether or not free LolA generated from the liganded LolA is active in the release reaction. To address these issues, the release of Lpp from spheroplasts was examined in the presence of various LolA proteins (Fig. 4A). The release of Lpp was absolutely dependent on LolA, as previously reported (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The liganded LolA or LolA(R43L) was completely inactive in the release reaction. Lipoproteins bound to LolA can be removed by washing with a detergent, sucrose monocaprate (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), or by lipoprotein transfer reaction to mLolB, a soluble version of LolB (3Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The LolA-Pal complex was subjected to these treatments, and then free LolA regenerated was used for the lipoprotein release assays (Fig. 4A). Regenerated free LolA was found to be completely active as to the lipoprotein release reaction. The bis-ANS fluorescence intensities were examined in the presence of the regenerated free LolA used in Fig. 4A. The high fluorescence intensities observed with the LolA-Pal complex were near completely abolished with free LolA regenerated from the complex on treatment with sucrose monocaprate or mLolB (Fig. 4B). All these results, taken together, indicate that the hydrophobic cavity of LolA opens upon lipoprotein binding and then closes upon lipoprotein release and that only free LolA is active as to the lipoprotein release reaction. The structures of LolA and LolB are characteristic comprising an incomplete β-barrel covered by an α-helical lid, which together form a hydrophobic cavity (7Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis revealed that LolA(R43L) exists in both open and closed forms (Fig. 1), the latter of which is essentially identical to that of wild-type LolA. These results indicate that Arg at position 43 is indeed important for stabilization of the closed conformation of LolA, as previously speculated (7Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The open/close state of the hydrophobic cavity was found to be possible to monitor by means of fluorescent bis-ANS binding (Fig. 3). The fluorescence increase induced by LolA(R43L) was almost instantaneous, whereas the fluorescence of bis-ANS did not increase even when it was incubated with wild-type LolA for a long period (data not shown). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity scarcely increased even when LolA(R43L) bound to Pal (Fig. 3), indicating that the open conformation comprises the major fraction of LolA(R43L). However, the formation of the LolA(R43L)-lipoprotein complex still required ATP hydrolysis by LolCDE. It seems therefore likely that the LolCDE-dependent ATP hydrolysis is required for the correct transfer of lipoproteins from the inner membrane to LolA and LolA(R43L). It was suggested recently that the energy liberated on ATP hydrolysis is transmitted to membrane subunits LolC and/or LolE and then utilized for the lipoprotein transfer to LolA (17Taniguchi N. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8538-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the convenient bis-ANS binding assay, the hydrophobic cavity of wild-type LolA was shown to undergo opening and closing upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, liganded forms of LolA and LolA(R43L) were found to be inactive as to the lipoprotein release reaction, whereas regeneration of free LolA caused recovery of the activity (Fig. 4A). We recently found that free LolA does not inhibit the transfer of lipoproteins from the liganded LolA to LolB (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that LolA undergoes a conformational change upon the binding of lipoproteins. This conformational change is critical for specific interaction between liganded LolCDE and free LolA and between liganded LolA and LolB. We recently established an experimental system by which a large amount of the LolA-lipoprotein complex can be purified (13Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex is of great importance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the transport and sensing of the complex lipid materials in the bacterial periplasm. Three other proteins were recently found to have very similar structures to those of LolA and LolB. LppX (PDB ID: 2BYO) is a lipoprotein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has been speculated to accommodate complex lipids in its hydrophobic cavity for their transport to the outer layers of the cell (18Sulzenbacher G. Canaan S. Bordat Y. Neyrolles O. Stadthagen G. Roig-Zamboni V. Rauzier J. Maurin D. Laval F. Daffé M. Cambillau C. Gicquel B. Bourne Y. Jackson M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1436-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The second one is the N-terminal domain of E. coli RseB (PDB ID: 2V42, 2V43, and 2P4B), which constitutes a signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of σE expression. It is speculated that mislocalized lipoproteins bind to the hydrophobic cavity of the N-terminal domain of RseB, which is critical for activation of the periplasmic quality control mechanism (19Wollmann P. Zeth K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 927-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Kim D.Y. Jin K.S. Kwon E. Ree M. Kim K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8779-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The third one is VioE (PDB ID: 3BMZ, 2ZF3, and 2ZF4) of Chromobacterium violaceum, which is speculated to play a key role in the biosynthesis of violacein (21Hirano S. Asamizu S. Onaka H. Shiro Y. Nagano S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6459-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Ryan K.S. Balibar C.J. Turo K.E. Walsh C.T. Drennan C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6467-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a purple pigment with antibacterial and cytotoxic properties. The functions of the hydrophobic cavities of these proteins remain only speculation. We revealed here that the hydrophobic cavity of LolA is the binding site for lipoproteins and its opening is essential for the LolA function. We are currently examining bis-ANS binding to the hydrophobic cavity of LolB with or without lipoproteins. We thank Rika Ishihara for technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2029599074,"Analysis of seismograms from a magnitude 3.9 seismic event on 6 August 2007 in central Utah reveals an anomalous radiation pattern that is contrary to that expected for a tectonic earthquake and which is dominated by an implosive component. The results show that the seismic event is best modeled as a shallow underground collapse. Interestingly, large transverse surface waves require a smaller additional noncollapse source component that might represent either faulting in the rocks above the mine workings or deformation of the medium surrounding the mine. Seismic moment tensor results for nuclear explosions, explosion and other mining cavity collapses, and tectonic earthquakes are compared, and the separation of the different populations indicates that the seismic moment tensor may be used for source-type discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W1965841046,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae zinc cluster regulator War1 mediates an essential transcriptional and adaptive response to weak organic acid stress. Here we investigate the mechanism of War1 activation upon weak acid stress. We identified several gain-of-function WAR1 alleles mapping to the central War1 region.

Functional analysis of War1 reveals that the central region and its C-terminal activation domain are required for function. Notably, the native DNA-binding and dimerization domains appear dispensable for War1 activity, because they can be replaced by a LexA DNA-binding domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates elevated promoter affinity of activated War1, because its PDR12 promoter association increases upon stress. Hyperactive WAR1 alleles have constitutively high PDR12 promoter association. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer of functional CFP-War1-YFP proteins also demonstrates conformational changes of stress-activated War1 in vivo.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, uncharged weak acids diffuse across the plasma membrane and dissociate inside the cell, causing intracellular acidification, free radical production, and oxidative stress (1Piper P. Calderon C.O. Hatzixanthis K. Mollapour M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), as well as inhibition of several metabolic processes (2Krebs H.A. Wiggins D. Stubbs M. Sols A. Bedoya F. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The yeast ABC transporter Pdr12 confers resistance to monocarboxylic acids with chain lengths up to C7 (3Holyoak C.D. Bracey D. Piper P.W. Kuchler K. Coote P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4644-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Piper P. Mahé Y. Thompson S. Pandjaitan R. Holyoak C. Egner R. Mühlbauer M. Coote P. Kuchler K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Only organic acids but not other stresses cause a dramatic induction of PDR12 transcription and a concomitant increase of Pdr12 (4Piper P. Mahé Y. Thompson S. Pandjaitan R. Holyoak C. Egner R.

Piper P.W. Yeast. 2003; 20: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A physiological role of Pdr12 is suggested from its proposed ability to extrude amino acid catabolism by-products (6Hazelwood L.A. Tai S.L. Boer V.M. de Winde J.H. Pronk J.T. Daran J.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Weak acid regulation of PDR12 occurs at the level of transcription and requires the Zn(II)2Cys6 zinc cluster transcription factor War1, which recognizes and binds response elements within the PDR12 promoter (7Kren A. Mamnun Y.M. Bauer B.E. Schüller C. Wolfger H. Hatzixanthis K. Mollapour M. Gregori C. Piper P. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). War1 is functionally conserved among several yeast species, including fungal pathogens. An orthologue mediating sorbate tolerance was identified in the distantly related human fungal pathogen Candida albicans (8Lebel K. MacPherson S. Turcotte B. Yeast. 2006; 23: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which weak organic acids cause War1 activation is currently an open question.In S. cerevisiae, some 55 members of the binuclear zinc cluster regulator family exist (for a review see Ref. 9MacPherson S. Larochelle M. Turcotte B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 583-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Most exhibit a similar molecular architecture and domain organization. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain is followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain, by an extended region of limited homology referred to as the “middle homology region” (MHR), 3The abbreviations used are: MHRmiddle homology regionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferORFopen reading frameCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinWAREweak acid response element3-AT3-amino-1,2,4-triazoleABCATP-binding cassette. 3The abbreviations used are: MHRmiddle homology regionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferORFopen reading frameCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinWAREweak acid response element3-AT3-amino-1,2,4-triazoleABCATP-binding cassette. and finally by a short acidic stretch encompassing the C-terminal activation domain (10Todd R.B. Andrianopoulos A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 1997; 21: 388-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Fungal zinc cluster proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including carbon and amino acid metabolism, stress response, mitochondrial signaling, peroxisome biogenesis, and ergosterol biosynthesis (9MacPherson S. Larochelle M. Turcotte B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 583-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).A common principle as to the function of these regulators is only beginning to emerge. Like War1 (7Kren A. Mamnun Y.M. Bauer B.E. Schüller C. Wolfger H. Hatzixanthis K. Mollapour M. Gregori C. Piper P. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), many other zinc cluster proteins permanently localize to the nucleus and constitutively bind their target promoters. Some of them are activated by small molecule stimuli such as drugs, fatty acids, and metabolic intermediates. For example, Pdr1 and Pdr3 directly bind structurally diverse xenobiotics to induce transcription of drug transporter genes (11Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Naar A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Put3 regulates proline utilization genes and is controlled by direct interaction with proline (12Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, Leu3, a regulator of leucine biosynthesis, binds its target promoters and is only activated in the presence of the leucine precursor α-isopropyl malate (13Kirkpatrick C.R. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4021-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Wang D. Hu Y. Zheng F. Zhou K. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19017-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Mutations within the MHR can lead to hyperactive alleles, as shown for Leu3, Pdr1/Pdr3, as well as Hap1, indicating a crucial regulatory function of this domain (16Zhou K.M. Bai Y.L. Kohlhaw G.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Kolaczkowska A. Kolaczkowski M. Delahodde A. Goffeau A. Mol. Genet.

Several zinc cluster proteins are activating their target genes in response to a signal generated through the interaction with small ligand molecules (19Sellick C.A. Reece R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Reece R.J. Beynon L. Holden S. Hughes A.D. Rebora K. Sellick C.A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2006; 73: 85-96Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This may also be true for War1, which is tightly regulated by weak acids, but high level War1 overexpression is not sufficient for increased PDR12 transcription. Nevertheless, regulation of War1-like zinc cluster factors is a rapid and highly dynamic process, despite constitutive War1 localization in the nucleus and the apparent absence of stress-transducing mechanisms such as mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, for example. Notably, as for War1, activation of several zinc cluster factors triggers appearance of phosphorylated forms, and it is not entirely clear whether phosphorylation is the cause or consequence of activation. The rapid weak acid-triggered activation of War1 is accompanied by the concomitant appearance of several phosphorylated War1 isoforms (7Kren A. Mamnun Y.M. Bauer B.E. Schüller C. Wolfger H. Hatzixanthis K. Mollapour M. Gregori C. Piper P. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Gregori C. Bauer B. Schwartz C. Kren A. Schüller C. Kuchler K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3094-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Schüller C. Mamnun Y.M. Mollapour M. Krapf G. Schuster M. Bauer B.E. Piper P.W. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As reported recently, exposure to the drug fluphenazine causes transient activation of the zinc cluster proteins Pdr1/Pdr3 on a similar time scale (23Fardeau V. Lelandais G. Oldfield A. Salin H. Lemoine S. Garcia M. Tanty V. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Devaux F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5063-5074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Here we investigated how weak acids change the activity of War1 in vivo. To identify regulatory domains and residues of War1, we devised a random mutagenesis screen to isolate hyperactive alleles and performed deletion analysis. Two lines of evidence suggest dynamic changes of War1 structure in response to weak acid stress. First, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) show increased and strong recruitment of War1 to its target promoter, suggesting a higher promoter affinity of activated War1. Second, FRET analysis suggests that conformational changes of War1 occur in stressed cells in vivo. Furthermore, inactive and hyperactive War1 mutant alleles appear locked in the inactive or the activated conformation, respectively. The latter War1 variants also show constitutive behavior regarding promoter binding. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism by which War1 activation is triggered by stress, leading to the adaptive transcriptional response triggering overexpression of the Pdr12 pump.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. Rich medium (YPD) and synthetic medium (SC) were prepared as described elsewhere (24Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). All yeast strains were grown at 30 °C. For weak acid susceptibility, exponentially growing cultures were adjusted to A600 of 0.2 and diluted 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1,000, and equal volumes were spotted onto YPD, pH 4.5, plates containing different sorbate concentrations (7Kren A. Mamnun Y.M. Bauer B.E. Schüller C. Wolfger H. Hatzixanthis K. Mollapour M. Gregori C. Piper P. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The strain YCG8 used for the mutant screen was constructed as follows. A 1000-bp PCR fragment of the PDR12 promoter was cloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pRS306 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) giving pRS306-PDR12. Then a PCR fragment, including the HIS3 ORF plus 160 bp of its 3′ region amplified from pRS303 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pRS306-PDR12. The resulting plasmid pCG4 containing the HIS3 gene under the control of the PDR12 promoter was linearized with EcoRV and integrated into the ura3-1 locus of W303-1A, creating strain YCG7. Correct integration was verified by genomic PCR. For strain YCG8, a 1880-bp fragment containing a KANR deletion cassette, flanked by 170 bp of the promoter and 175 bp of the terminator region of WAR1, was amplified from the strain Y06734 (war1Δ::Kan-Mx4 EURO-SCARF collection) and used to delete the WAR1 gene from YCG7. Correct integration was verified by PCR, and loss of War1 function was tested by growth inhibition assays on sorbate.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeRef.W303-1AMATa ura3-1 ley2-3,112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-10049FY1679-28cMATa ura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ6342YAK100MATa war1Δ::His3-Mx6 (isogenic to FY1679-28c)7YAK120MATa war1Δ::His3-Mx6 (isogenic to W303-1A)7YCS42-D4MATa leu2 Δ1 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ1 ade2-10oc lys2-801a ura3-52::pCS12ZI URA3 war1-4221YAK2MATa ura3::PDR12-lacZ (isogenic to W303-1A)7YBB27MATa ura3::PDR12-lacZ war1Δ::HIS3MX6 (isogenic to W303-1A)22YCG7MATa URA3-PPDR12HIS3 (isogenic to W303-1A)This studyYCG8MATa war1Δ::Kan-Mx4 (isogenic to YCG7)This studyL40MATa his3-200 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA::(lexAop)s-lacZ GAL4 gal80Stan Hollenberg Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Plasmids used in this studyNameRelevant DNA insertRef.pGalWAR1GAL1-10Pro-WAR1This studypGalWAR1-K762RGAL1-10Pro-WAR1-K762RThis studypBTM116lexAStan HollenbergpBWARlexA-WAR1This studypBWARΔ300lexA-WAR1Δ1-300This studypBWARΔ762lexA-WAR1Δ1-762This studypBWARΔ1950lexA-WAR1Δ1-1950This studypBWARΔ2460lexA-WAR1Δ1-2460This studypCGWAR1WAR121pCGWAR1-S368LWAR1-S368LThis studypCGWAR1-K762RWAR1-K762RThis studypCGWAR1-K762DWAR1-K762DThis studypCGWAR1-K762FWAR1-K762FThis studypCGWAR1-R764ΔWAR1-R764Δ21pAWYADHPro-WAR1-YFPThis studypAWCADHPro-WAR1-CFPThis studypACWYADHPro-CFP-WAR1-YFPThis studypACWY-S368LADHPro-CFP-WAR1-S368L-YFPThis studypACWY-K762RADHPro-CFP WAR1-K762R-YFPThis studypACWY-42ADHPro-CFP-WAR1-42-YFPThis studypPS1887NLS-CFP27pPS1888NLS-YFP27pPS1889NLS-CFP-YFP27 Open table in a new tab Plasmid pGalWAR1 is a derivative of pAMG (26Görner W.

The ADH1 promoter was replaced by the GAL1-10 promoter using the KspI and SalI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid pGMG (kindly provided by W. Reiter) was used for replacement of the MSN2-GFP construct with the entire WAR1 gene, including 0.5-kb 3′ region via the SalI and NotI restriction sites. pGalWAR1-K762R was generated by replacing a 2440-bp NsiI fragment of pGalWAR1 by the corresponding fragment from pCGWAR1-K762R.To construct plasmids expressing LexA-War1, the WAR1 ORF was amplified from W303-1A genomic DNA introducing a5′ EcoRI site, followed by an NcoI site at the WAR1 start codon and a PstI site after the stop codon, and finally cloned into pBTM116 (Stan Hollenberg, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) creating plasmid pBWAR1. Further N-terminal deletion derivatives were generated taking advantage of the unique NcoI site of pBWAR1.Plasmids for FRET Analysis—pAWY was created in two steps from pAMG (26Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) by replacing the NcoI-HindIII green fluorescent protein fragment with YFP, and the MSN2 sequences by a WAR1 fragment flanked by SalI and NcoI giving pYCplac111-AWY. The entire construct, including the ADH1 promoter, was cloned as a KspI-HindIII fragment into pRS316. pAWC was created from pAMG by replacing the NcoI-HindIII green fluorescent protein fragment with CFP and the MSN2 sequences by WAR1 (SalI and NcoI). For pACWY, an XhoI-SalI CFP fragment was introduced into the SalI site of pYCplac111-AWY. pACWY-K762R, pACWY-S368L, and pACWY-42 are derivatives of pACWY encoding the corresponding WAR1 gain-of-function variants, as well as the loss-of-function mutant war1-42 (21Gregori C. Bauer B. Schwartz C. Kren A. Schüller C. Kuchler K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3094-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) generated by replacing an internal NsiI fragment. Plasmids pPS1887 (NLS-CFP), pPS1888 (NLS-YFP), and pPS1889 (NLS-CFP-YFP) encoding fluorescent proteins were kindly provided by Pamela Silver (27Damelin M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and are referred to as pNLS-CFP, pNLS-YFP, and pNLS-CFP-YFP in this study.Random Mutagenesis and Screening for Constitutively Active War1 Mutants—The plasmid pCGWAR1 (21Gregori C. Bauer B. Schwartz C. Kren A. Schüller C. Kuchler K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3094-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was mutagenized in vitro (28Rose M.D. Fink G.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 1047-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 10 μg of plasmid DNA were dissolved in 0.5 ml of hydroxylamine solution (90 mg of NaOH, 350 mg of hydroxylamine-HCl in 5 ml of water, pH 6.5, freshly prepared before use) and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 5 m NaCl, 50 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and 1 ml of ethanol. After ethanol precipitation at -80 °C, the plasmid DNA was re-precipitated three times with ethanol and then dissolved in water. As a second method for mutagenesis, pCGWAR1 was passed through mutator strain XL1red (Stratagene) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Finally, the pool of mutagenized plasmid DNAs obtained by both methods was transformed into yeast recipient strain YCG8. Transformants growing on medium lacking leucine were washed from agar plates, and ∼100 colonies from each transformation were plated on selective plates containing 50 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) (Sigma). Growing colonies were selected for further analysis.Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, cell-free extracts were prepared by the trichloroacetic acid method exactly as described previously (29Mamnun Y.M. Schüller C. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Strains were grown to an A600 of 1; the cultures were split, and one-half was stressed with 8 mm potassium sorbate. Cell lysates equivalent to 0.5 A600 units were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. War1 and Pdr12 were visualized by immunoblotting using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and the polyclonal anti-War1 (21Gregori C. Bauer B. Schwartz C. Kren A. Schüller C. Kuchler K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3094-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and anti-Pdr12 antisera (4Piper P. Mahé Y. Thompson S. Pandjaitan R. Holyoak C. Egner R. Mühlbauer M. Coote P. Kuchler K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4257-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were carried out in triplicate using total cell-free crude glass bead extracts as described previously (24Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total yeast RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method. About 20 μg of total RNA were separated on a 1.4% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blots were hybridized with PCR-amplified probes and radiolabeled by incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP and a MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Methylene blue staining was used as control for equal RNA loading. The radiolabeled probes were added to the prehybridization solution after purification on a NICK column (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed at 65 °C three times in 2× SSC, 1% SDS, and three times in 1× SSC, 1% SDS, and then exposed to x-ray films at -70 °C or analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Storm 1840; GE Healthcare).DNA Microarray Experiments—50-ml cultures of YAK120 either transformed with pGalWAR1 or pGalWAR1-K762R were grown in YP + 2% raffinose to an A600 of about 0.8 before adding galactose at a final concentration of 2% w/v. After 1 h, cells were harvested, washed, and immediately frozen. Total RNA was prepared by hot phenol method. RNA concentration was measured at 260 nm in TE, pH 7. Samples of 20 μg of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with either Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP. Labeled cDNAs were pooled, and RNA was hydrolyzed for 20 min in 50 mm NaOH at 65 °C, followed by neutralization with acetic acid.Hybridization to whole genome cDNA microarrays (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada) was done in DigEasyHyb (Roche Applied Science) solution at 37 °C overnight with 70 μg of salmon sperm DNA/ml as a carrier. Microarrays were washed three times in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, followed by a 1-min wash in 1× SSC at room temperature. Glass slides were spun dry for 5 min at 500 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge, scanned on an Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices), and analyzed and normalized using Gene Pix Pro4.1 software (Axon). DNA microarrays and protocols were obtained from the Ontario Cancer Institute. All microarray experiments were carried out with independent RNA preparations. Microarray data sets are MIAME-compliant and have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE8399).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR assays were performed as described elsewhere (30Alepuz P.M. Jovanovic A. Reiser V. Ammerer G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A 50-ml yeast culture in YPD medium was grown to A600 of 0.4-0.6, treated with 8 mm sorbate for 20 min, or left untreated. For cross-linking, yeast cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation with polyclonal anti-War1 antibodies (21Gregori C. Bauer B. Schwartz C. Kren A. Schüller C. Kuchler K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3094-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C, and co-precipitated DNA was amplified by PCR and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The oligonucleotides Pdr12s 5′-TTTCACCTGTGATGGTGGAC-3′ and Pdr12as 5′-TGAGCCATAGCCGAAAGATC-3′ binding in the PDR12 promoter region were used, giving a 320-bp PCR product covering both WAREs identified previously (7Kren A. Mamnun Y.M. Bauer B.E. Schüller C. Wolfger H. Hatzixanthis K. Mollapour M. Gregori C. Piper P. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Primers specific for CLB2 promoter served as internal control; the primers Clb2-up 5′-ACTCCTTCTAATCAAACACGCG-3′ and Clb2-low 5′-CTGAAACTCTATGCCCATGC-3′ giving a 255-bp PCR product were used.FRET Imaging and Data Analysis—The fluorescence imaging workstation consisted of a Zeiss AxioplanII upright microscope, a Quantix CCD 5-MHz camera (Photometrics), z-step motor, and filter cubes with CFP, YFP, and FRET filter sets (Zeiss), all fully controlled by MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices). Three images were acquired in the same order in all experiments as follows: first, the FRET filter set CFP/YFP (excitation bp 436/25, BS FT 455, emission bp 535/30), second, the YFP filter set (excitation bp 500/25, BS FT 515, emission bp 535/30), and third, the CFP filter set (excitation bp 436/25, BS FT 455, emission bp 480/40). YFP fluorescence visible through the CFP filter set and vice versa was negligible in our experiments. The acquisition cycle was controlled by a MetaFluor software. Pictures were captured with 1-s exposures using the ×63 lens and 2 × 2 binning to achieve the necessary signal intensity above background. The mercury lamp was pre-heated for at least 20 min for equilibration.All fusion constructs expressed produced nuclearly localized fluorescence. Living unfixed cells were viewed on pre-warmed slides, and not more than three pictures were recorded per slide within 5 min. Sorbate and propionate treatment was limited to a maximum of 15 min in 50 mm potassium phosphate-buffered synthetic medium, pH 6.5. A minimum of three sets of pictures per condition was recorded.

https://openalex.org/W1990324073,"Maurocalcine is a 33-mer peptide initially isolated from the venom of a Tunisian scorpion. It has proved itself valuable as a pharmacological activator of the ryanodine receptor and has helped the understanding of the molecular basis underlying excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscles. Because of its positively charged nature, it is also an innovative vector for the cell penetration of various compounds. We report a novel maurocalcine analog with improved properties: (i) the complete loss of pharmacological activity, (ii) preservation of the potent ability to carry cargo molecules into cells, and (iii) coupling chemistries not affected by the presence of internal cysteine residues of maurocalcine. We did this by replacing the six internal cysteine residues of maurocalcine by isosteric 2-aminobutyric acid residues and by adding an additional N-terminal biotinylated lysine (for a proof of concept analog) or an N-terminal cysteine residue (for a chemically competent coupling analogue). Additional replacement of a glutamate residue by alanyl at position 12 further improves the potency of these analogues. Coupling to several cargo molecules or nanoparticles are presented to illustrate the cell penetration potency and usefulness of these pharmacologically inactive analogs.

It efficiently binds to the ryanodine receptor of skeletal muscles (RyR1 isoform) (1.Altafaj X. Cheng W. Esteve E. Urbani J. Grunwald D. Sabatier J.M. Coronado R. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4013-4016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and promotes channel opening to promote calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This pharmacological effect of MCa can be indirectly monitored through the stimulation it exerts on [3H]ryanodine binding (2.Esteve E. Smida-Rezgui S. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Regaya I. Chen L. Altafaj X. Rochat H. Allen P. Pessah I.N. Marty I. Sabatier J.M. Jona I. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37822-37831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In muscle fibers, MCa produces a transient loss of voltage control of Ca2+ release from RyR1 channels. This effect is due to an alteration of repolarization-induced closure of RyR1 channels, a process normally under the control of voltage-dependent dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive calcium channels (3.Pouvreau S. Csernoch L. Allard B. Sabatier J.M. De Waard M. Ronjat M. Jacquemond V. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 2206-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This function of MCa is due to a partial sequence homology between MCa and a cytoplasmic loop of the DHP-sensitive channel (2.Esteve E. Smida-Rezgui S. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Regaya I. Chen L. Altafaj X. Rochat H. Allen P. Pessah I.N. Marty I. Sabatier J.M. Jona I. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37822-37831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These observations explain why MCa, along with other members of the same family of toxins such as imperatoxin 1A (4.el-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), hemicalcin (5.Shahbazzadeh D. Srairi-Abid N. Feng W. Ram N. Borchani L. Ronjat M. Akbari A.

J. 2003; 17: 1765-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) are useful both for their pharmacological properties and for deciphering fine molecular details of the excitation-contraction coupling process. Recently, MCa has also proven of interest for its property of efficiently crossing the plasma membrane, either alone or when coupled to a membrane-impermeant cargo protein (2.Esteve E. Smida-Rezgui S. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Regaya I. Chen L. Altafaj X. Rochat H. Allen P. Pessah I.N. Marty I. Sabatier J.M. Jona I. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol.

MCa is a highly charged peptide with 12 basic residues out of 33, and a net global positive charge of +8. Most of these residues are on one face of the molecule, the opposite face being mostly hydrophobic in nature. The rich content of basic amino acid residues of MCa is reminiscent of that of all cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) characterized so far (Tat, penetratin, and poly-R). Hence, MCa can be classified within an emerging family of toxin CPPs that have no structural homologies apart from their content in basic residues. Recently, a new toxin, crotamin, has been purified from the venom of a South American snake. It also behaves as a CPP but apparently with a preference for dividing cells (8.Nascimento F.D. Hayashi M.A. Kerkis A. Oliveira V. Oliveira E.B. Radis-Baptista G. Nader H.B. Yamane T. Tersariol I.L. Kerkis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21349-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The great diversity in CPP sequences observed so far suggests that designing new MCa CPP analogues should be easy. This tolerance in sequence variation is possibly due to the diverse nature of membrane receptors implicated in CPP cell translocation. These receptors nevertheless possess a single point in common: they all appear to interact with CPPs on the basis of electrostatic interactions. In contrast, the structural characteristics of the interaction between MCa and RyR1 appear far more constrained. A single mutation within MCa, the replacement of an Arg residue by an alanyl, abolishes the pharmacological effect of MCa but has only a mild effect on its cell penetration efficacy (9.Mabrouk K. Ram N. Boisseau S. Strappazzon F. Rehaim A. Sadoul R. Darbon H. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2528-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, segregating the pharmacological properties from the cell-penetrating properties proved more complex than expected on the sole basis of amino acid substitutions of MCa (9.Mabrouk K. Ram N. Boisseau S. Strappazzon F. Rehaim A. Sadoul R. Darbon H. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2528-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This appears to be due to structural imperatives of the molecule because it has four functions to fulfill: first, possess the attributes of a CPP; second, conserve sequence homology with the DHP-sensitive calcium channel; third, bind to RyR1; and fourth, activate this latter channel. Many residues contribute both to the pharmacological effects and the cell penetration properties, namely some basic residues that make the functional segregation difficult with simple amino acid substitutions. To both circumvent these difficulties and take advantage of the flexibility in structural constraints required for MCa cell penetration, we sought a novel strategy for the design of an MCa analogue that would lose its pharmacological activity while retaining most of its cell penetration efficacy. As determined by 1H NMR, MCa folds along an inhibitor cystine knot motif with a disulfide bridge pattern of Cys3–Cys17, Cys10–Cys21, and Cys16–Cys32. It contains three β-strands that run from amino acid residues 9–11 (strand 1), 20–23 (strand 2), and 30–33 (strand 3), with β-strands 2 and 3 forming an anti-parallel β-sheet (10.Mosbah A. Kharrat R. Fajloun Z. Renisio J.G. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. El Ayeb M. Darbon H. Proteins. 2000; 40: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In earlier studies on another toxin, maurotoxin (MTX), active on voltage-gated potassium channels, it was found that the disulfide bridges of the peptide play an essential role in the three-dimensional structure of the toxin and thus on its activity (11.di Luccio E. Matavel A. Opi S. Regaya I. Sandoz G. M'Barek S. Carlier E. Esteve E. Carrega L. Fajloun Z. Rochat H. Loret E. de Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We therefore adopted a similar strategy for the design of a novel analogue of MCa in which we replaced all native cysteine residues, engaged in the three disulfide bridges, by isosteric 2-aminobutyric acid residues. The goal was to obtain a structurally altered analogue displaying a complete loss of pharmacological activity but preserving the positively charged nature of the peptide, a property required for the efficient cell penetration of a CPP. To further validate this analogue, three derivatives were produced that comprise either an N-terminal biotinylated lysine residue with or without an alanyl substitution of Glu12, previously shown to favor cell penetration (9.Mabrouk K. Ram N. Boisseau S. Strappazzon F. Rehaim A. Sadoul R. Darbon H. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2528-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), or an N-terminal cysteine residue for coupling chemistries to various cargoes. This chemical synthesis was accompanied by pharmacological assays, toxicity experiments, and proof of concept that cargo penetration is fully conserved. The data indicate that cysteine replacement within MCa can produce potent cell-penetrating analogues of MCa devoid of pharmacological activity. Reagents—Streptavidin-Cy5 (Strep-Cy5) was from Amersham Biosciences, dihydroethidium (DHE) from Molecular Probes, and rhodamine- and FITC-conjugated concanavalin A were from AbCys and Sigma, respectively. Doxorubicin was from Alexis Biochemicals. The TK705-amino-(polyethyleneglycol) quantum dots (QD) with surface-activated amine groups were purchased from Invitrogen. [3H]Ryanodine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Peptide Synthesis—MCab was synthesized as previously described (7.Boisseau S. Mabrouk K. Ram N. Garmy N. Collin V. Tadmouri A. Mikati M. Sabatier J.M. Ronjat M. Fantini J. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MCab-Abu, MCab-Abu E12A, and FITC-Gpep-Cys were purchased from the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara (Italy). Cys-MCa-Abu was synthesized by NeoMPS. MTXb-Abu was assembled by the group of Dr. J. M. Sabatier. Formation of MCab/, MCab-Abu/, MCab-Abu E12A/, or MTXb-Abu/Strep-Cy5 Complexes—Soluble Strep-Cy5 was mixed with four molar equivalents of MCab, MCab-Abu, MCab-Abu E12A, or MTXb-Abu for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, in mm: NaCl 136, Na2HPO4 4.3, KH2PO4 1.47, KCl 2.6, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 0.5, pH 7.2). Conjugation of Cys-MCa-Abu to Various Cargoes—Cys-MCa-Abu was conjugated to a FITC-Gpep-Cys molecule (sequence derived from Gβ1: FITC-β-AGITSVAFSRSGRLLLAGYDDFN-Abu-NIWDAMKGDRAC-OH) according to the method used by Davidson et al. (12.Davidson T.J. Harel S. Arboleda V.A. Prunell G.F. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. Troy C.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10040-10046Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, an equimolar mixture of Cys-MCa-Abu and FITC-Gpep-Cys was heated to 65 °C for 15 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The complex was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. Cys-MCa-Abu was also conjugated to doxorubicin. Briefly, doxorubicin.HCl (1 mg/ml) was suspended in PBS, pH 8.0, and conjugated to Cys-MCa-Abu using succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Pierce) according to the protocol of Liang and Yang (13.Liang J.F. Yang V.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005; 15: 5071-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Successful coupling was followed by a 16.5% SDS-PAGE and UV detection of the resulting conjugated doxorubicin-linker-Cys-MCa-Abu peptide. QD were also conjugated to Cys-MCa-Abu. The amino groups of the QD (≈100–120 functions per particle) were first converted into a maleimide coating as described (14.Cai W. Shin D.W. Chen K. Gheysens O. Cao Q. Wang S.X. Gambhir S.S. Chen X. Nano. Lett. 2006; 6: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), thereby yielding QDM. Briefly, QD (1 nmol) were incubated for 4 h in the dark at room temperature in PBS in the presence of 4-maleimidobutyric acid N-hydrosuccinimide ester (1.8 μmol, in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), then purified using NAP-5 columns (Amersham Biosciences). 20 μl of Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride solution 0.5 m was added to 100 nmol of the Cys-MCa-Abu in 80 μl of water for 30 min, and then incubated overnight at room temperature with QDM in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Non-reacted maleimide groups were quenched for 20 min by adding 2-mercapthoethanol in excess (500 nmol). The QDM-Cys-MCa-Abu conjugates were purified using NAP-5 columns. Surface modifications of QD were detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in a TAE buffer pH 8, and imaged by fluorescence using a 633-nm excitation wavelength and collecting emitted light above 700 nm. The hydrodynamic diameter of the QDM-Cys-MCa-Abu nanoparticles measured using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments) were 25 nm in PBS (20.5 nm for non-modified QD). The QDM-Cys-MCa-Abu concentration was calculated using 532 nm absorbance measurements (QD molar extinction coefficient ϵ = 2.1 × 106m-1 cm-1 at 532 nm). Cell Culture—Wild-type Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells (from ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in F-12K nutrient medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 10,000 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin (Invitrogen). MDA-MB-231 cells from ATCC were grown in Leibovitz L15 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10,000 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin. Media used for the culture of cerebellar granule neurons was based on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 unit/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm KCl, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cultures were prepared from 6-day-old S/IOPS NMRI mice (Charles River Laboratories), as described previously (15.Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Heavy SR Vesicles—Heavy SR vesicles were prepared following the method of Kim et al. (16.Kim D.H. Ohnishi S.T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Biuret method. Isolation and Preparation of Flexor Digitorum Brevis Muscle Fibers—Experiments were performed on single skeletal fibers isolated from the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles from 4–8-week-old OF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) in accordance with the guidelines of the French Ministry of Agriculture (87/848) and of the European Community (86/609/EEC). Procedures for enzymatic isolation of single fibers and partial insulation of the fibers with silicone grease were as previously described (17.Collet C. Allard B. Tourneur Y. Jacquemond V. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18.Jacquemond V. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 920-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were killed by cervical dislocation after halothane (Sigma-Aldrich) inhalation before removal of the muscles. Muscles were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tyrode solution for 60 min at 37 °C. Single fibers were then isolated by triturating the muscles in the experimental chamber. The major part of a single fiber was electrically insulated with silicone grease (Rhodia Siliconi Italia, Treviolo, Italia) so that whole-cell voltage-clamp could be achieved on a short portion of the fiber extremity. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Structural Analyses of MCab, MCab-Abu, and MCab-Abu E12A by Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco 810 dichrograph using 1-mm thick quartz cells. Spectra were recorded between 180 and 260 nm at 0.2 nm/min and were averaged from three independent acquisitions. The spectra were corrected for water signal and smoothed using a third-order least squares polynomial fit. [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—Heavy SR vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in an assay buffer composed of 5 nm [3H]ryanodine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2 (pCa = 5), and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. 1 μm MCab, MCab-Abu, or MCab-Abu E12A was added to the assay buffer just prior to the addition of heavy SR vesicles. [3H]Ryanodine bound to heavy SR vesicles was measured by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass filters followed by three washes with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Filters were then soaked overnight in 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Cybscint, ICN) and bound radioactivity determined by scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 20 μm cold ryanodine. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated three times. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. Fluorescent Measurements under Voltage-Clamp Conditions— An RK400 patch-clamp amplifier (BioLogic) was used in whole-cell configuration as previously described (18.Jacquemond V. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 920-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Voltage-clamp was performed with a microelectrode filled with the intracellular-like solution (in mm: 120 K glutamate, 5 Na2-ATP, 5 Na2-phosphocreatine, 5.5 MgCl2, 5 d-glucose, 5 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). Indo-1 (Molecular Probes) was present in this solution at 0.2 mm for fluorescence measurements under voltage-clamp conditions. The extracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 TEA-methanesulphonate, 2.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 0.002 tetrodotoxin, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. The tip of the microelectrode was inserted through the silicon, within the insulated part of the fiber. Membrane depolarizations were applied every 30 s from a holding command potential of -80 mV. For the present set of measurements, the cytoplasm was dialyzed with the microelectrode solution, which contained the calcium dye Indo-1 and a given peptide to be tested (200 μm for MCab-Abu and MCab-Abu E12A, and 100 μm for MCab). To facilitate intracellular dialysis, the electrode tip was broken within the silicon-insulated portion of the fiber by pushing it back and forth a few times toward the bottom of the chamber. Under these conditions, intracellular equilibration of the solution was awaited for 30 min. Equilibration was followed from the time course of increase of indo-1 fluorescence in the tested portion of the fiber. Indo-1 fluorescence was measured on an inverted Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope equipped with a commercial optical system allowing the simultaneous detection of fluorescence at 405 nm (F405) and 485 nm (F485) by two photomultipliers (IonOptix, Milton, MA) upon 360-nm excitation. Background fluorescence at both emission wavelengths was measured next to each fiber tested and was then subtracted from all measurements. In an earlier study, we showed that 10–100 μm levels of MCa were necessary to affect voltage-activated Ca2+ release in intact mammalian skeletal muscle fibers (3.Pouvreau S. Csernoch L. Allard B. Sabatier J.M. De Waard M. Ronjat M. Jacquemond V. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 2206-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For this reason, and despite the cell penetration properties of MCa and of its derivatives, it is easier and less costly to apply these compounds intracellularly through the voltage-clamp electrode rather than in the extracellular medium. Calibration of the Indo-1 Response and [Ca2+]intra Calculation—The standard ratio method was used with the parameters: r = F405/F485, with Rmin, Rmax, KD, and β having their usual definitions. Results were either expressed in terms of Indo-1% saturation or in actual free calcium concentration (18.Jacquemond V. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 920-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19.Csernoch L. Bernengo J.C. Szentesi P. Jacquemond V. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 957-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vivo values for Rmin, Rmax, and β were measured using procedures previously described (17.Collet C. Allard B. Tourneur Y. Jacquemond V. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). No correction was made for Indo-1 Ca2+ binding and dissociation kinetics. MTT Assay—Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were seeded into 96-well microplates at a density of ∼8 × 104 cells/well. After 4 days of culture, the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 10 μm MCab, MCab-Abu, Cys-MCa-Abu, or MCab E12A-Abu. Control wells containing cell culture medium alone or with cells, both without peptide addition, were included in each experiment. The cells were then incubated with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) for 30 min. Conversion of MTT into purple-colored MTT formazan by the living cells indicates the degree of cell viability. The crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and the optical density was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader (Biotek ELx-800, Mandel Scientific Inc.) for quantification of cell viability. All assays were run in triplicate. Flow Cytometry—MCab/, MCab-Abu/, MCab-Abu E12A, or MTXb-Abu/Strep-Cy5 complexes were incubated for 2 h with CHO cells to allow cell penetration. Control condition was represented by an incubation of cells with Strep-Cy5 alone. The cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove the excess extracellular complexes. Next, the cells were treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C to remove remaining membrane-associated extracellular cell surface-bound complexes. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g and resuspended in PBS. Flow cytometry analyses were performed with live cells using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were obtained and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Live cells were gated by forward/side scattering from a total of 10,000 events. Mean fluorescence values were determined from Gaussian fits of the resulting histograms and plotted as a function of complex concentration. Mean values of intracellular fluorescence for Strep-Cy5 alone incubation (less than 1% of the fluorescence observed for the lowest concentration of any of the various MCa/Strep-Cy5 complexes) were also subtracted. Analysis of the Subcellular Localization of Various MCa/or MTX/Cargo Complexes by Confocal Microscopy—For Strep-Cy5 complexes, 4 μm MCab, MCab-Abu, MCab-Abu E12A, or MTXb-Abu were coupled to 1 μm Strep-Cy5 as described above. CHO cells were incubated with the resulting complexes for 2 h, and then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone. Immediately after washing, the nucleus was stained with 1 μg/ml DHE for 20 min, and then washed again with DMEM. After this step, the plasma membrane was stained with 5 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated concanavalin A for 3 min. Cells were washed once more, but with PBS. For the FITC-Gpep-Cys-Cys-MCa-Abu complex, 1 μm conjugate was incubated with CHO cells for 2 h, the plasma membrane stained with 5 μg/ml of rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A. For the QDM-Cys-MCa-Abu complex, 50 nm of the complex was incubated with CHO cells for 2 h, and the nuclei stained with 1 μg/ml DHE for 20 min. For the doxorubicin-linker-Cys-MCa-Abu complex, 3 μm of the conjugate was incubated with MDA-MB-231 for 2 h, followed by staining of the plasma membrane with 5 μg/ml of FITC-conjugated concanavalin A for 3 min. In all experiments, live cells were immediately analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP2. Alexafluor-488 (excitation at 488 nm), rhodamine and doxorubicin (excitation at 543 nm), or Cy5 and QDM (excitation at 642 nm) were sequentially excited and emission fluorescence collected in z-confocal planes of 10–15-nm steps. Images were merged in Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Synthesis of Disulfide-less Analogs of MCa—Fig. 1A illustrates the three-dimensional solution structure of MCa with three disulfide bridges. The aim of this study was to design a MCa analog for which convenient chemical coupling could be performed by using an N-terminal additional cysteine residue. As shown, MCa already contains six cysteine residues that contribute to the folding of the peptide to form an inhibitor cysteine knot motif. Adding an additional cysteine residue at the N terminus may significantly change the normal folding of the peptide and the classical disulfide bridge arrangement (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6) in an unpredicted manner. In turn, this could significantly affect the pharmacological activity and cell-penetration properties of the resulting molecule(s). To facilitate chemical coupling strategies of MCa to cargo molecules, we investigated the requirement of disulfide bridges on MCa pharmacology and cell penetration properties. Several analogs were synthesized, each with an N-terminal biotinylated lysine for easy binding to fluorescent streptavidin molecules (our reporter cargo for this study): MCab, intact with the native disulfide bridges, MCab-Abu in which we replaced all internal cysteine residues by isosteric 2-aminobutyric acid (Abu, Fig. 1B), and MCab-Abu E12A, an analog of MCab-Abu in which Glu12 was replaced by alanyl, a substitution known to improve cell penetration efficacy of MCab (9.Mabrouk K.

We would expect that removing the disulfide bridges of MCa might affect its pharmacology more than its cell penetration properties for two reasons. First, disulfide bridge patterns are known to contribute to the pharmacological activity of toxins (20.Fajloun Z. Ferrat G. Carlier E. Fathallah M. Lecomte C. Sandoz G. di Luccio E. Mabrouk K.

Second, the structural requirements for the pharmacological activity of MCa were shown to be more stringent than those required for cell penetration as probed by alanine scanning of MCa (9.Mabrouk K. Ram N. Boisseau S. Strappazzon F. Rehaim A. Sadoul R. Darbon H. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2528-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, we synthesized MTXb-Abu, a biotinylated version of MTX that has no cell-penetrating properties on its own and that acts on voltage-dependent potassium channels (Fig. 1D). This peptide, in which we also replaced six internal cysteine residues by Abu derivatives, as for the MCab-Abu peptide, was used as a negative control in cell penetration experiments.

Both the KKRPK motif and the octapeptide repeat region of rPrP are essential for maximal binding. rPrP with pathogenic insertional mutations binds more DNA than wild-type rPrP. DNA promotes the aggregation of rPrP and protects its N terminus from proteinase K digestion. When rPrP is mixed with an expression plasmid and Ca2+, the rPrP·DNA complex is taken up by mammalian cells leading to gene expression. In the presence of Ca2+, rPrP by itself is also taken up by cells in a temperature- and pinocytosis-dependent manner. Cells do not take up rPrPΔKKRPK, which lacks the KKRPK motif. Thus, rPrP is the carrier for DNA and the KKRPK motif is essential for its uptake. When mixed with DNA, a pentapeptide KKRPK, but not KKKKK, is sufficient for DNA internalization and expression. In contrast, whereas the normal cellular prion protein, PrPC, on the cell surface can also internalize DNA, the imported DNA is not expressed. These findings may have relevance to the normal functions of PrPC and the pathogenic mechanisms of human prion disease. Recombinant prion protein, rPrP, binds DNA.

Human prion diseases constitute a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The majority of human prion diseases are sporadic, in which the pathogenic mechanisms are not known. Human prion diseases, such as Kuru and iatrogenic and variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, are contracted by an infectious mechanism. On the other hand, inherited human prion disease, which accounts for about 10% of human prion disease, is caused by mutation of the germline prion gene, PRNP. More than 30 different pathogenic mutations in the human PRNP gene have been identified (3Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Neurology. 1990; 40: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations are either insertional or point mutations. Insertion mutation occurs solely in the octapeptide repeat region; wild-type human (PrPC) 2The abbreviations used are: PrPCcellular form of native normal prion proteinPrPScthe infectious and pathogenic scrapie prionPrPMprion protein with pathogenic mutationsrPrPbacterial produced, recombinant mature full-length wild type PrPrPrP8ORrPrP with 8 octapeptide repeatsrPrP10ORrPrP with 10 octapeptide repeatsrPrPΔKKRPKrPrP lacking the KKRPK motifrPrPΔORrPrP lacking the octapeptide repeatsrPrPΔ23–90rPrP lacking residues 23 to 90rPrP23–145rPrP with residues 23 to 145Alexa-rPrPAlexa Fluor 546-labeled rPrPPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAGglycosaminoglycansmAbmonoclonal antibodyCHOChinese hamster ovaryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPKproteinase K. 2The abbreviations used are: PrPCcellular form of native normal prion proteinPrPScthe infectious and pathogenic scrapie prionPrPMprion protein with pathogenic mutationsrPrPbacterial produced, recombinant mature full-length wild type PrPrPrP8ORrPrP with 8 octapeptide repeatsrPrP10ORrPrP with 10 octapeptide repeatsrPrPΔKKRPKrPrP lacking the KKRPK motifrPrPΔORrPrP lacking the octapeptide repeatsrPrPΔ23–90rPrP lacking residues 23 to 90rPrP23–145rPrP with residues 23 to 145Alexa-rPrPAlexa Fluor 546-labeled rPrPPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAGglycosaminoglycansmAbmonoclonal antibodyCHOChinese hamster ovaryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPKproteinase K. has five octapeptide repeats.

In this article, we describe our most recent findings showing that both the KKRPK motif and octapeptide repeat region of the rPrP are essential for the binding of rPrP to DNA. Furthermore, in comparison to wild-type rPrP, rPrPMs with pathogenic insertional mutations bind more DNA. DNA promotes the aggregation of rPrP and renders rPrP partially proteinase K resistant. Binding of rPrP to DNA promotes the uptake of the rPrP·DNA complexes by mammalian cells, resulting in gene expression. On the other hand, cell surface PrPC also internalizes DNA but the imported DNA is not expressed. The significance of these findings with respect to the normal functions of PrPC and the pathogenesis of prion diseases is discussed.

Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Each medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary cultures of normal human astrocytes were obtained from Cambrex (Cambrex BioScience, Walkersville, MD) and cultured in Astrocyte Growth Medium, AGM™, obtained from the same vender. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air and 5% CO2. Plasmid Constructions and Proteins Preparation—The expression vectors for human rPrP corresponding to the mature full-length fragment (23–231) pET-rPrP, pET-rPrPΔ23–90, pET-rPrPΔKKRPK, pET-rPrPΔOR, pET-rPrP8OR, and pET-rPrP10OR have been described previously (22Yin S.

Binding of rPrPs to DNA—To detect rPrP-DNA binding, a synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotide was used: 5′-GTAACCGAAATCGGTTGA-3′ (18-nucleotide long DNA). DNA (0.5 μm) was coated onto 96-well ELISA plates at 4 °C overnight, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 3 h. Appropriate dilutions of rPrP or rPrPMs were added to individual wells in triplicates and incubated for 2 h. After three washes with PBS-T (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20), bound rPrP was detected with anti-PrP mAb 8H4 or SAF32 (39Feraudet C. Morel N. Simon S. Volland H. Frobert Y. Creminon C. Vilette D. Lehmann S. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11247-11258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Plates were washed three times with PBS-T, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at 1:10,000 was added for 1 h. ELISA plates were washed three times with PBS-T before adding the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 0.5 mg/ml. ELISA plates were read at 405 nm on a Beckman Coulter AD340 micro-ELISA plate reader. In some experiments, double-stranded plasmid pEYFP-GPI was used for detection of DNA-rPrP binding. To study the effects of DNA size on rPrP-DNA interaction, two other synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotides were also used in some experiments: 5′-ACCGGAATTCCTAGTCACTGCCGAAATGTATGATG-3′ (35-nucleotide long DNA) and 5′-TGTCGAC-3′ (7-nucleotide long DNA). Turbidity Measurement—Aggregation reactions were performed as previously described (24Yu S. Yin S. Li C. Wong P. Chang B. Xiao F. Kang S.C. Yan H. Xiao G. Tien P. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The assays were performed at room temperature in a volume of 100 μl in 96-well plates. Wild type rPrP or rPrPM (5 μm) were suspended in 100 μl of PBS, pH 7.4. DNA at the indicated size was added into the reactions at a final concentration of 2.5 μm. After adding DNA, turbidities were monitored as quickly as possible (during 15 s) by reading the absorbance at 405 nm in a Beckman Coulter AD340 micro-ELISA plate reader, using a kinetic photometric model (interval time 30 s, 30 cycles with 1-s shacking before every cycle). To study the blocking effects of 7-nucleotide long DNA in the aggregation experiments, 5 μm wild-type rPrP was preincubated with 2.5 μm 7-nucleotide long DNA for 30 min at room temperature, then 35-nucleotide long DNA was added to start the aggregation reaction. Gel Shift Assay—In the agarose gel shift assay, 0.2 μg of plasmid pcDNA3 (5.4 kb) was incubated with 1, 2.5, and 12.5 μg of wild-type rPrP or rPrPΔKKRPK in a 10-μl total volume of PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature, respectively. After incubation, each individual sample was loaded on a 1% agarose gel, and electrophoresed at 100 V. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis to visualize DNA bands. Radioactivity Counting of rPrP/DNA Aggregates—Wild type rPrP, rPrPΔKKRPK, rPrP8OR, or rPrP10OR (10 μm of each) were incubated with 32P-labeled 18-nucleotide long DNA (5 μm)in 100 μl of PBS for 30 min at room temperature, then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. After extensive washing by PBS, the pellets was dissolved in 100 μl of 1.0 m NaOH, 1% Triton X-100, and transferred to vials for scintillation counting in a PerkinElmer 1450 LCS counter. Bovine serum albumin was mixed with labeled DNA, processed similarly, and used as a negative control. PK Digestion of rPrP·DNA Complexes—Wild type rPrP or rPrP10OR (1 μm of each) were incubated in 18-nucleotide long DNA (5 μm) in a 20-μl total volume of PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, then proteinase K was added at 0, 5, 10, and 20 μg/ml and further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. rPrPs without DNA were used as a control. The digested mixtures were then separated by SDS-PAGE (12% Tris glycine, Bio-Rad), electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with different anti-PrP mAbs. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc region-specific antibody was used as the secondary antibody. rPrP detection was performed using the chemiluminescence blotting system (Roche). Cell Transfection and Assay—Cell transfection experiments were performed as described previously (40Esser D. Amanuma H. Yoshiki A. Kusakabe M. Rudolph R. Böhm G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1211-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with modification. Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well and grown overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The growth medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml/well of fresh growth medium for 2 h before the addition of rPrP·DNA complexes. Plasmid pEYFP-GPI (1 μg) in 100 μl of PBS was mixed with different amount of rPrPs or KKRPK peptide and 0.5 μl of 0.5 m CaCl2 at room temperature for 1 h. After addition of 500 μl of growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 6 μl of 0.5 m CaCl2, the transfection mixture was used to replace the culture medium of the confluent cells. The mixture was removed after 4 h of incubation and replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh medium. After 24 h, the cells were transferred to 6-well plates and cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml blasticidin. The antibiotic resistant cell colonies were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 4% trypan blue and counted under a microscope. Normal human primary astrocytes were grown on 4-well chamber slides and transfected by the rPrP·DNA complexes as described above. Cells were observed in a fluorescence microscopy at 18 h after transfection. For flow cytometry analysis, 1 × 106 cells in 6-well tissue culture plates were transfected using the optimized rPrP concentration (5 μg/ml) and pEYFP-GPI (4 μg/well). After 48 h, cells were analyzed in a FACScan™ (BD Bioscience). CHO cells do not express endogenous PrPC; a stable CHO cell line (CHO-PrPC) was established as described (41Li C. Wong P. Pan T. Xiao F. Yin S. Chang B. Kang S.C. Ironside J. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To detect cell surface PrPC by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, CHO-PrPC was incubated with mAb 8H4 (1 μg/ml) in ice-cold PBS. The cells were washed and further incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—rPrP was labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 using an Alexa Fluor 546 labeling kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid pEYFP-GPI was labeled with a Label IT Tracker Cy3 labeling kit (Mirus, Madison, WI). Cells were seeded on chamber slides and allowed to grow overnight. For rPrPs internalization assay, Alexa Fluor 546-labeled wild-type rPrP (Alexa-rPrP) or Alexa-rPrPΔKKRPK (5 μg/ml of each) was mixed 0.5 μl of 0.5 m CaCl2 in 100 μl of PBS at room temperature for 1 h. After addition of 500 μl of growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 6 μl of 0.5 m CaCl2, the mixture was used to replace the culture medium of confluent cells in chamber wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For testing the temperature effects on uptake of rPrPs, some of the incubation was also performed at 4 °C for 1 h. In some experiments, cells were treated with the macropinocytosis inhibitor amiloride (2.5 mm) for 30 min prior to incubation and during uptake experiments. For peptide-mediated DNA internalization assay, Cy3-labeled pEYFP-GPI plasmid (0.5 μg/ml) was mixed with KKRPK or KKKKK peptide (33 μg/ml of each) and 0.5 μl of 0.5 m CaCl2 in 100 μl of PBS at room temperature for 1 h. After addition of 500 μl of growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 6 μl of 0.5 m CaCl2, the mixture was used to replace the culture medium of confluent cells in chamber wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For the cell surface PrPC-mediated DNA internalization assay, Cy3-labeled pEYFP-GPI plasmid (0.5 μg/ml) was directly added into 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated with CHO or CHO-PrPC cells for 1 h at 37 °C. All cells were rinsed with PBS six times, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and incubated with the fluorescent dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1000) to stain the nucleus. Cells were washed extensively and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and analyzed on a LSM 510 META confocal microscopy. Binding of rPrPs to DNA—We quantified the binding of wild-type rPrP and three truncated rPrPs to single strand DNA by ELISA. rPrP binds DNA in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Compared with wild-type rPrP, rPrPΔKKRPK, which lacks the KKRPK motif and rPrPΔOR, which lacks the octapeptide repeats have only half of the DNA binding activity. On the other hand, rPrP lacking the entire N terminus, rPrPΔ23–90, is unable to bind DNA. Conversely, an rPrP23–145, which lacks the C-globular domain, binds even higher levels of DNA than wild-type rPrP (Fig. 1B). Binding to double strand DNA revealed similar results (Fig. 1C). Thus, both the KKRPK motif and the octapeptide repeat region are required for maximum binding of DNA. The smallest DNA, which rPrP binds is 7-nucleotide long (not shown). Aggregation of PrPC is an important step in the PrPC to PrPSc conversion process (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5051) Google Scholar, 42Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2349) Google Scholar). DNA promotes the aggregation of wild-type rPrP but not rPrPΔKKRPK or rPrPΔOR (Fig. 1D), and the degree of aggregation is proportional to the length of the DNA (Fig. 1E). Although rPrP binds 7-nucleotide long DNA in ELISA, this DNA does not cause rPrP aggregation. However, DNA with 7 nucleotides did block the aggregation of rPrP induced by larger DNA, albeit only by ∼50% (Fig. 1E). We speculate that simply binding to DNA is insufficient to cause rPrP to aggregate; aggregation of rPrP requires longer DNA, which can simultaneously bind multiple rPrP molecules. Binding of rPrP to DNA is further confirmed by gel shift assay (Fig. 1F). In the presence of rPrP the migration of the DNA into the gel is retarded, proportional to the amount of rPrP added (see arrows). The retardation is greatly reduced if the DNA is incubated with rPrPΔKKRPK or rPrPΔOR (not shown). rPrPMs with Pathogenic Insertional Mutations Bind More DNA—rPrPM with pathogenic mutations binds more GAG compared with wild-type rPrP because of a more exposed N terminus (22Yin S. Yu S. Li C. Wong P. Chang B. Xiao F. Kang S.C. Yan H. Xiao G. Grassi J. Tien P. Sy M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10698-10705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Yin S. Pham N. Yu S. Li C. Wong P. Chang B. Kang S.C. Biasini E. Tien P. Harris D.A. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7546-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hence, we next investigated whether rPrPM also binds more DNA. We found that two insertional mutants, rPrP8OR and rPrP10OR (Fig. 2A), bind more DNA than wild-type rPrP. In the presence of an 18-nucleotide long DNA, rPrPs with insertional mutations also aggregate more rapidly and form more aggregate than wild-type rPrP (Fig. 2B). The presence of both rPrP and DNA in the aggregate was further demonstrated by radioactive labeling experiments. DNA (18-nucleotide long) was labeled with 32P, mixed with rPrP, and the aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation. The levels of radioactivity in the pellets and in the supernatants were then determined (Fig. 2C). We found that the rPrP10OR/DNA pellet has the highest 32P activity followed by rPrP8OR/DNA and then wild-type rPrP/DNA. The rPrPΔKKRPK/DNA pellet has the lowest activity and the bovine serum albumin/DNA pellet only has background activity. Accordingly, the levels of radioactivity in the supernatant fractions were reversed: the supernatant from the bovine serum albumin/DNA sample has the highest activity, whereas the supernatant from the rPrP10OR/DNA has the lowest (not shown). Binding of DNA Protects the N Terminus of rPrP from Proteinase K (PK) Digestion—Resistance to PK digestion is a hallmark of infectious PrPSc (44Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 218: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether rPrP·DNA complexes are PK resistant. rPrP alone or rPrP· DNA complexes were treated with different concentrations of PK. After digestion, samples were immunoblotted with anti-PrP mAb 8H4. Both wild-type rPrP and rPrP10OR immunoreactivities were eliminated after treatment with 5 μg/ml PK (Fig. 3). When bound to DNA, rPrP acquired some degree of PK resistance. After PK digestion (5 μg/ml), mAb 8H4 reacts with a single rPrP species of about 23 kDa, which is similar to untreated full-length rPrP; ∼20% of the total rPrP is PK resistant as estimated by densitometry. In contrast, the rPrP10OR·DNA complex is more PK resistant. After treatment with 10 μg/ml PK, more than 40% of the total rPrP10OR is still detectable. Again, the PK-digested samples have one full-length rPrP10OR species. At 20 μg/ml PK all rPrP10OR immunoreactivity is eliminated. These results suggest that the rPrP·DNA complexes may be heterogeneous; some of the rPrP may be relatively more PK resistant. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that after PK digestion some full-length rPrP is still detectable. Alternatively, because the epitope of mAb 8H4 is at the C-terminal globular domain between residues 175 and 185, PK digestion might have eliminated this region of the rPrP, rendering the protein non-reactive to mAb 8H4. To test this possibility, we used additional anti-PrP mAbs, which react with epitopes either at the central region, such as mAb 7A12 (residues 143 to155), or the N terminus, such as mAb 8B4 (residues 35 to 45), to investigate whether there are C-terminal truncated rPrP species in the PK-digested samples. In the rPrP/DNA sample, after treatment with PK, mAb 7A12 reacted with two different rPrP species: one is full-length, 23-kDa rPrP; the other is an 18-kDa species. Because this smaller species is not detected with mAb 8H4, it is likely to be a C-terminal-truncated rPrP species. Results from the rPrP10OR·DNA complex revealed that after digestion with 5 μg/ml PK, in addition to the full-length rPrP10OR species, there are two additional smaller species, an intermediate one at about 20 kDa and a"

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). Although sharing some hallmarks with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer or Parkinson disease, TSEs are unique in that they can have a genetic, sporadic, or infectious origin. An enigmatic feature of infectious TSEs is the high latency that may range between a few months up to several decades. The occurrence of various prion strains associated with different incubation periods, clinical manifestations, and neuropathological lesions further illustrates the complexity of the host-pathogen relationship in the TSE field. transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid serotonin 7,7′-bi-(5-hydroxytryptamine-4-one) catecholamine dopamine norepinephrine prion protein cellular PrP disease-associated scrapie PrP protein serotonin transporter tryptamine 4,5-dione tryptophan hydroxylase vesicular monoamine transporter dibutyryl cyclic AMP 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) reactive oxygen species glycosylphosphatidylinositol. transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid serotonin 7,7′-bi-(5-hydroxytryptamine-4-one) catecholamine dopamine norepinephrine prion protein cellular PrP disease-associated scrapie PrP protein serotonin transporter tryptamine 4,5-dione tryptophan hydroxylase vesicular monoamine transporter dibutyryl cyclic AMP 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) reactive oxygen species glycosylphosphatidylinositol. A key event in TSE pathogenesis is the conversion of the cellular isoform of the prion protein, PrPC, into an abnormal conformational variant called PrPSc, which stands for the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). The central role played by PrPC in the development of prion diseases was first exemplified by the observation that PrP knock-out mice are resistant to TSE, whereas PrP-overexpressing (tga20) mice exhibit reduced incubation periods as compared with wild-type mice (2Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Neurograft experiments carried out on PrP–/– mice using tga20 mice as brain tissue donors clearly demonstrated that the presence of endogenous PrPC is mandatory for PrPSc to induce pathological alterations (3Brandner S. Raeber A. Sailer A. Blattler T. Fischer M. Weissmann C. Aguzzi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13148-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mallucci et al. (4Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) further showed that switching off PrPC neuronal expression in infected mice just before the clinical phase blocks TSE pathogenesis, although abundant prion replication still occurs in extraneuronal tissues. These experiments, thus, outline that prions require neuronal PrPC to exert their toxicity. This notion was recently reasserted and refined in a study based on transgenic mice expressing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor-less PrPC (ΔGPI PrP) (5Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Indeed, ΔGPI PrP infected mice were found to efficiently replicate scrapie and accumulate high levels of PrPSc in their brains without any sign of clinical illness. As a whole, these data argue for a primary role of neuronal, GPI-anchored PrPC in prion neuropathogenesis. Despite this overall advance, unraveling the sequence of cellular and molecular events that lead to neuronal cell demise in TSEs still constitutes an ongoing challenge. Exploiting cell culture systems that sustain stable prion replication represents a valuable approach to tackle this issue. Over the past decade prion-infected cell lines of neural or nonneural origin have shed much light on PrPSc biogenesis, conversion, and trafficking (6Vilette D. Vet. Res. 2007; 39: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, their use as tools to detect infectivity (7Klohn P.C. Stoltze L. Flechsig E. Enari M. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11666-11671Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), screen therapeutic compounds (8Kocisko D.A. Morrey J.D. Race R.E. Chen J. Caughey B. J. Gen.

However, they have provided but little insight into PrPSc-induced cellular dysfunction, as in most cases prion infection had no obvious impact on the cell phenotype. Prion replication was nevertheless found to alter cholinergic functions in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (10Rubenstein R. Deng H. Scalici C.L. Papini M.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In GT1 hypothalamic cells, infection is associated with reduced viability (11Schatzl H.M. Laszlo L. Holtzman D.M. Tatzelt J. DeArmond S.J. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8821-8831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress (12Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Increased rates of apoptosis were also recently observed upon infection of primary neuronal cultures derived from tg338 mice overexpressing ovine PrP (13Cronier S. Laude H. Peyrin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12271-12276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Investigating how prions disrupt neuronal cell function may be notably hindered by the relative scarcity of cell systems of neural origin supporting prion replication to date. Here, we introduce the 1C11 neuroectodermal clone, which naturally expresses PrPC (14Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), as a novel prion-permissive cell line. The murine 1C11 progenitor derives from F9 pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells and behaves as a committed neuronal stem cell (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This cell line has the unique capacity to differentiate upon induction into fully functional serotonergic (1C115-HT) or noradrenergic (1C11NE) cells. In the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2AMP), the 1C11 progenitor adopts a neuronal morphology and starts expressing neuron-associated markers. Within 4 days, almost 100% of the precursor cells convert into 1C115-HT cells that display a complete serotonergic phenotype including serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, storage, catabolism, and transport (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On another hand 12 days after the addition of Bt2AMP in combination with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1C11NE cells implement a complete noradrenergic differentiation program (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present work we demonstrate that 1C11 cells support the replication of various prion strains. Our results show that PrPSc accumulation does not prevent the entry of 1C11 cells into either neuronal differentiation program, but, however, triggers specific alterations of the overall neurotransmitter-associated functions in both 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells. In addition, prions promote the production of oxidized derivatives of either serotonin or catecholamines, which are critically involved in bioaminergic dysfunctions. Finally, the extent of all prion-induced changes in infected cells correlate with the level of PrPSc accumulation and that of infectivity. Materials—Bt2AMP, cyclohexane carboxylic acid, DMSO, trypan blue, GSH, dithiothreitol, cysteine, catalase, and superoxide dismutase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [Phenyl-6′-3H]paroxetine (20–25 Ci/mmol) and 125I-labeled RTI-55 (2200 Ci:mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Tetrabenazin (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (Saint Louis, MO). Proteinase K and Pefabloc were from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies against tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) were from Genway (San Diego, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Cell Culture—1C11 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% 5-HT-depleted fetal calf serum. The cells were induced to differentiate (i) along the serotonergic pathway by the addition of 1 mm Bt2AMP and 0.05% cyclohexane carboxylic acid and (ii) along the noradrenergic pathway by the addition of 1 mm Bt2AMP and 0.05% cyclohexane carboxylic acid and 2% DMSO (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining exclusion assay, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ex Vivo Transmission and Subcloning of Infected Cells—10% brain homogenates were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% glucose as described (16Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). About 1 × 105 cells in a 35-mm culture dish were incubated for 4–5 h with 1 ml of brain homogenate diluted at 0.2% in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1 ml of fetal calf serum-supplemented medium was then added. Cells were passaged at a 1:10 dilution every 3 or 4 days, and PrPSc was assayed by immunoblotting after 5 and 10 passages. Subcloning was performed at the first passage after the infection by limiting dilution (0.3 cell/6-mm titer well). The clones were then expanded, and the production of PrPSc was tested by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Protein extraction and immunological detection of PrPSc by Western blotting in mouse brain homogenates or cell lysates were conducted as described previously (16Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 mg of total protein was digested with 10 μg of proteinase-K at 37 °C for 30 min supplemented with 1 mm Pefabloc and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before SDS-10% PAGE and electrotransfer on nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). PrP was detected using a mixture consisting of an equal volume of ascites of SAF 60, 69, and 70 antibodies (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France), namely SAF mix. Western blots were revealed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Bioassay—Tga20 mice overexpressing wild-type Mo Prnp-a (kindly provided by Dr. Charles Weissmann) were inoculated intracerebrally with 20 μl of sample containing 0.1 or 10% of Fukuoka-1 brain homogenate or cell extracts (2 × 106 cells). Cells were submitted to three freeze-thaw cycles, and suspensions were sonicated for 2 min (Cup-horn sonicator). Each sample was inoculated in 6 mice. Mice were monitored every 2 days, and the time at which they presented mouse-scrapie symptoms and terminal points were recorded as described previously (17Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Quantification of Enzymatic Activities—Determination of enzymatic functions was conducted on uninfected and infected cells after induction of serotonergic or catecholaminergic differentiation. Cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and differentiated into serotonergic neurons for 2–4 days or into catecholaminergic neurons for 8 days. After 2 washings with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped and collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). Enzymatic activities for neurotransmitter synthesis were measured radioenzymatically as in Levin et al. (18Levin R.A. Pollard H.B. Kuhn D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 143: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in an assay mixture containing 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.10, 1 mm ferrous sulfate, 2 mm 6-methyl-H4-pterin, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 100 μm l-[3H] tryptophan or l-[3H] tyrosine to probe TPH and tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively. Enzymatic activities were determined by quantifying the production of [3H]2O in a liquid scintillation counter and expressed as pmol/30 min/mg of cell protein extract. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was measured as described by Costa Rosa et al. (19Costa Rosa L.F. Curi R. Murphy C. Newsholme P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 100 mm Tris HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NADP+, 1 mm glucose 6-phosphate at pH 7.6. Enzyme activity was assayed by following the rate of NADPH production at 340 nm and 30 °C and expressed as pmol/30 min/mg of cell protein extract. Determination of Bioamines, Metabolites, and Oxidation Products—The contents in bioamines and related metabolites were measured by HPLC combined to electrochemical detection as described in Lin et al. (20Lin P.Y.T Bulawa M.C. Wong P. Lin L. Scott J. Blank C.L. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1984; 7: 509-538Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were homogenized in a solution containing 0.5 m acetic acid, 0.5 m sodium acetate, 0.4 m NaClO4, and 4.7 μm guaiacol, used as an internal standard. Homogenization was performed in a Kontes ground glass Duall apparatus. Homogenates were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Supernatants were filtered through low speed centrifugation on a 0.45 μm BAS (West Lafayette, IN) polyacetate filter. Filtrates were stored at –80 °C until required. The levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), 5-HT, and related metabolites were measured using HPLC with a coulometric electrode array (ESA Coultronics, ESA Laboratories, Chelsford, MA). Quantifications were made by reference to calibration curves obtained with internal standards. To determine the chemical structure of oxidized derivatives of 5-HT or catecholamines (CA), collected chromatographic fractions were freeze-dried and analyzed by fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry using a VG instruments Model ZAB-E spectrometer (Manchester, UK). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian model 300XL spectrometer. After identification, the levels of oxidized derivatives of 5-HT and CA were quantified as above according to calibration curves established with pure standards obtained from Sigma or kindly provided by P. Bonetti (Hoffmann-La Roche). Radioligand Binding Experiments—The presence of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) sites was assessed through tetrabenazine binding as in Mouillet-Richard et al. (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). [3H]Paroxetine and 125I-labeled RTI-55 binding to the 5-HT transporter (SERT) was carried out as in Launay et al. (21Launay J.M. Schneider B. Loric S. Da Prada M. Kellermann O. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1843-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in cold buffer A containing 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.3. The supernatant was poured onto a 20% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The pellet containing crude membranes was resuspended in buffer B (75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.3). Radioligand binding was performed on crude membranes (20 μg of proteins) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 at 37 °C. A 30-min incubation period was followed by addition of ice-cold Tris HCl, pH 7.4 (5 ml, 10 mm). Samples were filtered on polyethyleneimine-treated filters, and radioactivity retained on filters was counted in liquid and solid scintillation counters (Packard Instrument Co.). Treatment of TPH with Infected Cell Supernatant—TPH was purified from 1C115-HT day-4 cells by affinity chromatography using agarose beads coated with antibodies against TPH2 (EC 1.14.16.4). TPH immobilized on agarose beads (about 3 μg) was incubated with 1 ml of 1C11Fk65-HT day-4 supernatants for 15 min at 30 °C. Protective agents (50 μm GSH, 500 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mm cysteine, 20 mm DMSO, 100 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 100 units/ml catalase) when present, were added to TPH 10 min before incubation with infected cell supernatant. Beads were washed 3 times with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.40, and TPH activity was assayed in duplicates. DTNB titration of SH was carried out by the method of Ellman as modified by Riddles et al. (22Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Briefly, TPH from 1C115-HT day-4 cells exposed or not to 1C11Fk65-HT day-4 supernatants was incubated with 50 μm DTNB in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.50, 6 m guanidine HCl. Absorbance was then recorded at 412 nm using a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Statistics were performed on raw data using Student's t test. The chosen significant criterion was p < 0.01. The 1C11 Neuroectodermal Cell Line Supports Prion Replication—As an attempt to infect the 1C11 cell line, precursor cells were incubated with brain homogenates (0.2%) from mice inoculated with five distinct mouse-adapted agents derived from scrapie: Chandler, 22L, 22A, and ME7 or a human TSE, Fukuoka-1 (23Tateishi J. Sato Y. Nagara H. Boellaard J.W. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1984; 64: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After 4–5 h of incubation in serum-free medium, the inoculated cells were washed and passaged 5 times (3 weeks). Proteinase K-resistant PrP in the cell lysates was assayed by Western blot. Successful infections of 1C11 cells were obtained for the Chandler-, 22L-, and Fukuoka-1-infected cultures but not for the ME7 and 22A strains (Fig. 1A). In all infected cultures, PrPSc remained detectable after 10 passages (not shown). Notably, PrPSc signals obtained in the Chandler- and 22L-infected cells were lower than those observed in Fukuoka-1-infected cells. The later cells were selected for further studies and cloned by limiting-dilution to generate cultures with higher and stable PrPSc production (24Race R.E. Fadness L.H. Chesebro B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two stably infected 1C11Fk clones producing elevated (#6) or moderate (#7) PrPSc levels (Fig. 1B) were chosen for further investigation. At this stage no obvious phenotypic differences (growth rate, viability) could be noted between the infected clones and the original 1C11 neuroectodermal cells when cultured in their undifferentiated conditions. PrPSc from 1C11Fk Clones Is Infectious—An essential issue was then to assess whether the infected cells also produced infectivity. Pellets of uninfected 1C11 and infected 1C11Fk #6 and #7 cells passaged 7 times after subcloning were inoculated intracerebrally to tga20 mice. Mice (n = 6) inoculated with 2 × 106 control 1C11 cells remained healthy over more than 250 days post-inoculation. In contrast, mice inoculated with 1C11Fk #6 and #7 cells died within a mean incubation time of 76 ± 3.5 (5/5 mice affected) and 89 ± 1.3 (6/6) days, respectively (Fig. 1C). As a comparison, the latencies of disease in tga20 mice upon inoculation with 20 μl of the original Fukuoka-1 homogenate diluted to 10 or 0.1% were 76 ± 0.7 (6/6) and 105 ± 2.4 (5/5) days, respectively. Thus, we conclude that 106 1C11Fk #6 cells carry approximately the same level of infectivity as 1 mg of crude Fukuoka-1-infected brain. Noteworthy, there was a 13-day delay between the incubation times with clones #6 and #7. It suggests that the #7 clone contains a 10-fold lower level of infectivity than the #6 clone, in agreement with the difference in the PrPSc contents of the two clones as estimated by Western blot (Fig. 1B). Altogether the above data show that 1C11Fk cells are chronically infected and produce infectious prions. Prion Infection Impairs Serotonin Synthesis in 1C11Fk5-HT Cells—Upon the addition of Bt2AMP, 1C11 cells undergo serotonergic differentiation with a nearly 100% frequency (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The acquisition of serotonin-associated functions in differentiating 1C115-HT cells is highly synchronous and follows a defined time schedule (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Along the serotonergic pathway, 5-HT synthesis becomes detectable in 1C115-HT day-2 cells and reaches maximal levels in 1C115-HT day-4 cells (15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When exposed to inducers of the serotonergic pathway, 1C11Fk-derived cells, now referred to as 1C11Fk5-HT, kept producing PrPSc (Fig. 1D). To evaluate the ability of prion-infected 1C11Fk cells to implement a serotonergic phenotype, we measured the activity of TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, and the 5-HT intracellular content after the addition of Bt2AMP. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, serotonin synthesis was detected in 1C11Fk5-HT cells at day 2. However, in 1C11Fk7- and 1C11Fk6-derived progenies, TPH activity reached only 79 and 48%, respectively, of the reference 1C115-HT day 2 level (Fig. 2A). In parallel, a significant decrease (63% of control) in 5-HT content was recorded in 1C11Fk65-HT-infected cells as compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 2B). With 1C11Fk75-HT cells, the 5-HT content was only slightly reduced (95% of control). The impact of prion infection on 5-HT synthesis was even more pronounced at day 4. Although TPH activity and 5-HT content normally increase between day 2 and day 4 of 1C11 serotonergic differentiation (Ref. 15Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2, A and B), both parameters were significantly decreased in 1C11Fk65-HT and 1C11Fk75-HT cells. The TPH enzymatic activity measured at day 4 in 1C11Fk65-HT cells represented only 5% that recorded in 1C115-HT-uninfected cells. Similarly, the 5-HT content of 1C11Fk65-HT cells was reduced to 4.6% that of the reference 1C115-HT day-4 level. Interestingly, TPH activity and 5-HT levels were less decreased in 1C11Fk7- than in 1C11Fk6-derived cells. Hence, the mean degree of enzymatic perturbation relates to the mean level of PrPSc accumulation. Although neurochemical analyses cannot be performed at the single cell scale, the extent of phenotypic alterations (>95% of reference level in 1C11Fk65-HT cells) argues against the possibility that a small proportion of cells within the culture carry the overall infectivity and account for 5-HT synthesis impairment. We may instead conclude to a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of prion infection on serotonin synthesis. In contrast to the above findings, prion infection had no impact on the activity of unrelated enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, throughout serotonergic differentiation (supplemental Fig. 1). Hence, 1C11Fk5-HT-infected cells exhibit selective impairment in serotonergic functions. This first set of observations indicates that (i) 1C11Fk cells retain the ability to engage into serotonergic differentiation upon induction, (ii) prion infection hinders the implementation of an optimal TPH activity, (iii) prion-induced alterations are all the more severe since cells accumulate PrPSc and infectivity (compare Fk6 and Fk7) and, finally, (iv) defects in serotonin synthesis accentuate alon"
https://openalex.org/W2001170375,"In humans, the SLC28 concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) protein family is represented by three Na+-coupled members; human CNT1 (hCNT1) and hCNT2 are pyrimidine and purine nucleoside-selective, respectively, whereas hCNT3 transports both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleoside drugs. Belonging to a phylogenetic CNT subfamily distinct from hCNT1/2, hCNT3 also mediates H+/nucleoside cotransport. Using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, we have characterized a cysteineless version of hCNT3 (hCNT3C-). Processed normally to the cell surface, hCNT3C- exhibited hCNT3-like transport properties, but displayed a decrease in apparent affinity specific for Na+ and not H+. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments in wild-type and hCNT3C- backgrounds identified intramembranous Cys-561 as the residue responsible for this altered Na+-binding phenotype. Alanine at this position restored Na+ binding affinity, whereas substitution with larger neutral amino acids (threonine, valine, and isoleucine) abolished hCNT3 H+-dependent nucleoside transport activity. Independent of these findings, we have established that Cys-561 is located in a mobile region of the hCNT3 translocation pore adjacent to the nucleoside binding pocket and that access of p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate to this residue reports a specific H+-induced conformational state of the protein ( Slugoski, M. D., Ng, A. M. L., Yao, S. Y. M., Smith, K. M., Lin, C. C., Zhang, J., Karpinski, E., Cass, C. E., Baldwin, S. A., and Young, J. D. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 8496-8507 ). The present investigation validates hCNT3C- as a template for substituted cysteine accessibility method studies of CNTs and reveals a pivotal functional role for Cys-561 in Na+- as well as H+-coupled modes of hCNT3 nucleoside transport."
https://openalex.org/W1975960841,"SHP-1 is expressed in the nuclei of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Increased SHP-1 expression and phosphatase activity coincide with cell cycle arrest and differentiation in these cells. Suspecting the tumor-suppressive properties of SHP-1, a yeast two-hybrid screen of an IEC cDNA library was conducted using the full-length SHP-1 as bait. Characterization of many positive clones revealed sequences identical to a segment of the Cdk2 cDNA sequence. Interaction between SHP-1 and Cdk2 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitations whereby co-precipitated Cdk2 phosphorylated SHP-1 protein. Inhibition of Cdk2 (roscovitine) or proteasome (MG132) was associated with an enhanced nuclear punctuate distribution of SHP-1. Double labeling localization studies with signature proteins of subnuclear domains revealed a co-localization between the splicing factor SC35 and SHP-1 in bright nucleoplasmic foci. Using Western blot analyses with the anti-SHP-1 antibody recognizing the C terminus, a lower molecular mass species of 45 kDa was observed in addition to the full-length 64–65-kDa SHP-1 protein. Treatment with MG132 led to an increase in expression of the full-length SHP-1 protein while concomitantly leading to a decrease in the levels of the lower mass 45-kDa molecular species. Further Western blots revealed that the 45-kDa protein corresponds to the C-terminal portion of SHP-1 generated from proteasome activity. Mutational analysis of Tyr<sup>208</sup> and Ser<sup>591</sup> (a Cdk2 phosphorylation site) residues on SHP-1 abolished the expression of the amino-truncated 45-kDa SHP-1 protein. In conclusion, our results indicate that Cdk2-associated complexes, by targeting SHP-1 for proteolysis, counteract the ability of SHP-1 to block cell cycle progression of IECs."
https://openalex.org/W2025268507,"LolA plays a critical role in the outer membrane sorting of Escherichia coli lipoproteins because it carries a hydrophobic lipoprotein from the inner membrane through the hydrophilic periplasm to the outer membrane receptor LolB. LolA has an incomplete β-barrel structure composed of 11 β-strands with an α-helical lid forming a hydrophobic cavity inside. The accompanying study revealed that the hydrophobic cavity opens and closes upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively. Ile93 in the α-helix and Phe140 in the β-strand are located close to each other in the hydrophobic cavity. These two residues were replaced by Cys to construct the I93C/F140C derivative. Expression of I93C/F140C immediately arrested growth whether wild-type LolA was present or not. However, this dominant negative phenotype was abolished by reducing agents, indicating that the intramolecular disulfide bonding between the two Cys residues is lethal. I93C/F140C was unstable, and its periplasmic level was lower than that of wild-type LolA or its single Cys derivative. Reduction of I93C/F140C was essential for the release of lipoproteins from the inner membrane. Moreover, treatment of I93C/F140C with divalent cross-linkers having different side chain lengths revealed that opening of the lid for a sufficient distance is required for the release activity. The binding of a fluorescent probe to the hydrophobic cavity of I93C/F140C also depended on reducing agents. Taken together, these results indicate that the two Cys residues introduced into LolA function as a redox switch, which regulates the opening and closing of the hydrophobic cavity.

LolA (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) accepts lipoproteins from LolCDE (2Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in the inner membrane and then transports them to LolB (3Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in the outer membrane, thereby playing a critical role in the outer membrane sorting of hydrophobic lipoproteins through the hydrophilic periplasm (4Tokuda H. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1693: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There are at least 90 species of lipoproteins in Escherichia coli, most of which are sorted to the outer membrane by the Lol system (4Tokuda H. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1693: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 182: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The number of LolA molecules in a single cell was estimated to be several hundreds (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similar numbers were estimated for LolCDE and LolB molecules (2Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, ∼106 molecules of the major outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp exist in a single cell (6Braun V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 335-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 7Mizushima S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 60: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the LolA-lipoprotein complex, an intermediate of the lipoprotein transfer reaction, was not detected in the periplasm under normal conditions, indicating that the outer membrane sorting of lipoproteins is highly efficient. It was found that Arg at position 43 of LolA decreases the strength of the hydrophobic interaction between LolA and lipoproteins, thereby enabling the efficient transfer of lipoproteins to LolB (8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, the LolA(R43L) mutant, in which Leu replaces Arg43, caused periplasmic accumulation of lipoproteins because the mutation significantly increased the strength of the hydrophobic interaction with lipoproteins (8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Miyamoto A. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both LolA and LolB comprise an incomplete β-barrel with an α-helical lid, which together form a hydrophobic cavity (10Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic cavity of LolA is closed because of hydrogen bonding between Arg43 in the β-barrel and some residues in the lid (10Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the accompanying study revealed that most LolA(R43L) exists in a open form (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the hydrophobic cavity of LolA was found to undergo opening and closing upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the opening of the LolA lid is coupled to ATP hydrolysis by LolCDE (10Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas lipoprotein transfer reactions after the formation of the LolA-lipoprotein complex proceed in the absence of energy input. For the formation of the LolA-lipoprotein complex, lipoproteins must be released from the inner membrane, transferred from LolCDE to LolA, and then properly placed in LolA. It is not known at present how the LolA lid opening is coupled to these events (12Taniguchi N. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8538-8544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To answer to this question and to gain detailed insights into molecular mechanisms, it seems useful if the opening and closing of the LolA lid can be regulated. Here, we report the introduction of a redox switch that can control the opening and closing of the hydrophobic cavity of LolA.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were used. The last two strains carried the chromosomal lolA gene under the control of the lactose promoter-operator. E. coli B strain BL21(DE3) (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used for high level expression of LolA-His6. The cells were grown on LB broth (Difco) or 2× YT broth (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). When required, chroramphenicol and spectinomycin were added at 25 and 50 μg/ml, respectively. Construction of Plasmids Carrying Genes for LolA Cys Mutants—Ile93 and Phe140 of FLAG-tagged LolA were mutated to Cys by means of PCR using Pfu ultra polymerase (Stratagene) with pSW77 (PBAD-lolA-FLAG) (18Watanabe S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as a template and the following oligonucleotide pairs; IC-F (5′-ggtaatacgccgtttatgctgTGTgcccgcaaccagtccagcgac-3′) and IC-R (5′-gtcgctggactggttgcgggcACAcagcataaacggcgtattacc-3′) for I93C; and FC-F (5′-cgtgatggcacaatccatcagTGTagcgcggtggagcaggacgat-3′) and FC-R (5′-atcgtcctgctccaccgcgctACActgatggattgtgccatcacg-3′) for F140C, in which the uppercase letters denote Cys. Derivatives of pSW77 were amplified in XL1-Blue, and then chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing of both strands of the respective plasmids. The mutant plasmids thus obtained were named pSWI and pSWF and encoded I93C-FLAG and F140C-FLAG, respectively, under PBAD. A mutant plasmid, pSWIF, carrying both the I93C and F140C mutations was constructed by PCR with pSWI as a template and a pair of primers, FC-F and FC-R. Plasmids allowing higher level expression of His6-tagged LolA were constructed for fluorescent bis-ANS binding assays. To construct pYORIF encoding His6-tagged LolA(R43L/I93C/F140C), two Cys residues were introduced into pYOR43L encoding LolA(R43L)-His6 (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), as mentioned for the construction of pSWIF. Purification of FLAG-tagged LolA Proteins—A reported method (18Watanabe S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was slightly modified. Briefly, TT016 cells harboring pSW77, pSWI, pSWF, or pSWIF were grown on 2× YT broth containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the culture OD660 nm reached 0.8, the cells were induced by the addition of 0.2% arabinose and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by conversion to spheroplasts. Periplasmic fractions were obtained as spheroplast supernatants and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 12 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min to remove aggregated materials, the periplasmic fractions were applied to a MonoQ column, which had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The column was developed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m). The fractions containing LolA-FLAG were examined by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 6 h at 4 °C. The fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min and further purified on a FLAG M2 affinity column. The column was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptides. FLAG-tagged LolA proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol for 6 h at 4 °C. Pulse-Chase Labeling of LolA(I93C/F140C)—TT016 cells harboring pSW77 or pSWIF were grown on 5 ml of M63–0.2% maltose minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% NaCl and 0.1 mm IPTG at 37 °C. When the culture OD660 nm reached 1.0, the cells were induced for 5 min by the addition of 0.2% arabinose in the presence and absence of 2 mm TCEP (pH 7.5), a reducing agent containing no SH group. The cells in 5 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in 1 ml of M63–0.2% maltose minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% NaCl. The cell suspensions were pulse-labeled with 10 μCi of Tran[35S]label for 1 min and then chased with 12 mm nonradioactive Met and Cys for the indicated times. The reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroactetic acid. Trichloroactetic acid-precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography after immunoprecipitation with anti-LolA antibodies. Modification of LolA Cys Mutants with SH-specific Reagents—FLAG-tagged Cys derivatives of LolA (3 μg) were incubated with 2 mm TCEP at 95 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice for 1 min. LolA derivatives were fully active after these treatments. The reduced derivatives were oxidized with 5 mm Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 and then kept reduced in the presence of 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol or TCEP or modified with 2 mm divalent cross-linker, BMOE, BMB, or BMH, at 25 °C for 2 h. These reagents were removed with a Microbiospin column (Bio-Rad). To examine the state of SH groups, LolA derivatives (100 ng) modified with the above reagents were further incubated with 2 mm AMS at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroactetic acid. Trichloroactetic acid-precipitated proteins were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (14%) and Western blotting with antibodies against FLAG peptides. Release of L10P from Spheroplasts—The release of L10P from spheroplasts was examined as reported (18Watanabe S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli DLP79–36 cells harboring pJYL10P (PBAD-L10P) (19Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were grown on M63–0.2% maltose minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% NaCl at 37 °C. When the culture OD660 nm reached 1.0, the cells were induced with 0.2% arabinose for 5 min and then converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min after the addition of 20 mm MgCl2 and then resuspended in M63–0.2% maltose minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 10 mm MgCl2. The spheroplast suspension (300 μl) was mixed with 750 μl of M63–0.2% maltose minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of Tran[35S]label and then subjected to 1 min pulse-labeling, followed by a 10-min chase with a 12 mm nonradioactive Met and Cys mixture. LolA proteins (2 μg/ml) treated with various Cysspecific reagents were then added to induce the release of L10P. To terminate the reaction, the mixture was chilled in ice water, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min. The spheroplasts and supernatant thus obtained were subjected to trichloroactetic acid precipitation and then immunoprecipitation with anti-Lpp antibodies as reported (1Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled L10P was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Purification of LolA(R43L)-His6 for bis-ANS Binding—His6-tagged LolA(R43L) and LolA(R43L/I93C/F140C) were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells harboring pYOR43L or pYORIF. The expression and purification of these LolA proteins were performed as described in the accompanying paper (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and then used for bis-ANS binding. Binding of bis-ANS—LolA proteins (2.5 μm) were incubated in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) in the presence of 5 μm bis-ANS for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was then measured with a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer RF-5000. The dye was excited at the wavelength of 390 nm. Emission spectra were collected in the range of 420–620 nm. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) or, in the case of Lpp, Hussain et al. (14Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5177-5182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric quantification was performed with an ATTO densitograph. Construction of Cys Mutants—The accompanying study revealed that the hydrophobic cavity of LolA undergoes opening and closing upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine the functional importance of the opening and closing of the LolA cavity in more detail, we attempted to introduce a switch that can regulate the open/closed state of the cavity. For this, we used Ile93 in the α2 helix and Phe140 in the β10 strand. The crystal structure of LolA(R43L) revealed that the Cβ-Cβ distances between Ile93 and Phe140 are 7.0 Å for the closed form and 10.9 Å for the open form (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that two Cys residues form a disulfide bond when the Cβ-Cβ distance is within 3–5 Å (21Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is applicable to two Cys residues located in the same domain (22Sowdhamini R. Srinivasanm N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). If a Cys is present in a mobile domain, disulfide bonds can be formed between two Cys residues at more than 10 Å apart (23Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed a LolA mutant in which Cys replaced either Ile93 or Phe140, or both. TT016 (lacPO-lolA lpp+) or TT015 (lacPO-lolA lpp-) cells harboring a plasmid that carried the gene for wild-type LolA or a Cys mutant of it were grown in the presence of 0.1 mm IPTG and 0.2% arabinose (Fig. 1, B and C). LolA and its Cys derivatives were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins. All of the five Lol proteins are essential for E. coli growth (16Tajima T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Tanaka K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6538-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Narita S. Tanaka K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two single Cys mutants, I93C and F140C, did not inhibit the growth of the two strains. Furthermore, these single Cys mutants were functional and complemented the absence of wild-type LolA (data not shown). In marked contrast, a double Cys mutant, I93C/F140C, caused very severe inhibition of the growth of both strains even in the presence of LolA expressed from the chromosome. On the other hand, the I93G mutant, which was previously characterized as a strong dominant negative mutant (18Watanabe S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), arrested the growth of TT016, but not that of TT015, in the presence of chromosomally encoded LolA. Because mislocalization of Lpp in the inner membrane causes a very toxic covalent linkage between the mislocalized Lpp and peptidoglycan (26Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the defect of lipoprotein sorting caused by I93G is severe in Lpp+ cells but only marginal in Lpp- cells. In contrast, I93C/F140C arrested the growth of not only Lpp+ cells but also Lpp- cells, indicating that this is the strongest dominant negative derivative among the more than 20 LolA mutants previously isolated (8Taniguchi N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34481-34488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Miyamoto A. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We next examined the growth of TT016 cells expressing LolA (Fig. 1D) or I93C/F140C (Fig. 1E) in the presence of various concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol. Their growth was unaffected by 2-mercaptoethanol when wild-type LolA was expressed (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the growth of cells expressing I93C/F140C absolutely required 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1E) or another reducing agent such as dithiothreitol or TCEP (data not shown). These results indicate that the lethality of I93C/F140C is caused by the formation of a disulfide bond. Oxidized and Reduced Forms of LolA(I93C/F140C)—TT016 cells were grown in the presence of IPTG to express wild-type LolA from the chromosome. When the culture OD660 nm reached 0.6, arabinose was added to induce LolA or the three Cys derivatives from plasmids in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Only the expression of I93C/F140C in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol inhibited growth. Whole cell proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG peptide antibodies (Fig. 2A). Irrespective of the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol in the growth medium, wild-type LolA, I93C and F140C migrated to the same positions as single bands. In contrast, two bands were detected with I93C/F140C. The slower migrating molecule most likely represents the reduced form of I93C/F140C because it increased when cells were grown in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and migrated to the same positions as LolA and the two single Cys derivatives did. The faster migrating molecule most likely represents the oxidized form of I93C/F140C, whose structure had become more compact because of an internal disulfide bond. No materials were detected with anti-FLAG peptide antibodies in other parts of the gel (not shown), indicating that intermolecular disulfide bonds are not formed. These results indicate that the oxidized form of I93C/F140C causes severe growth inhibition, whereas the reduced form has no inhibitory effect. The amount of I93C/F140C was lower than those of the other Cys derivatives even in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. We therefore examined the expression of I93C/F140C by means of pulse-chase labeling in the presence and absence of a reducing agent (Fig. 2B). The labeling of LolA proteins with 35S was performed in the presence of TCEP instead of 2-mercaptoethanol as a reducing agent. Precursors of I93C/F140C and wild-type LolA were undetectable at 1 min after the start of labeling in both the presence and absence of TCEP, whereas the processing of the precursors was inhibited by sodium azide, an inhibitor of SecA (27Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The half-life of 35S-labeled LolA was not different in the presence and absence of TCEP, whereas 35S-labeled I93C/F140C rapidly disappeared in the absence of TCEP, indicating that the oxidized form of I93C/F140C is unstable and quickly degraded in the periplasm (for example, compare the band densities at 20 min). The turnover of labeled I93C/F140C in the presence of TCEP was also slightly faster than that of wild-type LolA. The periplasm is a highly oxidative environment, and a small amount of the oxidized form of I93C/F140C was detected even in the presence of a reducing agent (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The decreased expression of I93C/F140C in the presence of TCEP seems to be caused by the presence of the unstable oxidized form. Divalent Cross-linking of Purified LolA(I93C/F140C)—I93C/F140C and the other LolA proteins were overexpressed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and then purified (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the results of in vivo analysis (Fig. 2A), the oxidized form of the purified I93C/F140C comprised the major fraction because of oxidation during its purification, whereas only the reduced form was detected for wild-type LolA and the two single Cys mutants (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, no proteins were detected in other parts of the SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purified proteins were reduced by TCEP and then either oxidized with Cu2+ (phenanthroline)3, kept reduced in the presence of TCEP, or treated with SH-specific AMS (Fig. 3B). Nonreducing SDS-PAGE revealed that the purified I93C/F140C molecules after these treatments migrated to three different positions as single bands (lanes 10–12). On the other hand, the mobility of wild-type LolA was not affected by these treatments. AMS (molecular mass = 536 Da) modifies free SH groups and causes slower migration on SDS-PAGE. The two single Cys mutants migrated slightly more slowly than the reduced form after AMS treatment, indicating that I93C and F140C were each modified with one AMS molecule. The migration of AMS-treated I93C/F140C was slower than that of the AMS-treated single Cys mutants. The difference between the migration positions of the reduced and AMS-treated I93C/F140C was about 1 kDa, indicating that two AMS molecules are attached to I93C/F140C. The purified I93C/F140C was reduced with TCEP and then modified with divalent cross-linkers with different side chain lengths (Fig. 3C). Oxidized, reduced, and cross-linked I93C/F140C molecules were further treated with AMS and then analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3D). Cross-linked I93C/F140C migrated slightly slower than oxidized I93C/F140C and faster than I93C/F140C modified with two AMS molecules. The mobility of I93C/F140C modified with divalent cross-linkers remained unchanged on further treatment with AMS (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that I93C/F140C molecules were completely modified with the respective divalent cross-linkers. Lipoprotein Releasing Activity of Cross-linked LolA(I93C/F140C)—The release of 35S-labeled lipoprotein L10P (19Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) from spheroplasts was examined with I93C/F140C that had been modified with three divalent cross-linkers (Fig. 4A). The activities of reduced and oxidized I93C/F140C molecules were also examined. The amount of L10P remaining in spheroplasts or released into the supernatant was then determined (Fig. 4B). The activity of wild-type LolA was not affected by any treatment. On the other hand, oxidation with Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 completely inactivated I93C/F140C, whereas reduced I93C/F140C was as active as wild-type LolA. The activity of I93C/F140C treated with divalent cross-linkers was affected by the length of the space arms (Fig. 4B). Cross-linking with the shortest BMOE caused near complete inhibition, whereas I93C/F140C treated with BMH was as active as the reduced form, indicating that the LolA function is inhibited when the distance between the α2 helix and the β10 strand is short. On the other hand, if the fixed distance is greater, cross-linked I93C/F140C was able to release L10P. These results, taken together, indicate that the opening of the LolA lid is essential for lipoprotein binding activity. Introduction of a Redox Switch into the Hydrophobic Cavity of LolA(R43L)—Arg at position 43 of LolA plays an important role in maintaining the closed conformation of free LolA (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of LolA(R43L), in which Leu replaced Arg at position 43, revealed that the major fraction of this derivative exists in the open conformation. It was then found that the fluorescent probe bis-ANS binds to the hydrophobic cavity of LolA(R43L) or liganded wild-type LolA (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we introduced a redox switch comprising I93C/F140C into LolA(R43L) derivative. The increase in the bis-ANS fluorescence induced by R43L/I93C/F140 was completely dependent on the reduction of the switch (Fig. 5). On the other hand, neither oxidation nor reduction affected the binding of bis-ANS when the redox switch was not introduced into LolA(R43L) (Fig. 5, inset). Taken together, these results indicate that I93C/F140C functions as a redox switch, which regulates the open/closed state of the hydrophobic cavity. Crystallographic and biochemical studies revealed that the hydrophobic cavity of LolA undergoes opening and closing upon the binding and release of lipoproteins, respectively (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To address the functional importance of opening of the hydrophobic cavity in more detail, we tried to introduce a redox switch into LolA. We expected that two Cys residues replacing Ile93 in the α2-helix and Phe140 in the β-barrel might form a disulfide bond and then function as a switch for the hydrophobic cavity, although the Cβ-Cβ distance for these residues was more than 7 Å. To our surprise, the LolA(I93C/F140C) derivative thus constructed was found to be the strongest dominant negative mutant so far isolated in the absence but not the presence of a reducing agent (Fig. 1). As far as we know, this is the first example of an E. coli strain of which the growth absolutely depends on a reducing agent. Pulse-chase labeling of LolA(I93C/F140C) revealed that its turnover rate is considerably faster than that of wild-type LolA, and therefore it exists at a low level even in the presence of a reducing agent (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the dominant negative property of LolA(I93C/F140C) was partly suppressed on the overexpression of Lol-CDE, 4S. Watanabe and H. Tokuda, unpublished observation. suggesting that oxidized I93C/F140C inhibits the binding of wild-type LolA to LolCDE. It was recently revealed that free LolA and liganded LolA have distinct properties, i.e. free LolA does not interfere with the lipoprotein transfer from liganded LolA to LolB (28Watanabe S. Oguchi Y. Yokota N. Tokuda H. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but liganded LolA is unable to catalyze the lipoprotein release reaction from the inner membrane (11Oguchi Y. Takeda K. Watanabe S. Yokota N. Miki K. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25414-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction with LolCDE is limited to the closed form of LolA and that with LolB is restricted to the liganded form of LolA. The oxidized I93C/F140C seems to have higher affinity for LolCDE than wild-type LolA has and thereby exhibits the dominant negative property. The ability of I93C/F140C to release lipoproteins absolutely required the reduction of the redox switch (Fig. 4A), indicating that opening of the cavity is essential for the lipoprotein releasing activity. Moreover, treatment of I93C/F140C with divalent cross-linkers having different side chain lengths revealed that opening of the lid for a sufficient distance (more than 10∼16 Å) is essential for the function (Fig. 4B). It seems therefore likely that the open conformation of LolA(R43L) (Fig. 1A, right panel) represents the conformation of liganded LolA. Nevertheless, the free form of LolA(R43L) does not inhibit the lipoprotein transfer from liganded wild-type LolA to LolB. 4S. Watanabe and H. Tokuda, unpublished observation. These results suggest that an additional conformation change occurs in LolA upon the lipoprotein binding, which then enables the interaction with LolB. Elucidation of the exact conformation of liganded LolA must await crystallographic study. Construction of a LolA derivative with a switch that turns the LolA function on and off is expected to be useful for the detailed analyses of the lipoprotein transfer reaction. The structure of LolB is very similar to that of LolA (10Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and its hydrophobic cavity also binds bis-ANS. 5Y. Oguchi and H. Tokuda, unpublished observation. The lipoprotein transfer from LolA to LolB takes place in the absence of energy input through the two similar hydrophobic cavities. The LolB function is likely to be regulated when a similar redox switch is introduced. The switch will be a useful tool for determining the molecular events of the transfer reaction in detail.
