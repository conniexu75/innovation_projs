https://openalex.org/W2086277161,"Mammalian pre-implantation development is a complex process involving dramatic changes in the transcriptional architecture. We report here a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse embryos, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on single-nucleotide variants in human blastomere messenger RNAs and paternal-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25 to 53%). By weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we find that each developmental stage can be delineated concisely by a small number of functional modules of co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation and metabolism, acting in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons with mouse pre-implantation embryos reveal that the majority of human stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are notably preserved, but developmental specificity and timing differ between human and mouse. Furthermore, we identify conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes represent novel candidates that are likely to be key in driving mammalian pre-implantation development. Together, the results provide a valuable resource to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms underlying progressive development of early mammalian embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2066520537,"Gender disparities appear to be decreasing in academia according to a number of metrics, such as grant funding, hiring, acceptance at scholarly journals, and productivity, and it might be tempting to think that gender inequity will soon be a problem of the past. However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship."

https://openalex.org/W1981137206,"Kidney cysts occur following inactivation of polycystins in otherwise intact cilia or following complete removal of cilia by inactivation of intraflagellar transport-related proteins. We investigated the mechanisms of cyst formation in these two distinct processes by combining conditional inactivation of polycystins with concomitant ablation of cilia in developing and adult kidney and liver. We found that loss of intact cilia suppressed cyst growth following inactivation of polycystins and that the severity of cystic disease was directly related to the length of time between the initial loss of the polycystin proteins and the subsequent involution of cilia. This cilia-dependent cyst growth was not explained by activation of the MAPK/ERK, mTOR or cAMP pathways and is likely to be distinct from the mechanism of cyst growth following complete loss of cilia. These data establish the existence of a new pathway defined by polycystin-dependent inhibition and cilia-dependent activation that promotes rapid cyst growth."
https://openalex.org/W1982958549,"Among ∼5,000,000 fungal species, C. albicans is exceptional in its lifelong association with humans, either within the gastrointestinal microbiome or as an invasive pathogen. Opportunistic infections are generally ascribed to defective host immunity but may require specific microbial programs. Here we report that exposure of C. albicans to the mammalian gut triggers a developmental switch, driven by the Wor1 transcription factor, to a commensal cell type. Wor1 expression was previously observed only in rare genetic backgrounds, where it controls a white-opaque switch in mating. We show that passage of wild-type cells through the mouse gastrointestinal tract triggers WOR1 expression and a novel phenotypic switch. The resulting GUT (gastrointestinally induced transition) cells differ morphologically and functionally from previously defined cell types, including opaque cells, and express a transcriptome that is optimized for the digestive tract. The white-GUT switch illuminates how a microorganism can use distinct genetic programs to transition between commensalism and invasive pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008047506,"Despite continual progress in the cataloging of vertebrate regulatory elements, little is known about their organization and regulatory architecture. Here we describe a massively parallel experiment to systematically test the impact of copy number, spacing, combination and order of transcription factor binding sites on gene expression. A complex library of ∼5,000 synthetic regulatory elements containing patterns from 12 liver-specific transcription factor binding sites was assayed in mice and in HepG2 cells. We find that certain transcription factors act as direct drivers of gene expression in homotypic clusters of binding sites, independent of spacing between sites, whereas others function only synergistically. Heterotypic enhancers are stronger than their homotypic analogs and favor specific transcription factor binding site combinations, mimicking putative native enhancers. Exhaustive testing of binding site permutations suggests that there is flexibility in binding site order. Our findings provide quantitative support for a flexible model of regulatory element activity and suggest a framework for the design of synthetic tissue-specific enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2150786121,"Monica Justice and colleagues performed a genetic suppressor screen in Mecp2-null mice, which recapitulate symptoms of Rett syndrome, a neurological disease with autistic features. They identify a nonsense suppressor mutation in Sqle, which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and show that treatment of Mecp2 mutant mice with statins improves symptoms and increases longevity. Mutations in MECP2, encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2, cause Rett syndrome, the most severe autism spectrum disorder. Re-expressing Mecp2 in symptomatic Mecp2-null mice markedly improves function and longevity, providing hope that therapeutic intervention is possible in humans. To identify pathways in disease pathology for therapeutic intervention, we carried out a dominant N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis suppressor screen in Mecp2-null mice and isolated five suppressors that ameliorate the symptoms of Mecp2 loss. We show that a stop codon mutation in Sqle, encoding squalene epoxidase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, underlies suppression in one line. Subsequently, we also show that lipid metabolism is perturbed in the brains and livers of Mecp2-null male mice. Consistently, statin drugs improve systemic perturbations of lipid metabolism, alleviate motor symptoms and confer increased longevity in Mecp2 mutant mice. Our genetic screen therefore points to cholesterol homeostasis as a potential target for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1984804635,"A series of long molecular dynamics simulations shows that the K+ channel is sterically locked in the inactive conformation by buried water molecules bound behind the selectivity filter; a kinetic model deduced from the simulations shows how releasing the buried waters can elongate the timescale of the recovery period, and this hypothesis is confirmed using ‘wet’ biophysical experiments. After a stimulus has caused the gate of an ion channel to open, the channel conducts until its selectivity filter inactivates. A recovery phase follows, involving conformational transition of the closed channel from an inactive to a conductive state. The bacterial K+ channel KcsA provides an excellent model system to study the mechanisms by which slow (C-type) inactivation of the channel and recovery from the inactivated state occur. In this manuscript, the authors used a series of long molecular dynamics simulations to show that the selectivity filter is sterically locked in the inactive conformation by buried water molecules bound behind the selectivity filter. A kinetic model deduced from the simulations shows how releasing the buried waters can elongate the timescale of the recovery period, and this model is probed using 'wet' biophysical experiments. Application of a specific stimulus opens the intracellular gate of a K+ channel (activation), yielding a transient period of ion conduction until the selectivity filter spontaneously undergoes a conformational change towards a non-conductive state (inactivation). Removal of the stimulus closes the gate and allows the selectivity filter to interconvert back to its conductive conformation (recovery). Given that the structural differences between the conductive and inactivated filter are very small, it is unclear why the recovery process can take up to several seconds. The bacterial K+ channel KcsA from Streptomyces lividans can be used to help elucidate questions about channel inactivation and recovery at the atomic level. Although KcsA contains only a pore domain, without voltage-sensing machinery, it has the structural elements necessary for ion conduction, activation and inactivation1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Here we reveal, by means of a series of long molecular dynamics simulations, how the selectivity filter is sterically locked in the inactive conformation by buried water molecules bound behind the selectivity filter. Potential of mean force calculations show how the recovery process is affected by the buried water molecules and the rebinding of an external K+ ion. A kinetic model deduced from the simulations shows how releasing the buried water molecules can stretch the timescale of recovery to seconds. This leads to the prediction that reducing the occupancy of the buried water molecules by imposing a high osmotic stress should accelerate the rate of recovery, which was verified experimentally by measuring the recovery rate in the presence of a 2-molar sucrose concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1996551392,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is usually correlated with the poor prognosis of gastric cancer. In this study, we revealed a total of 11 microRNAs (miRNA) that regulated MDR of gastric cancer via high-throughput functional screening, and miR-508-5p reversed MDR most efficiently among these candidate miRNAs. The overexpression of miR-508-5p was sufficient to reverse cancer cell resistance to multiple chemotherapeutics in vitro and sensitize tumours to chemotherapy in vivo. Further studies showed that miR-508-5p could directly target the 3′-untranslated regions of ABCB1 and Zinc ribbon domain-containing 1 (ZNRD1), and suppress their expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Meanwhile, the suppression of ZNRD1 led to a decrease in ABCB1. These findings suggest that a miR-508-5p/ZNRD1/ABCB1 regulatory loop has a critical role in MDR in gastric cancer. In addition, miR-508-5p could be used as a prognostic factor for overall survival in gastric cancer. These data reveal an important role for miR-508-5p in the regulation of MDR in gastric cancer, and suggest the potential application of miR-508-5p in drug resistance prediction and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1966841279,"In Gram-positive bacteria, T-box riboswitches regulate the expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and other proteins in response to fluctuating transfer RNA aminoacylation levels under various nutritional states. T-boxes reside in the 5'-untranslated regions of the messenger RNAs they regulate, and consist of two conserved domains. Stem I contains the specifier trinucleotide that base pairs with the anticodon of cognate tRNA. 3' to stem I is the antiterminator domain, which base pairs with the tRNA acceptor end and evaluates its aminoacylation state. Despite high phylogenetic conservation and widespread occurrence in pathogens, the structural basis of tRNA recognition by this riboswitch remains ill defined. Here we demonstrate that the ~100-nucleotide T-box stem I is necessary and sufficient for specific, high-affinity (dissociation constant (Kd) ~150 nM) tRNA binding, and report the structure of Oceanobacillus iheyensis glyQ stem I in complex with its cognate tRNA at 3.2 Å resolution. Stem I recognizes the overall architecture of tRNA in addition to its anticodon, something accomplished by large ribonucleoproteins such as the ribosome, or proteins such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, but is unprecedented for a compact mRNA domain. The C-shaped stem I cradles the L-shaped tRNA, forming an extended (1,604 Å(2)) intermolecular interface. In addition to the specifier-anticodon interaction, two interdigitated T-loops near the apex of stem I stack on the tRNA elbow in a manner analogous to those of the J11/12-J12/11 motif of RNase P and the L1 stalk of the ribosomal E-site. Because these ribonucleoproteins and T-boxes are unrelated, this strategy to recognize a universal tRNA feature probably evolved convergently. Mutually induced fit of stem I and the tRNA exploiting the intrinsic flexibility of tRNA and its conserved post-transcriptional modifications results in high shape complementarity, which in addition to providing specificity and affinity, globally organizes the T-box to orchestrate tRNA-dependent transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1968288171,"Chromosome duplication normally initiates through the assembly of replication fork complexes at defined origins. DNA synthesis by any one fork is thought to cease when it meets another travelling in the opposite direction, at which stage the replication machinery may simply dissociate before the nascent strands are finally ligated. But what actually happens is not clear. Here we present evidence consistent with the idea that every fork collision has the potential to threaten genomic integrity. In Escherichia coli this threat is kept at bay by RecG DNA translocase and by single-strand DNA exonucleases. Without RecG, replication initiates where forks meet through a replisome assembly mechanism normally associated with fork repair, replication restart and recombination, establishing new forks with the potential to sustain cell growth and division without an active origin. This potential is realized when roadblocks to fork progression are reduced or eliminated. It relies on the chromosome being circular, reinforcing the idea that replication initiation is triggered repeatedly by fork collision. The results reported raise the question of whether replication fork collisions have pathogenic potential for organisms that exploit several origins to replicate each chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2022586858,"Objective The objective of this study is to determine whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with reduced fetal growth, and whether nocturnal oxygen desaturation precipitates acute fetal heart rate changes. Study Design We performed a prospective observational study, screening 371 women in the second trimester for OSA symptoms. 41 subsequently underwent overnight sleep studies to diagnose OSA. Third trimester fetal growth was assessed using ultrasound. Fetal heart rate monitoring accompanied the sleep study. Cord blood was taken at delivery, to measure key regulators of fetal growth. Results Of 371 women screened, 108 (29%) were high risk for OSA. 26 high risk and 15 low risk women completed the longitudinal study; 14 had confirmed OSA (cases), and 27 were controls. The median (interquartile range) respiratory disturbance index (number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas or respiratory related arousals/hour of sleep) was 7.9 (6.1–13.8) for cases and 2.2 (1.3–3.5) for controls (p<0.001). Impaired fetal growth was observed in 43% (6/14) of cases, vs 11% (3/27) of controls (RR 2.67; 1.25–5.7; p = 0.04). Using logistic regression, only OSA (OR 6; 1.2–29.7, p = 0.03) and body mass index (OR 2.52; 1.09–5.80, p = 0.03) were significantly associated with impaired fetal growth. After adjusting for body mass index on multivariate analysis, the association between OSA and impaired fetal growth was not appreciably altered (OR 5.3; 0.93–30.34, p = 0.06), although just failed to achieve statistical significance. Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations accompanied nocturnal oxygen desaturation in one fetus, subsequently found to be severely growth restricted. Fetal growth regulators showed changes in the expected direction- with IGF-1 lower, and IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 higher- in the cord blood of infants of cases vs controls, although were not significantly different. Conclusion OSA may be associated with reduced fetal growth in late pregnancy. Further evaluation is warranted to establish whether OSA may be an important contributor to adverse perinatal outcome, including stillbirth."
https://openalex.org/W2056762193,"Neurotrophin receptors corresponding to vertebrate Trk, p75(NTR) or Sortilin have not been identified in Drosophila, thus it is unknown how neurotrophism may be implemented in insects. Two Drosophila neurotrophins, DNT1 and DNT2, have nervous system functions, but their receptors are unknown. The Toll receptor superfamily has ancient evolutionary origins and a universal function in innate immunity. Here we show that Toll paralogs unrelated to the mammalian neurotrophin receptors function as neurotrophin receptors in fruit flies. Toll-6 and Toll-7 are expressed in the CNS throughout development and regulate locomotion, motor axon targeting and neuronal survival. DNT1 (also known as NT1 and spz2) and DNT2 (also known as NT2 and spz5) interact genetically with Toll-6 and Toll-7, and DNT1 and DNT2 bind to Toll-6 and Toll-7 promiscuously and are distributed in vivo in domains complementary to or overlapping with those of Toll-6 and Toll-7. We conclude that in fruit flies, Tolls are not only involved in development and immunity but also in neurotrophism, revealing an unforeseen relationship between the neurotrophin and Toll protein families."

https://openalex.org/W2136058929,"Bak and Bax are the essential effectors of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Following an apoptotic stimulus, both undergo significant changes in conformation that facilitates their self-association to form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. However, the molecular structures of Bak and Bax oligomeric pores remain elusive. To characterize how Bak forms pores during apoptosis, we investigated its oligomerization under native conditions using blue native PAGE. We report that, in a healthy cell, inactive Bak is either monomeric or in a large complex involving VDAC2. Following an apoptotic stimulus, activated Bak forms BH3:groove homodimers that represent the basic stable oligomeric unit. These dimers multimerize to higher-order oligomers via a labile interface independent of both the BH3 domain and groove. Linkage of the α6:α6 interface is sufficient to stabilize higher-order Bak oligomers on native PAGE, suggesting an important role in the Bak oligomeric pore. Mutagenesis of the α6 helix disrupted apoptotic function because a chimera of Bak with the α6 derived from Bcl-2 could be activated by truncated Bid (tBid) and could form BH3:groove homodimers but could not form high molecular weight oligomers or mediate cell death. An α6 peptide could block Bak function but did so upstream of dimerization, potentially implicating α6 as a site for activation by BH3-only proteins. Our examination of native Bak oligomers indicates that the Bak apoptotic pore forms by the multimerization of BH3:groove homodimers and reveals that Bak α6 is not only important for Bak oligomerization and function but may also be involved in how Bak is activated by BH3-only proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2021534840,"Pre-Pottery Neolithic assemblages are best known from the fertile areas of the Mediterranean Levant. The archaeological site of Jebel Qattar 101 (JQ-101), at Jubbah in the southern part of the Nefud Desert of northern Saudi Arabia, contains a large collection of stone tools, adjacent to an Early Holocene palaeolake. The stone tool assemblage contains lithic types, including El-Khiam and Helwan projectile points, which are similar to those recorded in Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B assemblages in the Fertile Crescent. Jebel Qattar lies ∼500 kilometres outside the previously identified geographic range of Pre-Pottery Neolithic cultures. Technological analysis of the typologically diagnostic Jebel Qattar 101 projectile points indicates a unique strategy to manufacture the final forms, thereby raising the possibility of either direct migration of Levantine groups or the acculturation of mobile communities in Arabia. The discovery of the Early Holocene site of Jebel Qattar suggests that our view of the geographic distribution and character of Pre-Pottery Neolithic cultures may be in need of revision."
https://openalex.org/W1989071951,"The associations between obesity, hypertension and diabetes are well established, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may provide a link among them. The effect of RAS inhibition on type 2 diabetes is still unclear; however, RAS seems to play an important role in the regulation of the pancreas and glucose intolerance of mice fed high-fat (HF) diet.C57BL/6 mice fed a HF diet (8 weeks) were treated with aliskiren (50 mg/kg/day), enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) or losartan (10 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks, and the protective effects were extensively compared among groups by morphometry, stereological tools, immunostaining, Western blotting and hormonal analysis.All RAS inhibitors significantly attenuated the increased blood pressure in mice fed a HF diet. Treatment with enalapril, but not aliskiren or losartan, significantly attenuated body mass (BM) gain, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, improved the alpha and beta cell mass and prevented the reduction of plasma adiponectin. Furthermore, enalapril treatment improved the protein expression of the pancreatic islet Pdx1, GLUT2, ACE2 and Mas receptors. Losartan treatment showed the greatest AT2R expression.Our findings indicate that ACE inhibition with enalapril attenuated several of the deleterious effects of the HF diet. In summary, enalapril appears to be responsible for the normalization of islet morphology and function, of alpha and beta cell mass and of Pdx1 and GLUT2 expression. These protective effects of enalapril were attributed, primarily, to the reduction in body mass gain and food intake and the enhancement of the ACE2/Ang (1-7) /Mas receptor axis and adiponectin levels."
https://openalex.org/W2045803078,"Superior cervical ganglia 10 (SCG10), as a microtubule (MT) destabilizer, maintains MT homeostasis and has a critical role in neuronal development, but its function in tumorigenesis has not been characterized. In the present study, we demonstrated that p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4)-mediated SCG10 phosphorylation regulates MT homeostasis in metastatic gastric cancer. Our results indicate that SCG10 is a physiological substrate of PAK4, which is phosphorylated on serine 50 (Ser50) in a PAK4-dependent manner. Phosphorylated SCG10 regulated MT dynamics to promote gastric cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft mouse models. Inhibiting PAK4, either by LCH-7749944 or RNA interference, resulted in the inhibition of Ser50 phosphorylation and a blockade to cell invasion, suggesting that PAK4-SCG10 signaling occurs in gastric cancer cell invasion. Moreover, we demonstrated a strong positive correlation between PAK4 and phospho-Ser50 SCG10 expression in gastric cancer samples. We also showed that high expression of SCG10 phospho-Ser50 is highly correlated to an aggressive phenotype of clinical gastric cancer. These findings revealed a novel function of SCG10 in promoting invasive potential of gastric cancer cells, suggesting that blocking PAK4-mediated SCG10 phosphorylation might be a potential therapeutic strategy for metastasis of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2046099157,"The authors investigate the mechanisms of long-term depression of inhibitory synapses onto medium spiny neurons in the striatum. They identify direct vs. indirect pathway-specific and state-dependent differences in endocannabinoid signaling mechanisms underlying this plasticity. The dorsolateral striatum and cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) signaling mediate habitual action learning, which is thought to require a balance of activity in the direct and indirect striatal output pathways. However, very little is known about how the high CB1–expressing striatal inhibitory microcircuitry might contribute to long-term plasticity capable of sculpting direct and indirect pathway output. Using optogenetic and molecular interrogation of striatal GABAergic microcircuits, we examined voltage-dependent long-term depression of inhibitory synapses (iLTD) onto mouse and rat medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). The observed iLTD involved recruitment of different endocannabinoid types and showed both presynaptic and postsynaptic selectivity for MSN subtypes, ultimately resulting in a powerful disinhibition of direct pathway MSNs. These results suggest a new role for voltage states in gating circuit-specific forms of synaptic plasticity and illuminate possible circuit dynamics underlying action control."
https://openalex.org/W2005729115,"Future climate change is predicted to advance faster than the postglacial warming. Migration may therefore become a key driver for future development of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. For 140 European plant species we computed past range shifts since the last glacial maximum and future range shifts for a variety of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and global circulation models (GCMs). Range shift rates were estimated by means of species distribution modelling (SDM). With process-based seed dispersal models we estimated species-specific migration rates for 27 dispersal modes addressing dispersal by wind (anemochory) for different wind conditions, as well as dispersal by mammals (dispersal on animal's coat – epizoochory and dispersal by animals after feeding and digestion – endozoochory) considering different animal species. Our process-based modelled migration rates generally exceeded the postglacial range shift rates indicating that the process-based models we used are capable of predicting migration rates that are in accordance with realized past migration. For most of the considered species, the modelled migration rates were considerably lower than the expected future climate change induced range shift rates. This implies that most plant species will not entirely be able to follow future climate-change-induced range shifts due to dispersal limitation. Animals with large day- and home-ranges are highly important for achieving high migration rates for many plant species, whereas anemochory is relevant for only few species."
https://openalex.org/W2134199207,"Letm1 is a conserved protein in eukaryotes bearing energized mitochondria. Hemizygous deletion of its gene has been implicated in symptoms of the human disease Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Studies almost exclusively performed in opisthokonts have attributed several roles to Letm1, including maintaining mitochondrial morphology, mediating either calcium or potassium/proton antiport, and facilitating mitochondrial translation. We address the ancestral function of Letm1 in the highly diverged protist and significant pathogen, Trypanosoma brucei. We demonstrate that Letm1 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial volume via potassium/proton exchange across the inner membrane. This role is essential in the vector-dwelling procyclic and mammal-infecting bloodstream stages as well as in Trypanosoma brucei evansi, a form of the latter stage lacking an organellar genome. In the pathogenic bloodstream stage, the mitochondrion consumes ATP to maintain an energized state, whereas that of T. brucei evansi also lacks a conventional proton-driven membrane potential. Thus, Letm1 performs its function in different physiological states, suggesting that ion homeostasis is among the few characterized essential pathways of the mitochondrion at this T. brucei life stage. Interestingly, Letm1 depletion in the procyclic stage can be complemented by exogenous expression of its human counterpart, highlighting the conservation of protein function between highly divergent species. Furthermore, although mitochondrial translation is affected upon Letm1 ablation, it is an indirect consequence of K(+) accumulation in the matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2028724012,"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate prospectively whether MRI plaque imaging can identify patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis who have an increased risk for future cerebral events. MRI plaque imaging allows categorization of carotid stenosis into different lesion types (I–VIII). Within these lesion types, lesion types IV–V and VI are regarded as rupture-prone plaques, whereas the other lesion types represent stable ones. Methods Eighty-three consecutive patients (45 male (54.2%); age 54–88 years (mean 73.2 years)) presenting with an asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 50–99% according to ECST-criteria were recruited. Patients were imaged with a 1.5-T scanner. T1-, T2-, time-of-flight-, and proton-density weighted studies were performed. The carotid plaques were classified as lesion type I–VIII. Clinical endpoints were ischemic stroke, TIA or amaurosis fugax. Survival analysis and log rank test were used to ascertain statistical significance. Results Six out of 83 patients (7.2%) were excluded: 4 patients had insufficient MR image quality; 1 patient was lost-to-follow-up; 1 patient died shortly after the baseline MRI plaque imaging. The following results were obtained by analyzing the remaining 77 patients. The mean time of follow-up was 41.1 months. During follow-up, n = 9 (11.7%) ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred. Only patients presenting with the high-risk lesion types IV–V and VI developed an ipsilateral cerebrovascular event versus none of the patients presenting with the stable lesion types III, VII, and VIII (n = 9 (11.7%) vs. n = 0 (0%) during follow-up). Event-free survival was higher among patients with the MRI-defined stable lesion types (III, VII, and VIII) than in patients with the high-risk lesion types (IV–V and VI) (log rank test P<0.0001). Conclusions MRI plaque imaging has the potential to identify patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who are particularly at risk of developing future cerebral ischemia. MRI could improve selection criteria for invasive therapy in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2065518993,"Background Symbioses between metazoans and microbes are widespread and vital to many ecosystems. Recent work with several nematode species has suggested that strong associations with microbial symbionts may also be common among members of this phylu. In this work we explore possible symbiosis between bacteria and the free living soil bacteriovorous nematode Acrobeloides maximus. Methodology We used a soil microcosm approach to expose A. maximus populations grown monoxenically on RFP labeled Escherichia coli in a soil slurry. Worms were recovered by density gradient separation and examined using both culture-independent and isolation methods. A 16S rRNA gene survey of the worm-associated bacteria was compared to the soil and to a similar analysis using Caenorhabditis elegans N2. Recovered A. maximus populations were maintained on cholesterol agar and sampled to examine the population dynamics of the microbiome. Results A consistent core microbiome was extracted from A. maximus that differed from those in the bulk soil or the C. elegans associated set. Three genera, Ochrobactrum, Pedobacter, and Chitinophaga, were identified at high levels only in the A. maximus populations, which were less diverse than the assemblage associated with C. elegans. Putative symbiont populations were maintained for at least 4 months post inoculation, although the levels decreased as the culture aged. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes specific for Ochrobactrum and Pedobacter stained bacterial cells in formaldehyde fixed nematode guts. Conclusions Three microorganisms were repeatedly observed in association with Acrobeloides maximus when recovered from soil microcosms. We isolated several Ochrobactrum sp. and Pedobacter sp., and demonstrated that they inhabit the nematode gut by FISH. Although their role in A. maximus is not resolved, we propose possible mutualistic roles for these bacteria in protection of the host against pathogens and facilitating enzymatic digestion of other ingested bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2083211507,"Recognition of the translation initiation codon is thought to require dissociation of eIF1 from the 40 S ribosomal subunit, enabling irreversible GTP hydrolysis (Pi release) by the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC), rearrangement of the 40 S subunit to a closed conformation incompatible with scanning, and stable binding of Met-tRNAi to the P site. The crystal structure of a Tetrahymena 40 S·eIF1 complex revealed several basic amino acids in eIF1 contacting 18 S rRNA, and we tested the prediction that their counterparts in yeast eIF1 are required to prevent premature eIF1 dissociation from scanning ribosomes at non-AUG triplets. Supporting this idea, substituting Lys-60 in helix α1, or either Lys-37 or Arg-33 in β-hairpin loop-1, impairs binding of yeast eIF1 to 40 S·eIF1A complexes in vitro, and it confers increased initiation at UUG codons (Sui(-) phenotype) or lethality, in a manner suppressed by overexpressing the mutant proteins or by an eIF1A mutation (17-21) known to impede eIF1 dissociation in vitro. The eIF1 Sui(-) mutations also derepress translation of GCN4 mRNA, indicating impaired ternary complex loading, and this Gcd(-) phenotype is likewise suppressed by eIF1 overexpression or the 17-21 mutation. These findings indicate that direct contacts of eIF1 with 18 S rRNA seen in the Tetrahymena 40 S·eIF1 complex are crucial in yeast to stabilize the open conformation of the 40 S subunit and are required for rapid TC loading and ribosomal scanning and to impede rearrangement to the closed complex at non-AUG codons. Finally, we implicate the unstructured N-terminal tail of eIF1 in blocking rearrangement to the closed conformation in the scanning preinitiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1968035605,"RecG and RuvAB are proposed to act at stalled DNA replication forks to facilitate replication restart. To clarify the roles of these proteins in fork regression, we used a coupled spectrophotometric ATPase assay to determine how these helicases act on two groups of model fork substrates: the first group mimics nascent stalled forks, whereas the second mimics regressed fork structures. The results show that RecG is active on the substrates in group 1, whereas these are poor substrates for RuvAB. In addition, in the presence of group 1 forks, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) enhances the activity of RecG and enables it to compete with excess RuvA. In contrast, SSB inhibits the activity of RuvAB on these substrates. Results also show that the preferred regressed fork substrate for RuvAB is a Holliday junction, not a forked DNA. The active form of the enzyme on the Holliday junction contains a single RuvA tetramer. In contrast, although the enzyme is active on a regressed fork structure, RuvB loading by a single RuvA tetramer is impaired, and full activity requires the cooperative binding of two forked DNA substrate molecules. Collectively, the data support a model where RecG is responsible for stalled DNA replication fork regression. SSB ensures that if the nascent fork has single-stranded DNA character RuvAB is inhibited, whereas the activity of RecG is preferentially enhanced. Only once the fork has been regressed and the DNA is relaxed can RuvAB bind to a RecG-extruded Holliday junction.Background: DNA replication fork rescue requires the action of DNA helicases to regress the fork.Results: RecG is more active than RuvAB on substrates that mimic nascent stalled forks, whereas RuvAB is active on Holliday junctions.Conclusion: RecG in concert with SSB regresses stalled DNA replication forks, producing DNA substrates to which RuvAB can bind.Significance: RecG, not RuvAB, regresses stalled DNA replication forks. RecG and RuvAB are proposed to act at stalled DNA replication forks to facilitate replication restart. To clarify the roles of these proteins in fork regression, we used a coupled spectrophotometric ATPase assay to determine how these helicases act on two groups of model fork substrates: the first group mimics nascent stalled forks, whereas the second mimics regressed fork structures. The results show that RecG is active on the substrates in group 1, whereas these are poor substrates for RuvAB. In addition, in the presence of group 1 forks, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) enhances the activity of RecG and enables it to compete with excess RuvA. In contrast, SSB inhibits the activity of RuvAB on these substrates. Results also show that the preferred regressed fork substrate for RuvAB is a Holliday junction, not a forked DNA. The active form of the enzyme on the Holliday junction contains a single RuvA tetramer. In contrast, although the enzyme is active on a regressed fork structure, RuvB loading by a single RuvA tetramer is impaired, and full activity requires the cooperative binding of two forked DNA substrate molecules. Collectively, the data support a model where RecG is responsible for stalled DNA replication fork regression. SSB ensures that if the nascent fork has single-stranded DNA character RuvAB is inhibited, whereas the activity of RecG is preferentially enhanced. Only once the fork has been regressed and the DNA is relaxed can RuvAB bind to a RecG-extruded Holliday junction. Background: DNA replication fork rescue requires the action of DNA helicases to regress the fork. Results: RecG is more active than RuvAB on substrates that mimic nascent stalled forks, whereas RuvAB is active on Holliday junctions. Conclusion: RecG in concert with SSB regresses stalled DNA replication forks, producing DNA substrates to which RuvAB can bind. Significance: RecG, not RuvAB, regresses stalled DNA replication forks. Genome duplication is inherently accurate, is highly processive, and relies on the close interplay between the genetic recombination and DNA repair machinery (1Kogoma T.

Although RuvABC can function in replication fork processing, its primary role may instead be to perform the branch migration stage of recombination (38West S.C. Processing of recombination intermediates by the RuvABC proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is clear that both RecG and RuvAB can act on stalled replication fork substrates, producing suitable substrates for RuvC cleavage (10McGlynn P. Lloyd R.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is an important difference as RuvAB cannot unwind forked DNA to form a Holliday junction, whereas RecG is able to do so (14McGlynn P. Lloyd R. Action of RuvAB at replication fork structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41938-41944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Marians K.J.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8235-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the above mentioned studies show that each of these proteins can in principle function in DNA repair, having the capacity to act on model forked DNA substrates, they do not delineate how each may access a nascent, stalled replication fork, leading to its resurrection. To understand this, we performed a careful kinetic analysis of each enzyme in the presence of two groups of forked DNA substrates: the first group mimics nascent stalled DNA replication forks, whereas the second group mimics regressed forks (see Table 1).TABLE 1DNA substrates and their uses Open table in a new tab Results show that RecG exhibits significant activity on the substrates in group 1, whereas these are poor substrates for RuvAB. In these DNA substrates, either one or both arms are single-stranded DNA. In addition, the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) 2The abbreviations used are: SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; STMP, salt titration midpoint; HJ, Holliday junction. enhances the activity of RecG in the presence of these DNA molecules while inhibiting RuvAB. Furthermore, under conditions of vast RuvA excess, a condition that results in inhibition of RecG activity, SSB is able to rescue RecG by restoring the level of activity back to that observed in the absence of RuvA. Results also show that for the substrates in group 2, namely those that resemble a regressed fork, both DNA helicases are the most catalytically efficient of all the substrates tested herein. For these substrates, all arms are duplex DNA. The high catalytic efficiency of RuvAB on a fork with duplex arms requires cooperative binding of two substrate DNA molecules, whereas the enzyme binds only a single Holliday junction to achieve the same level of activity. In addition, from protein titrations, the activity of RuvAB saturates at one RuvA tetramer per DNA molecule where the DNA is either a fork with duplex arms or a Holliday junction. However, saturation of activity requires 3-fold more RuvB with the fork substrate than with the Holliday junction. Collectively, these data suggest that the preferred substrate for RuvAB is a Holliday junction as suggested previously (41Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C.

EcoSal—Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C2010Google Scholar). In summary, our data are consistent with our previous work supporting an early role for RecG in fork regression and a later role for RuvAB in fork rescue (43Buss J.A. Kimura Y. Bianco P.R. RecG interacts directly with SSB: implications for stalled replication fork regression.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 7029-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The work in this study strengthens this view and shows that at a nascent stalled DNA replication fork RecG, likely in concert with SSB, acts first to regress the fork. Concurrently, SSB inhibits access of RuvAB to a nascent stalled fork, which is a poor substrate for RuvAB. Fork processing by RecG leads to the formation of a fork with duplex arms that could be accessed by PriA, resulting in reloading of the replisome (44Gabbai C.B. Marians K.J.

Instead, if further processing of this structure occurs, it would be carried by RecG, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction-like structure as shown recently (48Manosas M. Perumal S.

https://openalex.org/W2039894956,"MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis follows a conserved succession of processing steps, beginning with the recognition and liberation of an miRNA-containing precursor miRNA hairpin from a large primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) by the Microprocessor, which consists of the nuclear RNase III Drosha and the double-stranded RNA-binding domain protein DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region protein 8). Current models suggest that specific recognition is driven by DGCR8 detection of single-stranded elements of the pri-miRNA stem-loop followed by Drosha recruitment and pri-miRNA cleavage. Because countless RNA transcripts feature single-stranded-dsRNA junctions and DGCR8 can bind hundreds of mRNAs, we explored correlations between RNA binding properties of DGCR8 and specific pri-miRNA substrate processing. We found that DGCR8 bound single-stranded, double-stranded, and random hairpin transcripts with similar affinity. Further investigation of DGCR8/pri-mir-16 interactions by NMR detected intermediate exchange regimes over a wide range of stoichiometric ratios. Diffusion analysis of DGCR8/pri-mir-16 interactions by pulsed field gradient NMR lent further support to dynamic complex formation involving free components in exchange with complexes of varying stoichiometry, although in vitro processing assays showed exclusive cleavage of pri-mir-16 variants bearing single-stranded flanking regions. Our results indicate that DGCR8 binds RNA nonspecifically. Therefore, a sequential model of DGCR8 recognition followed by Drosha recruitment is unlikely. Known RNA substrate requirements are broad and include 70-nucleotide hairpins with unpaired flanking regions. Thus, specific RNA processing is likely facilitated by preformed DGCR8-Drosha heterodimers that can discriminate between authentic substrates and other hairpins."
https://openalex.org/W2099209045,"Library preparation for next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) remains a key bottleneck in the sequencing process which can be relieved through improved automation and miniaturization. We describe a microfluidic device for automating laboratory protocols that require one or more column chromatography steps and demonstrate its utility for preparing Next Generation sequencing libraries for the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms. Sixteen different libraries can be generated simultaneously with significantly reduced reagent cost and hands-on time compared to manual library preparation. Using an appropriate column matrix and buffers, size selection can be performed on-chip following end-repair, dA tailing, and linker ligation, so that the libraries eluted from the chip are ready for sequencing. The core architecture of the device ensures uniform, reproducible column packing without user supervision and accommodates multiple routine protocol steps in any sequence, such as reagent mixing and incubation; column packing, loading, washing, elution, and regeneration; capture of eluted material for use as a substrate in a later step of the protocol; and removal of one column matrix so that two or more column matrices with different functional properties can be used in the same protocol. The microfluidic device is mounted on a plastic carrier so that reagents and products can be aliquoted and recovered using standard pipettors and liquid handling robots. The carrier-mounted device is operated using a benchtop controller that seals and operates the device with programmable temperature control, eliminating any requirement for the user to manually attach tubing or connectors. In addition to NGS library preparation, the device and controller are suitable for automating other time-consuming and error-prone laboratory protocols requiring column chromatography steps, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2000051774,"Plexiform lesions (PLs), the hallmark of plexogenic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), contain phenotypically altered, proliferative endothelial cells (ECs). The molecular mechanism that contributes to EC proliferation and formation of PLs is poorly understood. We now show that a decrease in intersectin-1s (ITSN-1s) expression due to granzyme B (GrB) cleavage during inflammation associated with PAH and the high p38/Erk1/2(MAPK) activity ratio caused by the GrB/ITSN cleavage products lead to EC proliferation and selection of a proliferative/plexiform EC phenotype. We used human pulmonary artery ECs of PAH subjects (EC(PAH)), paraffin-embedded and frozen human lung tissue, and animal models of PAH in conjunction with microscopy imaging, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches to demonstrate that GrB cleaves ITSN-1s, a prosurvival protein of lung ECs, and generates two biologically active fragments, an N-terminal fragment (GrB-EH(ITSN)) with EC proliferative potential and a C-terminal product with dominant negative effects on Ras/Erk1/2. The proliferative potential of GrB-EH(ITSN) is mediated via sustained phosphorylation of p38(MAPK) and Elk-1 transcription factor and abolished by chemical inhibition of p38(MAPK). Moreover, lung tissue of PAH animal models and human specimens and EC(PAH) express lower levels of ITSN-1s compared with controls and the GrB-EH(ITSN) cleavage product. Moreover, GrB immunoreactivity is associated with PLs in PAH lungs. The concurrent expression of the two cleavage products results in a high p38/Erk1/2(MAPK) activity ratio, which is critical for EC proliferation. Our findings identify a novel GrB-EH(ITSN)-dependent pathogenic p38(MAPK)/Elk-1 signaling pathway involved in the poorly understood process of PL formation in severe PAH."

https://openalex.org/W2012990453,"Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80% sensitivity and 99.6% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely available on ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html), a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the SpiderP website."
https://openalex.org/W2102216456,"Arsenic, a known human carcinogen, is widely distributed around the world and found in particularly high concentrations in certain regions including Southwestern US, Eastern Europe, India, China, Taiwan and Mexico. Chronic arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide and is associated with increased risk of many diseases including arthrosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. In this study, we explored genome level global responses to high and low levels of arsenic exposure in Caenorhabditis elegans using Affymetrix expression microarrays. This experimental design allows us to do microarray analysis of dose-response relationships of global gene expression patterns. High dose (0.03%) exposure caused stronger global gene expression changes in comparison with low dose (0.003%) exposure, suggesting a positive dose-response correlation. Biological processes such as oxidative stress, and iron metabolism, which were previously reported to be involved in arsenic toxicity studies using cultured cells, experimental animals, and humans, were found to be affected in C. elegans. We performed genome-wide gene expression comparisons between our microarray data and publicly available C. elegans microarray datasets of cadmium, and sediment exposure samples of German rivers Rhine and Elbe. Bioinformatics analysis of arsenic-responsive regulatory networks were done using FastMEDUSA program. FastMEDUSA analysis identified cancer-related genes, particularly genes associated with leukemia, such as dnj-11, which encodes a protein orthologous to the mammalian ZRF1/MIDA1/MPP11/DNAJC2 family of ribosome-associated molecular chaperones. We analyzed the protective functions of several of the identified genes using RNAi. Our study indicates that C. elegans could be a substitute model to study the mechanism of metal toxicity using high-throughput expression data and bioinformatics tools such as FastMEDUSA."
https://openalex.org/W2049445291,"How does the brain integrate multiple sources of information to support normal sensorimotor and cognitive functions? To investigate this question we present an overall brain architecture (called “the dual intertwined rings architecture”) that relates the functional specialization of cortical networks to their spatial distribution over the cerebral cortex (or “corticotopy”). Recent results suggest that the resting state networks (RSNs) are organized into two large families: 1) a sensorimotor family that includes visual, somatic, and auditory areas and 2) a large association family that comprises parietal, temporal, and frontal regions and also includes the default mode network. We used two large databases of resting state fMRI data, from which we extracted 32 robust RSNs. We estimated: (1) the RSN functional roles by using a projection of the results on task based networks (TBNs) as referenced in large databases of fMRI activation studies; and (2) relationship of the RSNs with the Brodmann Areas. In both classifications, the 32 RSNs are organized into a remarkable architecture of two intertwined rings per hemisphere and so four rings linked by homotopic connections. The first ring forms a continuous ensemble and includes visual, somatic, and auditory cortices, with interspersed bimodal cortices (auditory-visual, visual-somatic and auditory-somatic, abbreviated as VSA ring). The second ring integrates distant parietal, temporal and frontal regions (PTF ring) through a network of association fiber tracts which closes the ring anatomically and ensures a functional continuity within the ring. The PTF ring relates association cortices specialized in attention, language and working memory, to the networks involved in motivation and biological regulation and rhythms. This “dual intertwined architecture” suggests a dual integrative process: the VSA ring performs fast real-time multimodal integration of sensorimotor information whereas the PTF ring performs multi-temporal integration (i.e., relates past, present, and future representations at different temporal scales)."

The Isd pathway is important for the pathogenesis of S. aureus as heme may be the preferred iron source (25.Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O.

In vitro cleavage of the porphyrin ring by IsdG or IsdI requires molecular oxygen and a source of electrons, and ascorbic acid or non-S. aureus reductase proteins have typically been used as the electron donor (22.Skaar E.P.

IsdG and IsdI cleave the porphyrin ring at either the δ-meso or β-meso carbons, resulting in two different products, 5-oxo-δ-bilirubin and 15-oxo-β-bilirubin, that are known as the staphylobilins. They are similar to but distinct from biliverdin, the product of heme degradation by conventional heme oxygenases such as human heme oxygenase (HO-1), suggesting that the reaction mechanism is different (27.Reniere M.L. Ukpabi G.N. Harry S.R. Stec D.F. Krull R. Wright D.W. Bachmann B.O. Murphy M.E. Skaar E.P. The IsdG-family of haem oxygenases degrades haem to a novel chromophore.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike HO-1, which generates CO during heme degradation, IsdG and IsdI generate formaldehyde (28.Matsui T. Nambu S. Ono Y.

Heme bound to IsdG and IsdI is significantly distorted from planarity in a fashion described as ruffling (29.Lee W.C. Reniere M.L. Skaar E.P. Murphy M.E.

Outstanding questions about heme degradation in S. aureus, include how the reaction differs from other heme degrading enzymes to generate these novel products, what is the intracellular fate of the staphylobilins, and what is the in vivo electron donor for the reaction? Here, we show that a protein encoded by NWMN2274 in S. aureus strain Newman can act as a source of electrons for heme degradation by IsdG and IsdI in the presence of NADPH. In vitro heme degradation in the presence of this protein yields the same products as reactions with ascorbic acid as an electron donor. From the specificity of the reaction, NWMN2274 is proposed to be the biological reductase associated with IsdG or IsdI heme degradation within the cytoplasm of S. aureus, and we have named this protein the iron utilization oxidoreductase, or IruO. All chemicals were obtained from Fisher unless noted below. Full-length NWMN2274 was PCR-amplified from S. aureus strain Newman chromosomal DNA with forward primer (5′-AGC GGC CTG GTG CCG CGC GGC AGC ATG AAA GAT GTT ACA ATC ATT GGT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCG GCC GCA AGC TTG TCG ACG GAG TTA CTA GTA TAA ATG TTT ATT TAC AAT-3′) to form a megaprimer PCR product. Underlined sequences represent homology to pET28a. The thermal cycling conditions were 98 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 98 °C (10 s), 58 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (30 s), and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Megaprimer extension for increased homology to pET28a was performed with forward extension primer 5′-AGC AGC CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAC AGC AGC GGC CTG GTG CCG CGC GGC AGC-3′ and reverse extension primer 5′-TGG TGG TGG TGC TCG AGT GCG GCC GCA AGC TTG TCG ACG GAG TTA-3′. The thermal cycling conditions were 98 °C for 1 min, 25 cycles of 98 °C (10 s), 55 °C (20 s), and 72 °C (15 s), and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Both reactions were performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Insertion of the NWMN2274 amplicon into pET28a was performed using a previously described whole plasmid PCR technique (32.MacPherson I.S. Rosell F.I. Scofield M. Mauk A.G. Murphy M.E. Directed evolution of copper nitrite reductase to a chromogenic reductant.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2010; 23: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The pET28a-NWMN2274 construct was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(λDE3). Colonies containing pET28a-NWMN2274 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A second PNDO-encoding gene, NWMN0732, was similarly cloned using the primers 5′-AGC GGC CTG GTG CCG CGC GGC AGC ATG ACT GAA ATA GAT TTT GA-3′ and 5′-GCG GCC GCA AGC TTG TCG ACG GAG TTA TTA AGC TTG ATC GTT TAA ATG TTC AAT-3′ to generate pET28a-NWMN0732. For protein expression, E. coli BL21(λDE3) with pET28a-NWMN2274 was grown in 2× YT media supplemented with 25 mg/ml kanamycin at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of ∼0.8. Cultures were then induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for ∼16 h at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4400 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Gold Biotechnology), and lysed at 10,000 p.s.i. with an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin). The supernatant was isolated after centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 45 min, and His6-NWMN2274 was purified using a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) with a linear imidazole gradient (0–500 mm). Protein fractions were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm TCEP at 4 °C. The His6 tag was removed by thrombin (Hemotologic Technologies) digestion at a 1/500 (w/w) thrombin-to-protein ratio and incubated over 24 h at 4 °C followed by dialysis into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm TCEP for 2 h at 4 °C. NWMN2274 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Source 15Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm TCEP and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). NWMN2274 was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, and 2 mm TCEP and concentrated to 20 mg/ml (Fig. 1D). Purified protein was protected from light and stored at 4 °C. NWMN0732 was purified by using the same protocol. IsdI and IsdG were expressed in E. coli BL21 (λDE3) cells from the plasmid pET15b, purified by His-tag affinity chromatography, and digested with the tobacco etch virus protease to remove the His tag as previously described (22.Skaar E.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Tobacco etch virus protease was purified as previously described (33.Tropea J.E. Cherry S. Waugh D.S. Expression and purification of soluble His6-tagged TEV protease.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 498: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Electronic spectra from 250 to 800 nm were measured with a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Samples were NWMN2274 (as purified), NWMN2274 after heat denaturation and protein removal, and FAD, FMN, and riboflavin standards (Sigma). All samples were at 30 μm in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl. To heat-denature and remove NWMN2274 from the flavin molecule, the protein solution was boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged through a Nanosep centrifugal device (PALL Life Sciences) with a molecular mass cut-off of 3 kDa as described previously (34.Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Identifying and quantitating FAD and FMN in simple and in iron-sulfur-containing flavoproteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar). Flavin removed from NWMN2274 as well as FAD, FMN, and riboflavin standards (all at 20 μm) were separated using an Infinity 1260 Quaternary high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent) equipped with an Aqua 5-mm C18 column (Phenomenex). A previously established procedure was utilized (34.Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Identifying and quantitating FAD and FMN in simple and in iron-sulfur-containing flavoproteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. A flow rate of 1 ml/min and a column temperature of 20 °C were maintained during the entire analysis. The column was equilibrated with 85% solvent A (10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.5)) and 15% solvent B (methanol) at sample injection. After a 5-min post-injection period, a linear gradient was developed over 20 min to 75% solvent B followed by a second linear gradient over 5 min to 100% solvent B. Flavins were detected by absorption at 264 nm using an Infinity 1260 multiple wavelength detector (Agilent). In vitro heme degradation assays were conducted as previously described (29.Lee W.C. Reniere M.L. Skaar E.P. Murphy M.E. Ruffling of metalloporphyrins bound to IsdG and IsdI, two heme-degrading enzymes in Staphylococcus aureus.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30957-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 10 mm stock solutions of porcine hemin (Sigma) in 0.1 m NaOH were prepared and kept at −20 °C. 10 μm IsdI and 10 μm porcine hemin (Sigma) were mixed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Spectra from 300 to 800 nm were measured with a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. As noted below, some reactions were also supplemented with 200 μm NADPH (EMD Biosciences), 200 μm NADH (Roche), 5 μm bovine liver catalase (Sigma), or 4 units/ml bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (Sigma). To initiate degradation reactions, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 1 μm NWMN2274, or NWMN0732, 20 μm to 2 mm H2O2, or 5 units/ml Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase (Sigma), and 1 mm glucose (Sigma) were added to cuvettes. Spectra were recorded either every minute or every 10 min for up to 90 min depending on the rate at which the reaction progressed. For kinetic analysis, 600 μm NADPH and 0.1 μm NWMN2274 were added to reactions containing 1–25 μm IsdG-heme or IsdI-heme, and the decrease in the Soret peak at 412 nm was monitored every 0.1 s for 180 s. The concentration of IsdI-heme was determined from Soret absorbance measurements for 30 s starting at 10 s after the addition of the reductase using the reported extinction coefficients for IsdG-heme (131 mm−1 cm−1) and IsdI-heme (126 mm−1 cm−1) (22.Skaar E.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Slopes determined by linear regressions of these data were taken as initial reaction rates. Initial steady-state rates were plotted against the concentration of IsdG-heme or IsdI-heme, and a non-linear regression of the data were calculated to fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Linear and non-linear regressions were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6. For these experiments, 1-ml reactions containing 100 μm IsdI-heme were prepared, and 2 mm ascorbic acid, 2 mm H2O2, 2 units/ml glucose oxidase, and 5 mm glucose or 1 mm NADPH and 5 μm NWMN2274 or NWMN0732 were added to initiate reactions. Reactions were monitored, and once complete, heme degradation products were purified as previously described (27.Reniere M.L. Ukpabi G.N. Harry S.R. Stec D.F. Krull R. Wright D.W. Bachmann B.O.

Microbiol. 2010; 75: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with one important modification. Purification includes sample filtration through a Nanosep centrifugal device. The presence of the larger NWMN2274 protein blocked the pores of spin columns with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa and prevented samples from passing easily through the column. Pore size was increased to a cutoff of 10 kDa, which improved product purification significantly, but lower yields were typically obtained from the NWMN2274/NADPH reactions than from the ascorbic acid reactions. HPLC separation of the degradation products was completed as previously described (27.Reniere M.L. Ukpabi G.N. Harry S.R. Stec D.F. Krull R. Wright D.W. Bachmann B.O. Murphy M.E. Skaar E.P.

With either setup the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and a Waters XTerra C18 column was used. Homologs of NWMN2274 were identified with BLASTP (35.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J.

Only hits with E-values equal to or less than 0.001 and covering 40% or more of the query sequence were considered significant. Multiple sequence alignments were generated with T-Coffee (36.Di Tommaso P. Moretti S. Xenarios I. Orobitg M. Montanyola A. Chang J.-M. Taly J.-F. Notredame C. T-Coffee.

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were built with the PhyML method in SeaView Version 4 (38.Gouy M. Guindon S. Gascuel O. SeaView version 4.

The following S. aureus proteins (strain names in parentheses) all share >97% amino acid sequence identity to NWMN2274: SACOL2369 (SHY97–3906), SA2162 (N315), SAUSA300_2319 (USA300), SAOUHSC_02654 (NCTC 832), and MW2294 (MW2). Genes corresponding to these proteins were assumed to be orthologs of NWMN2274 in the analysis of microarray papers from various S. aureus strains. The heme-degrading proteins IsdG and IsdI require a source of electrons for porphyrin cleavage and iron release (22.Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O.

We sought to identify a protein that could act as the in vivo source of electrons when IsdI and IsdG degrade heme within the cytoplasm of S. aureus. No candidate reductases are located within the two operons that encode the Isd system of S. aureus or in the regions immediately upstream or downstream. We hypothesized that the candidate reductase would be annotated in the genome as a reductase and that mRNA expression would be co-regulated with other Isd genes. Data from several published microarray studies demonstrating expression changes in the Isd genes (39.Allard M. Moisan H. Brouillette E. Gervais A.L. Jacques M. Lacasse P. Diarra M.S. Malouin F.

https://openalex.org/W1988836265,"The PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling axis is centrally involved in cellular homeostasis and controls cell growth and proliferation. Due to its key function as regulator of cell survival and metabolism, the dysregulation of this pathway is manifested in several human pathologies including cancers and immunological diseases. Thus, current therapeutic strategies target the components of this signaling cascade. In recent years, numerous feedback loops have been identified that attenuate PI3K/PDK1/Akt-dependent signaling. Here, we report the identification of an additional level of feedback regulation that depends on the negative transcriptional control of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) class IA subunits. Genetic deletion of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) or the pharmacological inhibition of its downstream effectors, that is, Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), relieves this suppression and leads to the upregulation of PI3K subunits, resulting in enhanced generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Apparently, this transcriptional induction is mediated by the concerted action of different transcription factor families, including the transcription factors cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and forkhead box O. Collectively, we propose that PDK1 functions as a cellular sensor that balances basal PIP3 generation at levels sufficient for survival but below a threshold being harmful to the cell. Our study suggests that the efficiency of therapies targeting the aberrantly activated PI3K/PDK1/Akt pathway might be increased by the parallel blockade of feedback circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1994554332,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that employs many diverse interactions with coregulatory proteins in normal physiology and in prostate cancer (PCa). The AR mediates cellular responses in association with chromatin complexes and kinase cascades. Here we report that the nuclear matrix protein, scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1), regulates AR activity and AR levels in a manner that suggests its involvement in PCa. SAFB1 mRNA expression was lower in PCa in comparison with normal prostate tissue in a majority of publicly available RNA expression data sets. SAFB1 protein levels were also reduced with disease progression in a cohort of human PCa that included metastatic tumors. SAFB1 bound to AR and was phosphorylated by the MST1 (Hippo homolog) serine-threonine kinase, previously shown to be an AR repressor, and MST1 localization to AR-dependent promoters was inhibited by SAFB1 depletion. Knockdown of SAFB1 in androgen-dependent LNCaP PCa cells increased AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, stimulated growth of cultured cells and subcutaneous xenografts and promoted a more aggressive phenotype, consistent with a repressive AR regulatory function. SAFB1 formed a complex with the histone methyltransferase EZH2 at AR-interacting chromatin sites in association with other polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) proteins. We conclude that SAFB1 acts as a novel AR co-regulator at gene loci where signals from the MST1/Hippo and EZH2 pathways converge."

Previously, we found that downregulation of Sgf29 suppresses c-Myc-mediated malignant transformation. Nonetheless, the upstream regulator of the Sgf29 gene is not yet known. Here, we report that Sry (sex-determining region Y), an HMG (high-mobility group) domain containing transcription factor, directly upregulates Sgf29 gene expression. Sry expression was deregulated in two out of the four tested male rodent hepatocellular carcinoma (rHCC) cell lines. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Sry could bind HMG-boxes in the proximal promoter region of the Sgf29 gene. Knockdown of Sry robustly lowered anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness and tumorigenicity of rHCC cells, whereas ectopic expression of Sry conferred more malignant properties. Thus, these data show that Sry is involved in male-specific malignant conversion of rHCCs via Sgf29 upregulation."

https://openalex.org/W2015880836,"Expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) has been identified in an increasing array of tumor types and is known to play a role as an important mediator of Wnt signaling cascades. In this study, we aimed to clarify Ror2 interactions with the Wnt pathways within the context of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). An examination of Ror2 expression in primary human RCC tumors showed a significant correlation with several Wnt signaling genes, including the classical feedback target gene Axin2. We provide evidence that Ror2 expression results in a partially activated state for canonical Wnt signaling through an increased signaling pool of β-catenin, leading to an enhancement of downstream target genes following Wnt3a stimulation in both renal and renal carcinoma-derived cells. Additionally, inhibition of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) with either siRNA or dickkopf decreased the response to Wnt3a stimulation, but no change was seen in the increased β-catenin pool associated with Ror2 expression, suggesting that LRP6 cofactor recruitment is necessary for a Wnt3a-induced signal but that it does not participate in the Ror2 effect on β-catenin signaling. These results highlight a new role for Ror2 in conveying a tonic signal to stabilize soluble β-catenin and create a poised state of enhanced responsiveness to Wnt3a exogenous signals in RCC.Background: Expression of Ror2 leads to increased tumorigenicity in RCC.Results: Ror2 expression stabilizes an increased pool of soluble β-catenin, which enhances the response to Wnt stimulation.Conclusion: Ror2 promotes basal and canonical Wnt3a ligand-enhanced β-catenin signaling in RCC.Significance: This work demonstrates a novel Ror2-dependent tiered state of canonical Wnt signaling, promoting basal signals and priming RCC cells for a heightened response to the ligand.

Additionally, inhibition of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) with either siRNA or dickkopf decreased the response to Wnt3a stimulation, but no change was seen in the increased β-catenin pool associated with Ror2 expression, suggesting that LRP6 cofactor recruitment is necessary for a Wnt3a-induced signal but that it does not participate in the Ror2 effect on β-catenin signaling. These results highlight a new role for Ror2 in conveying a tonic signal to stabilize soluble β-catenin and create a poised state of enhanced responsiveness to Wnt3a exogenous signals in RCC. Background: Expression of Ror2 leads to increased tumorigenicity in RCC. Results: Ror2 expression stabilizes an increased pool of soluble β-catenin, which enhances the response to Wnt stimulation. Conclusion: Ror2 promotes basal and canonical Wnt3a ligand-enhanced β-catenin signaling in RCC. Significance: This work demonstrates a novel Ror2-dependent tiered state of canonical Wnt signaling, promoting basal signals and priming RCC cells for a heightened response to the ligand. Cancer cells usurp many normal signaling processes in the course of transformation or acquisition of transformed cell traits. The Wnt signaling pathway is a growth and differentiation control pathway central to embryogenesis and cancer (1.Majid S. Saini S. Dahiya R. Wnt signaling pathways in urological cancers. Past decades and still growing.Mol. Cancer. 2012; 11: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt pathway is characterized by secreted Wnt factors, with Wnt3a being the most widely studied, engaging the receptor complex consisting of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 2The abbreviations used are: LRPlow-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinRCCrenal cell carcinomaCMconditioned mediumDVLDishevelledANOVAanalysis of variance. and a member of the Frizzled (Fzd) family of receptors, halting the basal state of ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin within the destruction complex. As β-catenin becomes stabilized, it results in the saturation of the destruction complex, leading to an increase of cytosolic β-catenin and localization to the nucleus (2.Li V.S. Ng S.S. Boersema P.J. Low T.Y. Karthaus W.R. Gerlach J.P. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Maurice M.M. Mahmoudi T. Clevers H.

Nuclear β-catenin drives the transcription of genes involved in promoting cell proliferation, maintenance of a primitive state, or inducing differentiation dependent upon cellular context. Wnts can initiate other signaling processes, known as the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways and promote migration, establishment of polarity, or programming of morphogenesis (3.Angers S. Moon R.T.

Purified Wnt5a protein activates or inhibits β-catenin-TCF signaling depending on receptor context.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Ror2 has been shown to engage both canonical and noncanonical Wnts, and it has been shown to transmit signals related to convergent extension movements, planar cell polarity, and proliferation (19.Laird D.J.

Ror2 engagement of Wnt5a has been shown to inhibit canonical signaling. However, recent work utilizing primary cell lines showed this effect to be Ror2-independent (18.Mikels A.J. Nusse R.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 4044-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The ability of Ror2 to convey situation-appropriate signals likely involves the availability of cofactors, binding partners, or downstream substrates to affect the signal and functional outcome and may contribute to cell type- or situation-specific effects. Although we have shown previously that Ror2 expression is associated with cellular migration and invasion phenotypes in renal carcinoma cells, growth of RCC is also facilitated by β-catenin transcription-mediated canonical signals (22.Choi H. Chun Y.S. Kim T.Y. Park J.W. HIF-2α enhances β-catenin/TCF-driven transcription by interacting with β-catenin.Cancer -Res. 2010; 70: 10101-10111Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mediators of this signal are thought to be dependent on the lost expression of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (23.Chitalia V.C. Foy R.L. Bachschmid M.M. Zeng L. Panchenko M.V. Zhou M.I. Bharti A. Seldin D.C. Lecker S.H. Dominguez I. Cohen H.T. Jade-1 inhibits Wnt signalling by ubiquitylating β-catenin and mediates Wnt pathway inhibition by pVHL.Nat.

Therefore, we decided to explore the signaling pathways related to Ror2 expression in renal carcinoma- and renal-derived cellular systems. Here, we demonstrate that human RCC tumors and cell lines show concordance of Ror2 expression with a large number of established canonical Wnt pathway targets, suggestive of a role of Ror2 in mediating β-catenin-dependent signaling. Expression of Ror2 increased the stabilization of β-catenin as well as the transcriptional activity of canonical Wnt target genes, independently of exogenously added Wnt3a, and led to the enhancement of the canonical signal when exogenous Wnt3a was supplied. Inhibition of the canonical coreceptor LRP6 reduced the responsiveness to Wnt3a. However, it did not ablate the Wnt3a-independent increase in β-catenin. Mutations in the kinase domain of Ror2 abrogated the stabilization of β-catenin and Axin2 transcription observed with expression of wild-type protein. These findings demonstrate a novel LRP-independent function of Ror2 to maintain an increased signaling pool of stable β-catenin in renal cells while priming cells for additional responsiveness to Wnt3a activation of the β-catenin transcriptional pathway. 786-0 and the derivative cell lines 786-0 RC3 (25.Iliopoulos O.

L cells and Wnt3a-producing L cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. Control and Wnt3a-conditioned medium (CM) was collected at 24 and 48 h after cells reached confluency. 786-0 cells were transfected with TAP-hRor2 and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin to generate polyclonal stable lines. HEK293T and 786-0 cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying the eGFP control, TRE(tight)-eGFP-pEF1a-rtTA-IRES-Puro or hRor2-eGFP, TRE(tight)-hRor2eGFP-pEF1a-rtTA-IRES-Puro, with stable lines generated following selection with 1 μg/ml puromycin. The TAP-hRor2 was generated with hRor2 cloned into the pIRESpuro-GLUE backbone (26.Angers S. Thorpe C.J. Biechele T.L. Goldenberg S.J. Zheng N. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T.

The control TRE(tight)-eGFP-pEF1a-rtTA-IRES-Puro and TRE-tight-hRor2-eGFP-eF1a-rtTA-IRES-Puro vectors were generated with eGFP alone or the fusion hRor2-eGFP being cloned into a PHAGE6 lentiviral backbone (27.O'Connell R.M.

Expression of eGFP or hRor2-eGFP was confirmed visually 48 h after induction with doxycycline (500 ng/ml). Site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla CA) was used to introduce the amino acid substitutions K507M and D633A for hRor2-eGFP-DM. Stealth siRNA for LRP6 (5′-ACGCAGCAUUGAGCGUGCCAACAAA-3′ and 5′-GAUCCCAUGGUUGGGUACAUGU AUU-3′) were pooled, and Stealth negative control siRNA (Stealth RNAi negative control low GC duplex) was introduced into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and allowed to incubate for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Valencia, CA). cDNA was made from 500 ng of total RNA using random primers (Invitrogen) and Superscript II RT-PCR reagents (Invitrogen) and analyzed using the ABI 7900HT fast real-time PCR system with the following proprietary FAM-labeled primers: Ror2, Axin2, Fzd1, Jun, 18S, and β-actin (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Wnt-related gene expression was examined with the human Wnt signaling RT2 Profiler PCR array (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) using cDNA from 786-0 +TAP-hRor2, 786-0, and 786-0 shRor2.2 cells with the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system. Changes in gene expression were calculated following normalization to an internal pool of five housekeeping genes. Axin2 was not available in the RT2 Profiler PCR array. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis IN) and quantitated using Bradford reagent to measure absorbance at 595 nm. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Pittsburg, PA), and evaluated using the following antibodies: Ror2 (catalog no. AF2064, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); DVL2 (catalog no. 3216), DVL3 (catalog no. 3218), LRP6 (catalog no. 3395), and pLRP6 (catalog no. 2568, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); Ku80 used as loading control (catalog no. ab1273, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); and β-catenin (catalog no. C2206, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For all immunoblot analyses, following incubation with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to IR dye 680 or 800, membranes were scanned using the Odyssey IR imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) with densitometric analysis performed using Odyssey v3.0.21. Cells were incubated for 1 h with control-conditioned medium, Wnt3a-conditioned medium (1:2 dilution), or DKK1 (400 ng/ml, R&D Systems). 50 μg of protein lysates from each sample as determined by Bradford assay were rotated with 10 μl of prepared concanavalin A-Sepharose 4b beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed following a brief centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To determine the activity of canonical Wnt signaling in the RCC cells, 786-0 and HEK293T cells were transfected with TOPFlash and constitutive pHRG-Renilla luciferase reporters. 24 h post-transfection, cells were seeded in triplicate, with medium being replaced after 8 h with serum-free medium and incubated for 20 h. Post-serum starvation, cells were treated with control PBS or recombinant human Wnt3a (100 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and incubated for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured from lysed samples using a luminometer and the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Relative luciferase units were calculated by the ratio of TOPFlash luciferase activity to internal Renilla luciferase activity for each sample. Gene expression for 95 human RCC tumors was downloaded and prepared as described previously (28.Teng B.L. Hacker K.E. Chen S. Means A.R. Rathmell W.K. Tumor suppressive activity of prolyl isomerase Pin1 in renal cell carcinoma.Mol. Oncol. 2011; 5: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Collection and analysis of these tumors was approved by the institutional biomedical ethics review committee. Significance of analysis of microarrays was used to determine genes that significantly correlated with Ror2 expression among the 95 human RCC tumors with a false discovery rate < 0.043% and analyzed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to identify significantly enriched gene ontologies. One-way ANOVA was used to generate p values in the comparison of each experimental condition with the control. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant and < 0.001 to be highly significant. All error bars shown are the calculated S.D. or S.E. across duplicate or triplicate experiments. We established previously that Ror2 is expressed in RCC and contributes to three-dimensional growth, migration, and in vivo tumor growth (4.Wright T.M. Brannon A.R. Gordan J.D. Mikels A.J.

Ror2, a developmentally regulated kinase, promotes tumor growth potential in renal cell carcinoma.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the role of Ror2 as a Wnt receptor in RCC remains largely unknown. Ror2 has been shown to engage both canonical and non-canonical Wnt ligands (16.Li C. Chen H. Hu L. Xing Y. Sasaki T. Villosis M.F. Li J. Nishita M. Minami Y. Minoo P. Ror2 modulates the canonical Wnt signaling in lung epithelial cells through cooperation with Fzd2.BMC Mol.

Purified Wnt5a protein activates or inhibits β-catenin-TCF signaling depending on receptor context.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). We first sought to elucidate the dominant pattern of interaction of Ror2 with signaling networks through examination of gene expression patterns from 95 human clear cell RCC tumors. An analysis of transcript diversity was performed using Agilent microarray data using significance of microarrays. This evaluation yielded 723 genes (supplemental Table 1) that exhibited a significant correlation or anticorrelation with Ror2 (false discovery rate < 0.043%). A heat map of these genes following an unsupervised clustering exhibited two cluster patterns correlating with the level of Ror2 transcript in these tumors (Fig. 1A). A variety of significantly enriched gene ontologies (supplemental Table 2) were identified, using DAVID, from the genes exhibiting a positive correlation with Ror2. Similar to previous results (4.Wright T.M. Brannon A.R. Gordan J.D. Mikels A.J. Mitchell C. Chen S. Espinosa I. van de Rijn M. Pruthi R. Wallen E. Edwards L. Nusse R. Rathmell W.K. Ror2, a developmentally regulated kinase, promotes tumor growth potential in renal cell carcinoma.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), Ror2 expression correlated with many genes playing a role in skeletal system development (GO (Gene Ontology database): 0001501, p = 6.11 × 10−08) (Fig. 1B). In addition, enrichment for genes in the Wnt receptor canonical signaling pathway (GO:0016055, p = 2.6 × 10−4) was also observed (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the role of Ror2 as a Wnt receptor in RCC tumors may not be limited to non-canonical Wnt pathways. Building on our findings in our human RCC tumors, we examined the effects of Ror2 expression on gene expression using the human Wnt signaling RT2 Profiler PCR array (SABiosciences). The RCC-derived cell line 786-0, which exhibits endogenous Ror2 expression, a derived shRNA Ror2 knockdown cell line, 786-0 shRor2, and an overexpression cell line, 786-0 TAP-hRor2, were used to determine alterations in gene expression under basal conditions (Fig. 2A). We observed a large number of canonical genes displaying concordant expression with Ror2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting a potential association between Ror2 expression and the activity of canonical β-catenin transcriptional activity independent of Wnt3a stimulation with exogenous ligand. This concordant expression pattern with Ror2 was verified independently for targets Fzd1 and Jun using independent samples and primer pairs (Fig. 2, C and D). To more fully determine whether the aberrant expression of Ror2 in RCC cells contributes to β-catenin-dependent signaling, we used 786-0 cells, which endogenously express Ror2. To directly examine canonical Wnt target gene activation in these cells, we first examined the mRNA expression of a classic canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, using quantitative RT-PCR. Using two independent shRNAs targeting unique domains of Ror2, we observed a significant suppression of Ror2 (Fig. 3A) and of Axin2 transcription following treatment with Wnt3a (B) in comparison with the control empty vector (786-0 RC3), which also exhibited an increase in Ror2 expression with Wnt3a stimulation. These results were corroborated using the TOPFlash luciferase-reporter, where a 786-0 pRS (pRetroSuper) control showed a significant induction of signal in response to Wnt3a, but no induction was observed with shRor2 knockdown cell lines (Fig. 3C). Prior studies expressing Ror2 in HEK293 cells have focused on concomitant treatment of Wnt3a and Wnt5a but have not elaborated how Ror2 expression may also potentiate Wnt3a canonical signaling or examine the potential for differential signaling (18.Mikels A.J. Nusse R. Purified Wnt5a protein activates or inhibits β-catenin-TCF signaling depending on receptor context.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 29.Mikels A.

Chem. 2009; 284: 30167-30176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To further examine Ror2 contributions as a mediator of canonical β-catenin signaling in RCC, we utilized 786-0 and HEK293T cells expressing either a tetracycline-dependent fusion protein, Ror2-GFP, or a GFP control. Robust expression of Ror2 mRNA was observed in 786-0 Ror2-overexpressing cells, relative to control GFP cells, following the addition of doxycycline and remained unaltered by treatment with Wnt3a (Fig. 4A). Upon expression of Ror2, there was a significant increase in basal Axin2 mRNA as well as a heightened response to Wnt3a treatment (Fig. 4B). This enhancement of β-catenin-mediated transcription in the absence of Wnt3a with expression of Ror2 and further potentiation was also observed in 786-0 cells transfected with a TOPFlash luciferase reporter (Fig. 4D). To validate these findings in an additional renal-derived cell background, we used HEK293T cells expressing either GFP or Ror2. Upon the induction of Ror2 in HEK293T cells, we again observed a significant enhancement of Axin2 transcription and a further increase following stimulation with Wnt3a (Fig. 4F). Likewise, β-catenin mediated transcription measured using the TOPFlash luciferase reporter showed an enhanced response to Wnt3a stimulation, although no significant change was detected under basal conditions (Fig. 4H). Inhibition of GSK3-β with LiCl resulted in an additive effect of Axin2 transcription with Ror2 expression, suggesting that Ror2 effects are mediated through β-catenin (Fig. 4, C and G). Both TCF-luciferase reporters and target gene expression of Axin2 demonstrated that Ror2 expression is associated with heightened β-catenin target gene transcription in response to Wnt3a stimulation. In addition, expression of Ror2 resulted in an enhanced transcriptional activity in the absence of exogenous ligand. Therefore, we sought to determine whether these findings also correlated with the availability of β-catenin for transcriptional activation. To examine the pool of cytosolic β-catenin available for signaling, protein lysates were incubated with concanavalin-A-Sepharose beads. Immunoblot analysis of 786-0 cell lysates revealed an increase of free β-catenin levels (indicated with an asterisk, compared with total levels) upon expression of Ror2, with a further increase following stimulation with Wnt3a CM (Fig. 5A). These results were corroborated in HEK293T cells, demonstrating increased stabilized β-catenin upon Ror2 expression that is enhanced with the addition of Wnt3a CM in comparison to GFP expressing cells (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2060481216,"The small G protein Ras regulates proliferation through activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK) cascade. The first step of Ras-dependent activation of ERK signaling is Ras binding to members of the Raf family of MAP kinase kinase kinases, C-Raf and B-Raf. Recently, it has been reported that in melanoma cells harboring oncogenic Ras mutations, B-Raf does not bind to Ras and does not contribute to basal ERK activation. For other types of Ras-mutant tumors, the relative contributions of C-Raf and B-Raf are not known. We examined non-melanoma cancer cell lines containing oncogenic Ras mutations and express both C-Raf and B-Raf isoforms, including the lung cancer cell line H1299 cells. Both B-Raf and C-Raf were constitutively bound to oncogenic Ras and contributed to Ras-dependent ERK activation. Ras binding to B-Raf and C-Raf were both subject to inhibition by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA. cAMP inhibited the growth of H1299 cells and Ras-dependent ERK activation via PKA. PKA inhibited the binding of Ras to both C-Raf and B-Raf through phosphorylations of C-Raf at Ser-259 and B-Raf at Ser-365, respectively. These studies demonstrate that in non-melanocytic Ras-mutant cancer cells, Ras signaling to B-Raf is a significant contributor to ERK activation and that the B-Raf pathway, like that of C-Raf, is a target for inhibition by PKA. We suggest that cAMP and hormones coupled to cAMP may prove useful in dampening the effects of oncogenic Ras in non-melanocytic cancer cells through PKA-dependent actions on B-Raf as well as C-Raf.Background: How the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA regulates B-Raf binding to Ras is not known.Results: PKA inhibits the binding of B-Raf to active Ras via phosphorylation of serine 365 in B-Raf.Conclusion: B-Raf can participate in the Ras-dependent activation of ERK in Ras-mutant cancers, and this is inhibited by PKA.Significance: PKA can block Ras binding to both Raf isoforms C-Raf and B-Raf. The small G protein Ras regulates proliferation through activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK) cascade. The first step of Ras-dependent activation of ERK signaling is Ras binding to members of the Raf family of MAP kinase kinase kinases, C-Raf and B-Raf. Recently, it has been reported that in melanoma cells harboring oncogenic Ras mutations, B-Raf does not bind to Ras and does not contribute to basal ERK activation. For other types of Ras-mutant tumors, the relative contributions of C-Raf and B-Raf are not known. We examined non-melanoma cancer cell lines containing oncogenic Ras mutations and express both C-Raf and B-Raf isoforms, including the lung cancer cell line H1299 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2089412322,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease; the histological spectrum of which ranges from steatosis to steatohepatitis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) often leads to cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. To better understand pathogenesis of NAFLD, we performed the pathway of distinction analysis (PoDA) on a genome-wide association study dataset of 250 non-Hispanic white female adult patients with NAFLD, who were enrolled in the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) Database Study, to investigate whether biologic process variation measured through genomic variation of genes within these pathways was related to the development of steatohepatitis or cirrhosis. Pathways such as Recycling of eIF2:GDP, biosynthesis of steroids, Terpenoid biosynthesis and Cholesterol biosynthesis were found to be significantly associated with NASH. SNP variants in Terpenoid synthesis, Cholesterol biosynthesis and biosynthesis of steroids were associated with lobular inflammation and cytologic ballooning while those in Terpenoid synthesis were also associated with fibrosis and cirrhosis. These were also related to the NAFLD activity score (NAS) which is derived from the histological severity of steatosis, inflammation and ballooning degeneration. Eukaryotic protein translation and recycling of eIF2:GDP related SNP variants were associated with ballooning, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Il2 signaling events mediated by PI3K, Mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition, and Prostanoid ligand receptors were also significantly associated with cirrhosis. Taken together, the results provide evidence for additional ways, beyond the effects of single SNPs, by which genetic factors might contribute to the susceptibility to develop a particular phenotype of NAFLD and then progress to cirrhosis. Further studies are warranted to explain potential important genetic roles of these biological processes in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W1986648958,"Background Risk perception is a reported predictor of vaccination uptake, but which measures of risk perception best predict influenza vaccination uptake remain unclear. Methodology During the main influenza seasons (between January and March) of 2009 (Wave 1) and 2010 (Wave 2),505 Chinese students and employees from a Hong Kong university completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to assess how well different risk perceptions measures in Wave 1 predicted vaccination uptake against seasonal influenza in Wave 2. Principal Findings The results of the multivariate logistic regression models showed that feeling at risk (β = 0.25, p = 0.021) was the better predictor compared with probability judgment while probability judgment (β = 0.25, p = 0.029 ) was better than beliefs about risk in predicting subsequent influenza vaccination uptake. Beliefs about risk and feeling at risk seemed to predict the same aspect of subsequent vaccination uptake because their associations with vaccination uptake became insignificant when paired into the logistic regression model. Similarly, to compare the four scales for assessing probability judgment in predicting vaccination uptake, the 7-point verbal scale remained a significant and stronger predictor for vaccination uptake when paired with other three scales; the 6-point verbal scale was a significant and stronger predictor when paired with the percentage scale or the 2-point verbal scale; and the percentage scale was a significant and stronger predictor only when paired with the 2-point verbal scale. Conclusions/Significance Beliefs about risk and feeling at risk are not well differentiated by Hong Kong Chinese people. Feeling at risk, an affective-cognitive dimension of risk perception predicts subsequent vaccination uptake better than do probability judgments. Among the four scales for assessing risk probability judgment, the 7-point verbal scale offered the best predictive power for subsequent vaccination uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2074193097,"Histamine H(3) receptor (Hrh3/H(3)R) is primarily expressed by neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) where it functions as a presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor and heteroreceptor. Previously, we identified an H(3)R-mediated central component in susceptibility to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis (MS), related to neurogenic control of blood brain barrier permeability and peripheral T cell effector responses. Furthermore, we identified Hrh3 as a positional candidate for the EAE susceptibility locus Eae8. Here, we characterize Hrh3 polymorphisms between EAE-susceptible and resistant SJL and B10.S mice, respectively, and show that Hrh3 isoform expression in the CNS is differentially regulated by acute peripheral inflammatory stimuli in an allele-specific fashion. Next, we show that Hrh3 is not expressed in any subpopulations of the immune compartment, and that secondary lymphoid tissue is anatomically poised to be regulated by central H(3)R signaling. Accordingly, using transcriptome analysis, we show that, inflammatory stimuli elicit unique transcriptional profiles in the lymph nodes of H(3)RKO mice compared to WT mice, which is indicative of negative regulation of peripheral immune responses by central H(3)R signaling. These results further support a functional link between the neurogenic control of T cell responses and susceptibility to CNS autoimmune disease coincident with acute and/or chronic peripheral inflammation. Pharmacological targeting of H(3)R may therefore be useful in preventing the development and formation of new lesions in MS, thereby limiting disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2047973688,"The α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely expressed in the brain and are implicated in a variety of physiological processes. There are two stoichiometries of the α4β2 nAChR, (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2, with different sensitivities to acetylcholine (ACh), but their pharmacological profiles are not fully understood. Methyllycaconitine (MLA) is known to be an antagonist of nAChRs. Using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique and α4β2 nAChRs in the Xenopus oocyte expression system, we demonstrate that inhibition by MLA occurs via two different mechanisms; that is, a direct competitive antagonism and an apparently insurmountable mechanism that only occurs after preincubation with MLA. We hypothesized an additional MLA binding site in the α4-α4 interface that is unique to this stoichiometry. To prove this, we covalently trapped a cysteine-reactive MLA analog at an α4β2 receptor containing an α4(D204C) mutation predicted by homology modeling to be within reach of the reactive probe. We demonstrate that covalent trapping results in irreversible reduction of ACh-elicited currents in the (α4)3(β2)2 stoichiometry, indicating that MLA binds to the α4-α4 interface of the (α4)3(β2)2 and providing direct evidence of ligand binding to the α4-α4 interface.

https://openalex.org/W1993781306,"PfbA (plasmin- and fibronectin-binding protein A) is an extracellular Streptococcus pneumoniae cell-wall attached surface protein that binds to fibronectin, plasmin, and plasminogen. Here we present a structural analysis of the surface exposed domains of PfbA using a combined approach of X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The crystal structure of the PfbA core domain, here called PfbAβ, determined to 2.28 Å resolution revealed an elongated 12-stranded parallel β-helix fold, which structure-based comparisons reveal is most similar to proteins with carbohydrate modifying activity. A notable feature of the PfbAβ is an extensive cleft on one face of the protein with electrochemical and spatial features that are analogous to structurally similar carbohydrate-active enzymes utilizing this feature for substrate accommodation. Though this cleft displays a combination of basic amino acid residues and solvent exposed aromatic amino acids that are distinct features for recognition of carbohydrates, no obvious arrangement of amino acid side chains that would constitute catalytic machinery is evident. The pseudo-atomic SAXS model of a larger fragment of PfbA suggests that it has a relatively well-ordered structure with the N-terminal and core domains of PfbA adopting an extend organization and reveals a novel structural class of surface exposed pneumococcal matrix molecule adhesins."
https://openalex.org/W2124796024,"The ""stator stalk"" of F1Fo-ATP synthase is essential for rotational catalysis as it connects the nonrotating portions of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli, the stator stalk consists of two (identical) b subunits and the δ subunit. In mycobacteria, one of the b subunits and the δ subunit are replaced by a b/δ fusion protein; the remaining b subunit is of the shorter b' type. In the present study, it is shown that it is possible to generate a functional E. coli ATP synthase containing a b/δ fusion protein. This construct allowed the analysis of the roles of the individual b subunits. The full-length b subunit (which in this case is covalently linked to δ in the fusion protein) is responsible for connecting the stalk to the catalytic F1 subcomplex. It is not required for interaction with the membrane-embedded Fo subcomplex, as its transmembrane helix can be removed. Attachment to Fo is the function of the other b subunit which in turn has only a minor (if any at all) role in binding to δ. Also in E. coli the second b subunit can be shortened to a b' type."
https://openalex.org/W2056522688,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by brain accumulation of the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and by loss of cholinergic neurons and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Recent evidence indicates that memory loss and cognitive decline in AD correlate better with the amount of soluble Aβ than with the extent of amyloid plaque deposits in affected brains. Inhibition of nAChRs by soluble Aβ40 is suggested to contribute to early cholinergic dysfunction in AD. Using phage display screening, we have previously identified a heptapeptide, termed IQ, homologous to most nAChR subtypes, binding with nanomolar affinity to soluble Aβ40 and blocking Aβ-induced inhibition of carbamylcholine-induced currents in PC12 cells expressing α7 nAChRs. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis and whole-cell current recording, we have now defined the amino acids in IQ essential for reversal of Aβ40 inhibition of carbamylcholine-induced responses in PC12 cells, mediated by α7 subtypes and other endogenously expressed nAChRs. We further investigated the effects of soluble Aβ, IQ and analogues of IQ on α3β4 nAChRs recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells. Results show that nanomolar concentrations of soluble Aβ40 potently inhibit the function of α3β4 nAChRs, and that subsequent addition of IQ or its analogues does not reverse this effect. However, co-application of IQ makes the inhibition of α3β4 nAChRs by Aβ40 reversible. These findings indicate that Aβ40 inhibits different subtypes of nAChRs by interacting with specific receptor domains homologous to the IQ peptide, suggesting that IQ may be a lead for novel drugs to block the inhibition of cholinergic function in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2027086191,"Knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to reproductive isolation is essential for understanding population structure and speciation. While several models have been advanced to explain post-mating reproductive isolation, experimental data supporting most are indirect. Laboratory investigations of this phenomenon are typically carried out under benign conditions, which result in low rates of genetic change unlikely to initiate reproductive isolation. Previously, we described an experimental system using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where starvation served as a proxy to any stress that decreases reproduction and/or survivorship. We showed that novel lineages with restructured genomes quickly emerged in starved populations, and that these survivors were more fit than their ancestors when re-starved. Here we show that certain yeast lineages that survive starvation have become reproductively isolated from their ancestor. We further demonstrate that reproductive isolation arises from genomic rearrangements, whose frequency in starving yeast is several orders of magnitude greater than an unstarved control. By contrast, the frequency of point mutations is less than 2-fold greater. In a particular case, we observe that a starved lineage becomes reproductively isolated as a direct result of the stress-related accumulation of a single chromosome. We recapitulate this result by demonstrating that introducing an extra copy of one or several chromosomes into naïve, i.e. unstarved, yeast significantly diminishes their fertility. This type of reproductive barrier, whether arising spontaneously or via genetic manipulation, can be removed by making a lineage euploid for the altered chromosomes. Our model provides direct genetic evidence that reproductive isolation can arise frequently in stressed populations via genome restructuring without the precondition of geographic isolation."
