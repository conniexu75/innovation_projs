https://openalex.org/W3136138984,"Assessing and selecting the most viable embryos for transfer is an essential part of in vitro fertilization (IVF). In recent years, several approaches have been made to improve and automate the procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. Based on images of embryos with known implantation data (KID), AI models have been trained to automatically score embryos related to their chance of achieving a successful implantation. However, as of now, only limited research has been conducted to evaluate how embryo selection models generalize to new clinics and how they perform in subgroup analyses across various conditions. In this paper, we investigate how a deep learning-based embryo selection model using only time-lapse image sequences performs across different patient ages and clinical conditions, and how it correlates with traditional morphokinetic parameters. The model was trained and evaluated based on a large dataset from 18 IVF centers consisting of 115,832 embryos, of which 14,644 embryos were transferred KID embryos. In an independent test set, the AI model sorted KID embryos with an area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.67 and all embryos with an AUC of 0.95. A clinic hold-out test showed that the model generalized to new clinics with an AUC range of 0.60-0.75 for KID embryos. Across different subgroups of age, insemination method, incubation time, and transfer protocol, the AUC ranged between 0.63 and 0.69. Furthermore, model predictions correlated positively with blastocyst grading and negatively with direct cleavages. The fully automated iDAScore v1.0 model was shown to perform at least as good as a state-of-the-art manual embryo selection model. Moreover, full automatization of embryo scoring implies fewer manual evaluations and eliminates biases due to inter- and intraobserver variation."

Little is known, however, about the impacts of the pandemic on displaced populations, and how those impacts differ by gender and life stage. We investigate the extent to which the pandemic has compounded pre-existing social inequalities among adolescents in Jordan, and the role support structures play in promoting resilience.Our analysis leverages longitudinal quantitative survey data and in-depth qualitative interviews, collected before and after the onset of COVID-19, with over 3,000 Syrian refugees, stateless Palestinians and vulnerable Jordanians, living in camps, host communities and informal tented settlements. We utilize mixed-methods analysis combining multivariate regression with deductive qualitative tools to evaluate pandemic impacts and associated policy responses on adolescent wellbeing and mental health, at three and nine months after the pandemic onset. We also explore the role of support systems at individual, household, community, and policy levels.We find the pandemic has resulted in severe economic and service disruptions with far-reaching and heterogenous effects on adolescent wellbeing. Nine months into the pandemic, 19.3% of adolescents in the sample presented with symptoms of moderate-to severe depression, with small signs of improvement (3.2 percentage points [pp], p<0.001). Two thirds of adolescents reported household stress had increased during the pandemic, especially for Syrian adolescents in host communities (10.7pp higher than any other group, p<0.001). Social connectedness was particularly low for girls, who were 13.4 percentage points (p<0.001) more likely than boys to have had no interaction with friends in the past 7 days. Adolescent programming shows signs of being protective, particularly for girls, who were 8.8 percentage points (p<0.01) more likely to have a trusted friend than their peers who were not participating in programming.Pre-existing social inequalities among refugee adolescents affected by forced displacement have been compounded during the COVID-19 pandemic, with related disruptions to services and social networks. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets to support healthy and empowered development in adolescence and early adulthood requires interventions that target the urgent needs of the most vulnerable adolescents while addressing population-level root causes and determinants of psychosocial wellbeing and resilience for all adolescent girls and boys."

The present study aims to explore the impact and the importance of Education 4.0 for improving English language learning in the perception of students in India, especially Hyderabad City. Moreover, Education 4.0 has bloomed as an important need to move along with the fast-growing education system of the world. But, it is a fact that many Indian students have complications and difficulties in learning English due to many reasons. The traditional methods of teaching are one of those reasons. Students learn only through the conventional methods, and they may find it boring and not effective. The education and mode of teaching have changed a lot, and it has attained a newer form of using the technology. Moreover, in the current era, where work from home and online teaching has become a new normal throughout the world, the technology used for teaching is inseparable. Hence, the authors are motivated to study the impact of Education 4.0 on improving English learning from Hyderabad, India. The methodology of the study has applied quantitative research. The study has employed pre-tested, close-ended questionnaires and post-assessment to gather data from the respondents to understand students' performance in English language learning after implying Education 4.0. The five-point Likert scale has been used to analyse the collected data and to get mean values of responses. The total number of respondents is 145 students who pursue their engineering degrees in the select region. Among the collected data, most of them were from urban. The data obtained from the respondents proved that there is a direct correlation between the students' perception and implementation of Education 4.0 in learning the English language. This study indicated that the respondents upheld Education 4.0 to improve English language learning in Hyderabad, India."
https://openalex.org/W4225892561,"The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in postmenopausal women has increased significantly. Estrogen plays a very important role in NAFLD, but whether NAFLD in premenopausal women was caused by estrogen deficiency was unknown. Thus, it is of great clinical significance to explore the mechanism of NAFLD in premenopausal women. Gut microbiota and its metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFA) have been shown to play important roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the impact of gut microbiota and SCFA in NAFLD patients and mice caused by estrogen deficiency. We showed that premenopause NAFLD patients had much lower estrogen levels. Estrogen deficient mice, due to ovariectomy (OVX), suffered more severe liver steatosis with an elevated body weight, abdominal fat weight, serum triglycerides and deterioration in hepatic steatosis. Altered gut microbiota composition and decreased butyrate content were found in NAFLD patients and in OVX mice. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or supplementing with butyrate alleviated NAFLD in OVX mice. The production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) Reg3ɣ, β-defensins and the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction, including ZO-1 and Occluding-5, were decreased in the OVX mice compared to control mice. Upregulation of PPAR-ɣ and VLDLR, downregulation of PPAR-ɑ indicated that OVX mice suffered from abnormal lipid metabolism. These data indicate that changes in the gut microbiota and SCFA caused by estrogen reduction, together with a disorder in AMP production and lipid metabolism, promote NAFLD, thus provide SCFAs derived from microbiota as new therapeutic targets for the clinical prevention and treatment of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4210259172,"To undertake a reliable analysis of injury severity in road traffic accidents, a complete understanding of important attributes is essential. As a result of the shift from traditional statistical parametric procedures to computer-aided methods, machine learning approaches have become an important aspect in predicting the severity of road traffic injuries. The paper presents a hybrid feature selection-based machine learning classification approach for detecting significant attributes and predicting injury severity in single and multiple-vehicle accidents. To begin, we employed a Random Forests (RF) classifier in conjunction with an intrinsic wrapper-based feature selection approach called the Boruta Algorithm (BA) to find the relevant important attributes that determine injury severity. The influential attributes were then fed into a set of four classifiers to accurately predict injury severity (Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Binary Logistic Regression (BLR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)). According to BA's experimental investigation, the vehicle type was the most influential factor, followed by the month of the year, the driver's age, and the alignment of the road segment. The driver's gender, the presence of a median, and the presence of a shoulder were all found to be unimportant. According to classifier performance measures, XGBoost surpasses the other classifiers in terms of prediction performance. Using the specified attributes, the accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, F1-Measure, and AUC-ROC values of the XGBoost were 82.10%, 0.607, 0.776, and 0.880 for single vehicle accidents and 79.52%, 0.569, 0.752, and 0.86 for multiple-vehicle accidents, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4210314894,"Discussions about science and engineering postdoctoral researchers focus almost exclusively on academic postdocs and their chances of eventually securing tenure-track faculty positions. Further, biological sciences dominate policy research and published advice for new PhDs regarding postdoctoral employment. Our analysis uses the Survey of Earned Doctorates and Survey of Doctorate Recipients to understand employment implications for physical sciences and engineering (PSE) and life sciences (LS) graduates who took postdoctoral positions in government, industry, and academic sectors. We examine postdoc duration, reasons for staying in a postdoc, movement between sectors, and salary implications. There is considerable movement between employment sectors within the first six years post-PhD. Additionally, postdocs in PSE are shorter, better paid, and more often in nonacademic sectors than postdocs in LS. These results can help science and engineering faculty discuss a broader range of career pathways with doctoral students and help new PhDs make better informed early career decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4225724531,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a disease involving damage to the kidney structure and function, is a global public health problem. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) is both an inevitable pathological change in individuals with CKD and a driving force in the progression of renal fibrosis. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) and its metabolite 1-methylnicotinamide (MNAM) have been shown to protect against lipotoxicity-induced kidney tubular injury. However, the biological roles of NNMT and MNAM in regulating TIF remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of NNMT and MNAM on TIF and the mechanisms involved. We explored the functions and mechanisms of NNMT and MNAM in TIF, as well as the interaction between NNMT and MNAM, using unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice and cultured mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs) stimulated with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Several important findings were obtained as follows: (1) NNMT expression was upregulated in the kidneys of UUO mice and TGF-β1-induced mTECs, and this upregulation was proposed to be a protective compensatory response to TIF. (2) MNAM was a potentially effective antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory medication in UUO mice. (3) The antifibrotic effect of NNMT overexpression was exerted by increasing the concentration of MNAM. (4) The renoprotective role of MNAM depended on the selective blockade of the interaction of Smad3 with TGFβ receptor I. Overall, our study shows that NNMT is involved in the development and progression of CKD and that its metabolite MNAM may be a novel inhibitor of the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway with great therapeutic potential for CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4210339773,"The Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is an intensely pleasant tingling sensation originating in the scalp and neck and is elicited by a range of online video-induced triggers. Many individuals now regularly watch ASMR videos to relax, and alleviate symptoms of stress and insomnia, all which are indicative of elevated levels of anxiety. Emerging literature suggests that ASMR-capable individuals are characterised by high trait neuroticism, which is associated with a tendency to experience negative emotional states such as anxiety. To date however no literature has empirically linked these personality constructs and watching ASMR videos on the effect of reducing anxiety. In the current study, 36 ASMR-experiencers and 28 non-experiencers watched an ASMR video, and completed assessments of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and pre- / post-video state anxiety. MANCOVA with Group as the independent measures factor showed that ASMR-experiencers had significantly greater scores for neuroticism, trait anxiety, and video engagement than non-experiencers. Pre-video state anxiety was also significantly greater in the ASMR-experiencers and was significantly attenuated on exposure to the ASMR video, whereas non-experiencers reported no difference in state anxiety pre- and post-video. Thus, watching ASMR alleviated state anxiety but only in those who experienced ASMR. Subsequent mediation analyses identified the importance of pre-existing group differences in neuroticism, trait and (pre-video) state anxiety in accounting for the group difference in the reduction of state anxiety. The mediation analysis further lends support for watching ASMR videos as an intervention for the reduction of acute state anxiety. Future areas for research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4210389415,"Retrospective data demonstrates that robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery provides many benefits, such as decreased postoperative pain, lower mortality, shorter length of stay, shorter chest tube duration, and reductions in the incidence of common postoperative pulmonary complications, when compared to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Despite the potential benefits of robotic surgery, there are two major barriers against its widespread adoption in thoracic surgery: lack of high-quality prospective data, and the perceived higher cost of it. Therefore, in the face of these barriers, a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing robotic- to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is needed. The RAVAL trial is a two-phase, international, multi-centered, blinded, parallel, randomized controlled trial that is comparing robotic- to video-assisted lobectomy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer that has been enrolling patients since 2016.The RAVAL trial will be conducted in two phases: Phase A will enroll 186 early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients who are candidates for minimally invasive pulmonary lobectomy; while Phase B will continue to recruit until 592 patients are enrolled. After consent, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either robotic- or video-assisted lobectomy, and blinded to the type of surgery they are allocated to. Health-related quality of life questionnaires will be administered at baseline, postoperative day 1, weeks 3, 7, 12, months 6, 12, 18, 24, and years 3, 4, 5. The primary objective of the RAVAL trial is to determine the difference in patient-reported health-related quality of life outcomes between the robotic- and video-assisted lobectomy groups at 12 weeks. Secondary objectives include determining the differences in cost-effectiveness, and in the 5-year survival data between the two arms. The results of the primary objective will be reported once Phase A has completed accrual and the 12-month follow-ups are completed. The results of the secondary objectives will be reported once Phase B has completed accrual and the 5-year follow-ups are completed.If successfully completed, the RAVAL Trial will have studied patient-reported outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and survival of robotic- versus video-assisted lobectomy in a prospective, randomized, blinded fashion in an international setting.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02617186.

https://openalex.org/W4210602813,"Biolayer interferometry (BLI) is a widely utilized technique for determining macromolecular interaction dynamics in real time. Using changes in the interference pattern of white light reflected off a biosensor tip, BLI can determine binding parameters for protein-protein (e.g., antibody-substrate kinetics) or protein-small molecule (e.g., drug discovery) interactions. However, a less-appreciated application for BLI analysis is DNA-protein interactions. DNA-binding proteins play an immense role in cellular biology, controlling critical processes including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Understanding how proteins interact with DNA often provides important insight into their biological function, and novel technologies to assay DNA-protein interactions are of broad interest. Currently, a detailed protocol utilizing BLI for DNA-protein interactions is lacking. In the following protocol, we describe the use of BLI and biotinylated-DNA probes to determine the binding kinetics of a transcription factor to a specific DNA sequence. The experimental steps include the generation of biotinylated-DNA probes, the execution of the BLI experiment, and data analysis by scientific graphing and statistical software (e.g., GraphPad Prism). Although the example experiment used throughout this protocol involves a prokaryotic transcription factor, this technique can be easily translated to any DNA-binding protein. Pitfalls and potential solutions for investigating DNA-binding proteins by BLI are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W4210610285,"Organic fertilizers and especially microbial biomass, also known as microbial fertilizer, can enable a paradigm shift to the conventional fertilizer-to-food chain, particularly when produced on secondary resources. Microbial fertilizers are already common practice (e.g. Bloom® and Synagro); yet microbial fertilizer blends to align the nutrient release profile to the plant's needs are, thus far, unexplored. Moreover, most research only focuses on direct fertilization effects without considering added value properties, such as disease prevention. This study has explored three promising types of microbial fertilizers, namely dried biomass from a consortium of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, a microalga (Arthrospira platensis) and a purple non-sulfur bacterium (Rhodobacter sphaeroides). Mineralization and nitrification experiments showed that the nitrogen mineralization profile can be tuned to the plant's needs by blending microbial fertilizers, without having toxic ammonium peaks. In a pot trial with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), the performance of microbial fertilizers was similar to the reference organic fertilizer, with cumulative dry matter yields of 5.6-6.7 g per pot. This was confirmed in a pot trial with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), showing an average total plant length of 90-99 cm after a growing period of 62 days for the reference organic fertilizer and the microbial fertilizers. Moreover, tomato plants artificially infected with powdery mildew (Oidium neolycopersici), a devastating disease for the horticultural industry, showed reduced disease symptoms when A. platensis was present in the growing medium. These findings strengthen the application potential of this novel class of organic fertilizers in the bioeconomy, with a promising match between nutrient mineralization and plant requirements as well as added value in crop protection."
https://openalex.org/W4210247374,"We estimated excess mortality in Medicare recipients in the United States with probable and confirmed Covid-19 infections in the general community and amongst residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities. We considered 28,389,098 Medicare and dual-eligible recipients from one year before February 29, 2020 through September 30, 2020, with mortality followed through November 30 th , 2020. Probable and confirmed Covid-19 diagnoses, presumably mostly symptomatic, were determined from ICD-10 codes. We developed a Risk Stratification Index (RSI) mortality model which was applied prospectively to establish baseline mortality risk. Excess deaths attributable to Covid-19 were estimated by comparing actual-to-expected deaths based on historical (2017–2019) comparisons and in closely matched concurrent (2020) cohorts with and without Covid-19. Overall, 677,100 (2.4%) beneficiaries had confirmed Covid-19 and 2,917,604 (10.3%) had probable Covid-19. A total of 472,329 confirmed cases were community living and 204,771 were in LTC. Mortality following a probable or confirmed diagnosis in the community increased from an expected incidence of about 4.0% to actual incidence of 7.5%. In long-term care facilities, the corresponding increase was from 20.3% to 24.6%. The absolute increase was therefore similar at 3–4% in the community and in LTC residents. The percentage increase was far greater in the community (89.5%) than among patients in chronic care facilities (21.1%) who had higher baseline risk of mortality. The LTC population without probable or confirmed Covid-19 diagnoses experienced 38,932 excess deaths (34.8%) compared to historical estimates. Limitations in access to Covid-19 testing and disease under-reporting in LTC patients probably were important factors, although social isolation and disruption in usual care presumably also contributed. Remarkably, there were 31,360 (5.4%) fewer deaths than expected in community dwellers without probable or confirmed Covid-19 diagnoses. Disruptions to the healthcare system and avoided medical care were thus apparently offset by other factors, representing overall benefit. The Covid-19 pandemic had marked effects on mortality, but the effects were highly context-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W4210491002,"Pandemics, such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, represents a health threat to humans worldwide. During times of heightened health risks, the public's perceptions, and acceptance of evidence-based preventive measures, such as vaccines, is of high relevance. Moreover, people might seek other preventive remedies to protect themselves from getting infected (e.g., herbal remedies, nutritional supplements). A recent study on consumers' preference for naturalness showed that people put more weight on perceived naturalness of a preventive remedy compared to a curative one. This result was attributed to the increased focus on perceived effectiveness as opposed to perceived risk. This raises the question whether the current pandemic would shift people's perceptions from prevention to curing and thus, exhibit a preference for synthetic remedies because they are seen as more effective. The present online experiment (conducted in April 2021) investigated people's perceptions of vaccines and remedies within the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A 2x2 between-subject design with type of remedy (natural vs. synthetic) and salience of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (high vs. low) was conducted in Switzerland in spring 2021 (N = 452). The data did not provide evidence of a curative mindset for preventive remedies, as the participants exhibited a clear preference for the natural remedy compared to the synthetic remedy. Our study stresses the importance of understanding people's mindsets on how to protect themselves from infection with a virus during an ongoing pandemic to tackle misinformation and vaccine hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W4210567400,"With limited availability of vaccines, an efficient use of the limited supply of vaccines in order to achieve herd immunity will be an important tool to combat the wide-spread prevalence of COVID-19. Here, we compare a selection of strategies for vaccine distribution, including a novel targeted vaccination approach (EHR) that provides a noticeable increase in vaccine impact on disease spread compared to age-prioritized and random selection vaccination schemes. Using high-fidelity individual-based computer simulations with Oslo, Norway as an example, we find that for a community reproductive number in a setting where the base pre-vaccination reproduction number R = 2.1 without population immunity, the EHR method reaches herd immunity at 48% of the population vaccinated with 90% efficiency, whereas the common age-prioritized approach needs 89%, and a population-wide random selection approach requires 61%. We find that age-based strategies have a substantially weaker impact on epidemic spread and struggle to achieve herd immunity under the majority of conditions. Furthermore, the vaccination of minors is essential to achieving herd immunity, even for ideal vaccines providing 100% protection."
https://openalex.org/W4210633547,"The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcription factor with important roles in inflammation, immune response, and oncogenesis. Dysregulation of NF-κB signaling is associated with inflammation and certain cancers. We developed a gene expression biomarker predictive of NF-κB modulation and used the biomarker to screen a large compendia of gene expression data. The biomarker consists of 108 genes responsive to tumor necrosis factor α in the absence but not the presence of IκB, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Using a set of 450 profiles from cells treated with immunomodulatory factors with known NF-κB activity, the balanced accuracy for prediction of NF-κB activation was > 90%. The biomarker was used to screen a microarray compendium consisting of 12,061 microarray comparisons from human cells exposed to 2,672 individual chemicals to identify chemicals that could cause toxic effects through NF-κB. There were 215 and 49 chemicals that were identified as putative or known NF-κB activators or suppressors, respectively. NF-κB activators were also identified using two high-throughput screening assays; 165 out of the ~3,800 chemicals (ToxCast assay) and 55 out of ~7,500 unique compounds (Tox21 assay) were identified as potential activators. A set of 32 chemicals not previously associated with NF-κB activation and which partially overlapped between the different screens were selected for validation in wild-type and NFKB1-null HeLa cells. Using RT-qPCR and targeted RNA-Seq, 31 of the 32 chemicals were confirmed to be NF-κB activators. These results comprehensively identify a set of chemicals that could cause toxic effects through NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W4210791921,"Introduction The world is awash with claims about the effects of health interventions. Many of these claims are untrustworthy because the bases are unreliable. Acting on unreliable claims can lead to waste of resources and poor health outcomes. Yet, most people lack the necessary skills to appraise the reliability of health claims. The Informed Health Choices (IHC) project aims to equip young people in Ugandan lower secondary schools with skills to think critically about health claims and to make good health choices by developing and evaluating digital learning resources. To ensure that we create resources that are suitable for use in Uganda’s secondary schools and can be scaled up if found effective, we conducted a context analysis. We aimed to better understand opportunities and barriers related to demand for the resources, how the learning content overlaps with existing curriculum and conditions in secondary schools for accessing and using digital resources, in order to inform resource development. Methods We used a mixed methods approach and collected both qualitative and quantitative data. We conducted document analyses, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, school visits, and a telephone survey regarding information communication and technology (ICT). We used a nominal group technique to obtain consensus on the appropriate number and length of IHC lessons that should be planned in a school term. We developed and used a framework from the objectives to code the transcripts and generated summaries of query reports in Atlas.ti version 7. Findings Critical thinking is a key competency in the lower secondary school curriculum. However, the curriculum does not explicitly make provision to teach critical thinking about health, despite a need acknowledged by curriculum developers, teachers and students. Exam oriented teaching and a lack of learning resources are additional important barriers to teaching critical thinking about health. School closures and the subsequent introduction of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated teachers’ use of digital equipment and learning resources for teaching. Although the government is committed to improving access to ICT in schools and teachers are open to using ICT, access to digital equipment, unreliable power and internet connections remain important hinderances to use of digital learning resources. Conclusions There is a recognized need for learning resources to teach critical thinking about health in Ugandan lower secondary schools. Digital learning resources should be designed to be usable even in schools with limited access and equipment. Teacher training on use of ICT for teaching is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4220984019,"Introduction During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been suggestions that various techniques could be employed to improve the fit and, therefore, the effectiveness of face masks. It is well recognized that improving fit tends to improve mask effectiveness, but whether these fit modifiers are reliable remains unexplored. In this study, we assess a range of common “fit hacks” to determine their ability to improve mask performance. Methods Between July and September 2020, qualitative fit testing was performed in an indoor living space. We used quantitative fit testing to assess the fit of both surgical masks and KN95 masks, with and without ‘fit hacks’, on four participants. Seven fit hacks were evaluated to assess impact on fit. Additionally, one participant applied each fit hack multiple times to assess how reliable hacks were when reapplied. A convenience of four participants took part in the study, three females and one male with a head circumference range of 54 to 60 centimetres. Results and discussion The use of pantyhose, tape, and rubber bands were effective for most participants. A pantyhose overlayer was observed to be the most effective hack. High degrees of variation were noted between participants. However, little variation was noted within participants, with hacks generally showing similar benefit each time they were applied on a single participant. An inspection of the fit hacks once applied showed that individual facial features may have a significant impact on fit, especially the nose bridge. Conclusions Fit hacks can be used to effectively improve the fit of surgical and KN95 masks, enhancing the protection provided to the wearer. However, many of the most effective hacks are very uncomfortable and unlikely to be tolerated for extended periods of time. The development of effective fit-improvement solutions remains a critical issue in need of further development."
https://openalex.org/W4210394626,"The Wapiti Formation of northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia, Canada, preserves an Upper Cretaceous terrestrial vertebrate fauna that is latitudinally situated between those documented further north in Alaska and those from southern Alberta and the contiguous U.S.A. Therefore, the Wapiti Formation is important for identifying broad patterns in vertebrate ecology, diversity, and distribution across Laramidia during the latest Cretaceous. Tracksites are especially useful as they provide a range of palaeoecological, palaeoenvironmental, and behavioural data that are complementary to the skeletal record. Here, we describe the Tyrants Aisle locality, the largest in-situ tracksite known from the Wapiti Formation. The site occurs in the lower part of Unit 4 of the formation (~72.5 Ma, upper Campanian), exposed along the southern bank of the Redwillow River. More than 100 tracks are documented across at least three distinct track-bearing layers, which were deposited on an alluvial floodplain. Hadrosaurid tracks are most abundant, and are referable to Hadrosauropodus based on track width exceeding track length, broad digits, and rounded or bilobed heel margins. We suggest the hadrosaurid trackmaker was Edmontosaurus regalis based on stratigraphic context. Tyrannosaurids, probable troodontids, possible ornithomimids, and possible azhdarchid pterosaurs represent minor but notable elements of the ichnofauna, as the latter is unknown from skeletal remains within the Wapiti Formation, and all others are poorly represented. Possible social behaviour is inferred for some of the hadrosaurid and small theropod-like trackmakers based on trackway alignment, suitable spacing and consistent preservation. On a broad taxonomic level (i.e., family or above), ichnofaunal compositions indicate that hadrosaurids were palaeoecologically dominant across Laramidia during the late Campanian within both high-and low-latitude deposits, although the role of depositional environment requires further testing."
https://openalex.org/W4210600952,"Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis has been hypothesized to play a role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Increased calcium levels can impair axonal transport, disrupt synaptic transmission, and ultimately lead to cell death. Given the potential role of calcium dyshomeostasis in AD, there is interest in testing the ability of already approved drugs targeting various calcium channels to affect amyloid pathology and other aspects of disease. The objective of this study was to test the effects of FDA-approved L-type calcium channel antagonist nimodipine on amyloid accumulation and dystrophic neurite formation in 5XFAD mice, a mouse model of amyloid pathology. 5XFAD transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates were treated with vehicle or nimodipine-containing chow from two to eight months of age, then brains were harvested and amyloid pathology assessed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. Nimodipine was well tolerated and crossed the blood brain barrier, as expected, but there was no effect on Aβ accumulation or on the relative amount of neuritic dystrophy, as assessed by either immunoblot, dot blot or immunofluorescence imaging of Aβ42 and dystrophic neurite marker LAMP1. While we conclude that nimodipine treatment is not likely to improve amyloid pathology or decrease neuritic dystrophy in AD, it is worth noting that nimodipine did not worsen the phenotype suggesting its use is safe in AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4226424211,"Few studies explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of glycolytic proteins and downstream effectors in ovarian cancer cells. We recently showed that the functional activation of the cytoskeletal regulator FAK in endothelial cells is fostered by the glycolytic enhancer 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). We tested the hypothesis that miR-206 and mir-26b, emerging onco-suppressors targeting PFKFB3 in estrogen-dependent tumors, would regulate proliferation and migration of serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells via common glycolytic proteins, i.e., GLUT1 and PFKFB3, and downstream FAK. PFKFB3 was overexpressed in SKOV3, and its pharmacological inhibition with 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO) significantly reduced cell proliferation and motility. Both miR-206 and miR-26b directly targeted PFKFB3 as evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay. However, endogenous levels of miR-26b were higher than those of miR-206, which was barely detectable in SKOV3 as well as OVCAR5 and CAOV3 cells. Accordingly, only the anti-miR-26b inhibitor concentration-dependently increased PFKFB3 levels. While miR-206 overexpression impaired proliferation and migration by downregulating PFKFB3 levels, the decreased PFKFB3 protein levels related to miR-26 overexpression had no functional consequences in all EOC cell lines. Finally, consistent with the migration outcome, exogenous miR-206 and miR-26b induced opposite effects on the levels of total FAK and of its phosphorylated form at Tyr576/577. 3PO did not prevent miR-26b-induced SKOV3 migration. Overall, these results support the inverse relation between endogenous miRNA levels and their tumor-suppressive effects and suggest that restoring miR-206 expression represents a potential dual anti-PFKFB3/FAK strategy to control ovarian cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4210351406,"Background An increasing number of children and adolescents have reported mental health problems, and resilience is a protective factor against these problems. Therefore, the aim of the study is to verify the effect of peer education based on adolescent health education on adolescent resilience. Method A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted including 1,613 students who were divided into an intervention group (19 classes, 732 participants) and a control group (24 classes, 881 participants). One-year peer education was performed in the intervention group, and the control group had no interventions. The Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents by Yueqin Hu and a self-designed basic information questionnaire were used to collect data. Chi-square test and rank-sum test were used to compare the differences of demographic characteristics between the two groups. A linear mixed model was used to compare the changes of resilience between the two groups after intervention, and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to verify the effect of peer education on adolescent resilience. The significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. Results After intervention, compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant improvement in target focus, emotion adjustment, interpersonal assistance and total resilience ( P &lt; 0.05). The ICC range was 0.003 to 0.034. The GLMM results indicated that peer education based on adolescent health education had significant effects on adolescents’ target focus ( β = 0.893, P = 0.002), emotional adjustment ( β = 1.766, P &lt; 0.001), interpersonal assistance ( β = 1.722, P = 0.016) and total mental resilience ( β = 5.391, P &lt; 0.001), and the effect was greater for boys than for girls. Conclusions Peer education based on adolescent health education is effective for improving adolescents’ target focus, emotional adjustment, interpersonal assistance, and total resilience, especially for males. Future research should devote more attention to positive cognition and family support as well as gender differences."
https://openalex.org/W4210401180,"In two experiments, we used the simple zero-sum game Rock, Paper and Scissors to study the common reinforcement-based rules of repeating choices after winning ( win-stay ) and shifting from previous choice options after losing ( lose-shift ). Participants played the game against both computer opponents who could not be exploited and computer opponents who could be exploited by making choices that would at times conflict with reinforcement. Against unexploitable opponents, participants achieved an approximation of random behavior, contrary to previous research commonly finding reinforcement biases. Against exploitable opponents, the participants learned to exploit the opponent regardless of whether optimal choices conflicted with reinforcement or not. The data suggest that learning a rule that allows one to exploit was largely determined by the outcome of the previous trial."
https://openalex.org/W4210491510,"The impact of COVID-19 on socio-economical activities has changed everyday life. Dental hygienists, who perform aerosol generating procedures, have been strongly affected by changes in routine procedures. This cross-sectional study aimed at carrying out an online survey among dental hygienists in Lombardy. The survey was implemented after the first-wave lockdown focusing on the level of knowledge on COVID-19 and Sars-CoV-2, the virus-related changes in their attitude and working routine, and the socio-economic effects. In this report, we included 313 questionnaires of respondents (259 Females, and 54 Males; age = 33 ± 9 years). A significant percentage of respondents acknowledged the use of ""word of mouth"" among colleagues (n = 114, 36%) and social networks (n = 113, 36%) to be up to date on COVID-19. About half of respondents correctly identified the main COVID-19 symptoms/signs, just 13% (n = 41) identified the routes of transmission. Three quarters of respondents (n = 234, 75%) were afraid of being infected during the clinical practice, and about half of them would be afraid to treat patients having symptoms attributable to COVID-19. Twenty-one percent (n = 67) of participants also thought about changing job. Air-polishing was identified as the highest risk procedure, and 82% (n = 256) reported that they eliminated its use. Most claimed they never had a swab or a serological test, with two respondents positive to molecular test (0.6%), and 12 positives to serological test (3.8%). More than half of the participants (65%; n = 202) complained the dental hygienist is not protected, despite a loss of earnings due to lockdown between 2,000 and 10,000 euros. This study demonstrated that dental hygienists were emotionally and economically affected by the pandemic, significantly changing their work routine. Anti-epidemic protocols are pivotal to react promptly and to contain the virus in the dental setting."
https://openalex.org/W4210550352,"Climate change constitutes a rising challenge to the agricultural base of developing countries. Most of the literature has focused on the impact of changes in the means of weather variables on mean changes in production and has found very little impact of weather upon agricultural production. Instead, we focus on the relationship between extreme events in weather and extreme losses in crop production. Indeed, extreme events are of the greatest interest for scholars and policy makers only when they carry extraordinary negative effects. We build on this idea and for the first time, we adopt a conditional dependence model for multivariate extreme values to understand the impact of extreme weather on agricultural production. Specifically, we look at the probability that an extreme event drastically reduces the harvest of any of the major crops. This analysis, which is run on data for six different crops and four different weather variables in a vast array of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, shows that extremes in weather and yield losses of major staples are associated events. We find a high heterogeneity across both countries and crops and we are able to predict per country and per crop the risk of a yield reduction above 90% when extreme events occur. As policy implication, we can thus assess which major crop in each country is less resilient to climate shocks."
https://openalex.org/W4226176669,"Parenting interventions offer an evidence-based method for the prevention and early intervention of child mental health problems, but to-date their population-level effectiveness has been limited by poor reach and engagement, particularly for fathers, working mothers, and disadvantaged families. Tailoring intervention content to parents' context offers the potential to enhance parent engagement and learning by increasing relevance of content to parents' daily experiences. However, this approach requires a detailed understanding of the common parenting situations and issues that parents face day-to-day, which is currently lacking. We sought to identify the most common parenting situations discussed by parents on parenting-specific forums of the free online discussion forum, Reddit. We aimed to understand perspectives from both mothers and fathers, and thus retrieved publicly available data from r/Daddit and r/Mommit. We used latent Dirichlet allocation to identify the 10 most common topics discussed in the Reddit posts, and completed a manual text analysis to summarize the parenting situations (defined as involving a parent and their child aged 0-18 years, and describing a potential/actual issue). We retrieved 340 (r/Daddit) and 578 (r/Mommit) original posts. A model with 31 latent Dirichlet allocation topics was best fitting, and 24 topics included posts that met our inclusion criteria for manual review. We identified 45 unique but broadly defined parenting situations. The majority of parenting situations were focused on basic childcare situations relating to eating, sleeping, routines, sickness, and toilet training; or related to how to respond to child negative emotions or difficult behavior. Most situations were discussed in relation to infant or toddler aged children, and there was high consistency in the themes raised in r/Daddit and r/Mommit. Our results offer potential to tailor parenting interventions in a meaningful way, creating opportunities to develop content and resources that are directly relevant to parents' lived experiences."
https://openalex.org/W4210293338,"Little information exists on how COVID-19 testing influences intentions to engage in risky behavior. Understanding the behavioral effects of diagnostic testing may highlight the role of adequate testing on controlling viral transmission. In order to evaluate these effects, simulated scenarios were conducted evaluating participant intentions to self-isolate based on COVID-19 diagnostic testing availability and results.Participants from the United States were recruited through an online survey platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) and randomized to one of three hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario asked participants to imagine having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 along with a clinical diagnosis from their physician. However, scenarios differed in either testing availability (testing available v. unavailable) or testing result (positive v. negative test). The primary outcome was intention to engage in high-risk COVID-19 behaviors, measured using an 11-item mean score (range 1-7) that was pre-registered prior to data collection. Multi-variable linear regression was used to compare the mean composite scores between conditions. The randomized survey was conducted between July 23rd to July 29th, 2020.A total of 1400 participants were recruited through a national, online, opt-in survey. Out of 1194 respondents (41.6% male, 58.4% female) with a median age of 38.5 years, participants who had no testing available in their clinical scenario showed significantly greater intentions to engage in behavior facilitating COVID-19 transmission compared to those who received a positive confirmatory test result scenario (mean absolute difference (SE): 0.14 (0.06), P = 0.016), equating to an 11.1% increase in mean score risky behavior intentions. Intention to engage in behaviors that can spread COVID-19 were also positively associated with male gender, poor health status, and Republican party affiliation.Testing availability appears to play an independent role in influencing behaviors facilitating COVID-19 transmission. Such findings shed light on the possible negative externalities of testing unavailability.Effect of Availability of COVID-19 Testing on Choice to Isolate and Socially Distance, NCT04459520, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04459520."

Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) is an objective index for evaluating nutritional status of elderly people over 65 years old. The aim of the current study was to explore the correlation and predictive value between GNRI and postoperative recovery and complications in PCa patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).Taking 98 as the GNRI boundary value, 96 PCa patients (aged≥65 y) undergoing LRP in the Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College from January 2018 to December 2020 were grouped into malnutrition group (MNg, 34 patients, 35.4%) and normal nutrition group (NNg, 62 patients, 64.6%). Basic information, laboratory examination indexes, operation conditions, postoperative complications and postoperative recovery indexes of patients were recorded and retrospectively analyzed. Clavien-Dindo Classification System (CDCS) was used to assess postoperative complications. T-test was used to analyze differences between the two groups. ROC curve was generated to determine the predictive value of GNRI for postoperative complications.Percentage of complications was significantly higher in MNg group compared with that in NNg group (P < 0.01). The average grade based on CDCS was significantly lower in NNg group compared with that in MNg group (P < 0.01). Body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), preoperative hemoglobin value (HGB), serum albumin (ALB) values of MNg and NNg were significantly positively correlated with GNRI (P<0.01). Incidence and severity of postoperative complications of MNg patients were significantly higher compared with those of NNg patients (P<0.05). Average hospitalization cost of MNg patients was higher in MNg patients compared with that of NNg patients (P<0.05). Duration of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), duration of antibiotic use and duration of indwelling drainage tube were longer in MNg patients compared with those in NNg patients (P<0.05). Furthermore, volume of indwelling drainage tube was higher in MNg patients compared with that in NNg patients (P<0.05).GNRI is an effective and reliable tool for evaluation of preoperative nutritional status of prostate cancer patients. The findings showed that GNRI is correlated with postoperative recovery and complications, and is an effective predictive marker."
https://openalex.org/W4210402728,"A large proportion of adults in Japan remain unmarried even though they intend to marry during their lifetime. To provide data for policy makers and those searching for partners in the Japanese marriage market, we estimated the number and characteristics of unmarried women and men with marriage intention and assessed their partner preferences. Based on the findings, we hypothesized regarding potential mismatches between the individuals available in the marriage market and the type of partners they are looking for.We used data from the National Fertility Survey (2015), a nationally representative survey in Japan, and included 20,344 participants aged 18-49 years, of which 6,568 were unmarried with marriage intention. We estimated the total number of unmarried women and men who intend to marry, extrapolated their characteristics to the Japanese population, and assessed their partner preferences, as well as their ideal age of marriage and the ideal age of their partner.In 2015, there were 8.48 million unmarried women and 9.83 million unmarried men aged 18-49 years with marriage intention in Japan. Surpluses of around 600,000 men were observed in non-densely inhabited areas (men-to-women ratio: 1.31) and in the Kanto region (1.23). Most of the women and men in the marriage market had annual incomes lower than 3,000,000 JPY (28,000 USD) and only 263,000 women (3%) and 883,000 men (9%) had an income of 5,000,000 JPY (47,000 USD) or more; 167,000 men (2%) had an income of 7,000,000 JPY (66,000 USD) or more, with roughly three-quarters of them having a university degree. When asked about eight items that one may consider in a potential partner, the proportion of women listing an item as ""important"" tended to be larger than those of men across all items (education, occupation, finances, personality, mutual hobbies, cooperation/understanding regarding one's work, and attitude towards/skills in housework and childrearing) except appearance. The largest differences were observed for finances (proportion of women vs. men listing the item as ""important"" or ""would consider:"" 94.0% vs. 40.5%, p<0.001), occupation (84.9% vs. 43.9%, p<0.001), and education (53.9% vs. 28.7%, p<0.001). While women, on average, preferred men who were around 1-3 years older than themselves, men preferred women around their own age until the age of 26 years, at which point men preferred women who were younger than themselves, with the preferred age difference increasing substantially with age. As such, the number of men preferring a younger partner was larger than the number of women who preferred an older partner.By providing data on the number, characteristics and partner preferences of individuals in the marriage market, our study could inform decisions for those searching for marriage partners in Japan. Moreover, we hypothesize that mismatches in geographical location, the supply-demand disparity for partners with higher income, and age preferences could partly explain the large number of Japanese women and men who remain unmarried despite intending to get married. Further studies are needed to assess if, and to what extent, the identified mismatches may affect marriage rates."
https://openalex.org/W4210484303,"Using Brofenbrenner's socio-ecological model as a conceptual framework, the objective of this study was to determine playground users (primary school staff and pupils) perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to a physically active school playground at an intra-personal (individual), inter-personal (social), environmental and policy level. Results from a series of qualitative interactions with children (n = 65) from years five and six (9 to 11 years old), and structured interviews with adult teachers (n = 11) revealed key differences in the child and adult perceptions of the playground and the purpose of break-times. A number of inter-related environmental boundaries and school policies were identified as restrictive to children's explorations and activity levels during 'free play' periods, which centred on resource availability, accessibility and health and safety. Further, traditional playground hierarchies act to promote and prevent physical activity engagement for different groups (e.g. gender and age). Finally, differences between the adult and child perception of the primary school playground were observed. Playground physical activity, during break-times appears to be affected by a number of variables at each level of the socio-ecological model. This study provides an opportunity for primary schools to reflect on primary school playground strategies and practices that are implemented at each level of the socio-ecological model to encourage a more effective use of the playground during school break-times."
https://openalex.org/W4210584849,"Adept use of fertilizers is critical if sustainable development goal two of zero hunger and agroecosystem resilience are to be achieved for African smallholder agroecosystems. These heterogeneous systems are characterized by poor soil health mainly attributed to soil nutrient depletion. However, conventional methods do not take into account spatial patterns across geographies within agroecosystems, which poses great challenges for targeted interventions of nutrient management. This study aimed to develop a novel population-based farm survey approach for diagnosing soil nutrient deficiencies. The approach embraces principles of land health surveillance of problem definition and rigorous sampling scheme. The advent of rapid soil testing techniques, like infrared spectroscopy, offers opportune avenues for high-density soil and plant characterization. A farm survey was conducted on 64 maize fields, to collect data on soil and plant tissue nutrient concentration and grain yield (GY) for maize crops, using hierarchical and purposive sampling. Correlations between soil test values with GY and biomass were established. The relationship between GY, soil NPK, and the tissue nutrient concentrations was evaluated to guide the setting up of localized critical soil test values. Diagnosis Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) indices for total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and total potassium (K) were used to rank and map the prevalence of nutrient limitations. A positive correlation existed between plant tissue nutrient concentration with GY with R 2 values of 0.089, 0.033, and 0.001 for NPK, respectively. Soil test cut-off values were 0.01%, 12 mg kg -1 , 4.5 cmol c kg -1 for NPK, respectively, which varied slightly from established soil critical values for soil nutrient diagnostics. N and K were the most limiting nutrients for maize production in 67% of sampled fields. The study demonstrates that a population-based farm survey of crop fields can be a useful tool in nutrient diagnostics and setting priorities for site-specific fertilizer recommendations. A larger-scale application of the approach is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4210682968,"A key part of keeping doctoral and postdoctoral trainees in STEM research careers is mentoring. Our previous research indicates that mentoring trainees in scientific communication (SC) skill development increases research career intention through two social-cognitive constructs, self-efficacy in and outcome expectations for acquiring SC skills, as well as science identity. While many mentor training interventions exist, no programs focus on developing SC skills specifically. The ""Scientific Communication Advances Research Excellence"" (SCOARE) program trains mentors to address trainee scientific communication (SC) skill development as an innovative approach to increase trainee research career persistence. The SCOARE training is a half-day workshop for faculty mentors of research trainees at five sites nationally. Informed by previous research, workshop content focuses on practical, effective mentoring strategies to develop trainee speaking and writing skills. Anonymous evaluation data collected after each workshop indicates participant satisfaction and reported positive increases in skills and knowledge in applying new and various techniques when mentoring trainees (skills) and how linguistic bias influences our perception of others (knowledge).

https://openalex.org/W4213380501,"The causes of the peculiar time trend in the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in most parts of the world and of its geographic distribution are still unknown. We used the data base of 1974-2003 incident cases of hematological malignancies to explore the time trend of NHL incidence in the region of Sardinia, Italy, and we used Bayesian methods to plot the probability of NHL incidence by residential unit on the regional map. In 1974-2003, 4109 NHL cases were diagnosed among resident adults in Sardinia, with an incidence rate of 13.38 x 10-5 (95% CI 12.97-13.80). NHL incidence showed an upward trend along the study period with an average annual percent change (APC) of 4.94 (95% CI -5.39-16.4), which did not vary by gender or by age-group. Cancer registry data, covering part of the region starting from 1993, suggest that the increasing trend did not persist in the subsequent years. Areas with the highest probability of an excess incidence tended to cluster in the north-eastern part of the region and in two major urban centers, with the low incidence areas located in the south, confirming previous observations. Prevalence of viral infections, environmental and occupational exposures, or socio-economic deprivation would not explain the peculiar geographic distribution we observed. These findings provide convincing arguments for extending the coverage of routine cancer registration over the whole Sardinian population, while prompting further research on the genetic and environmental determinants of NHL in the risk areas."
https://openalex.org/W4225659221,"Age-related physiological changes are most notable and best-studied late in life, while the nature of aging in early- or middle-aged individuals has not been explored as thoroughly. In C. elegans, many studies of movement vs. age generally focus on three distinct phases: sustained, youthful movement; onset of rapidly progressing impairment; and gross immobility. We investigated whether this first period of early-life adult movement is a sustained ""healthy"" level of high function followed by a discrete ""movement catastrophe""-or whether there are early-life changes in movement that precede future physiological declines. To determine how movement varies during early adult life, we followed isolated individuals throughout life with a previously unachieved combination of duration and temporal resolution. By tracking individuals across the first six days of adulthood, we observed declines in movement starting as early as the first two days of adult life, as well as high interindividual variability in total daily movement. These findings suggest that movement is a highly dynamic behavior early in life, and that factors driving movement decline may begin acting as early as the first day of adulthood. Using simulation studies based on acquired data, we suggest that too-infrequent sampling in common movement assays limits observation of early-adult changes in motility, and we propose feasible strategies and a framework for designing assays with increased sensitivity for early movement declines."

Universal youth-focused substance use prevention programs have demonstrated effectiveness but are often not sustainable due to the significant amount of time, effort, and resources required. We describe a trial protocol for a brief, low-participant-burden intervention to improve substance use-specific parent-child communication through the promotion of family meals and increased parental engagement.This study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a 13-week intervention. A total of 500 dyads of parents and their 5th-7th grade children are recruited from across Massachusetts. Dyads are randomized to the intervention or attention-control condition using block urn randomization, based on child grade, gender, and school. Parents/guardians in the substance use preventive intervention arm receive a short handbook, attend two meetings with an interventionist, and receive two SMS messages per week. Parents/guardians in the control arm receive the same dose but with content focused on nutrition, physical activity, and weight stigma. Participant dyads submit videos of family meals, audio recordings of prompted conversations, and quantitative surveys over an 18-month period (baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 months post-intervention). The primary outcomes measure the quantity and quality of parent-child substance use conversations and proximal child indicators (i.e., substance use attitudes and expectancies, affiliation with substance-using peers, and intentions and willingness to use substances). The secondary outcome is child substance use initiation.This is a novel, brief, communication-focused intervention for parents/guardians that was designed to reduce participant burden. The intervention has the potential to improve parent-child engagement and communication and conversations about substance use specifically and decrease child substance use risk factors and substance use initiation.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03925220.

https://openalex.org/W4210364340,"Social associations within mixed-species bird flocks can promote information flow about food availability and provide predator avoidance benefits. The relationship between flocking propensity, foraging habitat quality, and interspecific competition can be altered by human-induced habitat degradation. Here we take a close look at sociality within two ecologically important flock-leader (core) species, the Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) and tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), to better understand how degradation of foraging habitat quality affects mixed-species flocking dynamics. We compared interactions of free ranging wild birds across a gradient of foraging habitat quality in three managed forest remnants. Specifically, we examined aspects of the social network at each site, including network density, modularity, and species assortativity. Differences in the social networks between each end of our habitat gradient suggest that elevated levels of interspecific association are more valuable in the habitat with low quality foraging conditions. This conclusion is supported by two additional findings: First, foraging height for the subordinate Carolina chickadee relative to the tufted titmouse decreased with an increase in the number of satellite species in the most disturbed site but not in the other two sites. Second, the chickadee gargle call rate, an acoustic signal emitted during agonistic encounters between conspecifics, was relatively higher at the high-quality site. Collectively, these results suggest an increase in heterospecific associations increases the value of cross-species information flow in degraded habitats."

In this setting, the SARS-CoV-2 infection screening retains a great value. However, there are still limited data on the feasibility and efficacy of combined screening procedures to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic cases) in cancer outpatients undergoing antineoplastic therapy.From May 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020, during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 860 consecutive patients, undergoing active anticancer therapy, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a combined screening procedure, including a self-report questionnaire, a molecular nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and a rapid serological immunoassay (for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies). The primary endpoint of the study was to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including asymptomatic cases) in consecutive and unselected cancer outpatients by a combined screening modality. A total of 2955 SARS-CoV-2 NPS and 860 serological tests, in 475 patients with hematologic cancers and in 386 with solid tumors, were performed. A total of 112 (13%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially COVID-19 related. In 1/860 cases (< 1%) SARS-CoV-2 NPS was positive and in 14 cases (1.62%) the specific serological test was positive (overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 1.62%). Of the 112 cases who declared symptoms potentially COVID-19-related, only 2.7% (3/112) were found SARS-CoV-2 positive.This is the largest study reporting the feasibility of a combined screening procedure (including triage, NPS and serologic test) to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients receiving active therapy, during the first epidemic wave and under the restrictive lockdown measures, in one of the active areas of the SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Lacking specific recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, a combined diagnostic screening might be more effective to detect the exact prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in neoplastic patient population. The prevalence can obviously change according to the territorial context, the entity of the restrictive measures adopted and the phase of the epidemic curve. However, its exact and real-time knowledge could be important to balance risks/benefits of oncologic treatments, avoiding (if the prevalence is low) the reduction of dose intensity or the selection of less intensive (but also less effective) anti-cancer therapies."

In women, older age, lower BMI, and less intake of vegetables were associated with increased risks of proximal femur fractures. With regard to the outcome of total lower limb fractures, less intake of vegetables and regular exercise were significant predictors in women. Calcium intake was not significantly associated with proximal femur or total lower limb fractures. There were no significant predictors of proximal femur or total lower limb fractures in men, except for age.Aging was a significant risk factor for proximal femur and total lower limb fractures in both men and women.

However, some products can be harmful to the mother, fetus or breast-fed child, which presents a challenge to health professionals and consumers. This study was aimed at assessing the practice of OTC medication dispensing and counseling services provided to pregnant and lactating by community pharmacists (CPs). A cross-sectional descriptive questionnaire-based survey was answered during February—November 2020, by licensed CPs practicing in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The determination of the significant factors associated with the CPs’ views and OTC medication dispensing during pregnancy and breastfeeding was carried out using logistic regression. Among 256 respondents, dispensing medicines and referral to a physician were the predominant services provided to pregnant and lactating women. Respondents dispensed medications mostly to treat headache (74.2%), fever (62.5%) in pregnant women, and headache (81.3%) and fever (65.2%) in lactating mothers. Referral to a physician was common in pregnant women in the following cases: varicose veins (72.7%), swelling of the feet and legs (71.9%), and vaginal itching (53.9%). In breastfeeding women, the referrals were commonly for varicose veins (79.7%), swelling of the feet and legs (73.0%) and mastitis (70.3%). Most participants came to an agreement that CPs are capable of counselling and providing pregnant and lactating women the best OTC treatment. Around 35% of the respondents stated that OTC medicines are not safe to be used during pregnancy. One in five respondents stated that OTC medicines are not safe for breastfeeding women. CPs were confident to counsel and provide advice to pregnant and breastfeeding women to address medication and health problems. Proper utilization of CPs can contribute largely to the healthcare system in managing common minor ailments in pregnant and lactating women, reducing the need to visit the physician and enhancing patient safety."

Methods Hospital based retrospective cross sectional, descriptive study was conducted on registration of all pregnancy outcomes from August 30, 2017 to August 30, 2019 at DBRH, Ethiopia. The collected data were checked for completeness and consistencies, and cleaned, coded and entered using Epi data version 4.2 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20 for analysis. Variables were interpreted per 1000 pregnancies and those variables having p&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The total prevalence of NTDs was 10.9 (95% CI 8.9 to 13.3) per 1000 pregnancies and the prevalence of each NTD type was anencephaly 5.6 (95% CI 4.2 to 7.4) per 1000 pregnancies, spina bifida 3.5 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.9) per 1000 pregnancies, encephalocele 1.1 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.0) per 1000 pregnancies, and both spina bifida and anencephaly 0.7(95% CI 0.3 to 1.4) per 1000 pregnancies. Among livebirths, aborted, stillbirths and medically terminated pregnancies (n = 8862), there were 50 anencephaly cases, 31 spina bifida cases, 10 encephalocele cases, and 6 cases affected by both spina bifida and anencephaly. Conclusion The prevalence of NTDs in this study was among the highest globally reported. The total prevalence was 10.9 per 1000 pregnancies. Increased periconceptional folic acid use, counseling for women with certain medical illnesses at higher risk for NTDs, and early maternal screening for genetic factors are possible approaches to reduce in NTDs in the population."
https://openalex.org/W4210767740,"The mechanisms controlling the extraordinarily slow carbon (C) mineralization rates characteristic of Sphagnum-rich peatlands (""bogs"") are not fully understood, despite decades of research on this topic. Soluble phenolic compounds have been invoked as potentially significant contributors to bog peat recalcitrance due to their affinity to slow microbial metabolism and cell growth. Despite this potentially significant role, the effects of soluble phenolic compounds on bog peat C mineralization remain unclear. We analyzed this effect by manipulating the concentration of free soluble phenolics in anaerobic bog and fen peat incubations using water-soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (""PVP""), a compound that binds with and inactivates phenolics, preventing phenolic-enzyme interactions. CO2 and CH4 production rates (end-products of anaerobic C mineralization) generally correlated positively with PVP concentration following Michaelis-Menten (M.M.) saturation functions. Using M.M. parameters, we estimated that the extent to which phenolics inhibit anaerobic CO2 production was significantly higher in the bog-62 ± 16%-than the fen-14 ± 4%. This difference was found to be more substantial with regards to methane production-wherein phenolic inhibition for the bog was estimated at 54 ± 19%, while the fen demonstrated no apparent inhibition. Consistent with this habitat difference, we observed significantly higher soluble phenolic content in bog vs. fen pore-water. Together, these findings suggest that soluble phenolics could contribute to bogs' extraordinary recalcitrance and high (relative to other peatland habitats) CO2:CH4 production ratios."
https://openalex.org/W4210773674,"Although Viking sailors did not have a magnetic compass, they could successfully navigate with a sun-compass under a sunny sky. Under cloudy/foggy conditions, they might have applied the sky-polarimetric Viking navigation (SPVN), the high success of which has been demonstrated with computer simulations using the following input data: sky polarization patterns measured with full-sky imaging polarimetry, and error functions of the navigation steps measured in psychophysical laboratory and planetarium experiments. As a continuation of the earlier studies, in this work we investigate the sensitivity of the success of SPVN to the following relevant sailing, meteorological and navigational parameters: sunstone type, sailing date, navigation periodicity, night sailing, dominance of strongly, medium or weakly cloudy skies, and changeability of cloudiness. Randomly varying these parameters in the simulation of Viking voyages along the latitude 60° 21' 55'' N from Norway to Greenland, we determined those parameters which had strong and weak influences on the success of SPVN. The following intrinsic parameters of the simulation were also randomly changed: sailing speed, visibility distance of Greenland's southeast coastline and start time of diurnal sailing. Our results show that the sailing success is sensitive to the night sailing, navigation periodicity and sailing date, while it is robust against the sunstone type, dominance of strongly, medium or weakly cloudy skies, and changing cloudiness."
https://openalex.org/W4225280420,"In many groups of animals the dominance hierarchy is linear. What mechanisms underlie this linearity of the dominance hierarchy is under debate. Linearity is often attributed to cognitively sophisticated processes, such as transitive inference and eavesdropping. An alternative explanation is that it develops via the winner-loser effect. This effect implies that after a fight has been decided the winner is more likely to win again, and the loser is more likely to lose again. Although it has been shown that dominance hierarchies may develop via the winner-loser effect, the degree of linearity of such hierarchies is unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether a similar degree of linearity, like in real animals, may emerge as a consequence of the winner-loser effect and the socio-spatial structure of group members. For this purpose, we use the model DomWorld, in which agents group and compete and the outcome of conflicts is self-reinforcing. Here dominance hierarchies are shown to emerge. We analyse the dominance hierarchy, behavioural dynamics and network triad motifs in the model using analytical methods from a previous study on dominance in real hens. We show that when one parameter, representing the intensity of aggression, was set high in the model DomWorld, it reproduced many patterns of hierarchical development typical of groups of hens, such as its high linearity. When omitting from the model the winner-loser effect or spatial location of individuals, this resemblance decreased markedly. We conclude that the combination of the spatial structure and the winner-loser effect provide a plausible alternative for hierarchical linearity to processes that are cognitively more sophisticated. Further research should determine whether the winner-loser effect and spatial structure of group members also explains the characteristics of hierarchical development in other species with a different dominance style than hens."
https://openalex.org/W4210254645,"This paper examines whether mega-events-initiated planning regulations improved air quality in Chinese cities and explores the driving forces of the enforcement of such regulations. Using the 2008 Beijing Olympics as an example, we find that mega-events serve as an opportunity for cities to combat air pollution. The 2008 Olympics prompted a handful of Chinese cities to cut pollution and sustain a blue sky: Cities with air quality regulated for the Olympics cut their Air Pollution Index by about 16 points during the Games, compared to non-regulated cities, and 60% of that effect remained four years after the event. These achievements are obtained through effective mobilization of city leaders by associating air quality with their political careers. This study reveals that 1) a mega-event may improve urban environmental quality beyond the host cities and the event period, and 2) successful implementation of environmental regulations hinges on incentivizing local leaders."
https://openalex.org/W4210408704,"Distrust, and more broadly, public perception of government's handling of a crisis, has been a widely studied topic within health crisis research and suggests that these perceptions are significantly associated with the behavior of its citizens.To understand which aspects of the public's perception of government handling of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted engagement of protective behaviors among older adults, who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19.Participants were recruited from an ongoing biopsychosocial study on aging amongst community-dwelling older adults. There were two rounds of data collection, during the national lockdown and post-lockdown. The average length of follow-up was 5.88 months. N = 421 completed the first round of data collection and N = 318 subsequently completed the second round of questionnaires.During the lockdown, perceptions that pandemic-related measures in place were sufficient, effective, timely, provided a sense of safety, important information was easily accessible, and government handling of the pandemic could be trusted, were found to significantly predict engagement in protective behaviors. During post-lockdown, only perceptions that measures in place were sufficient, provided a sense of safety, and important information was easily accessible, remained significant predictors. The perception that COVID-19 measures were clear and easy to understand now became a significant predictor.Public perceptions of government handling of the pandemic predicted engagement in protective behaviors but were less important during post-lockdown. To effectively engage older adults in protective behavior, our findings suggest for pandemic-related information to be accessible, introducing timely safety measures, and having easy-to-understand instructions for nuanced measures."
https://openalex.org/W4210434345,"We used the method of measuring potential difference between two Ag|AgCl electrodes immersed directly into electrolyte solution with lower concentration and at different distances from membrane. The bacterial cellulose membrane was placed in horizontal plane in the membrane system with configurations with higher NaCl concentration and density under (A) and over the membrane (B). In both configurations at the initial moment the voltage between electrodes amounted to zero. After turning off mechanical stirring of solutions, in configuration A we observed the monotonic increase and next stabilization of voltage while in configuration B after short time dependent on the initial quotient of NaCl concentrations on the membrane we observed appearance of pulsations of measured voltage and gradual decrease of mean voltage over time. Smooth changes of voltage are connected with diffusional reconstruction of Concentration Boundary Layers (CBLs) while fast increase and subsequent pulsations of voltage are connected with the appearance of hydrodynamic instabilities (gravitational convection) near membrane imposed on diffusive reconstruction of thin layer. The time needed for the appearance of hydrodynamic instabilities in CBL depended nonlinearly on the initial ratio of electrolyte concentrations on the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W4210487445,"The matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has a complex role in infection and immune evasion, particularly with respect to suppression of Type I interferon (IFN). Viral strains bearing the wild-type (wt) M protein are able to suppress Type I IFN responses. We recently reported that the 22-25 strain of VSV encodes a wt M protein, however its sister plaque isolate, strain 22-20, carries a M[MD52G] mutation that perturbs the ability of the M protein to block NFκB, but not M-mediated inhibition of host transcription. Therefore, although NFκB is activated in 22-20 infected murine L929 cells infected, no IFN mRNA or protein is produced. To investigate the impact of the M[D52G] mutation on immune evasion by VSV, we used transcriptomic data from L929 cells infected with wt, 22-25, or 22-20 to define parameters in a family of executable logical models with the aim of discovering direct targets of viruses encoding a wt or mutant M protein. After several generations of pruning or fixing hypothetical regulatory interactions, we identified specific predicted targets of each strain. We predict that wt and 22-25 VSV both have direct inhibitory actions on key elements of the NFκB signaling pathway, while 22-20 fails to inhibit this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4210637283,"Despite rigorous sterilization protocols placed in surgical procedures, there is demonstrated evidence that show patients contract infections while hospitalized. This study aims to investigate the presence of biological materials in osteotome surgical tools after sterilization processes, determine the relationship between lack of sharpness and cross-contamination, and evaluate the influence of materials surface coating as a potential contamination preventive. Three commercially available osteotomes with different surface coatings were studied and submitted to a procedure of bone-cutting cycles. After use, each was sterilized and examined under SEM and EDS. Bone contaminants were detected in each osteotome although the PVD coated osteotome demonstrated significantly less contamination than either the as-supplied or electroless nickel coated one. According to the results, there is an association between blade sharpness and post-sterilization bone contamination. These findings suggest either disposable osteotomes should be used in surgical procedures, or an effective sharpen process should both be established and monitored to minimise post-operative infections."
https://openalex.org/W4210711638,"German retailers offer a large variety of accessories for pets. However, not all products are suitable for pet husbandry. Several articles can negatively influence the wellbeing of pets or cause injuries, but empirical studies that evaluate accessories for small pets under animal welfare aspects are rare. In the present study, we assessed articles manufactured or sold in Germany in the product categories pet cages, hay racks, running wheels, exercise balls, harnesses and leashes, tube systems, and hamster bedding. To do so, we searched 28 German websites, visited 50 pet shops and 13 home improvement and garden centers on site and afterwards examined the animal welfare compliance of the products according to various evaluation criteria. Most of the examined products were rated not suitable for pet husbandry and were animal-welfare-adverse. This result applies to 86.1% (n = 87) of the 101 assessed running wheel models, 82.7% (n = 172) of the 208 assessed pet cage models and 55.6% (n = 40) of the 72 assessed hay rack models. The articles in the product categories exercise balls, harnesses and leashes, tube systems, and hamster bedding were also found unsuitable due to animal welfare concerns. Furthermore, we found clear shortcomings regarding article declarations. In some cases, relevant product information (e.g., dimensions) were missing, or the presented information was too general (e.g., rodent cage). Improperly declared pet accessories make it difficult for pet owners to decide whether a product is suitable or unsuitable for the species they keep. A declaration duty for manufacturers of pet products could ensure that German retailers only offer properly declared pet accessories and facilitate the decision for pet owners to purchase products appropriate for the pets they keep. Furthermore, a voluntary product certification for manufacturers would allow retailers to check the animal welfare compliance of articles before including them in their assortment. If a product is unsuitable for pet husbandry because it does not meet the set requirements, it must be considered animal-welfare-adverse and removed from the assortment. As done for the Austrian ""animal welfare label,"" an independent, qualified third party could do the certification."
https://openalex.org/W4210803169,"This study examines whether age associates with entrepreneurship tendencies across the lifespan, after taking into account aspects of personality that affect entrepreneurship. Participants (N = 963) aged 18-81, including 200 actual entrepreneurs, completed questionnaires about entrepreneurship tendency, personality traits, and attachment orientations. Results show that age is associated with a reduced tendency to engage in entrepreneurial activity. However, this decline is quite limited, it weakens with age, and is absent after age 50. In addition, the negative association of age with entrepreneurial tendency is smaller in participants with above-median entrepreneurship tendency scores relative to those with below-median scores, and it disappears in actual entrepreneurs. Furthermore, most of the traits that have been previously associated with entrepreneurial tendencies, especially Openness to Experience and Extraversion, remain unchanged with age, accounting for the stability of entrepreneurial tendency over time. The results have implications for policy makers who wish to encourage older adults to engage in entrepreneurial activity."
