https://openalex.org/W2080802801,"A Caenorhabditis-specific pheromone and the food supply influence both entry into and exit from a developmentally arrested juvenile stage called the dauer larva. The pheromone increases the frequency of dauer larva formation and inhibits recovery but does not affect adult behavior such as chemotaxis and egg laying. The fatty acid--like pheromone has been partially purified and characterized by a new bioassay. If similar developmental control mechanisms are used by parasitic nematodes, such mechanisms might be exploited to develop highly selective anthelmintic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1488171851,"We have identified the biological activity of three polypeptides released by limited proteolysis of human plasma fibronectin by leukocyte elastase. A Mr = 140,000 peptide contains cell-spreading activity; a Mr = 60,000 peptide mediates binding to denatured collagen (gelatin), and a Mr = 29,000 peptide contains glutaminyl residues responsible for the transglutaminase (blood coagulation factor XIIIa)-catalyzed incorporation of amines. More extensive proteolysis yielded numerous peptides, including a Mr = 40,000 peptide derived from the Mr = 60,000 peptide which retains gelatin-binding activity. Quantification of the gelatin-binding peptides is consistent with two binding sites per dimeric fibronectin molecule of Mr = 440,000. Both Mr = 60,000 and 40,000 gelatin-binding peptides were enriched with half-cystine residues, containing 28 and 25, respectively, but devoid of cysteine. This, coupled with the electrophoretic behavior of both peptides, was consistent with the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds in the gelatin-binding domain. Intact fibronectin contains 1 free cysteine residue/monomer, as recently described. This cysteine reacts with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) very slowly under nondenaturing conditions but rapidly when fibronectin is denatured. The free cysteine is located in the Mr = 140,000 peptide. While the Mr = 40,000 and 60,000 gelatin-binding peptides bind to gelatin with an affinity about 30-fold and 5-fold less than intact fibronectin (based on a monomeric fibronectin Mr = 220,000), neither gelatin-binding peptide supports spreading of fibronectin-deficient test cells on gelatin or tissue culture plastic substrates. The purified Mr = 140,000 peptide supported cell spreading on plastic, retaining about one-half of the spreading activity of intact fibronectin on a weight basis. These data confirm recent results, suggesting multiple, protease- resistant domains with discrete biological functions within fibronectin. Our results, together with established data, suggest a model for the location of the transglutaminase-reactive glutaminyl residues, gelatin binding, and cell-adhesive domains in fibronectin. The release of univalent, biologically active fibronectin fragments by elastase, a major physiologically released inflammatory protease of human leukocytes, suggests a new potential mechanism for alteration of cell connective tissue interactions at sites of inflammation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2027367985,"In a variety of species, including rodents and man, the γ chain of fibrinogen consists of two nonallelic forms, called γA and γB, or γ and γ′. We have found that these two fibrinogen γ chains in the rat arise by translation of two mRNAs of 1700 and 2200 nucleotides, which are produced from a single gene by alternative splice patterns. The more abundant, γA chain mRNA is 1561 nucleotides long, excluding the polyadenylated region, and encodes a protein 83% homologous with the human γA chain. A hydrophobic “signal” polypeptide of 25 amino acids is present at the amino terminus. The γB (γ′) mRNA is identical with the γA sequence with the exception of a 513 bp insert located 202 bp from the poly(A) extension. This 513 bp insert is identical to the seventh and final intron of the γ-fibrinogen gene, and is located four codons prior to the termination codon for the γA chain. Translation into this sequence produces a unique 12 amino acid carboxylterminus in the rat γB (γ′) polypeptide that is homologous with the known carboxylterminus of the human γB (γ′) chain."

https://openalex.org/W1668553077,"The amino acid sequence of the light chain of the vitamin K-dependent protein C from bovine plasma is reported together with the supporting data. The sequence was determined by sequenator analysis of intact light chain, which contains 155 amino acid residues, and fragments obtained by chemical and enzymatic degradation of the light chain. All 11 glutamyl residues up to position 44 are carboxylated as gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. This part of the molecule proved very homologous to the other vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins. The remaining part (111 residues) is homologous to the corresponding parts in factor IX and factor X but not to prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W186710576,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) inhibited type I collagen synthesis in the central bone but not the periosteum of fetal rat calvaria maintained in organ culture. The central bone synthesized primarily type I collagen, whereas the periosteum synthesized both types I and III collagen. Enhanced degradation of newly synthesized collagen seemed an unlikely mechanism for the observed decrease in collagen synthesis since 1,25-(OH)2D3 reduced both the labeling of intracellular procollagen and total [3H]hydroxyproline formation in fetal rat calvaria. As measured by cell-free translation of RNA extracted from calvaria, 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased the level of functional procollagen mRNA and collagen synthesis to the same extent. Both collagen synthesis and procollagen mRNA levels were decreased as early as 3 h after exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and were 50% of the control level by 24 hr. Upon removal of 1,25-(OH)2D3 from the cultures, collagen synthesis and procollagen mRNA remained depressed for 24 h but returned to control levels by 48 h. A reduction in collagen synthesis and procollagen mRNA was also observed in calvaria excised from 6-day-old rat pups given a single subcutaneous injection of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1.6 ng/g body weight). We conclude that 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibits the synthesis of type I collagen in the differentiated osteoblast by reducing the level of functional procollagen mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2061820222,"A bovine liver serine tRNA with a variety of unusual features has been sequenced and characterized. This tRNA is aminoacylated with serine, although it has a tryptophan anticodon CmCA. In ribosome binding assays, this tRNA (tRNACmCASer) binds to the termination codon UGA and shows little or no binding in response to a variety of other codons including those for tryptophan and serine. The unusual codon recognition properties of this molecule were confirmed in an in vitro assay where this tRNA suppressed UGA termination. This is the first naturally occurring eucaryotic suppressor tRNA to be so characterized. Other unusual features, possibly related to the ability of this tRNA to read UGA, are the presence of two extra nucleotides, compared to all other tRNAs, between the universal residues U at position 8 and A at position 14 and the presence of an extra unpaired nucleotide within the double-stranded loop IV stem. This tRNA is also the largest eucaryotic tRNA sequenced to date (90 nucleotides). Despite its size, however, it contains only six modified residues. tRNACmCASer shows extremely low homology to other mammalian serine (47–52% homology) or tryptophan (49% homology) tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1878634411,"We have cloned and identified mRNA sequences for two rat pancreatic trypsinogens. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned sequences revealed two mRNAs that encode similar, though noallelic, pretrypsinogens. Trypsinogen I mRNA is 804 nucleotides in length, plus an estimated poly(A) tract of 100 nucleotides, and contains a short (13 nucleotide) 5' noncoding region and a 3' noncoding region of 54 nucleotides. It encodes a preproenzyme of 246 amino acids comprising a hydrophobic prepeptide (signal peptide) of 15 amino acids, an activation peptide characteristic of trypsinogens, and an active form of trypsin, 223 amino acids in length, that has 78% amino acid sequence identity with porcine trypsin. Trypsinogen II mRNA has a nucleotide sequence 88% homologous with that of trypsinogen I mRNA and encodes a protein with 89% amino acid sequence identity with trypsinogen I. The enzymes encoded by trypsinogen I and II mRNAs retain the key amino acid residues that determine the characteristic substrate cleavage preference of trypsins and, therefore, represent the rat counterparts of this digestive enzyme. Trypsinogen I mRNA is a major pancreatic mRNA comprising an estimated 2-5% of the total, whereas trypsinogen II mRNA is present at much lower levels."

The technetium-99m analog, trans-(99mTc(dmpe) 2Cl2]+, has also been prepared and shown to yield excellent gamma-ray images of the heart. The purposeful design, characterization, and synthesis of this technetium-99m radiopharmaceutical represents a striking application of fundamental inorganic chemistry to a problem in applied nuclear medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1525916153,"We have compared the cleavage of purified human Hageman factor (HF) by an activated form of human Hageman factor (HFa) (autodigestion) and by kallikrein. In each case, an initial cleavage is seen which produces HFa with Mr = 80,000 consisting of a heavy chain of Mr = 52,000 disulfide-linked to a light chain of Mr = 28,000. As autodigestion proceeds, HFa is shown to be further digested to yield a major active product at a molecular weight of 40,000 as well as Hageman factor fragment (HFf), which appear as two closely related molecular species of Mr = 28,000 and 30,000. A minor active product of Mr = 70,000 is also seen. Upon reduction of each of the active forms, a chain with Mr = 28,000 is released which contains the active site. HF digestion by kallikrein results in rapid formation of HFa, followed by HFa digestion to HFf and degradation of the heavy chain region to an inactive fragment at 40,000 daltons, which is then degraded to an end product of Mr = 36,000. Production of the active species with Mr = 40,000 and 70,000 is greatly diminished when kallikrein is the HF activator, and these active forms are shown to be formed primarily by autodigestion. The time course of HFa and HFf formation indicates that the rate of activation of Hageman factor by kallikrein is much faster than the rate of autoactivation; the addition of high molecular weight kininogen increases the rate of HFa and HFf formation as well as the extent of HG digestion. These data indicate that HFa is the active intermediate from which other active species are derived. The patterns of HF and HFa digestion by HFa and kallikrein are distinct; a model for HF digestion is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2118325844,"Human leukocyte cathespin G strongly stimulates the rate of solubilization of human lung elastin by human leukocyte elastase. For instance, the elastolytic activity of an equimolar mixture of elastase and cathepsin G is more than 5 times higher than that of elastase alone. Optimal stimulation occurs only if cathepsin G and elastase act simultaneously on elastin. Potentiation of leukocyte elastase digestion of lung elastin may also be brought about by bovine alpha-chymotrypsin. This enzyme is about half as efficient as cathepsin G. Stimulation of leukocyte elastase activity by cathepsin G is about 3 times less pronounced with bovine ligamentum nuchae elastin than with human lung elastin. On the other hand, the elastolytic activity of porcine pancreatic elastase is only enhanced by 20 to 30% by cathepsin. Therefore, maximal potentiation of elastolysis occurs with the lung elastin/leukocyte elastase system. The pathologic relevance of these findings is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1525205313,"We have developed a continuous spectroscopic method to analyze the kinetics of elastase secretion by human neutrophils. We have used the elastase-specific substrate methylsuccinylalanylalanylprolylvalylmethylcoumarin amide (Castillo, M. J., Nakajima, K., Zimmerman, J., and Powers, J. C. (1979) Anal. Biochem. 99, 53-64), which liberates the fluorophore, aminomethylcoumarin, when cleaved by elastase. We find that secretion of elastase in cytochalasin B-treated cells is initiated within approximately 5 s of exposure of the cells to the fluoresceinated chemotactic peptide stimulus, N-formyl-norleucylleucylphenylalanylnorleucyltyrosyllysine-fluorescein, and that secretion is completed within 30 s. The kinetics of this response is only slightly dependent on the concentration of the stimulus. Up to 100% (approximately 0.5 pg/neutrophil) of the elastase can be released in a dose-dependent manner by stimulated cells. We have also used this fluoresceinated stimulus and an antibody to fluorescein (Sklar, L. A., Oades, Z. G., Jesaitis, A. J., Painter, R. G., and Cochrane, C. G. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 7540-7544) to probe the temporal relationship between the binding of stimulus to the receptors and the cellular response. We find that the entire response is elicited by the binding which occurs within the first 15 s after the addition of stimulus, regardless of the dose. We estimate that an occupancy of no more than 20% of the cellular receptors for the stimulus is required to evoke the optimal response."
https://openalex.org/W2060257489,"The substantial increases of hepatic, splenic, and renal heme oxygenase levels that occur shortly after birth in neonatal rats were prevented by a single administration of tin-protoporphyrin (10 micromoles per kilogram of body weight). With this treatment serum bilirubin levels declined within 24 hours to near-normal adult levels and remained low throughout the postnatal period. Zinc-protoporphyrin at doses up to 50-fold greater than the effective dose of tin-protoporphyrin did not prevent the immediate increases in tissue heme oxygenase activities and in serum bilirubin levels that occur postnatally. Studies in vitro with microsomal heme oxygenase in human spleen indicate that tin-protoporphyrin is a potent competitive inhibitor of the oxidation of heme to bile pigment in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1486745112,"Transcription of Drosophila tRNA genes is controlled by signals within and outside the region coding for the mature tRNA. Deletion analysis has revealed an oligonucleotide sequence in the 5'-flanking region of a Drosophila tRNA2Lys gene to be responsible for the poor transcriptional activity of this and of other tRNA genes. The low template activity of this gene was maintained even after deletion of the 5'-flanking region up to nucleotide -23. Removal of nine additional nucleotides resulted in complete loss of transcriptional repression. The oligonucleotide responsible for transcriptional repression is GGCAGTTTTTG and is located 13 nucleotides upstream from the mature tRNA coding sequence. Since the sequence of the undecanucleotide is well conserved within the 5'-flanking region of all known Drosophila tRNA2Lys genes, we have investigated why the transcription of all these genes is not similarly repressed. Deletion or insertion of nucleotides between the mature tRNA coding region and this oligonucleotide resulted in tRNA genes with increased template activity. This observation suggests that the position of this oligonucleotide relative to some element downstream influences the extent of transcriptional repression."

https://openalex.org/W1564703693,"cDNA clones encoding human apolipoprotein E were identified by screening an adult human liver cDNA library with an oligonucleotide probe. The probe was a mixture of synthetic 14-base long DNA oligomers constructed to correspond to all possible codons for apo-E amino acids 218-222. Plasmids from four of the 20 clones selected by this screening procedure were digested with PstI and all had five internal PstI sites with a total length of the cDNA insert of approximately 900 base pairs. DNA sequence analysis of one of these clones, designated pE-301, revealed that it corresponded to apo-E amino acids 81-299, and contained a standard termination codon, polyadenylation signal, and poly A tail. The DNA sequence examined included the known apo-E polymorphic sites at amino acids 112, 145, and 158, and the mutant apo-E phenotypes can all be explained on the basis of a single base substitution in the first position of each of these codons. This work supports the hypothesis that the apo-E polymorphism is due to mutations in the region of DNA coding for the apo-E structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1597038876,"A series of potentiometric titrations of xanthine oxidase have been performed at room temperature in the pH range 6.1-9.9. Reduction of the two Fe/S centers was monitored by CD, and that of the FAD and Mo center by EPR. The Fe/S centers behave as centers having a protonable group whose pKa changes with reduction state (E = -344 mV, pKo = 6.4, and pKr = 8.1 for Fe/S I; E = -249 mV, pKo = 6.4, and pKr = 8.0 for Fe/S II). The flavin and the two types of molybdenum centers show varying behavior, but, in all cases, electron addition is accompanied by protonation. The sequence for FAD is reduction, protonation, reduction, protonation with E1 = -398 mV, E2 = -240 mV, pK1 = 9.5, pK2 = 7.4. For rapid molybdenum, the sequence is protonation, reduction, protonation, reduction with E1 = -369 mV, E2 = -301 mV, pK1 = 7.9, pK2 = 8.4; and for slow molybdenum, protonation, reduction, protonation with E1 = 320 mV, E2 = -477 mV, pK1 = 7.5, pK2 = 9.5.

(1982) in Flavins and Flavoproteins (Massey, V., and Williams, C. H., eds) pp. 796-804, Elsevier/North-Holland, New York) showed the centers to have significant temperature dependence, which calls for a re-evaluation of conclusions reached using cryogenic techniques (e.g. rapid-freeze). The optical absorbance characteristics of the enzyme were also investigated and a possible absorbance for molybdenum was suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1533891877,The precursor of the cationic protein called stratum corneum basic protein (SCBP) has been purified from extracts of epidermal keratohyalin granules. The precursor and SCBP have virtually identical amino acid compositions and similar reactivities to antibody to SCBP. Peptide mapping studies using elastase in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels suggest that the primary amino acid sequences of SCBP and the precursor are similar. The proteins differ in their mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in their net charges. The lower pI of the precursor (6.9) appears to be due to 15 to 20 mol of covalently bound phosphate per mol of protein; SCBP contains no phosphate.

P. C., Herbrink, P., Bloemendal, H., and de Jong, W. W. (1980) Exp. Eye Res. 31, 213-216) and a gamma-crystallin polypeptide (gamma II) (Croft, L. R. (1972) Biochem. J. 128, 961-970) of the bovine lens. A previous comparison indicated that bovine beta Bp and gamma II contain internally homologous sequences of amino acids and are evolutionarily related, suggesting an intragenic duplication of a common ancestral gene (Driessen, H. P. C., Herbrink, P., Bleomendal, H., and de Jong, W. W. (1980) Exp. Eye Res. 31, 213-216). When the amino acids were aligned, we calculated a 43% homology between the murine and bovine beta-crystallin polypeptides and a 22% homology between the murine beta-crystallin and bovine gamma-crystallin polypeptides. As for bovine beta Bp and gamma II, there is a striking homology between the amino and carboxyl halves of the murine beta-crystallin polypeptide. The internally homologous amino acids have been preferentially conserved among the three crystallin chains, a fact consistent with the possibility that these lens proteins arose from a common precursor gene that internally duplicated."

https://openalex.org/W1522145227,"Insertion of tubulin into the bilayer of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles at the phase transition results in the formation of stable vesicle-tubulin complexes (Klausner, R. D., Kumar, N., Weinstein, J. N., Blumenthal, R., and Flavin, M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5879-5885). These complexes aggregated when maintained below phase transition for 10-20 min. Addition of millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Co2+, but not Mg2+, caused the vesicle-tubulin complexes to fuse into larger structures as shown by (a) electron microscopy, (b) increased trapped volume, and (c) changes ion resonance energy transfer between two fluorescent lipid probes incorporated into the same vesicle. There was no loss of internal aqueous contents from the vesicle-tubulin complexes during Ca2+-induced fusion. Anti-tubulin drugs had no effect on the aggregation or fusion, and vesicle-bound tubulin did not associate with microtubules when tubulin was assembled in vitro. Trypsin-treated vesicle-tubulin complexes were incapable of supporting Ca2+-induced fusion. This system provides a model for Ca2+-induced and protein-mediated nonleaky fusion of uncharged lipid bilayers."

https://openalex.org/W1966298629,"Dictyostelium discoideum strain JC-5 is a temperature-sensitive, cohesion-defective mutant. At the restrictive temperature, aggregates are formed and develop normally to a specific late stage, but then disperse to a lawn of noncohesive cells. The defect stems from the inability of the mutant at the restrictive temperature to accumulate or retain an adequate level of a newly arisen, plasma-membrane-associated cohesive moiety during the later stages of morphogenesis. We now report that the noncohesive mutant cells can be induced to cohere at a level of >99% by addition of a fraction reactive with wheat germ agglutinin and isolated from the plasma membranes of late-stage, cohesive mutant or wild-type cells. Furthermore, the cohesivities of latestage, cohesive mutant or wild-type cells can be significantly enhanced by the same preparations but early-stage cohesive cells remain unaffected. The cohesion-inducing activity can be recovered from two regions of a one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electropherogram following elution and renaturation. The first is associated with a single silver-staining band (apparent molecular weight 95,000). It appears de novo at a postaggregative stage, and accumulates in a thermostable fashion in the wild-type and in a thermosensitive fashion in the mutants, concurrent with the loss of cohesivity. The second is associated with a complex of silver-staining bands (apparent molecular weights 40,000–50,000).

Albumin synthesis paralleled the albumin mRNA levels during the first 8 days after injection; but, 16 and 32 days after injection, albumin synthesis again decreased while albumin mRNA remained at normal levels. The time courses of the effects of estrogen on albumin and vitellogenin mRNA levels were different.

At the conclusion of the reaction there is a net increase in absorbance at wavelengths greater than 550 nm. A spectrally similar species is obtained when violapterin is added to dithionite-reduced enzyme. This long wavelength absorbance is not accompanied by an EPR signal characteristic of flavin neutral radical and it is produced equally well in flavin-free xanthine oxidase. Its production is eliminated by the inhibitors, cyanide and allopurinol, which react at the molybdenum center. We conclude that this new species is a charge transfer complex between Mo(IV) and the product of the reaction, violapterin (2,4,7-trihydroxypteridine). A similar, though less intense, absorbance at 650 nm is also obtained when lumazine is bound to the reduced enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1604032144,"Evidence is presented for the existence of a new C-23 oxidation pathway for the metabolism of the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, namely 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Homogenates of intestinal mucosa or kidney, but not liver, from rats and chicks convert 1,25(OH)2[26,27-3H]D3 into two new metabolites, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-23-oxo-vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2-23-oxo-D3) and 1 alpha,25,26-trihydroxy-23-oxo-vitamin D3 (1,25,26(OH)3-23-oxo-D3), and an unknown metabolite(s) which has been possibly subjected to side chain modification/cleavage so that the tritium of the substrate has been converted into a form which is volatile. The isolation and chemical characterization of 1,25(OH)2-23-oxo-D3 and 1,25,26(OH)3-23-oxo-D3 from homogenates of chick intestinal mucosa has recently been described (Ohnuma, N., Kruse, J., Popjak, G., and Norman, A.

The activity of the C-23 pathway in homogenates of chick intestinal mucosa can be enhanced 10 x by prior priming of the birds with a single intravenous dose of 500 ng (1.3 nmol) of 1,25(OH)2D3; the induction of the enzyme activity is maximal by 3-6 h and returns to basal levels by 12 h. A comparison was made in chick and rat intestinal homogenates of this C-23 pathway and the previously known C-24 oxidation pathway, which converts 1,25(OH)2D3 into 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,24,25(OH)3D3); it was calculated that under these conditions 72% of the 1,25(OH)2D3 was metabolized by the C-23 oxidation pathway, 13% by the C-24 pathway, and only 14% by other as yet unspecified pathways. It is proposed that the newly discovered C-23 pathway for metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3 by the target intestinal mucosa and kidney may play a prominent role under physiological conditions of controlling the tissue levels of this hormonally active form of vitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W1543725850,"Initiation factor eIF-3 has been isolated from the 120 mM KCl postribosomal supernatant of wheat germ by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose. Glycerol gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions indicate that the eIF-3 prepared in this manner is at least 85% pure. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate shows that the wheat germ eIF-3 contains 11 polypeptides, ranging in molecular weight from about 25,000 to 120,000. Eight of the polypeptides are present in equimolar amounts; two of the polypeptides are present at molar ratios of about 0.5; and one is present at a molar ratio of about 0.3. The highly purified wheat germ eIF-3 does not prevent the association of wheat germ 40S and 60 S ribosomal subunits to a significant extent. Wheat germ eIF-3 does not increase appreciably the ability of eIF-2 to form a ternary complex with Met-tRNAf and GTP. It does, however, enhance the binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the presence of eIF-2 and GTP."
https://openalex.org/W102662741,"A synthetic heptadecapeptide corresponding to part of the NH2-terminal 17 residues of chicken gizzard myosin light chain (Mr = 20,000), Ser-Ser-Lys-Thr-Thr-Lys-Arg-Pro-Gln-Arg-Ala-Thr-Ser-(P)-Asn-Val-Phe-Ser-NH2, was readily phosphorylated by the myosin light chain kinase isolated from the same tissue. The synthetic peptide was phosphorylated stoichiometrically at serine 13, the same residue phosphorylated in the parent protein. The apparent Km and Vmax for peptide phosphorylation was 90 microM and 1.3 mumol min-1 mg-1 compared to 10 microM and 22 mumol min-1 mg-1, respectively, for the myosin light chain. The synthetic heptadecapeptide acted as a competitive inhibitor for myosin light chain phosphorylation with Ki approximately 600 microM. Acetylation of the heptadecapeptide alpha-amino group of serine 1 had little effect on Vmax (0.8 mumol min-1 mg-1) and increased the apparent Km 2-fold. The smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase did not phosphorylate the synthetic heptadecapeptide analog of the corresponding skeletal muscle myosin light chain (Mr = 18,500), nor did it phosphorylate synthetic peptide substrates specific for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase or phosphorylase b kinase. These findings support the idea that the myosin light chain kinase has particular protein substrate specificity requirements and that some of these are derived from the region of primary structure around the phosphorylation site in its native substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1510568613,"Isoacceptors of rabbit liver tRNALys which preferentially translate the codon AAG were compared for their function in several aspects of translation. As shown in other laboratories, Lys-tRNALys1,2 are two isoacceptors which differ from each other by a single base pair and are fully modified with N6-threonyl-adenosine adjacent to the anticodon. Lys-tRNALys4, which occurs commonly in rapidly dividing mammalian cells and tissues, is hypomodified at several bases and contains a precursor of N6-threonyl-adenosine next to its anticodon. These isoacceptors were incubated in cell-free protein synthesizing systems which contain rabbit globin mRNA. (Lys-tRNALys3 which translates AAA was also included.) The resulting globin was isolated and digested with trypsin, and the relative incorporation of lysine from Lys-tRNALys1,2 and from Lys-tRNALys4 into lysine-containing sites in the globin peptides as determined. Lys-tRNALys1,2 and Lys-tRNALys4 translate AAG preferentially, but Lys-tRNALys4 wobbles more than the former and translates AAA codons more efficiently. Overall, Lys-tRNALys1,2 is preferred in globin synthesis by about 30% compared to Lys-tRNALys4, and with one exception, the incorporation of lysine into the individual AAG lysine-containing sites in globin occurs more efficiently from Lys-tRNALys1,2. There is, however, considerable variation from site to site in the relative efficiencies of the Lys-tRNAs in incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1536856539,"The gene for spinach chloroplast tRNAThr3 has been sequenced and is co-linear with the tRNA, does not contain an intervening sequence, and does not code for the 3'-terminal CCA, which is added post-transcriptionally. This gene shares features with prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and mitochondrial tRNA genes. The opposite strand of the tRNA gene contains a proper ribosome binding site, homology to a classical bacterial promoter, and could potentially code for a small peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1560071417,"In the pregnant rat, the yolk sac, which possesses true placental functions, is a vitamin D target organ. We tested its ability to hydroxylate 25-hydroxy- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OHD3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3). 24,25-Dihydroxy- and 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3 were produced by rat yolk sac homogenates incubated with tritiated 25-OHD3 and 1,25-(OH)2D3. Rat yolk sac homogenates also formed small amounts of 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These newly synthesized metabolites were isolated and identified by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, and periodate cleavage. Yolk sac 25-OHD3- and 1,25-(OH)2D3-24-hydroxylases were present in mitochondria and were of a mixed function oxidase nature. They were detected in the yolk sac as early as day 12 in the embryonic period and until the end of gestation. No hydroxylation occurred in maternal liver, amnion, fetal brain, or skin homogenates. Both 24-hydroxylases were detected in pure isolated rat yolk sac endodermal cells. This may be of physiological importance, since they are the 1,25-(OH)2D3 target cells in the yolk sac. Injection of 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3 into rat yolk sac vitelline veins strongly suggested that the yolk sac vitelline veins strongly suggested that the yolk sac produced 1,24,25-(OH)3D3 in vivo. We conclude that the yolk sac and more precisely its endodermal cells may help to control vitamin D metabolism within the fetoplacental unit."
https://openalex.org/W1943315623,"Abstract We have documented previously that although the phosphorylation of the beta subunit of cardiac phosphorylase kinase plays a major role in activation of the enzyme, enzyme activity is also modulated by either cAMP-dependent or cAMP-independent phosphorylation of the alpha' subunit (Sul, H. S., Cooper R. H., Whitehouse S., and Walsh D. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3484-3490). This paper reports that deactivation of 32P-labeled cardiac phosphorylase kinase by protein phosphatase occurs concomitantly with the dephosphorylation of either the alpha' or beta subunits. However, enzyme activation attributable to alpha' subunit phosphorylation is still apparent after dephosphorylation of the beta subunit and, similarly, that caused by beta subunit phosphorylation is maintained after alpha' subunit dephosphorylation. These data support out previously stated conclusion that both alpha' and beta subunit phosphorylation regulates the activity of cardiac phosphorylase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1508549130,"The synthesis of vitamin D-binding proteins in rat was examined using liver and kidney slices, isolated hepatocytes, and isolated renal tubules. Rat liver synthesized both serum vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and a tissue DBP-binding component and secreted serum DBP. Rat kidney also synthesized a tissue DBP-binding component and cytosol vitamin D-binding protein (CDBP) which was immunologically related to serum DBP, but secretion of renal CDBP was not observed. Renal CDBP had a higher molecular weight (approximately 65,000) than that of serum DBP (54,000) and was heat-labile, while serum DBP was heat-stable (60 degrees C, 60 min). Renal CDBP was considered to exist in cytosol, forming a complex with a tissue DBP-binding component. These results indicate that liver is a site of synthesis of serum DBP and that CDBP, which is immunologically related to but physicochemically different from serum DBP, is synthesized in situ in kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1581060680,"Met-tRNAf deacylase from reticulocyte ribosomes has been purified to homogeneity. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the homogeneous preparation gives a single protein band corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 67,000. Purified Met-tRNAf deacylase degrades free Met-tRNAf and also Met-tRNAf bound to 40 S ribosomes in the presence of AUG codon but does not degrade Met-tRNAf in the ternary complex, Met-tRNAf.eIF-2.GTP. Purified Met-tRNAf deacylase does not inhibit protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates at any concentration tested indicating that Met-tRNAf deacylase is not a protein synthesis inhibitor. Antibodies against Met-tRNAf deacylase have been prepared by immunizing a chicken with homogeneous preparation of Met-tRNAf deacylase. Addition of anti-Met-tRNAf deacylase does not have any effect on protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysates indicating that Met-tRNAf deacylase is not required for protein synthesis."
