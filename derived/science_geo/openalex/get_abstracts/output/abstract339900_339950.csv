https://openalex.org/W2023778871,"A corrected radiocarbon age of 11,050 +/- 14 years before present for an advance of the Franz Josef Glacier to the Waiho Loop terminal moraine on the western flank of New Zealand's Southern Alps shows that glacier advance on a South Pacific island was synchronous with initiation of the Younger Dryas in the North Atlantic region. Hence, cooling at the beginning of the Younger Dryas probably reflects global rather than regional forcing. The source for Younger Dryas climatic cooling may thus lie in the atmosphere rather than in a North Atlantic thermohaline switch."
https://openalex.org/W2086729818,"Currently a controversy is raging as to which of three competing methodologies of biological classification is the best: phenetics, cladistics, or evolutionary classification. The merits and seeming deficiencies of the three approaches are analyzed. Since classifying is a multiple-step procedure, it is suggested that the best components of the three methods be used at each step. By such a synthetic approach, classifications can be constructed that are equally suited as the basis of generalizations and as an index to information storage and retrieval systems."

Here, approaches are outlined for manipulating and accessing texts in arbitrary subject areas in accordance with user needs. In particular, methods are given for determining text themes, traversing texts selectively, and extracting summary statements that reflect text content."
https://openalex.org/W2038776743,"Sound production by male wolf spiders during courtship is critical for behavioral reproductive isolation of two sibling species. Females only respond to and copulate with conspecific males, and acoustic signals through a substrate are necessary to induce receptivity. No reproductive barriers that could arise during mating (such as genital or mechanical incompatibility) or after mating (infertility) are in effect between the species, since forced interspecific matings produce viable offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2071905616,"The extent of Antarctic pack ice in the summer, as charted from satellite imagery, decreased by 2.5 million square kilometers between 1973 and 1980. The U.S. Navy and Russian atlases and whaling and research ship reports from the 1930's indicate that summer ice conditions earlier in this century were heavier than the current average. Surface air temperatures along the seasonally shifting belt of melting snow between 55 degrees and 80 degrees N during spring and summer were higher in 1974 to 1978 than in 1934 to 1938. The observed departures in the two hemispheres qualitatively agree with the predicted impact of an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, since it is not known to, what extent the changes in snow and ice cover and in temperature can be explained by the natural variability of the climate system or by other processes unrelated to carbon dioxide, a cause-and-effect relation cannot yet be established."
https://openalex.org/W2082131996,"The abundances of siderophile elements in the Earth's silicate mantle are too high for the mantle to have been in equilibrium with iron in the core if equilibrium occurred at low pressures and temperatures. It has been proposed that this problem may be solved if equilibrium occurred at high pressures and temperatures. Experimental determination of the distribution of siderophile elements between liquid metal and liquid silicate at 100 kilobar and 2000 degrees C demonstrates that it is unlikely that siderophile element abundances were established by simple metal-silicate equilibrium, which indicates that the segregation of the core from the mantle was a complex process."
https://openalex.org/W2038371064,"Foraminiferal communities in the Cenozoic shelf deposits of the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain exhibit little unity during almost 55 million years of successive transgressions and regressions. Transgression communities are composed of a dynamic mixture of immigrants and newly evolved species. During regressions, species within these communities either became extinct or emigrated. Some emigrants returned during subsequent transgressions, but many did not. The neritic species of the Atlantic and Gulf continental margins constitute a species pool. Immigrants and emigrants transferred into and out of the species pool, while extinctions and originations repeatedly altered its species composition. While the results indicate a lack of local community unity, at the same time they demonstrate the necessity of a species pool to sustain species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2135965153,Upwelling in the Costa Rica Dome is seasonal and the result of the localized cyclonic wind stress curl. Fluctuations in the wind stress curl in the fall release the upwelled region as a Rossby wave. Similar low-latitude domes are hypothesized to be ubiquitous to those oceans where a localized cyclonic wind stress curl is associated with an Intertropical Convergence Zone.

https://openalex.org/W2044293228,"X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to probe the chemical and structural environment of vanadium in coal. It was found that vanadium exists in at least two environments, in both of which it was coordinated to oxygens. There was no evidence of vanadium in nitrogen (porphyrin) or sulfide environments. It was also found that the vanadium environments in the raw coal did not survive unchanged in a liquefaction process. These findings have implications for coal cleaning processes and for trace element release into the liquefaction process stream."
https://openalex.org/W1967010584,"Recent studies have implied that (Mg, Fe)SiO(3)-perovskite, a likely dominant mineral phase in the lower mantle, may have a high melting temperature. The implications of these findings for the dynamics of the lower mantle were investigated with the use of numerical convection models. The results showed that low homologous temperatures (0.3 to 0.5) would prevail in the modeled lower mantle, regardless of the effective Rayleigh number and internal heating rates. High-temperature ductile creep is possible under relatively cold conditions. In models with low rates of internal heating, local maxima of viscosity developed in the mid-lower mantle that were similar to those obtained from inversion of geoid, topography, and plate velocities."
https://openalex.org/W2046779568,"Hemocyanin in the whole blood of the hydrothermal vent brachyuran crab, Bythograea thermydron, has a moderate oxygen affinity (P50 = 6.6 millimeters of mercury at 2.6°C; pH 7.5), which unlike that of other hemocyanins is independent of temperature over the range 2° to 30°C; carbon dioxide and pH have independent effects on the oxygen affinity of this pigment. The pH effect on affinity is moderate (Δlog P50/ΔpH = –0.34), whereas increased carbon dioxide, which can act both directly and by changing pH, has a much larger effect (Δlog P50/ΔpH = –0.81). This blood has a moderately high degree of cooperativity (Hill cooperativity coefficient, n, was 2.8) and a large oxygen-carrying capacity for a crustacean (4.5 milliliters of oxygen per 100 milliliters of blood). These properties characterize an oxygen transport system whose function appears to be largely independent of the wide range of environmental conditions encountered around the vents."

https://openalex.org/W2159619964,"The Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s right to operate a nuclear power plant at California's Diablo Canyon has been contested for eight years at 36 federal and four state hearings, three licensing appeals, and two congressional inquiries. The utility announced that design errors in the structural supports were discovered just as the plant appeared ready for operation. Corrections will be technically straightforward, but the political and legal ramifications may cause further delays by supporting the claims of environmental groups that the plant cannot withstand an earthquake. A review of the debate indicates that the developing field of seismic engineering is still imprecise because the theoretical bases remain untested. (DCK)"
