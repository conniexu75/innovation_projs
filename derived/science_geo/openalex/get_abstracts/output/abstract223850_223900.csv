The blood is unique in our experience, and in the literature, in that it has the antigen D, but lacks any detectable representative of the C and E allelomorphic series of antigens."

They may be separated, identified and estimated by means of partition chromatography using silica gel columns. The whole range from acetic to capric acids, inclusive, may be separated in this way; but this involves the use of more than one solvent1,2 (that is, separation in stages) or buffered columns3, and several titrations."

https://openalex.org/W2050974459,"VARIOUS methods for the estimation of pectin-esterase and polygalacturonase have been used1,2; but for rapid examination of cultures of micro-fungi, a modification of the ‘cup-plate’ diffusion method is useful. The polygalacturonase assay is carried out on a medium containing 1.5 per cent agar and 1 per cent sodium pectate at pH 5.0; and after incubation at 37° C. for 18 hr., the plates are sprayed with acid, when the enzyme activity is revealed as clear circular zones on an opalescent background. For the pectin-esterase assay, buffer-free agar containing 1 per cent purified pectin and methyl red adjusted to pH 6.0 is used, and the activity is indicated as red zones on a yellow background, due to the lowering of the pH by demethylation of the pectin. With each enzyme there is a linear relationship between the diameter of the zone and the logarithm of the enzyme concentration. Other enzymes (amylase, cellulase, xylanase, arabanase) may be determined similarly3, and the activities calculated by the usual method4,5."
https://openalex.org/W2035448579,"AS is well known, the hydrogen molecule (H2) has no ordinary dipole infra-red spectrum. Its quadrupole rotation-vibration spectrum is exceedingly weak, and has only recently been found1. In the case of HD, on account of the asymmetry, there is no longer a distinction between symmetric and antisymmetric rotational levels, and a dipole rotation-vibration spectrum can occur at least in principle. However, the change of dipole moment associated with the vibration of HD is obviously very small. The main contribution to this change is due to the fact that the electrons lag slightly behind the nuclei during the vibrational motion. Wick2 has calculated according to wave mechanics the intensity of the fundamental of HD. From his data it can be estimated that the minimum absorbing path required for an observation of the fundamental of HD is 30 m. atm. For the overtones, correspondingly longer pathlengths would be required."

One of these, thiourea, is shown below to reduce the mortality following whole-body irradiation of mice. We also tried a few other substances, selected, like thiourea, in the hope that they would enter cells without being too toxic or too rapidly metabolized, and would protect by competing for hydroxyl radicals. The effect of sodium ethane-dithiophosphonate is of added interest because sodium ethane-monothiophosphonate protects weakly against the radiomimetic substance bis-chlorethyl sulphide (mustard gas)2."

https://openalex.org/W2106570362,"STICKY traps in the form of vertical cylinders, and vertical or horizontal plates, are widely used to estimate the numbers of air-borne particles such as pollen, fungus spores, fungicides and insecticides. Although a knowledge of factors controlling deposition is a prerequisite for interpreting trap catches, the relation between the numbers deposited and their concentration in the air sweeping the surface has had scant attention. The problem has been studied here in connexion with epidemic crop diseases, and it has been shown that the size of the trap itself affects the catch to an extent greater than generally recognized."

https://openalex.org/W1984939891,"IT is generally thought that the very large forces which isolated muscles can develop when excited electrically would produce movements so violent as to endanger tendons and bones if they were available in voluntary contractions in normal life. Our strength is kept within bounds by the inability of the higher centres to activate the muscles to the full. In a prolonged effort, this limited capacity to drive anterior horn cells by an effort of will is the part of the neuromuscular apparatus most subject to fatigue, so that the observed falling off in performance is due to an even less complete nervous activation of the muscle fibres rather than to failure of the contractile mechanism itself1,2."

https://openalex.org/W2411625505,"CERTAIN strains of Paramecium, known as ‘killers’, contain in their cytoplasm particles, called ‘kappa particles’1, which are Feulgen-positive, and stain with Giemsa after acid hydrolysis2. Killers liberate into the culture medium a substance lethal to Paramecium not containing kappa particles, known as ‘sensitives’. Kappa particles have many of the properties of cytoplasmic genes3, but their size (0.2–0.5 µ in length), and their staining reactions, suggest that they may be parasitic micro-organisms3–5 such as the rickettsiæ, viruses of the psittacosislymphogranuloma group, or even small bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2081158480,"THE methionine content of cereals and legumes widely used in India has been measured. Determinations were made with a Lumetron photo-electric colorimeter using the sodium nitroprusside method of McCarthy and Sullivan1 as modified by Csonka and Denton2, and further modified by us3. The values shown in the accompanying table give the mean of at least two determinations. It is seen that the vetch pea is very poor in methionine content. The relationship between this very low methionine content of the vetch pea and lathyrism has been discussed elsewhere. There is evidence to support our view that lathyrism is due to absolute methionine deficiency, aided by some toxic substance which further brings about a disturbance in methionine metabolism. It is also apparent that the low nutritive value of lentil protein is due not to cystine deficiency but to methionine deficiency. The better quality of rice protein is due, at least in part, to the much higher methionine content of the former. Further investigation is in progress."

From June 1949 until April 1950, more than a thousand cases were observed in a narrowly limited district—the plain of the Sharon. Some cases were very severe, showing hæmaturia, oliguria, azotæmia, jaundice, meningitis and episcleral injection; the death-rate was 2 per cent. Most of the sera of the patients agglutinated Leptospira grippo-typhosa and Leptospira bovis, the titres ranging from 1 : 200 to 1 : 20,000."
https://openalex.org/W1981555426,"A RELATIONSHIP has been shown between metabolic activity and the severity of lesions produced by feeding rats a diet low in choline and its precursors1. Cortisone (11-dehydro-17 hydroxycorticosterone acetate) is known to influence many metabolic processes2, and it seemed possible that it might modify the effects of acute choline deficiency in weanling rats. Experiments have been carried out to study this possibility."

A number of preparations have been described by high-temperature sintering1–3, pneumatolytic4, or pyrolytic5 methods, and at lower temperatures by the hydrothermal procedure6–8, the usual range of temperatures lying between 300° and 1,000° C. The lowest temperature previously recorded for such a synthesis has been 245° C. in the case of Gruner's formation of potash feldspar, by hydrothermal alteration of montmorillonite9. The reaction at this temperature was, however, very slow and required about six weeks."
https://openalex.org/W1967820973,"ONE of the most important vectors of malaria in India, and the only vector so far reported in Ceylon, is A. culicifacies. Afridi and Puri1 reviewed the available literature relating to this species in India. Covell2 lists the countries where this mosquito has been found, its breeding places, adult habits and relation to malaria. In India, this is reported to be a domestic species. James and Gunasekera3 were the first to find this species infected in Nature in Ceylon. Carter and Jacocks4 confirmed these findings. During the various regional epidemics that occurred in Ceylon during and since 1934, this was the only anopheline species found infected with malarial parasites. According to Carter (unpublished reports), A. culicifacies in Ceylon is domestic in its habits and has been captured in dwellings and in human-baited traps. It breeds profusely in the sand pools and rock pools in the beds of streams and rivers. The breeding places so far described were in the close vicinity of human habitations."

It has also been prepared by heating hydroanisoin with dilute sulphuric acid4 (the product reported by this method had a melting point of 95°, which would be 15° lower than that of pure deoxyanisoin), or with a mixture of hydrochloric and acetic acids2. Hydroanisoin itself is obtained by electrolytic reduction of anisaldehyde in alkaline solution using nickel, platinum5,6 or copper7 as cathodes, or by the action of sodium amalgam on an ethereal solution of anisoin3, or catalytic reduction of anisil or anisoin using platinum oxide2."

https://openalex.org/W1988370938,"NUMEROUS attempts to achieve a photo-sensitized reduction of carbon dioxide by water in vitro are on record1. Various degrees of success have been claimed; but in almost every case the repetition of such experiments in other laboratories has failed and, in any event, the yields originally reported were extremely small. A significant advance, however, appeared to have been made in 1943 by Baur and his co-workers2. After many years of experimentation, Baur developed a two-phase system consisting of glycerol, geraniol, chlorophyll and methylene blue, which on illumination in a carbon dioxide atmosphere was stated to produce formaldehyde and oxygen in a photochemical yield amounting to about 5 per cent of that of natural photosynthesis. Although it is now known that formaldehyde is not an intermediate in natural photosynthesis, the realization of a photosensitized hydrogen-transfer reaction between carbon dioxide and water outside the living cell would be a result of great significance, and a confirmation of Baur's results, which have been widely quoted, therefore appeared desirable."
