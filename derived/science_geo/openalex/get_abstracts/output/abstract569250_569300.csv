https://openalex.org/W2521169042,"The assembly and analysis of complete genomes and large genomic fragments have tripled the number of known ocean viruses and uncovered the potentially important roles they play in nitrogen and sulfur cycling. Ocean viruses profoundly impact microbial community composition and metabolic activity in the oceans, thereby affecting global-scale biogeochemical cycling. Owing to sampling and cultivation challenges, viral diversity remains poorly described at the genome level, such that less than one per cent of observed surface-ocean viruses are 'known'. Information on viruses of the deep ocean is particularly scarce. Here, Matthew Sullivan and colleagues report the assembly of complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both surface- and deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina research expeditions. The resulting Global Oceans Viromes dataset roughly triples known ocean viral populations and doubles known candidate bacterial and archaeal viral genera. Using this global map, the study predicts viral hosts and identifies viral auxiliary metabolic genes, most of which were previously unknown. Ocean microbes drive biogeochemical cycling on a global scale1. However, this cycling is constrained by viruses that affect community composition, metabolic activity, and evolutionary trajectories2,3. Owing to challenges with the sampling and cultivation of viruses, genome-level viral diversity remains poorly described and grossly understudied, with less than 1% of observed surface-ocean viruses known4. Here we assemble complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both surface- and deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina research expeditions5,6, and analyse the resulting ‘global ocean virome’ dataset to present a global map of abundant, double-stranded DNA viruses complete with genomic and ecological contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic viral populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters (defined as approximately genus-level groups7,8). This roughly triples the number of known ocean viral populations4 and doubles the number of candidate bacterial and archaeal virus genera8, providing a near-complete sampling of epipelagic communities at both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of the 867 viral clusters were locally or globally abundant, together accounting for nearly half of the viral populations in any global ocean virome sample. While two-thirds of these clusters represent newly described viruses lacking any cultivated representative, most could be computationally linked to dominant, ecologically relevant microbial hosts. Moreover, we identified 243 viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes, of which only 95 were previously known. Deeper analyses of four of these auxiliary metabolic genes (dsrC, soxYZ, P-II (also known as glnB) and amoC) revealed that abundant viruses may directly manipulate sulfur and nitrogen cycling throughout the epipelagic ocean. This viral catalog and functional analyses provide a necessary foundation for the meaningful integration of viruses into ecosystem models where they act as key players in nutrient cycling and trophic networks."

https://openalex.org/W2522145673,"In Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane transporters import nutrients by coupling to an inner membrane protein complex called the Ton complex. The Ton complex consists of TonB, ExbB, and ExbD, and uses the proton motive force at the inner membrane to transduce energy to the outer membrane via TonB. Here, we structurally characterize the Ton complex from Escherichia coli using X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, and crosslinking. Our results reveal a stoichiometry consisting of a pentamer of ExbB, a dimer of ExbD, and at least one TonB. Electrophysiology studies show that the Ton subcomplex forms pH-sensitive cation-selective channels and provide insight into the mechanism by which it may harness the proton motive force to produce energy."
https://openalex.org/W2523415988,"Disease-associated malnutrition has been identified as a prevalent condition, particularly for the elderly, which has often been overlooked in the U.S. healthcare system. The state-level burden of community-based disease-associated malnutrition is unknown and there have been limited efforts by state policy makers to identify, quantify, and address malnutrition. The objective of this study was to examine and quantify the state-level economic burden of disease-associated malnutrition.Direct medical costs of disease-associated malnutrition were calculated for 8 diseases: Stroke, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Coronary Heart Failure, Breast Cancer, Dementia, Musculoskeletal Disorders, Depression, and Colorectal Cancer. National disease and malnutrition prevalence rates were estimated for subgroups defined by age, race, and sex using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. State prevalence of disease-associated malnutrition was estimated by combining national prevalence estimates with states' demographic data from the U.S. Census. Direct medical cost for each state was estimated as the increased expenditures incurred as a result of malnutrition.Direct medical costs attributable to disease-associated malnutrition vary among states from an annual cost of $36 per capita in Utah to $65 per capita in Washington, D.C. Nationally the annual cost of disease-associated malnutrition is over $15.5 billion. The elderly bear a disproportionate share of this cost on both the state and national level.Additional action is needed to reduce the economic impact of disease-associated malnutrition, particularly at the state level. Nutrition may be a cost-effective way to help address high health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W2523479896,"Testosterone products are recommended by some prescribers in response to a diagnosis or presumption of ""low testosterone"" (low-T) for cardiovascular health, sexual function, muscle weakness or wasting, mood and behavior, and cognition. We performed a systematic review of 156 eligible randomized controlled trials in which testosterone was compared to placebo for one or more of these conditions. We included studies in bibliographic databases between January 1, 1950 and April 9, 2016, and excluded studies involving bodybuilding, contraceptive effectiveness, or treatment of any condition in women or children. Studies with multiple relevant endpoints were included in all relevant tables. Testosterone supplementation did not show consistent benefit for cardiovascular risk, sexual function, mood and behavior, or cognition. Studies that examined clinical cardiovascular endpoints have not favored testosterone therapy over placebo. Testosterone is ineffective in treating erectile dysfunction and controlled trials did not show a consistent effect on libido. Testosterone supplementation consistently increased muscle strength but did not have beneficial effects on physical function. Most studies on mood-related endpoints found no beneficial effect of testosterone treatment on personality, psychological well-being, or mood. The prescription of testosterone supplementation for low-T for cardiovascular health, sexual function, physical function, mood, or cognitive function is without support from randomized clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2522582617,"Melanogenesis is a process responsible for melanin production, which is stored in melanocytes containing tyrosinase. Inhibition of this enzyme is a target in the cosmetics industry, since it controls undesirable skin conditions such as hyperpigmentation due to the overproduction of melanin. Species of the Morus genus are known for the beneficial uses offered in different parts of its plants, including tyrosinase inhibition. Thus, this project aimed to study the inhibitory activity of tyrosinase by extracts from Morus nigra leaves as well as the characterization of its chromatographic profile and cytotoxicity in order to become a new therapeutic option from a natural source. M. nigra leaves were collected, pulverized, equally divided into five batches and the standardized extract was obtained by passive maceration. There was no significant difference between batches for total solids content, yield and moisture content, which shows good reproducibility of the extraction process. Tyrosinase enzymatic activity was determined for each batch, providing the percentage of enzyme inhibition and IC50 values obtained by constructing dose-response curves and compared to kojic acid, a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor. High inhibition of tyrosinase activity was observed (above 90% at 15.625 μg/mL). The obtained IC50 values ranged from 5.00 μg/mL ± 0.23 to 8.49 μg/mL ± 0.59 and were compared to kojic acid (3.37 μg/mL ± 0.65). High Performance Liquid Chromatography analysis revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid, rutin and, its major compound, isoquercitrin. The chromatographic method employed was validated according to ICH guidelines and the extract was standardized using these polyphenols as markers. Cytotoxicity, assessed by MTT assay, was not observed on murine melanomas, human keratinocytes and mouse fibroblasts in tyrosinase IC50 values. This study demonstrated the potential of M. nigra leaf extract as a promising whitening agent of natural source against skin hyperpigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2523553191,"An extensive series of 44 radiocarbon (14C) and 37 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages have been obtained from the site of Riwi, south central Kimberley (NW Australia). As one of the earliest known Pleistocene sites in Australia, with archaeologically sterile sediment beneath deposits containing occupation, the chronology of the site is important in renewed debates surrounding the colonization of Sahul. Charcoal is preserved throughout the sequence and within multiple discrete hearth features. Prior to 14C dating, charcoal has been pretreated with both acid-base-acid (ABA) and acid base oxidation-stepped combustion (ABOx-SC) methods at multiple laboratories. Ages are consistent between laboratories and also between the two pretreatment methods, suggesting that contamination is easily removed from charcoal at Riwi and the Pleistocene ages are likely to be accurate. Whilst some charcoal samples recovered from outside hearth features are identified as outliers within a Bayesian model, all ages on charcoal within hearth features are consistent with stratigraphy. OSL dating has been undertaken using single quartz grains from the sandy matrix. The majority of samples show De distributions that are well-bleached but that also include evidence for mixing as a result of post-depositional bioturbation of the sediment. The results of the two techniques are compared and evaluated within a Bayesian model. Consistency between the two methods is good, and we demonstrate human occupation at this site from 46.4–44.6 cal kBP (95.4% probability range). Importantly, the lowest archaeological horizon at Riwi is underlain by sterile sediments which have been dated by OSL making it possible to demonstrate the absence of human occupation for between 0.9–5.2 ka (68.2% probability range) prior to occupation."
https://openalex.org/W2522717087,"The domestic cat (Felis catus) is an invasive exotic in many locations around the world and is thought to be a key factor driving recent mammal declines across northern Australia. Many mammal species native to this region now persist only in areas with high topographic complexity, provided by features such as gorges or escarpments. Do mammals persist in these habitats because cats occupy them less, or despite high cat occupancy? We show that occupancy of feral cats was lower in mammal-rich habitats of high topographic complexity. These results support the idea that predation pressure by feral cats is a factor contributing to the collapse of mammal communities across northern Australia. Managing impacts of feral cats is a global conservation challenge. Conservation actions such as choosing sites for small mammal reintroductions may be more successful if variation in cat occupancy with landscape features is taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2521108230,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) oxidizes fatty acids for thermogenesis and could therefore be considered as part of a new strategy in combating obesity and associated metabolic diseases. It is well established that aging is accompanied by a decline of brown adipocyte regenerative capacity. How aging contributes to this loss is poorly understood. Here, we identify a long noncoding RNA, uc.417, which is transcribed from an ultraconserved region in rodents. Expression of uc.417 increases with age. Ectopic expression of uc.417 impairs adipogenesis and the thermogenic program in brown adipocytes. However, uc.417 is not required for brown fat function. In vivo, uc.417 attenuates the cold-induced thermogenic programin mouse BAT. Moreover, we find that uc.417 moderately inhibits phosphorylation of p38MAPK without affecting the total protein level of p38MAPK. The p38MAPK pathway is essential for activating BAT to stimulate uncoupling protein 1 gene expression. The data point to uc.417 as being an important factor in an age-dependent loss of function of brown adipose tissue.—Cui, X., You, L., Li, Y., Zhu, L., Zhang, F., Xie, K., Cao, Y., Ji, C., Guo, X.

https://openalex.org/W2522417081,"Objectives The objective of this article was to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of the two most prominent types of case management in the Netherlands (intensive case management and linkage models) against no access to case management (control group) for people with already diagnosed dementia and their informal caregivers. Methods The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective embedded within a two year prospective, observational, controlled, cohort study with 521 informal caregivers and community-dwelling persons with dementia. Case management provided within one care organization (intensive case management model, ICMM), case management where care was provided by different care organizations within one region (Linkage model, LM), and a group with no access to case management (control) were compared. The economic evaluation related incremental costs to incremental effects regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), psychological health of the informal caregiver (GHQ-12), and quality adjusted life years (QALY) of the person with dementia and informal caregiver. Results Inverse-propensity-score-weighted models showed no significant differences in clinical or total cost outcomes between the three groups. Informal care costs were significantly lower in the ICMM group compared to both other groups. Day center costs were significantly lower in the ICMM group compared to the control group. For all outcomes, the probability that the ICMM was cost-effective in comparison with LM and the control group was larger than 0.97 at a threshold ratio of 0 €/incremental unit of effect. Conclusion This study provides preliminary evidence that the ICMM is cost-effective compared to the control group and the LM. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution since this study was not a randomized controlled trial."

However, for classification to be useful in practice, a reliable algorithm that can be successfully trained on small datasets is necessary. In this work, we consider seven different classification algorithms with the goal of finding a robust classifier that can be successfully trained on small datasets. We found good classification performance (accuracy > 0.83 and F1-score > 0.84) using the Optimum Path Forest classifier. Dataset and algorithms are made publicly available."
https://openalex.org/W2523163650,"A three-dimensional and almost complete pterosaur mandible from the Crato Formation (Early Cretaceous of Northeastern Brazil), Araripe Basin, is described as a new species of a tapejarine tapejarid. Tapejarines are a particular group of toothless pterosaurs, characterized by well-developed cranial crests, downturned rostra, and have been proposed to represent frugivorous flying reptiles. Though comparatively well represented and distributed, the evolutionary history of the group is still poorly known, and the internal relationships of its members are not well understood. The new species here reported, named Aymberedactylus cearensis gen. et sp. nov., adds new data concerning the evolution of the group, concerning their morphology and geographical origin. It differs from known tapejarids due to its unusually elongate retroarticular process and a shallow fossa on the splenial exhibiting distinctive rugose texture. Furthermore, it exhibits a suite of basal and derived conditions within the Tapejaridae, demonstrating how their morphological traits probably evolved and that these forms were even more diverse than already acknowledged. The discovery of Aymberedactylus cearensis sheds new light on the evolutionary history of the Tapejarinae."
https://openalex.org/W2521187729,"The role of urinary retinol-binding protein (RBP) as a biomarker of CKD in proximal tubular diseases, glomerulopathies and in transplantation is well established. However, whether urinary RBP is also a biomarker of renal damage and CKD progression in general CKD is not known. In this study, we evaluated the association of urinary RBP with renal function and cardiovascular risk factors in the baseline data of the Progredir Study, a CKD cohort in Sao Paulo, Brazil, comprising 454 participants with stages 3 and 4 CKD. In univariate analysis, urinary RBP was inversely related to estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI eGFR) and several cardiovascular risk factors. After adjustments, however, only CKD-EPI eGFR, albuminuria, systolic blood pressure, anemia, acidosis, and left atrium diameter remained significantly related to urinary RBP. The inverse relationship of eGFR to urinary RBP (β-0.02 ± 95CI -0.02; -0.01, p<0.0001 for adjusted model) remained in all strata of albuminuria, even after adjustments: in normoalbuminuria (β-0.008 ± 95CI (-0.02; -0.001, p = 0.03), in microalbuminuria (β-0.02 ± 95CI (-0.03; -0.02, p<0,0001) and in macroalbuminuria (β-0.02 ± 95CI (-0.03; -0.01, p<0,0001). Lastly, urinary RBP was able to significantly increase the accuracy of a logistic regression model (adjusted for sex, age, SBP, diabetes and albuminuria) in diagnosing eGFR<35 ml/min/1.73m2 (AUC 0,77, 95%CI 0,72-0,81 versus AUC 0,71, 95%CI 0,65-0,75, respectively; p = 0,05). Our results suggest that urinary RBP is significantly associated to renal function in CKD in general, a finding that expands the interest in this biomarker beyond the context of proximal tubulopathies, glomerulopathies or transplantation. Urinary RBP should be further explored as a predictive marker of CKD progression."

We addressed whether CCR2 deficiency resulted in sustained improvement of mdx5cv-Ccr22/2 diaphragm. Compared to mdx5cv controls, CCR2 deficiency in mdx5cv-Ccr22/2 mice markedly reduced intramuscular Ly6Chi MPs at all stages, but it reduced Ly6Clow MPs only at early stages (4 and 9 wk). CCR2 deficiency reduced quadriceps and diaphragm muscle damage and fibrosis at 14 wk but not at ± mo, and it improved diaphragm muscle regeneration and respiratory function at 14wk but not at 6 mo. IntramuscularMPs in mdx5cv-Ccr2−/− diaphragm expressed a low level of IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ genes, a similar level of TNF-α, TGF-β1, and platelet-derived growth factor a genes, and a high level of IGF-1 and osteopontin genes compared to mdx5cv controls. Diaphragm fibroblasts at 14 wk showed a similar cell number with a similar level of collagen and profibrogenic growth factor gene expression in mdx5cv-Ccr2−/− and mdx5cv mice. Diaphragm MPs from both mdx5cv-Ccr2−/− and mdx5cv mice stimulated collagen gene expression by cocultured fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2523441178,"Organizations should measure their information security performance if they wish to take the right decisions and develop it in line with their security needs. Since the measurement of information security is generally underdeveloped in practice and many organizations find the existing recommendations too complex, the paper presents a solution in the form of a 10 by 10 information security performance measurement model. The model—ISP 10×10M is composed of ten critical success factors, 100 key performance indicators and 6 performance levels. Its content was devised on the basis of findings presented in the current research studies and standards, while its structure results from an empirical research conducted among information security professionals from Slovenia. Results of the study show that a high level of information security performance is mostly dependent on measures aimed at managing information risks, employees and information sources, while formal and environmental factors have a lesser impact. Experts believe that information security should evolve systematically, where it’s recommended that beginning steps include technical, logical and physical security controls, while advanced activities should relate predominantly strategic management activities. By applying the proposed model, organizations are able to determine the actual level of information security performance based on the weighted indexing technique. In this manner they identify the measures they ought to develop in order to improve the current situation. The ISP 10×10M is a useful tool for conducting internal system evaluations and decision-making. It may also be applied to a larger sample of organizations in order to determine the general state-of-play for research purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2523515391,"Responding to a high-fat meal requires an interplay between multiple digestive tissues, sympathetic response pathways, and the gut microbiome. The epithelial enterocytes of the intestine are responsible for absorbing dietary nutrients and preparing them for circulation to distal tissues, which requires significant changes in cellular activity, including both morphological and transcriptional responses. Following a high-fat meal, we observe morphological changes in the enterocytes of larval zebrafish, including elongation of mitochondria, formation and expansion of lipid droplets, and the rapid and transient ruffling of the nuclear periphery. Dietary and pharmacological manipulation of zebrafish larvae demonstrated that these subcellular changes are specific to triglyceride absorption. The transcriptional changes that occur simultaneously with these morphological changes were determined using RNA sequencing, revealing a cohort of up-regulated genes associated with lipid droplet formation and lipid transport via lipoprotein particles. Using a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor to block β-lipoprotein particle formation, we demonstrate that the transcriptional response to a high-fat meal is associated with the transfer of ER triglyceride to nascent β-lipoproteins, possibly through the activation of Creb3l3/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein. These data suggest that a transient increase in ER lipids is the likely mediator of the initial physiological response of intestinal enterocytes to dietary lipid."
https://openalex.org/W2521258635,"Background and Objective Alterations of brain morphology in Crohn’s disease have been reported, but data is scarce and heterogenous and the possible impact of disease predisposition on brain development is unknown. Assuming a systemic course of the disease, brain involvement seems more probable in presence of extraintestinal manifestations, but this question has not yet been addressed. The present study examined the relationship between Crohn’s disease and brain structure and focused on the connection with extraintestinal manifestations and markers of brain development. Methods In a pilot study, brains of 15 patients with Crohn’s disease (of which 9 had a history of extraintestinal manifestations, i.e. arthritis, erythema nodosum and primary sclerosing cholangitis) were compared to matched healthy controls using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Patients and controls were tested for depression, fatigue and global cognitive function. Cortical thickness, surface area and folding were determined via cortical surface modeling. Results The overall group comparison (i.e. all patients vs. controls) yielded no significant results. In the patient subgroup with extraintestinal manifestations, changes in cortical area and folding, but not thickness, were identified: Patients showed elevated cortical surface area in the left middle frontal lobe (p<0.05) and hypergyrification in the left lingual gyrus (p<0.001) compared to healthy controls. Hypogyrification of the right insular cortex (p<0.05) and hypergyrification of the right anterior cingulate cortex (p<0.001) were detected in the subgroup comparison of patients with against without extraintestinal manifestations. P-values are corrected for multiple comparisons. Conclusions Our findings lend further support to the hypothesis that Crohn’s disease is associated with aberrant brain structure and preliminary support for the hypothesis that these changes are associated with a systemic course of the disease as indicated by extraintestinal manifestations. Changes in cortical surface area and folding suggest a possible involvement of Crohn’s disease or its predisposition during brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2521635256,"Background MicroRNAs, which are small regulatory RNAs, post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding 3'-UTR of their mRNA targets. Their deregulation has been shown to cause increased proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. miR-145, an important tumor supressor microRNA, has shown to be downregulated in many cancer types and has crucial roles in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, invasion, recurrence, and chemo-radioresistance. Our aim is to investigate potential common target genes of miR-145, and to help understanding the underlying molecular pathways of tumor pathogenesis in association with those common target genes. Methods Eight published microarray datasets, where targets of mir-145 were investigated in cell lines upon mir-145 over expression, were included into this study for meta-analysis. Inter group variabilities were assessed by box-plot analysis. Microarray datasets were analyzed using GEOquery package in Bioconducter 3.2 with R version 3.2.2 and two-way Hierarchical Clustering was used for gene expression data analysis. Results Meta-analysis of different GEO datasets showed that UNG, FUCA2, DERA, GMFB, TF, and SNX2 were commonly downregulated genes, whereas MYL9 and TAGLN were found to be commonly upregulated upon mir-145 over expression in prostate, breast, esophageal, bladder cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Biological process, molecular function, and pathway analysis of these potential targets of mir-145 through functional enrichments in PPI network demonstrated that those genes are significantly involved in telomere maintenance, DNA binding and repair mechanisms. Conclusion As a conclusion, our results indicated that mir-145, through targeting its common potential targets, may significantly contribute to tumor pathogenesis in distinct cancer types and might serve as an important target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2521838726,"The development of a physiologically plausible computational model of a neural controller that can realize a human-like biped stance is important for a large number of potential applications, such as assisting device development and designing robotic control systems. In this paper, we develop a computational model of a neural controller that can maintain a musculoskeletal model in a standing position, while incorporating a 120-ms neurological time delay. Unlike previous studies that have used an inverted pendulum model, a musculoskeletal model with seven joints and 70 muscular-tendon actuators is adopted to represent the human anatomy. Our proposed neural controller is composed of both feed-forward and feedback controls. The feed-forward control corresponds to the constant activation input necessary for the musculoskeletal model to maintain a standing posture. This compensates for gravity and regulates stiffness. The developed neural controller model can replicate two salient features of the human biped stance: (1) physiologically plausible muscle activations for quiet standing; and (2) selection of a low active stiffness for low energy consumption."

Med. 2005; 202: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TrkA is the high-affinity receptor for NGF, belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase family (8.Chao M.V.

U.S.A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). TrkA is a type I transmembrane protein, and newly made TrkA is translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and subsequently transported through the exocytic pathway to the plasma membrane, where it functions as a receptor for binding NGF and promoting NGF signal transduction (11.Martin-Zanca D.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our data show that PTP-MEG2 facilitates TrkA transport to the cell surface and, importantly, also down-regulates NGF/TrkA signal transduction by dephosphorylation of TrkA and reduces neurite outgrowth. Endogenous PTP-MEG2 was expressed at relatively low levels in PC12 cells and cortical neurons, as evidenced by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B), and, strikingly, exhibited strong accumulation at the neurite terminal inside the growth cone marked by actin staining, as shown by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). To facilitate functional characterization of PTP-MEG2 in NGF/TrkA activation and signal transduction, we overexpressed PTP-MEG2 and TrkA, respectively, via a lentivirus vector in PC12 cells and cortical neurons (Fig. 1B). Like endogenous PTP-MEG2, overexpressed WT and mutant PTP-MEG2 (CS) showed the same accumulation at the neurite terminal (Fig. 1C). The PTP-MEG2:C515S mutant lost phosphatase activity because of a Cys-to-Ser mutation at residue 515 and exhibited a dominant negative phenotype, possibly by competing with the endogenous protein for the membrane binding site (13.Wang X.

Interestingly, there were some differences between PC12 cells and cortical neurons in terms of TrkA maturation and PTP-MEG2 distribution. During biosynthesis, TrkA undergoes posttranslational modification to convert from a 110-kDa N-glycosylated precursor form to the 140-kDa mature form with further modification by sialylation (15.Jullien J. Guili V. Reichardt L.F. Rudkin B.B. Molecular kinetics of nerve growth factor receptor trafficking and activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38700-38708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In comparison with cortical neurons, PC12 cells showed higher levels of the precursor form at steady state (Fig. 1B). Cortical neurons showed PTP-MEG2 accumulation in notable puncta along the neurites in addition to the neurite terminal (Fig. 1C). The puncta were likely stations for transport vesicles. In support of this contention, the membrane fusion factor NSF was found to partially localize to the PTP-MEG2 puncta, especially in neurons expressing the substrate-trapping PTP-MEG2:C515S mutant (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Localization of PTP-MEG2 and NSF in the neurites of cortical neurons. Cortical neurons transduced with the lentiviruses expressing PTP-MEG2 (A) and PTP-MEG2:C515S (B), respectively, were immunostained with the antibodies for PTP-MEG2 and NSF, as indicated in red and green, respectively. Shown are typical confocal images of PTP-MEG2, PTP-MEG2:C515S, and NSF distribution in these neurons. DAPI staining indicates the location of nuclei (blue).

As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of TrkA led to autophosphorylation at Tyr-674/Tyr-675 as well as Tyr-490 on both mature and precursor forms. NGF treatment further enhanced the TrkA phosphorylation of the mature form at the cell surface, especially at the kinase domain Tyr residues Tyr-674/Tyr-675 (Fig. 3, A and B). Co-expression of PTP-MEG2:WT but not the C515S mutant dramatically reduced TrkA phosphorylation at both Tyr(P)-674/Tyr(P)-675 and Tyr(P)-490 (Fig. 3A), indicating TrkA as a novel substrate for PTP-MEG2 tyrosine phosphatase activity. At steady state, pTrkA was largely localized to the cell surface at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, B and C). However, autophosphorylation of TrkA could occur on secretory vesicles along the biosynthetic pathway. When PTP-MEG2 activity was blocked by co-expression of the C515S mutant, which induced accumulation of the precursor form of TrkA (Fig. 3A), pTrkA exhibited dramatic intracellular accumulation at the perinuclear region (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting a block of pTrkA transport to the cell surface and a negative feedback regulation of TrkA biosynthesis at the level of anterograde transport by autophosphorylation. In support of this contention, PTP-MEG2:WT facilitated TrkA transport to the cell surface (Fig. 3, B and C). The perinuclear accumulation of the intracellular pTrkA caused by the PTP-MEG2:C515S mutant suggested a location at or near the Golgi complex. To test this contention, we stained the cells with antibodies for protein markers associated with the cis and trans Golgi apparatus (GM130 and TGN38), followed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to determine whether pTrkA co-localized with the Golgi markers. Again the C515S mutant caused perinuclear accumulation of pTrkA (Fig. 4) in comparison with control cells, where TrkA was largely transported to the plasma membrane and then phosphorylated. Although the perinuclear pTrkA was adjacent to the Golgi complex, it did not completely co-localize with the Golgi markers (Fig. 4). In contrast, PTP-MEG2:WT reduced phosphorylation and pTrkA levels, especially the intracellular pTrkA level, and the small amount of residual pTrkA appeared only on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). As a control for total TrkA distribution, the cells were also stained with an anti-TrkA antibody that recognized both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated TrkA, and the distribution pattern was the same as pTrkA, although the PTP-MEG2:C515S-mediated transport block was less severe, and more TrkA appeared at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B), presumably reflecting the nonphosphorylated TrkA fraction. To investigate whether the kinase activity and phosphorylation state of TrkA are required for its perinuclear accumulation during inactivation of PTP-MEG2 phosphatase activity, we constructed a kinase-inactive rat TrkA in which the catalytically important Lys-547 (equivalent to Lys-538 of human TrkA) was mutated to Ala (TrkA:K547A) and expressed it in PC12 cells. Immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates with anti-TrkA and anti-pTrkA antibodies indicated that the TrkA:K547A mutant was expressed at similar levels compared with WT TrkA but completely lost the kinase activity and autophosphorylation regardless of co-expression with PTP-MEG2 WT or the dominant negative C515S mutant (Fig. 5A). In addition, TrkA:K547A no longer showed accumulation of the precursor form in the presence of PTP-MEG2:C515S (Fig. 5A). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrated that the non-phosphorylated TrkA:K547A mutant was no longer subject to regulation by PTP-MEG2 proteins and was able to overcome the transport block by PTP-MEG2:C515S to reach the plasma membrane, as evidenced by anti-TrkA antibody staining (Fig. 5, B and C). On the other hand, the anti-pTrkA antibody staining served as a control and confirmed the loss of phosphorylation in TrkA:K547A, in contrast to TrkA:WT, which was autophosphorylated and heavily concentrated near the Golgi apparatus in cells expressing PTP-MEG2:C515S (Fig. 5B). NGF-mediated TrkA phosphorylation and signal transduction are essential for PC12 cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth and also facilitate the development and differentiation of primary neurons such as cortical neurons. To determine whether PTP-MEG2 phosphatase activity may negatively regulate NGF/TrkA signal transduction and cell differentiation, we overexpressed PTP-MEG2:WT or the C515S mutant in PC12 cells (Fig. 6A) and cortical neurons (Fig. 7A) and observed the effects on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in comparison with control cells that were transduced with the empty lentiviral vector. In PC12 cells, NGF treatment induced neurite outgrowth and cell differentiation for 5 days (Fig. 6, B–D). Both the percentage of cells containing neurites and total neurite length increased over the 5-day period, and, remarkably, this NGF/TrkA-mediated cell differentiation process was strongly inhibited by overexpression of PTP-MEG2:WT (Fig. 6, C and D). In contrast, the inhibitory effect of the phosphatase-dead C515S mutant was much smaller and delayed until 3 days after NGF induction (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the mutant does not directly dephosphorylate and inactivate TrkA signaling per se. A possible explanation for this delayed inhibitory effect is that NGF binding induces endocytosis and down-regulation of TrkA at the cell surface and that there is a need for newly synthesized TrkA molecules to reach the plasma membrane to replenish the cell surface receptor pool for sustained NGF/TrkA signaling and cell differentiation, but the anterograde transport of TrkA is blocked by the C515S mutant (Fig. 3), which should lead to reduced levels of TrkA at the cell surface and reduced signaling at later stages of neurite extension and differentiation.FIGURE 7PTP-MEG2 inhibits NGF/TrkA signaling-dependent cell differentiation in cortical neurons. A, confocal images of cortical neurons transduced with the vector lentivirus expressing GFP alone (control) or co-transduced with the vector virus and one of the lentiviruses expressing PTP-MEG2:WT or PTP-MEG2:CS as indicated. The GFP virus was used at a low concentration relative to the PTP-MEG2 viruses so that all GFP-expressing cells also simultaneously expressed PTP-MEG2:WT or the PTP-MEG2:CS mutant, which was identified by immunostaining with the anti-PTP-MEG2 antibody as indicated. DAPI staining indicates the location of nuclei. Scale bar = 100 μm. B, Sholl analysis of control, PTP-MEG2:WT, and PTP-MEG2:CS neurons like those in A. The graph shows the average number of neurite intersections at a given radius to the soma and quantification of the area under each curve, which is indicative of neurite differentiation and complexity and is also shown in the inset (*, p < 0.05; one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cortical neurons, NGF treatment facilitated neuronal development by increasing neurite branching and complexity, especially high-order branching. To enhance NGF sensitivity and facilitate microscopic analysis, the neurons were transduced with high titers of the lentiviruses expressing TrkA and low titers of the lentiviruses expressing GFP so that the neurons expressing GFP and subjected to following functional analysis also simultaneously expressed TrkA. Upon overexpression of PTP-MEG2:WT in these neurons (Fig. 7A), neurite branching was significantly reduced, as evidenced by Sholl analysis, which quantified the number of intersecting neurite extensions within a given radius to the cell body (Fig. 7B). We further quantified the total number of branch nodes and total neurite length in these neurons and found that both were reduced by PTP-MEG2:WT overexpression (Fig. 8, A and B). Single-neurite tracing in these assays suggested that the inhibitory effect of PTP-MEG2 was on branch node complexity. Along this line, we investigated high-order branching and complexity by quantification of the number of branches at each level of neurite branch order in individual neurons. In this regard, PTP-MEG2:WT strongly reduced high-order branching and complexity (Fig. 8C). Consistent with the results in PC12 cells, the C515S mutant also exhibited an inhibitory effect on the NGF/TrkA-dependent neuronal differentiation, although to a lesser extent and with high variance (Fig. 8C). Because the C515S mutant has no phosphatase activity (Fig. 3), its inhibitory effect cannot result from direct dephosphorylation of TrkA, like PTP-MEG2 WT. Instead, the inhibitory effect of the C515S mutant on NGF/TrkA signaling and neuron differentiation may be an indirect result of its block of TrkA anterograde trafficking, leading to reduced TrkA levels at the cell surface. We have identified TrkA as a novel substrate for the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-MEG2, which dephosphorylates TrkA at both the kinase activation domain (Tyr-674/675) and the signaling effector binding site (Tyr-490) (Fig. 9). Indeed, overexpression of PTP-MEG2 strongly inhibits NGF/TrkA-mediated signal transduction and neurite outgrowth and differentiation in PC12 cells and cortical neurons. NGF/TrkA signal transduction initiates at the plasma membrane by NGF binding to the extracellular domain of TrkA, leading to phosphorylation of Tyr-674/675 and activation of tyrosine kinase activity in the cytoplasmic domain of TrkA. The TrkA tyrosine kinase activity, in turn, phosphorylates additional tyrosine residues such as Tyr-490 in the cytoplasmic domain of other TrkA molecules on the plasma membrane, forming TrkA dimers and binding sites for recruitment of downstream signaling molecules such as Shc and Frs for activation of the MAPK, PI3K, and phospholipase C signaling pathways (8.Chao M.V. Neurotrophins and their receptors: a convergence point for many signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar, 9.Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Trk receptors: roles in neuronal signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). These NGF/TrkA-mediated signaling pathways ultimately lead to target gene expression for neuronal differentiation and function. Neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation take several days and require replenishment of NGF in the culture medium because of the endocytosis of NGF-TrkA complexes from the cell surface to endosomes and eventually lysosomes for degradation and down-regulation. Replenishment of TrkA at the cell surface is accomplished by anterograde transport of newly synthesized TrkA to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we found that efficient anterograde transport of TrkA also requires PTP-MEG2 phosphatase activity (Fig. 9). As such, TrkA becomes a novel cargo protein of secretory vesicles that depend on PTP-MEG2, which is known to facilitate the transport of a small fraction of post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane via dephosphorylation of NSF (6.Huynh H. Bottini N. Williams S. Cherepanov V. Musumeci L. Saito K. Bruckner S. Vachon E. Wang X. Kruger J. Chow C.W. Pellecchia M. Monosov E. Greer P.A. Trimble W. et al.Control of vesicle fusion by a tyrosine phosphatase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanism of NSF phosphorylation is not well understood and neither is the type of vesicles on which NSF is particularly prone to inactivation by tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data suggest that these vesicles contain TrkA and, possibly, other receptor tyrosine kinases that are membrane cargo proteins but might also control their own transport via phosphorylation of NSF on the membrane. This new mechanism would serve as another layer of quality control to prevent prematurely activated TrkA, e.g. in the case of high levels of expression, from reaching the cell surface (Fig. 9). PC12 cells (Clontech) and primary mouse cortical neurons were cultured and used in the experiments. PC12 cell monolayers were grown in 6-well or 24-well tissue culture plates with or without coverslips. The growth medium was DMEM containing 5% FBS, 10% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with 10% CO2. Cortical neurons were isolated from E16-E18 C57B/6 mouse pups according to approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Briefly, cortices were isolated and minced in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6). Tissues were transferred to Leibovitz medium containing 1 mg/ml papain (Worthington), DNase (250 units/ml), and 0.42 mg/ml cysteine for enzymatic digestion (20 min, 37 °C). The digestion medium was rinsed away with Leibovitz medium containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA. The tissue was then triturated, and cells were centrifuged (100 × g) in Leibovitz medium containing 10 mg/ml BSA. Pelleted cells were resuspended in neuronal growth medium (Neurobasal medium containing 2% NuSerum (BD Biosciences), 2% B27 (Life Technologies), penicillin/streptomycin (10 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (29.2 μg/ml)) at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated 15-mm coverslips (German glass no. 0). After 72 h of incubation, the neuronal cultures were treated with 5-fluor-2′-deoxyuridine (1.5 μg/ml) and uridine (3.5 μg/ml) for inhibition of astrocyte proliferation. Two expression systems were employed to express the TrkA (15.Jullien J. Guili V. Reichardt L.F. Rudkin B.B. Molecular kinetics of nerve growth factor receptor trafficking and activation.J. Biol.

The first system consisted of the bidirectional expression vectors pBI and pBI/eGFP from Clontech, which were able to express two proteins simultaneously, e.g. eGFP and PTP-MEG2:WT or PTP-MEG2:C515S, upon transfection of the cells via a Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)-mediated procedure. We also generated a pBI/TrkA construct for TrkA expression or co-expression with either of the PTP-MEG2 proteins. The second system was the lentivirus vector for highly efficient expression of TrkA and PTP-MEG2 proteins in both PC12 cells and cortical neurons as described below. The lentiviral shuttle vector was a modified version of the original FUGW vector backbone (16.Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D.

The vector included the HIV-1 flap sequence, the human ubiquitin-C promoter, and a woodchuck hepatitis virus regulatory element. The ubiquitin promoter controlled the expression of eGFP, PTP-MEG2:WT, PTP-MEG2:C515S, TrkA, or C-terminal eGFP tagged TrkA. All expression constructs were verified by sequencing. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by transfection of HEK293 cells with four plasmids, the lentiviral shuttle vector, pVSVG, pRRE, and pREV using a calcium phosphate-mediated transfection procedure. The HEK293 culture media were collected 40–44 h after transfection and filtered with a 0.45-μm PVDF filter (Millipore) to remove cellular debris, followed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g to concentrate the viruses. The virus pellets were dissolved in a small volume of medium, aliquoted, and stored frozen at −80 °C. The kinase-dead TrkA mutant (TrkA:K547A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies) and the pBI/TrkA plasmid as the template. The resulting pBI/TrkA:K547A construct was subjected to DNA sequencing, and the mutation was confirmed. Upon transfection of PC12 cells, TrkA:K547A protein expression was identified by immunoblot analysis with the anti-TrkA antibody. The primary antibodies used in immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy included mouse monoclonal antibodies for PTP-MEG2 (R&D Systems) (5.Zhao R. Fu X. Li Q. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J.

Cells were lysed in 1% SDS, and the lysates were sheared to reduce stickiness by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times with a 1-ml syringe. Proteins in the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) that were probed with appropriate primary antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies such as IRDye 800CW or IRDye 680CW and then visualization and quantification with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS three times, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked in PBS containing 0.5% goat serum and 0.2% BSA. Cells were stained with appropriate primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, washed in blocking buffer three times, and then stained with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with 5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS, washed three times in PBS, and mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Life Technologies) for 24 h before imaging using a Leica SP2 MP laser-scanning confocal microscope. The confocal images were processed by Leica software. Epifluorescence images of PC12 cells were acquired by an Olympus IX51 fluorescence microscope with the associated software. Epifluorescence images of cortical neurons were acquired by a Nikon Ti fluorescence microscope with the associated software. Cells were grown in 6-well plates to 50% confluency and transfected with the pBI/eGFP vector or constructs simultaneously expressing eGFP and PTP-MEG2:WT or PTP-MEG2:C515S, respectively. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in growth medium, followed by NGF induction of neurite outgrowth and cell differentiation in low-serum medium (DMEM containing 1% horse serum and 100 ng/ml NGF) for 5 days. The transfected cells were identified by epifluorescence microscopy of eGFP expression, and the percentage of differentiated cells containing neurites at least twice as long as the cell body was determined each day from 200 transfected cells. In addition, the total neurite length of representative differentiated cells for each condition was also quantified and presented. Neurite structural analyses were performed on micrographs with the Neurolucida 10 software package. Neurites were manually traced, and all analyses were performed with built-in software tools. All statistical analyses appropriate for each experimental procedure were performed in GraphPad Prism 6 and are clearly stated in the text. For quantification of neurite branch complexity, branch nodal complexity was quantified using the branched structure analysis tools in Neurolucida and exported into GraphPad Prism. The area under the curve for each neuron was measured, and the averages are displayed. For Sholl analysis, the traces were subjected to Sholl analysis in Neurolucida 10, and data were exported to GraphPad Prism.

https://openalex.org/W2523718610,"Marine fish abundance and distribution often varies across spatial scales for a variety of reasons, and this variability has significant ecological and management consequences. We quantified the distribution of reef-associated fish species along the southeast United States Atlantic coast using underwater video survey samples (N = 4,855 in 2011-2014) to elucidate variability within species across space, depths, and habitats, as well as describe broad-scale patterns in species richness. Thirty-two species were seen at least 10 times on video, and the most commonly observed species were red porgy (Pagrus pagrus; 41.4% of videos), gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus; 31.0%), black sea bass (Centropristis striata; 29.1%), vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens; 27.7%), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus; 22.6%). Using generalized additive models, we found that most species were non-randomly distributed across space, depths, and habitats. Most rare species were observed along the continental shelf break, except for goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), which was found on the continental shelf in Florida and Georgia. We also observed higher numbers of species in shelf-break habitats from southern North Carolina to Georgia, and fewer in shallower water and at the northern and southern ends of the southeast United States Atlantic coast. Our study provides the first broad-scale description of the spatial distribution of reef fish in the region to be based on fishery-independent data, reinforces the utility of underwater video to survey reef fish, and can help improve the management of reef fish in the SEUS, for example, by improving indices of abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2523006558,"Background and Aim Although a few studies have reported that sarcopenia is associated with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), no studies have investigated this association in a large sample representative of the elderly Korean population. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that used data from the Fourth and Fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) on subjects aged 65 years and older. Sarcopenia was defined as a skeletal muscle index (SMI) more than 1 SD below the gender-specific mean for young adults; SMI was calculated as the appendicular muscle mass divided by height squared (ASM/Ht2). Heavy alcohol consumption was defined as consuming at least 210 g/week, and elevated liver enzymes were defined as alanine aminotransferase levels of at least 32 U/L or aspartate aminotransferase levels of at least 34 U/L. ALD was defined as heavy alcohol consumption and elevated liver enzymes. Results The mean age of the 1,151 elderly males was 71.6 ± 0.2 years, and the prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption was 11.8% (136 subjects). SMI did not differ between the non-heavy and heavy alcohol consumer groups (7.1 ± 0.0 kg/m2 vs. 7.3 ± 0.1 kg/m2, respectively, P = 0.145). However, after stratifying by the presence of liver disease and heavy alcohol consumption and adjusting for other confounders in the multivariate logistic regression, SMI was significantly lower among heavy alcohol consumers with ALD (all P < 0.05). Additionally, two-way ANOVA showed a significant interaction between heavy alcohol consumption and liver disease (P = 0.011). Conclusion Sarcopenia was accelerated in the elderly male ALD group, with a significant interaction between alcohol consumption and liver disease."

The main objective was to explore if treatment cycle number modifies the outcome when investigating the effect of female Body Mass Index (BMI) on oocyte quantity in IVF.A historical cohort study was conducted on 5,342 treatment-cycles during the period 1999-2009. Exclusion criteria were missing information on BMI or treatment type. Further, women were excluded if they had ovulated before oocyte retrieval. According to baseline BMI, women were divided into four categories following the World Health Organization standards. Multiple linear regressions analyses were performed accounting for the non-independence of ≥2 cycles in a woman.Stratification according to cycle number revealed a more suboptimal outcome in the first treatment- cycles than in the following cycles, suggesting a possible interaction or effect modification from cycle number or a factor related to cycle number. The median dose of total follicular stimulating hormone given to the four BMI groups could not straight forwardly explain the less optimal oocyte outcome observed in first treatment cycles. No statistically significant differences were observed in oocyte yield for underweight, overweight and obesity compared to normal weight women when analyzing all treatment-cycles. Overweight women had significantly fewer mature (MII) oocytes (p = 0.009) than normal weight women, whereas no differences was observed for underweight and obese women.Our study suggests a possible interaction or effect modification related to treatment cycle number. Investigating the effects of BMI on IVF-results in first treatment-cycles alone should be carried out cautiously."

To define what aspects of TG homeostasis regulate hepatic CREBH processing and apoA-IV gene expression, several mouse models of attenuated VLDL particle assembly were subjected to acute hepatosteatosis induced by an overnight fast or short term ketogenic diet feeding. Compared with chow-fed C57BL/6 mice, fasted or ketogenic diet-fed mice displayed increased hepatic TG content, which was highly correlated (r2 = 0.95) with apoA-IV gene expression, and secretion of larger, TG-enriched VLDL, despite a lower rate of TG secretion and a similar or reduced rate of apoB100 secretion. When VLDL particle assembly and secretion was inhibited by hepatic shRNA-induced apoB silencing or genetic or pharmacologic reduction in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity, hepatic TG content increased dramatically; however, CREBH processing and apoA-IV gene expression were attenuated compared with controls. Adenovirus-mediated reconstitution of MTP expression proportionately restored CREBH processing and apoA-IV expression in liver-specific MTP knock-out mice. These results reveal that hepatic TG content, per se, does not regulate CREBH processing. Instead, TG mobilization into the endoplasmic reticulum for nascent VLDL particle assembly activates CREBH processing and enhances apoA-IV gene expression in the setting of acute steatosis. We conclude that VLDL assembly and CREBH activation play key roles in the response to hepatic steatosis by up-regulating apoA-IV and promoting assembly and secretion of larger, more TG-enriched VLDL particles.

https://openalex.org/W2522244176,"Introduction HIV infection is a risk factor for opportunistic pneumonias such as tuberculosis (TB) and for age-associated health complications. Short telomeres, markers of biological aging, are also associated with an increased risk of age-associated diseases and mortality. Our goals were to use a single cohort of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals hospitalized with pneumonia to assess whether shortened telomere length was associated with HIV infection, TB diagnosis, and 2-month mortality. Methods This was a sub-study of the IHOP Study, a prospective observational study. Participants consisted of 184 adults admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda who underwent evaluation for suspected TB and were followed for 2 months. Standardized questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and clinical data. PBMCs were isolated and analyzed using quantitative PCR to determine telomere length. The association between HIV infection, demographic and clinical characteristics, and telomere length was assessed, as were the associations between telomere length, TB diagnosis and 2-month mortality. Variables with a P≤0.2 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate models. Results No significant demographic or clinical differences were observed between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects. Older age (P<0.0001), male gender (P = 0.04), total pack-years smoked (P<0.001), alcohol consumption in the past year (P = 0.12), and asthma (P = 0.08) were all associated (P≤0.2) with shorter telomere length in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis adjusting for these five variables, HIV-positive participants had significantly shorter telomeres than HIV-negative participants (β = -0.0621, 95% CI -0.113 to -0.011, P = 0.02). Shortened telomeres were not associated with TB or short-term mortality. Conclusions The association between HIV infection and shorter telomeres suggests that HIV may play a role in cellular senescence and biological aging and that shorter telomeres may be involved in age-associated health complications seen in this population. The findings indicate a need to further research the impact of HIV on aging."

SMILE was performed at a depth of either 160μm (160-cap group) or 100μm (100-cap group). Corneal biomechanics, PCE, ECD were evaluated pre-operatively, 1week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 4 months post-operatively by Pentacam, Corvis ST, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) respectively. The Young's modulus was obtained by strip-extensometry test 4 months after surgery.At each time point, the second applanation time (A2T) was similar between the groups with the exception of 4 months after surgery (22.66±0.16 ms in the 160-cap group versus 21.75±0.29 ms in the 100-cap group, p = 0.004). Neither deformation amplitude (DA) nor the first applanationtime (A1T) were significantly different between the two groups. The postoperative posterior surface did not shift forward, the changes of PCE and ECD were not significantly different between the two groups at any observation time. Young's modulus was higher in the 160-cap group than that in the 100-cap group with no statistical significance (P>0.05). Regression analyses showed that the PCE changes and Young's modulus were not affected by cap thickness (CT) or residual stromal bed thickness (RBT) (All P>0.05).The differences of corneal biomechanics, posterior surface elevation, or ECD changes were quite small when using 100μm or 160μm cap thicknesses in SMILE."
https://openalex.org/W2521933536,"This study represents the first characterization of sand microbiota in migrating barchan sand dunes. Bacterial communities were studied through direct counts and cultivation, as well as 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequence analysis to gain an understanding of microbial abundance, diversity, and potential metabolic capabilities. Direct on-grain cell counts gave an average of 5.3 ± 0.4 x 105 cells g-1 of sand. Cultured isolates (N = 64) selected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria (58%), Firmicutes (27%) and Proteobacteria (15%). Deep-sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 18 dunes demonstrated a high relative abundance of Proteobacteria, particularly enteric bacteria, and a dune-specific-pattern of bacterial community composition that correlated with dune size. Shotgun metagenome sequences of two representative dunes were analyzed and found to have similar relative bacterial abundance, though the relative abundances of eukaryotic, viral and enterobacterial sequences were greater in sand from the dune closer to a camel-pen. Functional analysis revealed patterns similar to those observed in desert soils; however, the increased relative abundance of genes encoding sporulation and dormancy are consistent with the dune microbiome being well-adapted to the exceptionally hyper-arid Qatari desert."
https://openalex.org/W2522194483,"The ecological function of animal seed dispersal depends on species interactions and can be affected by drivers such as the management interventions applied to protected areas. This study was conducted in two protected areas in the Monte Desert: a fenced reserve with grazing exclusion and absence of large native mammals (the Man and Biosphere Ñacuñán Reserve; FR) and an unfenced reserve with low densities of large native and domestic animals (Ischigualasto Park; UFR). The study focuses on Prosopis flexuosa seed removal by different functional mammal groups: “seed predators”, “scatter-hoarders”, and “opportunistic frugivores”. Under both interventions, the relative contribution to seed removal by different functional mammal groups was assessed, as well as how these groups respond to habitat heterogeneity (i.e. vegetation structure) at different spatial scales. Camera traps were used to identify mammal species removing P. flexuosa seeds and to quantify seed removal; remote sensing data helped analyze habitat heterogeneity. In the FR, the major fruit removers were a seed predator (Graomys griseoflavus) and a scatter-hoarder (Microcavia asutralis). In the UFR, the main seed removers were the opportunistic frugivores (Lycalopex griseus and Dolichotis patagonum), who removed more seeds than the seed predator in the FR. The FR shows higher habitat homogeneity than the UFR, and functional groups respond differently to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. In the FR, because large herbivores are locally extinct (e.g. Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores are excluded, important functions of large herbivores are missing, such as the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity, which provides habitats for medium-sized opportunistic frugivores with consequent improvement of quality and quantity of seed dispersal services. In the UFR, with low densities of large herbivores, probably one important ecosystem function this group performs is to increase habitat heterogeneity, allowing for the activity of medium-sized mammals who, behaving as opportunistic frugivores, did the most significant seed removal."
https://openalex.org/W2522383867,"At constant average speed (v), a balance between thrust force (Ft) and drag force (Fd) should occur: Ft−Fd = 0; hence the power generated by thrust forces (Pt = Ft·v) should be equal to the power needed to overcome drag forces at that speed (Pd = Fd·v); the aim of this study was to measure Pt (tethered swims), to estimate Pd in active conditions (at sprint speed) and to compare these values. 10 front crawl male elite swimmers (expertise: 93.1 ± 2.4% of 50 m world record) participated to the study; their sprint speed was measured during a 30 m maximal trial. Ft was assessed during a 15 s tethered effort; passive towing measurement were performed to determine speed specific drag in passive conditions (kP = passive drag force/v2); drag force in active conditions (Fd = kA·v2) was calculated assuming that kA = 1.5·kP. Average sprint speed was 2.20 ± 0.07 m·s-1; kA, at this speed, was 37.2 ± 2.7 N·s2·m-2. No significant differences (paired t-test: p > 0.8) were observed between Pt (399 ± 56 W) and Pd (400 ± 57 W) and a strong correlation (R = 0.95, p < 0.001) was observed between these two parameters. The Bland-Altman plot indicated a good agreement and a small, acceptable, error (bias: -0.89 W, limits of agreement: -25.5 and 23.7 W). Power thrust experiments can thus be suggested as a valid tool for estimating a swimmer’s power propulsion."
https://openalex.org/W2521747977,"During social interactions, we make inferences about people's personal characteristics based on their appearance. These inferences form a potential prejudice that can positively or negatively bias our interaction with them. Not much is known about the effects of negative bias on face perception and the ability to recognize people faces. This ability was investigated by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) from 128 sites in 16 volunteers. In the first session (encoding), they viewed 200 faces associated with a short fictional story that described anecdotal positive or negative characteristics about each person. In the second session (recognition), they underwent an old/new memory test, in which they had to distinguish 100 new faces from the previously shown faces. ERP data relative to the encoding phase showed a larger anterior negativity in response to negatively (vs. positively) biased faces, indicating an additional processing of faces with unpleasant social traits. In the recognition task, ERPs recorded in response to new faces elicited a larger FN400 than to old faces, and to positive than negative faces. Additionally, old faces elicited a larger Old-New parietal response than new faces, in the form of an enlarged late positive (LPC) component. An inverse solution SwLORETA (450-550 ms) indicated that remembering old faces was associated with the activation of right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left medial temporal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus. Only negatively connoted faces strongly activated the limbic and parahippocampal areas and the left SFG. A dissociation was found between familiarity (modulated by negative bias) and recollection (distinguishing old from new faces)."
https://openalex.org/W2522337609,"The mitochondrial Bcl-2 inhibitor of transcription 1 (Bit1) protein is part of an anoikis-regulating pathway that is selectively dependent on integrins. We previously demonstrated that the caspase-independent apoptotic effector Bit1 exerts tumor suppressive function in lung cancer in part by inhibiting anoikis resistance and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Herein we show a novel function of Bit1 as an inhibitor cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line. Suppression of endogenous Bit1 expression via siRNA and shRNA strategies promoted mesenchymal phenotypes, including enhanced fibroblastoid morphology and cell migratory potential with concomitant downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin expression. Conversely, ectopic Bit1 expression in A549 cells promoted epithelial transition characterized by cuboidal-like epithelial cell phenotype, reduced cell motility, and upregulated E-cadherin expression. Specific downregulation of E-cadherin in Bit1-transfected cells was sufficient to block Bit1-mediated inhibition of cell motility while forced expression of E-cadherin alone attenuated the enhanced migration of Bit1 knockdown cells, indicating that E-cadherin is a downstream target of Bit1 in regulating cell motility. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR and reporter analyses revealed that Bit1 upregulates E-cadherin expression at the transcriptional level through the transcriptional regulator Amino-terminal Enhancer of Split (AES) protein. Importantly, the Bit1/AES pathway induction of E-cadherin expression involves inhibition of the TLE1-mediated repression of E-cadherin, by decreasing TLE1 corepressor occupancy at the E-cadherin promoter as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Consistent with its EMT inhibitory function, exogenous Bit1 expression significantly suppressed the formation of lung metastases of A549 cells in an in vivo experimental metastasis model. Taken together, our studies indicate Bit1 is an inhibitor of EMT and metastasis in lung cancer and hence can serve as a molecular target in curbing lung cancer aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2522686565,"Neisseria meningitidis is an exclusively human pathogen frequently carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx but it can also provoke invasive infections such as meningitis and septicemia. N. meningitidis uses a limited range of carbon sources during infection, such as glucose, that is usually transported into bacteria via the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), in which the phosphocarrier protein HPr (encoded by the ptsH gene) plays a central role. Although N. meningitidis possesses an incomplete PTS, HPr was found to be required for its virulence. We explored the role of HPr using bioluminescent wild-type and ΔptsH strains in experimental infection in transgenic mice expressing the human transferrin. The wild-type MC58 strain was recovered at higher levels from the peritoneal cavity and particularly from blood compared to the ΔptsH strain. The ΔptsH strain provoked lower levels of septicemia in mice and was more susceptible to complement-mediated killing than the wild-type strain. We tested whether meningococcal structures impacted complement resistance and observed that only the capsule level was decreased in the ΔptsH mutant. We therefore compared the transcriptomic profiles of wild-type and ΔptsH strains and identified 49 differentially expressed genes. The HPr regulon contains mainly hypothetical proteins (43%) and several membrane-associated proteins that could play a role during host interaction. Some other genes of the HPr regulon are involved in stress response. Indeed, the ΔptsH strain showed increased susceptibility to environmental stress conditions. Our data suggest that HPr plays a pleiotropic role in host-bacteria interactions most likely through the innate immune response that may be responsible for the enhanced clearance of the ΔptsH strain from blood."
https://openalex.org/W2521598818,"The specifics of how the nanoscale properties of collagen (e.g., the crosslinking profile) affect the mechanical integrity of bone at larger length scales is poorly understood despite growing evidence that collagen's nanoscale properties are altered with disease. Additionally, mass independent increases in postyield displacement due to exercise suggest loading-induced improvements in bone quality associated with collagen. To test whether disease-induced reductions in bone quality driven by alterations in collagen can be rescued or prevented via exercise-mediated changes to collagen's nanoscale morphology and mechanical properties, the effects of treadmill exercise and β-aminopropionitrile treatment were investigated. Eight week old female C57BL/6 mice were given a daily subcutaneous injection of either 164 mg/kg β-aminopropionitrile or phosphate buffered saline while experiencing either normal cage activity or 30 min of treadmill exercise for 21 consecutive days. Despite differences in D-spacing distribution (P = 0.003) and increased cortical area (tibial: P = 0.005 and femoral: P = 0.015) due to β-aminopropionitrile treatment, an overt mechanical disease state was not achieved as there were no differences in fracture toughness or 4 point bending due to β-aminopropionitrile treatment. While exercise did not alter (P = 0.058) the D-spacing distribution of collagen or prevent (P < 0.001) the β-aminopropionitrile-induced changes present in the unexercised animals, there were differential effects in the distribution of the reduced elastic modulus due to exercise between control and β-aminopropionitrile-treated animals (P < 0.001). Fracture toughness was increased (P = 0.043) as a main effect of exercise, but no significant differences due to exercise were observed using 4 point bending. Future studies should examine the potential for sex specific differences in the dose of β-aminopropionitrile required to induce mechanical effects in mice and the contributions of other nanoscale aspects of bone (e.g., the mineral-collagen interface) to elucidate the mechanism for the exercise-based improvements in fracture toughness observed here and the increased postyield deformation observed in other studies."
https://openalex.org/W2522222051,"We assessed the effects of red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta; hereafter fire ant) on the foraging of hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). We used a manipulative experiment, placing resource patches with a known amount of millet seed within areas with reduced (RIFA [–]) or ambient (RIFA [+]) numbers of fire ants. We measured giving up densities (the amount of food left within each patch) within the resource patches for 4 days to quantify the effects of fire ants on cotton rat foraging. We assessed the effects of fire ant treatment (RIFA), Day, and their interaction on cotton rat giving up densities. Giving up densities on RIFA [+] grids were nearly 2.2 times greater across all foraging days and ranged from 1.6 to 2.3 times greater from day 1 to day 4 than the RIFA [–] grids. From day 1 to day 4, mean giving up densities decreased significantly faster for the RIFA [–] than RIFA [+] treatments, 58% and 13%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that cotton rats perceive a risk of injury from fire ants, which is likely caused by interference competition, rather than direct predation. Envenomation from ants likely decrease the foraging efficiency of cotton rats resulting in more time spent foraging. Increased time spent foraging is likely stressful in terms of the opportunity for direct injury and encounters with other predators. These indirect effects may reduce an individual cotton rat’s fitness and translate into lowered population abundances."
https://openalex.org/W2522584712,"Studies of the defence capacity of ancient hominins against toxic substances may contribute importantly to the reconstruction of their niche, including their diets and use of fire. Fire usage implies frequent exposure to hazardous compounds from smoke and heated food, known to affect general health and fertility, probably resulting in genetic selection for improved detoxification. To investigate whether such genetic selection occurred, we investigated the alleles in Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans at gene polymorphisms well-known to be relevant from modern human epidemiological studies of habitual tobacco smoke exposure and mechanistic evidence. We compared these with the alleles in chimpanzees and gorillas. Neanderthal and Denisovan hominins predominantly possess gene variants conferring increased resistance to these toxic compounds. Surprisingly, we observed the same in chimpanzees and gorillas, implying that less efficient variants are derived and mainly evolved in modern humans. Less efficient variants are observable from the first early Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers onwards. While not clarifying the deep history of fire use, our results highlight the long-term stability of the genes under consideration despite major changes in the hominin dietary niche. Specifically for detoxification gene variants characterised as deleterious by epidemiological studies, our results confirm the predominantly recent appearance reported for deleterious human gene variants, suggesting substantial impact of recent human population history, including pre-Holocene expansions."
https://openalex.org/W2523137866,"This paper distinguishes a rare subset of myeloid dendritic-like cells found in mouse spleen from conventional (c) dendritic cells (DC) in terms of phenotype, function and gene expression. These cells are tentatively named ""L-DC"" since they resemble dendritic-like cells produced in longterm cultures of spleen. L-DC can be distinguished on the basis of their unique phenotype as CD11bhiCD11cloMHCII-CD43+Ly6C-Ly6G-Siglec-F- cells. They demonstrate similar ability as cDC to uptake and retain complex antigens like mannan via mannose receptors, but much lower ability to endocytose and retain soluble antigen. While L-DC differ from cDC by their inability to activate CD4+ T cells, they are capable of antigen cross-presentation for activation of CD8+ T cells, although less effectively so than the cDC subsets. In terms of gene expression, CD8- cDC and CD8+ cDC are quite distinct from L-DC. CD8+ cDC are distinguishable from the other two subsets by expression of CD24a, Clec9a, Xcr1 and Tlr11, while CD8- cDC are distinguished by expression of Ccnd1 and H-2Eb2. L-DC are distinct from the two cDC subsets through upregulated expression of Clec4a3, Emr4, Itgam, Csf1r and CD300ld. The L-DC gene profile is quite distinct from that of cDC, confirming a myeloid cell type with distinct antigen presenting properties."

These closures could have unintended consequences for students and their families. Publicly available social media could be analyzed to identify the consequences of an unplanned school closure.As a proxy for an unplanned, pandemic-related school closure, we used the district-wide school closure due to the September 10-18, 2012 teachers' strike in Chicago, Illinois. We captured social media posts about the school closure using the Radian6 social media-monitoring platform. An online workforce from Amazon Mechanical Turk categorized each post into one of two groups. The first group included relevant posts that described the impact of the closure on students and their families. The second group included irrelevant posts that described the political aspects of the strike or topics unrelated to the school closure. All relevant posts were further categorized as expressing a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. We analyzed patterns of relevant posts and sentiment over time and compared our findings to household surveys conducted after other unplanned school closures.We captured 4,546 social media posts about the district-wide school closure using our search criteria. Of these, 930 (20%) were categorized as relevant by the online workforce. Of the relevant posts, 619 (67%) expressed a negative sentiment, 51 (5%) expressed a positive sentiment, and 260 (28%) were neutral. The number of relevant posts, and especially those with a negative sentiment, peaked on day 1 of the strike. Negative sentiment expressed concerns about childcare, missed school lunches, and the lack of class time for students. This was consistent with findings from previously conducted household surveys.Social media are publicly available and can readily provide information on the impact of an unplanned school closure on students and their families. Using social media to assess the impact of an unplanned school closure due to a public health event would be informative. An online workforce can effectively assist with the review process."
https://openalex.org/W2522292265,"The distribution and behavior of foraging animals usually imply a balance between resource availability and predation risk. In some predators such as scorpions, cannibalism constitutes an important mortality factor determining their ecology and behavior. Climbing on vegetation by scorpions has been related both to prey availability and to predation (cannibalism) risk. We tested different hypotheses proposed to explain climbing on vegetation by scorpions. We analyzed shrub climbing in Buthus cf. occitanus with regard to the following: a) better suitability of prey size for scorpions foraging on shrubs than on the ground, b) selection of shrub species with higher prey load, c) seasonal variations in prey availability on shrubs, and d) whether or not cannibalism risk on the ground increases the frequency of shrub climbing. Prey availability on shrubs was compared by estimating prey abundance in sticky traps placed in shrubs. A prey sample from shrubs was measured to compare prey size. Scorpions were sampled in six plots (50 m x 10 m) to estimate the proportion of individuals climbing on shrubs. Size difference and distance between individuals and their closest scorpion neighbor were measured to assess cannibalism risk. The results showed that mean prey size was two-fold larger on the ground. Selection of particular shrub species was not related to prey availability. Seasonal variations in the number of scorpions on shrubs were related to the number of active scorpions, but not with fluctuations in prey availability. Size differences between a scorpion and its nearest neighbor were positively related with a higher probability for a scorpion to climb onto a shrub when at a disadvantage, but distance was not significantly related. These results do not support hypotheses explaining shrub climbing based on resource availability. By contrast, our results provide evidence that shrub climbing is related to cannibalism risk."
https://openalex.org/W2522536887,"Many animals have evolved strategies to reduce risks of inbreeding and its deleterious effects on the progeny. In social arthropods, such as the eusocial ants and bees, inbreeding avoidance is typically achieved by the dispersal of breeders from their native colony. However studies in presocial insects suggest that kin discrimination during mate choice may be a more common mechanism in socially simpler species with no reproductive division of labour. Here we examined this possibility in the subsocial cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, a model species for research in sexual selection, where males establish dominance hierarchies to access females and control breeding territories. When given a binary choice between a sibling male and a non-sibling male that had the opportunity to establish a hierarchy prior to the tests, females mated preferentially with the dominant male, irrespective of kinship or body size. Despite the lack of kin discrimination during mate choice, inbred-mated females incurred significant fitness costs, producing 20% less offspring than outbred-mated females. We discuss how the social mating system of this territorial cockroach may naturally limit the probability of siblings to encounter and reproduce, without the need for evolving active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, such as kin recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2522863969,"While many zooplankton species recover quickly after the treatment of water resources with the piscicide, rotenone, some fail to reach pretreatment population density or, in rare cases, do not reappear at all. The variable impact of rotenone on zooplankton populations could stem from differences in the capacity of species to switch entirely to anaerobic catabolic pathways in the presence of rotenone, which blocks mitochondrial electron transport. Alternatively, variable responses among species could originate from differences in permeability of dormant life-stages to lipophilic chemicals like rotenone. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of rotenone on development, emergence and hatching of zooplankton embryos that lack both the anaerobic capacity to develop in the presence of rotenone and a permeability barrier to prevent the entry of rotenone during dormancy. Post-diapause embryos of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, were employed as a model system, because they are permeable to lipophilic compounds when dechorionated and require aerobic conditions to support development. Early development in this species is also well characterized in the literature. Brine shrimp embryos were exposed to rotenone while development was either slowed by chilling or suspended by anoxia. Development, emergence and hatching were then observed in rotenone-free artificial seawater. The data presented demonstrate that rotenone freely diffuses across the embryonic cuticle in a matter of hours, and prevents development and emergence after brief exposures to ecologically relevant concentrations (0.025-0.5 mg L-1) of the piscicide. Neither the removal of rotenone from the environment, nor the removal of embryonic water with a hypertonic solution, are sufficient to reverse this block on development and emergence. These data indicate that rotenone could impair recruitment from egg banks for species of zooplankton that lack both an embryonic barrier to the entry of lipophilic compounds and the anaerobic capacity to develop when NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity is inhibited by rotenone."
https://openalex.org/W2521263407,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important enzyme in the control of the neuronal action potential and sensitive to organophosphate inhibition. Brain fish AChE is less sensitive to organophosphate inhibition than AChE from terrestrial animals, although this sensitivity is variable among species and has not yet been fully evaluated in fish species. In this setting, inhibition kinetic constants for progressive irreversible inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase due to methyl-paraoxon exposure were determined in three fish species (Mugil liza, Genidens genidens and Lagocephalus laevigatus) and hen (Gallus domesticus). Enzyme extraction using a detergent was shown to be adequate, and samples presented activity inhibition in high substrate concentrations and suppression of inhibition by methyl-paraoxon in the presence of the substrate, similar to kinetic patterns from purified enzyme preparations. Catfish (G. genidens) AChE presented the highest sensitivity among the evaluated fish species (IC50 = 1031.20 nM ± 63.17) in comparison to M. liza and L. laevigatus (IC50: 2878.83 ± 421.94 and 2842.5 ± 144.63 nM respectively). The lower dissociation constant (Kd = 20.3 ± 2.95 μM) of catfish AChE showed greater enzyme affinity for methyl-paraoxon, explaining this species higher sensitivity to organophosphates. Hen AChE presented higher ki (900.57 ± 65.3 mM-1min-1) and, consequently, greater sensitivity to methyl-paraoxon, explained by a lower Kd (0.6 ± 0.13 μM). Furthermore, hen AChE did not differentiate between the propionylthiocholine and acetylthiocholine substrates, indicating easier access of methyl-paraoxon to the hen enzyme activity site. The results obtained herein indicate a suitable extraction of AChE and, despite different inhibition kinetic constants, demonstrate that fish AChE is less sensitive to methyl-paraoxon, probably due to reduced access to the catalytic center which provides greater enzyme substrate selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2547684092,"Microglia are the immune effector cells that are activated in response to pathological changes in the central nervous system. Microglial activation is accompanied by the alteration of integrin expression on the microglia surface. However, changes of integrin expression upon chemoattractant (ADP) stimulation still remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether ADP induces the alteration of integrin species on the cell surface, leading to changes in chemotactic ability on different extracellular matrix proteins. Flow cytometry scans and on-cell Western assays showed that ADP stimulation induced a significant increase of α6 integrin-GFP, but not α5, on the surface of microglia cells. Microglia also showed a greater motility increase on laminin than fibronectin after ADP stimulation. Time lapse microscopy and integrin endocytosis assay revealed the essential role of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity for the recycling of α6 integrin-GFP from the endosomal recycling complex to the plasma membrane. Lack of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity caused a reduced rate of focal adhesion formation on laminin at the leading edge. Our results suggest that the alteration of integrin-mediated adhesion may regulate the extent of microglial infiltration into the site of damage by controlling their chemotactic ability.

https://openalex.org/W2522904921,"The overexpression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is associated with inflammation and virtually all human cancers. Despite the fact that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties, the negative regulation of uPAR by DHA is still undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of DHA on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced uPAR expression and the underlying molecular mechanisms in ECV304 human endothelial cells. DHA concentration-dependently inhibited TPA-induced uPAR. Specific inhibitors and mutagenesis studies showed that PKCδ, JNK1/2, Erk1/2, NF-κB, and AP-1 were critical for TPA-induced uPAR expression. Application of DHA suppressed TPA-induced translocation of PKCδ, activation of the JNK1/2 and Erk1/2 signaling pathways, and subsequent AP-1 and NF-κB transactivation. In conclusion, these observations suggest a novel role for DHA in reducing uPAR expression and cell invasion by inhibition of PKCδ, JNK1/2, and Erk1/2, and the reduction of AP-1 and NF-κB activation in ECV304 human endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2523229553,"The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is involved in the onset and progression of several inflammatory diseases. The RAGE primary transcript undergoes numerous alternative splicing (AS) events, some of which are species-specific. Here, we characterize the mouse-specific mRAGE_v4 splice variant, which is conserved in rodents and absent in primates. mRAGE_v4 derives from exon 9 skipping and encodes a receptor (M-RAGE) that lacks 9 amino acids between the transmembrane and the immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. RNA-Seq data confirm that in mouse lung mRAGE_v4 is the most abundant RAGE mRNA isoform after mRAGE, which codes for full-length RAGE (FL-RAGE), while in heart all RAGE variants are almost undetectable. The proteins M-RAGE and FL-RAGE are roughly equally abundant in mouse lung. Contrary to FL-RAGE, M-RAGE is extremely resistant to shedding because it lacks the peptide motif recognized by both ADAM10 and MMP9, and does not contribute significantly to soluble cRAGE formation. Thus, a cassette exon in RAGE corresponds to a specific function of the RAGE protein-the ability to be shed. Given the differences in RAGE AS variants between rodents and humans, caution is due in the interpretation of results obtained in mouse models of RAGE-dependent human pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2523484231,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand, immunoglobulin-like receptor that has been implicated in aging-associated diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that both human and murine Ager genes undergo extensive alternative splicing that generates multiple putative transcripts encoding different receptor isoforms. Except for the soluble isoform (esRAGE), the majority of putative RAGE isoforms remain unstudied. Profiling of murine Ager transcripts showed that variant transcript 4 (mRAGE_v4), the second most abundant transcript in lungs and multiple other tissues, encodes a receptor that lacks nine residues located within the C2 extracellular section close to the trans-membrane domain. We therefore characterized mRAGEV4 isoreceptor in comparison with the full-length mRAGE (mRAGEFL). Although differing in only nine residues, mRAGEFL and mRAGEV4 display very different cellular behaviors. While mRAGEFL undergoes constitutive, extensive shedding in the cell to generate sRAGE, mRAGEV4 hardly sheds. In addition, we found that while mRAGEFL can localize to both the plasma membrane and the endosome, mRAGEV4 is exclusively localized to the plasma membrane. These very different cellular localization patterns suggest that, in addition to their roles in sRAGE production, mRAGEFL and mRAGEV4 may play distinct, spatiotemporal roles in signaling and innate immune responses. Compared to mice, humans do not have the v4 transcript. Although hRAGE, like mRAGEFL, also localizes to the plasma membrane and the endosome, its rate of constitutive shedding is significantly lower. These observations provide valuable information regarding RAGE biology, and serve as a reference by which to create mouse models relating to human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2523372581,"Objective The clinical management of patients with thyroid nodules that are biopsied by fine-needle aspiration cytology and yield indeterminate results remains unsettled. The BRAF V600E mutation has dubious diagnostic value due to its low sensitivity. Novel strategies are urgently needed to distinguish thyroid malignancies from thyroid nodules. Design This prospective study included 504 thyroid nodules diagnosed by ultrasonography from 468 patients, and fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed under ultrasound guidance. Cytology and molecular analysis, including BRAF V600E, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, were conducted simultaneously. The cytology, ultrasonography results, and mutational status were gathered and analyzed together. Predictive scoring systems were designed using a combination of diagnostic parameters for ultrasonography, cytology and genetic analysis. The utility of the scoring systems was analyzed and compared to detection using the individual methods alone or combined. Result The sensitivity of scoring systema (ultrasonography, cytology, BRAF V600E, RET/PTC) was nearly identical to that of scoring systemb (ultrasonography, cytology, BRAF V600E); these were 91.0% and 90.2%, respectively. These sensitivities were significantly higher than those obtained using FNAC, genetic analysis and US alone or combined; their sensitivities were 63.9%, 70.7% and 87.2%, respectively. Scoring systemc (ultrasonography, cytology) was slightly inferior to the former two scoring systems but still had relatively high sensitivity and specificity (80.5% and 95.1%, respectively), which were significantly superior to those of single cytology, ultrasonography or genetic analysis. In nodules with uncertainty cytology, scoring systema, scoring systemb and scoring systemc could elevate the malignancy detection rates to 69.7%, 69.7% and 63.6%, respectively. Conclusion These three scoring systems were quick for clinicians to master and could provide quantified information to predict the probability of malignant nodules. Scoring systemb is recommended for improving the detection rate among nodules of uncertain cytology."
https://openalex.org/W2523187685,"The objective of this study was to identify and describe levels of household economic vulnerability in HIV-affected communities in Côte d’Ivoire, defined as those with a high prevalence of HIV and large numbers of orphans and vulnerable children. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 3,749 households in five health regions of Côte d’Ivoire. Using principal component analysis, we attempted to identify sets of correlated vulnerabilities and derive a small number of composite scores to create an index for targeting interventions to vulnerable populations. The 65 vulnerability measures examined did not cluster in ways that would allow for the creation of a small number of composite measures. Instead, we found that households face numerous unique pathways to vulnerability."
