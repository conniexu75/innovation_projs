https://openalex.org/W3120271639,"We use the UK Household Longitudinal Study and compare pre-COVID-19 pandemic (2017-2019) and during-COVID-19 pandemic data (April 2020) for the same group of individuals to assess and quantify changes in mental health as measured by changes in the GHQ-12 (General Health Questionnaire), among ethnic groups in the UK. We confirm the previously documented average deterioration in mental health for the whole sample of individuals interviewed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we find that the average increase in mental distress varies by ethnicity and gender. Both women –regardless of their ethnicity– and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) men experienced a higher average increase in mental distress than White British men, so that the gender gap in mental health increases only among White British individuals. These ethnic-gender specific changes in mental health persist after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Finally, we find some evidence that, among men, Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani individuals have experienced the highest average increase in mental distress with respect to White British men."

To generate this dataset, we developed GridTape, a technology that combines automated serial-section collection with automated high-throughput transmission EM. Using this dataset, we studied neuronal networks that control leg and wing movements by reconstructing all 507 motor neurons that control the limbs. We show that a specific class of leg sensory neurons synapses directly onto motor neurons with the largest-caliber axons on both sides of the body, representing a unique pathway for fast limb control. We provide open access to the dataset and reconstructions registered to a standard atlas to permit matching of cells between EM and light microscopy data. We also provide GridTape instrumentation designs and software to make large-scale EM more accessible and affordable to the scientific community.

To navigate a complex world, an animal’s nervous system must stimulate precise patterns of muscle contractions to produce coordinated body movements. Humans have more than 100,000 motor neurons (MNs) that innervate more than 100 million muscle fibers (Kanning et al., 2010Kanning K.C. Kaplan A. Henderson C.E. Motor neuron diversity in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 409-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Limb MNs reside in the spinal cord, where neuronal networks integrate signals from the brain with sensory feedback from the body to coordinate limb movements. A century of studies in mammals has revealed many principles of spinal cord organization and development (Kiehn, 2011Kiehn O. Development and functional organization of spinal locomotor circuits.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the neuronal circuits that control motor output, largely because we do not know their wiring and connectivity. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a particularly appealing system for studying mechanisms of motor control. Insects have a ventral nerve cord (VNC) that is homologous to the vertebrate spinal cord (Niven et al., 2008Niven J.E. Graham C.M. Burrows M. Diversity and evolution of the insect ventral nerve cord.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2008; 53: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but they lack vertebrae, making the VNC more experimentally accessible. Moreover, many insects have neurons that are uniquely identifiable across individuals, making insects well-established models for understanding the physiology of motor circuits (Burrows, 1996Burrows M. The Neurobiology of an Insect Brain. Oxford University Press on Demand, 1996Crossref Google Scholar; Büschges et al., 2008Büschges A. Akay T. Gabriel J.P. Schmidt J. Organizing network action for locomotion: insights from studying insect walking.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More specifically, Drosophila is a genetically accessible model system with complex and well-characterized behaviors including walking, flight, escape responses, grooming, and courtship. Recent technical advances have enabled in vivo electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging of genetically identified VNC neurons in behaving adult Drosophila, providing insight into motor-related activity patterns during behavior (Chen et al., 2018Chen C.L. Hermans L. Viswanathan M.C. Fortun D. Aymanns F. Unser M. Cammarato A. Dickinson M.H. Ramdya P. Imaging neural activity in the ventral nerve cord of behaving adult Drosophila.Nat.

Furthermore, the small size of the Drosophila nervous system makes it suitable for comprehensive connectivity mapping using electron microscopy (EM). EM-based connectivity mapping was previously undertaken for a larval Drosophila nervous system (Ohyama et al., 2015Ohyama T. Schneider-Mizell C.M. Fetter R.D. Aleman J.V. Franconville R.

A VNC “connectome”—a map of its neurons and their synaptic connections—would enhance our understanding of how VNC circuits control muscles of the legs (Soler et al., 2004Soler C. Daczewska M.

EM is the gold standard for mapping structural connectivity within neuronal circuits (Sjostrand, 1958Sjostrand F.S.

However, even seemingly small tissue volumes (1 mm3) acquired at synaptic resolution (e.g., 4 × 4 × 40 nm3 per voxel) produce massive datasets (>1,500 teravoxels) that require automated methods for reliable acquisition in a reasonable amount of time. Recent developments in scanning EM (SEM) methods have enabled connectomic analyses of multiple circuits (Briggman et al., 2011Briggman K.L. Helmstaedter M. Denk W.

Although there have been recent developments in motorized TEM section collection (Lee et al., 2018Lee T.J. Kumar A. Balwani A.H. Brittain D. Kinn S. Tovey C.A. Dyer E.L. da Costa N.M. Reid R.C. Forest C.R. Bumbarger D.J.

Lauritzen J.S. Perlman E. Robinson C.G. Nichols M. Milkie D. Torrens O. Price J. Fisher C.B. Sharifi N. et al.A Complete Electron Microscopy Volume of the Brain of Adult Drosophila melanogaster.Cell. 2018; 174: 730-743.e22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we lack an end-to-end platform for automated large-scale TEM section collection and imaging. To address this, we designed a tape-based data acquisition pipeline that combines automated sectioning with a TEM-compatible collection substrate and an automated, reel-to-reel imaging stage. This technology, called GridTape, accelerates section collection and enables fully automated TEM imaging for a fraction of the cost of alternative systems. Here, we used GridTape to produce a synapse-resolution EM dataset of an adult female Drosophila melanogaster VNC. We then reconstructed over 1,000 sensory and motor neurons in a neuronal network that controls limb movements to investigate wiring principles such as the organization of peripheral nerves and the uniqueness and bilateral symmetry of leg MNs. We registered the EM dataset to a light microscopy (LM)-based atlas, allowing us to find genetically identified neurons in the EM dataset based on their morphology. Through EM reconstruction, we found a class of leg proprioceptive neuron, the bilaterally projecting campaniform sensillum (bCS) neurons, that provide direct synaptic input onto the MNs with the largest-caliber axons in multiple legs. We identified the functionally characterized “fast” tibia flexor MN as a major synaptic target of bCS neurons based on registration of EM and LM morphology. Finally, we generated intersectional driver lines to genetically label bCS neurons, revealing their location in the leg, confirming their morphology in the VNC, and providing tools for future studies. We provide the EM dataset, neuron reconstructions, and designs for GridTape instrumentation as freely available resources. We developed GridTape, a TEM-compatible tape substrate (Figures 1A and 1B ) that combines advantages of section collection from the automated tape-collecting ultra-microtome SEM (ATUM-SEM) approach (Hayworth et al., 2014Hayworth K.J. Morgan J.L. Schalek R. Berger D.R. Hildebrand D.G. Lichtman J.W. Imaging ATUM ultrathin section libraries with WaferMapper: a multi-scale approach to EM reconstruction of neural circuits.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 68Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with the advantages of TEM imaging (Figures 1C–1E). To produce GridTape, regularly spaced 2 × 1.5 mm2 holes resembling slots in conventional TEM grids are laser-milled through aluminum-coated polyimide tape (Figure 1A). A 4 mm-wide trough is also milled from the uncoated surface so that the tape can be safely layered upon itself (Figure 1B). The milled tape is coated with a 50 nm-thick film (LUXFilm®, Luxel Corporation) that spans the slots to provide support for section collection. We collected sections onto GridTape using an ATUM modified for compatibility with GridTape (Figures S1A–S1C). The tape is positioned near the knife edge so that sections consistently adhere to the moving tape as they are being cut. By monitoring the ultramicrotome cutting speed and adjusting the tape speed, the movement of GridTape slots is locked in-phase with cutting. This closed-loop sectioning approach permits automated collection of >4,000 sections per day, >10 times faster than manual section collection (Bock et al., 2011Bock D.D. Lee W.C.A. Kerlin A.M.

Collecting sections onto thin films enables widefield TEM imaging. To automate the imaging process, we engineered a stage that attaches to standard TEM microscopes and houses GridTape reels in vacuum (Figure 1F). Tape housings were added on opposite sides of the microscope column to allow motors to feed the tape between the two sides and position sections under the electron beam. To image large areas at synaptic resolution, the microscope automatically montages each section using piezoelectric nano-positioners. The tape is then translated to position the next section for montaging, enabling continuous unattended operation. Using a 2 × 2 camera array (Bock et al., 2011Bock D.D. Lee W.C.A. Kerlin A.M. Andermann M.L. Hood G. Wetzel A.W. Yurgenson S. Soucy E.R. Kim H.S. Reid R.C. Network anatomy and in vivo physiology of visual cortical neurons.Nature. 2011; 471: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), we achieve imaging rates of >40 Mpixels per second (Table S1). This microscope, termed transmission electron microscope with a camera array and GridTape (TEMCA-GT), provides high-throughput imaging at a relatively low cost of ∼US$300,000 per microscope (Tables S1 and S2). To map circuits underlying motor control, we acquired a dataset encompassing an adult female Drosophila VNC that consists of 86.3 trillion voxels and spans 21 million μm3 (Figure 2). The dataset includes the VNC, neck connective, and a portion of the brain’s subesophageal ganglion (Figures 2A and 2C–2G). The imaged volume was captured from 4,355 serial coronal sections, each cut around 45 nm thick and collected onto GridTape continuously over 27 h (22.1 s per section). Of these sections, 98% were positioned within 0.37 mm of the average section position, with only six sections having 20% or more of the VNC off the imageable slot area (Figures 2B and S1D; STAR methods). An additional three sections were lost before imaging due to support film damage. No off-slot or lost sections were consecutive. Imaging at 4.3 × 4.3 nm2 per pixel resolution required 60 continuous days on one TEMCA-GT at a rate of 42.73 ± 3.04 Mpixels per second (mean ± SD across sections), an order of magnitude faster than most volumetric EM approaches (Table S1). This amounted to 20.6 million images, or 172.6 TB of raw data. We adapted a software pipeline (STAR methods) to align the images into a three-dimensional (3D) volume (Video S1). Whereas alignment of serial-section TEM data has historically been a challenge due to irregularities in the sectioning process, GridTape section collection provided consistent placement of serial sections, with few partial, lost, or damaged sections (STAR methods). This facilitated the high-quality alignment of serial sections (Figure 2E) required for efficient and accurate connectomic reconstruction. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/d7e41e6e-78b9-4fec-b306-809026aeeb13/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

MNs had cell bodies located in the VNC, projected to a dorsal layer of the VNC, and did not contain synaptic vesicles or presynaptic specializations within the neuropil (Figure 3A; Video S2). Sensory neurons did not have cell bodies in the VNC, arborized more ventrally, and made synaptic outputs within the neuropil (Figure 3B; Video S2). An additional 20 neurons did not fall into one of these two main categories (Figure S2). Consistent with previous reports, we also counted 3,738 axons traveling between the brain and VNC via the neck connective (Coggshall et al., 1973Coggshall J. Boschek C. Buchner S.

https://openalex.org/W3120120982,"Microplastics are ubiquitous contaminants in aquatic habitats globally, and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are point sources of microplastics. Within aquatic habitats microplastics are colonized by microbial biofilms, which can include pathogenic taxa and taxa associated with plastic breakdown. Microplastics enter WWTPs in sewage and exit in sludge or effluent, but the role that WWTPs play in establishing or modifying microplastic bacterial assemblages is unknown. We analyzed microplastics and associated biofilms in raw sewage, effluent water, and sludge from two WWTPs. Both plants retained &gt;99% of influent microplastics in sludge, and sludge microplastics showed higher bacterial species richness and higher abundance of taxa associated with bioflocculation (e.g. Xanthomonas ) than influent microplastics, suggesting that colonization of microplastics within the WWTP may play a role in retention. Microplastics in WWTP effluent included significantly lower abundances of some potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa (e.g. Campylobacteraceae ) compared to influent microplastics; however, other potentially pathogenic taxa (e.g. Acinetobacter ) remained abundant on effluent microplastics, and several taxa linked to plastic breakdown (e.g. Klebsiella , Pseudomonas , and Sphingomonas ) were significantly more abundant on effluent compared to influent microplastics. These results indicate that diverse bacterial assemblages colonize microplastics within sewage and that WWTPs can play a significant role in modifying the microplastic-associated assemblages, which may affect the fate of microplastics within the WWTPs and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3013687394,"In confronting the global spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic we must have coordinated medical, operational, and political responses. In all efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through serological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic indices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 2000 day-scale time series of 1- and 2-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most 'important' for April 2020 with respect to April 2019. We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for 'virus' in January 2020 followed by a decline through February and then a surge through March and April. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as well as for retrospective investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3120550722,"Multidrug resistant Enterobacterales have become a serious global health problem, with extended hospital stay and increased mortality. Antibiotic monotherapy has been reported ineffective against most drug resistant bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae , thus encouraging the use of multidrug therapies as an alternative antibacterial strategy. The present works assessed the antibacterial activity of colistin against K . pneumoniae isolates. Resistant isolates were tested against 16 conventional antibiotics alone and in combination with colistin. The results revealed that all colistin resistant isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance against the tested antibiotics except amikacin. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, combinations of colistin with amikacin, or fosfomycin showed synergism against 72.72% (8 of 11 isolates). Colistin with either of gentamicin, meropenem, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxifloxacin, minocycline, or piperacillin exhibited synergism against 81.82% (9 of 11 isolates). Combinations of colistin with either of tobramycin or ciprofloxacin showed synergism against 45.45% (5 in 11 isolates), while combinations of colistin with imipenem or ceftolozane and tazobactam displayed 36.36% (4 of 11 isolates) and 63.64% (7 of 11 isolates) synergism. In addition, combinations of colistin with levofloxacin was synergistic against 90.91% (10 of 11 isolates). The results revealed that combinations of colistin with other antibiotics could effectively inhibit colistin resistant isolates of K . pneumoniae , and thus could be further explore for the treatment of multidrug resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3118933403,"Introduction The world has been engulfed with the pandemic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which have created significant impact in the emergency surgical health delivery including acute appendicitis. The main aim of this study was to compare the demographic and clinical parameters between two cohorts before the onset of lockdown and within the pandemic. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed between two groups A and B, who presented with acute appendicitis three months prior to and after initiation of lockdown on March 24 2020 respectively in one of the tertiary centers of Nepal. These two cohorts were compared in demographics, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical aspects of acute appendicitis. Results There were 42 patients in group A and 50 patients in group B. Mean age of the patients was 31.32±17.18 years with male preponderance in group B (N = 29). Mean duration of pain increased significantly in group B [57.8±25.9(B) vs 42.3±25.0(A) hours, P = 0.004] along with mean duration of surgery [51.06±9.4(B) vs 45.27±11.8(A) minutes, P = 0.015]. There was significant decrease in post-operative hospital stay among group B patients [3.04±1.1(B) vs 3.86±0.67(A) days, P = 0.0001]. Complicated cases increased in group B including appendicular perforation in 10 cases. Similarly, mean duration of presentation to hospital significantly increased in group B patients with perforation [69.6±21.01 vs 51.57±17.63 hours, P = 0.008]. Conclusion During the adversity of the current pandemic, increased number of cases of acute appendicitis can be dealt with surgery as the chances of late presentation and complexity of the lesion exists."
https://openalex.org/W3119451513,"Molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is an enamel condition characterized by lesions ranging in color from white to brown which present rapid caries progression, and mainly affects permanent first molars and incisors. These enamel defects usually occur when there are disturbances during the mineralization or maturation stage of amelogenesis. Both genetic and environmental factors have been suggested to play roles in MIH’s development, but no conclusive risk factors have shown the source of the disease. During head and neck development, the interferon regulatory factor 6 ( IRF6 ) gene is involved in the structure formation of the oral and maxillofacial regions, and the transforming growth factor alpha ( TGFA ) is an essential cell regulator, acting during proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. In this present study, it was hypothesized that these genes interact and contribute to predisposition of MIH. Environmental factors affecting children that were 3 years of age or older were also hypothesized to play a role in the disease etiology. Those factors included respiratory issues, malnutrition, food intolerance, infection of any sort and medication intake. A total of 1,065 salivary samples from four different cohorts were obtained, and DNA was extracted from each sample and genotyped for nine different single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association tests and logistic regression implemented in PLINK were used for analyses. A potential interaction between TGFA rs930655 with all markers tested in the cohort from Turkey was identified. These interactions were not identified in the remaining cohorts. Associations (p&lt;0.05) between the use of medication after three years of age and MIH were also found, suggesting that conditions acquired at the age children start to socialize might contribute to the development of MIH."
https://openalex.org/W3118822238,"Introduction The management and treatment of Medical Waste (MW) are of great concern owing to its potential hazard to human health and the environment, particularly in developing countries. In Bhutan, although guidelines exist on the prevention and management of wastes, the implementation is still hampered by technological, economic, social difficulties and inadequate training of staff responsible for handling these waste. The study aimed at assessing the awareness and practice of medical waste management among health care providers and support staff at the National Referral Hospital and its compliance with the existing National guidelines and policies. Materials and methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2019. Three research instruments were developed and used; (i) Demographic questionnaire, (ii) Awareness questions, and (iii) the Observational checklist. The data was coded and double entered into Epi data version 3.1 and SPSS version 18 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to present the findings of the study. Results The majority of the respondents were female (54.1%) with a mean age of 32.2 (±7.67) years, most of whom have not received any waste management related training/education (56.8%). About 74.4% are aware of medical waste management and 98.2% are aware on the importance of using proper personal protective equipment. Only 37.6% knew about the maximum time limit for medical waste to be kept in hospital premises is 48 hours. About 61.3% of the observed units/wards/departments correctly segregated the waste in accordance to the national guidelines. However, half of the Hospital wastes are not being correctly transported based on correct segregation process with 58% of waste not segregated into infectious and general wastes. Conclusion The awareness and practice of medical waste management among healthcare workers is often limited with inadequate sensitization and lack of proper implementation of the existing National guidelines at the study site. Therefore, timely and effective monitoring is required with regular training for healthcare workers and support staff. Furthermore, strengthening the waste management system at National Referral Hospital would provide beneficial impact in enhancing safety measures of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3118969273,"Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are a highly heterogeneous subtype of Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), accounting for about 25% of NHL. Despite an increased progression-free survival upon therapy, 40–50% of patients develop relapse/refractory disease, therefore there remains an important medical need. T cell recruiting therapies, such as the CD20xCD3 T cell bi-specific antibody CD20-TCB (RG6026 or glofitamab), represent a novel approach to target all stages of DLBCL, especially those that fail to respond to multiple lines of treatment. We aimed for a better understanding of the molecular features related to the mode of action (MoA) of CD20-TCB in inducing Target/T cell synapse formation and human T cell recruitment to the tumor. To directly evaluate the correlation between synapse, cytokine production and anti-tumor efficacy using CD20-TCB, we developed an innovative preclinical human DLBCL in vivo model that allowed tracking in vivo human T cell dynamics by multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM). By ex vivo and in vivo approaches, we revealed that CD20-TCB is inducing strong and stable synapses between human T cell and tumor cells, which are dependent on the dose of CD20-TCB and on LFA-1 activity but not on FAS-L. Moreover, despite CD20-TCB being a large molecule (194.342 kDa), we observed that intra-tumor CD20-TCB-mediated human T cell-tumor cell synapses occur within 1 hour upon CD20-TCB administration. These tight interactions, observed for at least 72 hours post TCB administration, result in tumor cell cytotoxicity, resident T cell proliferation and peripheral blood T cell recruitment into tumor. By blocking the IFNγ-CXCL10 axis, the recruitment of peripheral T cells was abrogated, partially affecting the efficacy of CD20-TCB treatment which rely only on resident T cell proliferation. Altogether these data reveal that CD20-TCB’s anti-tumor activity relies on a triple effect: i) fast formation of stable T cell-tumor cell synapses which induce tumor cytotoxicity and cytokine production, ii) resident T cell proliferation and iii) recruitment of fresh peripheral T cells to the tumor core to allow a positive enhancement of the anti-tumor effect."
https://openalex.org/W3119222939,"Background The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in regions endemic for both Dengue and Chikungunya is still not fully understood. Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Methods Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1 st , 2019 to June 30 th , 2020. Findings Covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 210 (2.85%) out of the 7,370 serum samples tested. The earliest undiagnosed missed case of COVID-19 dated back to a sample collected on December 18, 2019, also positive for Dengue Virus. Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed. Interpretation Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Data presented here demonstrate that in arboviral endemic regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection must be always considered, regardless of the existence of a previous positive diagnosis for Dengue or Chikungunya."
https://openalex.org/W3119939089,"Pantoea agglomerans is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus causing a wide range of opportunistic infections in humans including septicemia, pneumonia, septic arthritis, wound infections and meningitis. To date, the determinants of virulence, antibiotic resistance, metabolic features conferring survival and host-associated pathogenic potential of this bacterium remain largely underexplored. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the whole-genome of P . agglomerans KM1 isolated from kimchi in South Korea. The genome contained one circular chromosome of 4,039,945 bp, 3 mega plasmids, and 2 prophages. The phage-derived genes encoded integrase, lysozyme and terminase. Six CRISPR loci were identified within the bacterial chromosome. Further in-depth analysis showed that the genome contained 13 antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance to clinically important antibiotics such as penicillin G, bacitracin, rifampicin, vancomycin, and fosfomycin. Genes involved in adaptations to environmental stress were also identified which included factors providing resistance to osmotic lysis, oxidative stress, as well as heat and cold shock. The genomic analysis of virulence factors led to identification of a type VI secretion system, hemolysin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and genes involved in iron uptake and sequestration. Finally, the data provided here show that, the KM1 isolate exerted strong immunostimulatory properties on RAW 264.7 macrophages in vitr o. Stimulated cells produced Nitric Oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The upstream signaling for production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and NO depended on TLR4 and TLR1/2. While production of TNF-α, IL-6 and NO involved solely activation of the NF-κB, IL-10 secretion was largely dependent on NF-κB and to a lesser extent on MAPK Kinases. Taken together, the analysis of the whole-genome and immunostimulatory properties provided in-depth characterization of the P . agglomerans KM1 isolate shedding a new light on determinants of virulence that drive its interactions with the environment, other microorganisms and eukaryotic hosts"
https://openalex.org/W3119887753,"We apply event history analysis to analyze career and publication data of virtually all political scientists in German university departments, showing that each published refereed journal article increases a political scientist’s chance for tenure by 9 percent, while other publications affect the odds for tenure only marginally and in some cases even negatively. Each received award and third party funding increases the odds for tenure by respectively 41 and 26 percent, while international experience, social capital and children hardly have a strong influence. Surprisingly, having degrees from a German university of excellence strongly decreases the odds for tenure. Women with similar credentials have at least 20 percent higher odds to get tenure than men. Our data therefore suggests that the lower factual hiring rates of women are better explained by a leaky pipeline, e.g. women leaving academia, rather than because women are not hired even when they are as productive as men. The article contributes to a better understanding of the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in achieving highly competitive job positions."
https://openalex.org/W3119638586,"The assessment and prediction of regional water quality are fundamental inputs to environmental planning and watershed ecological management. This paper explored spatiotemporal changes in the correlation of water quality parameters (WQPs) and land-use types (LUTs) in a reticular river network area. Water samples of 44 sampling sites were collected every quarter from 2016 to 2018 and evaluated for dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and permanganate index (COD Mn ). A redundancy analysis (RDA) and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were applied to analyze the land-use type impacts on seasonal WQPs at five buffer scales (100, 200, 500, 800, and 1000 m). The Kruskal–Wallis test results revealed significant seasonal differences in NH 3 -N, TP, COD Mn , and DO. The area percentages of farmland, water area and built-up land in the study area were 38.96%, 22.75% and16.20%, respectively, for a combined total area percentage of nearly 80%. Our study showed that orchard land had an especially favorable influence on WQPs. Land-use type impacts on WQPs were more significant during the dry season than the wet season. The total variation explained by LUTs regarding WQPs at the 1 km buffer scale was slightly stronger than at smaller buffer scales. Built-up land had a negative effect on WQPs, but orchard and forest-grassland had a positive effect on WQPs. The effects of water area and farmland on WQPs were complex on different buffer scales. These findings are helpful for improving regional water resource management and environmental planning."
https://openalex.org/W3119844156,"Background This study aimed to develop and validate the Food and Nutrition Literacy Questionnaire for Chinese School-age Children (FNLQ-SC). Methods A comprehensive literature review and qualitative study were initially performed to identify the dimensions and core components of food and nutrition literacy. A cross-sectional survey of 4359 school-age children was conducted, and junior middle school students were used to analyze the reliability and validity of the questionnaire (n = 2452). The reliability of the questionnaire was determined by internal consistency, the construct validity was assessed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and the content validity was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results From the literature review and qualitative methods, 19 core components of the FNLQ-SC were developed, including one dimension of food and nutrition knowledge and understanding, and four skill dimensions (ability of access, selection, preparing food and healthy eating). The overall FNLQ-SC questionnaire had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.698). The EFA of skill components extracted 5 factors that were included in the conceptual framework in a slightly different model, and the cumulative contribution of variance accounted for 50.60% of the overall variance. The CFA of skill components showed an acceptable fit in general and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was 0.070 (between 0.50 to 0.80). The communality was greater than 0.20 for all components. The Pearson correlation coefficients between each dimension and the overall questionnaire ranged from 0.370 to 0.877. The average FNLQ-SC score of all 4395 participants was 61.91 ± 9.22, and the score for the knowledge and understanding dimension was higher than that for the skill dimensions. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that not only social demographic characteristics (being a girl, being an only child, living someplace other than at school, having an urban registered permanent residence status, being from an affluent family, and being cared for by parents/grandparents with a higher education level) but also the home food environment were predictors of food and nutrition literacy in school-age children (R 2 = 0.226, F = 81.401, P &lt;0.05). Conclusion The Food and Nutrition Literacy Questionnaire (FNLQ-SC) developed here had good reliability, and it can potentially be a useful instrument for assessing food and nutrition literacy among Chinese school-age children."
https://openalex.org/W3118539831,"Background Despite the benefits offered by an abundance of health applications promoted on app marketplaces (e.g., Google Play Store), the wide adoption of mobile health and e-health apps is yet to come. Objective This study aims to investigate the current landscape of smartphone apps that focus on improving and sustaining health and wellbeing. Understanding the categories that popular apps focus on and the relevant features provided to users, which lead to higher user scores and downloads will offer insights to enable higher adoption in the general populace. This study on 1,000 mobile health applications aims to shed light on the reasons why particular apps are liked and adopted while many are not. Methods User-generated data (i.e. review scores) and company-generated data (i.e. app descriptions) were collected from app marketplaces and manually coded and categorized by two researchers. For analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes Artificial Intelligence algorithms were used. Results The analysis led to features that attracted more download behavior and higher user scores. The findings suggest that apps that mention a privacy policy or provide videos in description lead to higher user scores, whereas free apps with in-app purchase possibilities, social networking and sharing features and feedback mechanisms lead to higher number of downloads. Moreover, differences in user scores and the total number of downloads are detected in distinct subcategories of mobile health apps. Conclusion This study contributes to the current knowledge of m-health application use by reviewing mobile health applications using content analysis and machine learning algorithms. The content analysis adds significant value by providing classification, keywords and factors that influence download behavior and user scores in a m-health context."
https://openalex.org/W3119197419,"With COVID-19 N95 shortages, frontline medical personnel are forced to reuse this disposable–but sophisticated–multilayer respirator. Widely used to decontaminate nonporous surfaces, UV-C light has demonstrated germicidal efficacy on porous, non-planar N95 respirators when all surfaces receive ≥1.0 J/cm 2 dose. Of utmost importance across disciplines, translation of empirical evidence to implementation relies upon UV-C measurements frequently confounded by radiometer complexities. To enable rigorous on-respirator measurements, we introduce a photochromic indicator dose quantification technique for: (1) UV-C treatment design and (2) in-process UV-C dose validation. While addressing outstanding indicator limitations of qualitative readout and insufficient dynamic range, our methodology establishes that color-changing dosimetry can achieve the necessary accuracy (&gt;90%), uncertainty (&lt;10%), and UV-C specificity (&gt;95%) required for UV-C dose measurements. In a measurement infeasible with radiometers, we observe a striking ~20× dose variation over N95s within one decontamination system. Furthermore, we adapt consumer electronics for accessible quantitative readout and use optical attenuators to extend indicator dynamic range &gt;10× to quantify doses relevant for N95 decontamination. By transforming photochromic indicators into quantitative dosimeters, we illuminate critical considerations for both photochromic indicators themselves and UV-C decontamination processes."
https://openalex.org/W3120335629,"To date, the effect of both fixed and time-varying individual, social, psychological, environmental, and behavioral characteristics on temporal growth trends in physical activity (PA) among younger individuals remains an under-studied topic. In this paper, we address this gap in previous work by examining how temporal growth trends in PA respond to changing social, environmental, and behavioral characteristics using a large sample of college students (N = 692) who participated in the NetHealth project at the University of Notre Dame and from which fine-grained longitudinal data on physical activity and social interaction were collected unobtrusively via the use of wearables for 637 days (August 16, 2015 to May 13, 2017). These data are augmented by periodic survey data on fixed sociodemographic and psychological variables. We estimate latent growth-curve models for daily activity status, steps, active minutes, and activity calories. We find evidence of both a generalized friendship paradox and a peer effect for PA, with the average PA level of study participants’ contacts being on average larger than their own, and with this average level exerting a statistically significant effect on individual PA levels. Notably, there was limited evidence of temporal growth in PA across the 637 days of observation with null temporal effects for three out of the four PA indicators, except for daily steps taken. Finally, we find that social, psychological, and behavioral factors (e.g., large network size, high extroversion levels, and more courses taken) are systematically associated with higher PA levels in this sample. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of social, environmental, and behavioral factors (such as peer networks and daily sociability) in modulating the dynamics of PA levels among college students."
https://openalex.org/W3120482658,"Threats posed by windstorms are an increasing concern to forest managers in the southern United States (US). Studies suggest that the southern US will experience an increase in the occurrence as well as the intensity of windstorms, such as hurricanes, in the future. However, forest managers may have difficulty preparing for this future because there is limited understanding of how windstorms affect the structure and composition of forests over the long term. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of Hurricane Ivan, which made landfall in September 2004 near Gulf Shore, Alabama, impacting forests in the western Florida Panhandle and southwestern Alabama. We acquired the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot data available for the period from 2002 to 2018 for the Ivan-affected area and classified the plots into 4 categories: (1). ND (No Disturbance), (2). NDBH (No Disturbance but Harvested), (3). ID (Disturbance caused by Hurricane Ivan), and (4). IDAH (Disturbance caused by Hurricane Ivan and Harvested). The plots that were damaged by Hurricane Ivan (ID and IDAH plots) had significantly (α = 0.05) (1) higher basal area, (2) higher quadratic mean diameter and height, (3) more diverse tree species composition (species richness and Shannon diversity index), (4) denser stocking of seedling and saplings, (5) lower proportion of dead trees or saplings, and (6) higher live aboveground biomass than the plots that were not damaged by the hurricane (ND and NDBH plots). Diverse stands were not necessarily more windstorm resistant. Species diversity in the overstory may not improve forest resistance to hurricane damage but may improve its resilience following the hurricane. The study suggests that managing stand structure through density management and stand improvement could be critical to windstorm resilience and resistance in the southern US forests."
https://openalex.org/W3118775858,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) rate is increasing in the U.S. The use of prescription and illicit opioids has continued to rise nationally in recent years as well. Opioids have been shown to have a deleterious effect on multiple types of cancer with recent data suggesting opium use as a risk factor for PC. Using national databases, we tested whether opioid usage pattern over time could explain the state and national-based variations in PC rates in the U.S. Opioid death rate (as a surrogate for prescription and illicit opioid use) was extracted from the CDCs Wonder online data through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Incidence of pancreatic cancer was retrieved from the online CDCs data base gathered from the U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group. Prevalence of obesity, tobacco and alcohol use was collected from Behavioral risk factor surveillance system. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test the association between levels of PC rate and opioid death/use rates during the years 1999–2016. A rise in PC was seen over time at the national and state levels. Similarly, the opioid death rates increased over time. Among other potential PC risk factors, only obesity prevalence showed an increase during the study period. A state’s opioid death rate at 4 years prior significantly predicted initial incidence of PC (β = 0.1848, p&lt;0.0001) and had a significant effect on the estimated annual change in the rate of PC (β = -.0193,p&lt;0.0001). Opioid use may be an un-identified risk factor contributing to the increasing incidence of PC in the U.S. These novel findings need to be verified by population-based studies."
https://openalex.org/W3120336012,"Scientific articles often contain relevant geographic information such as where field work was performed or where patients were treated. Most often, this information appears in the full-text article contents as a description in natural language including place names, with no accompanying machine-readable geographic metadata. Automatically extracting this geographic information could help conduct meta-analyses, find geographical research gaps, and retrieve articles using spatial search criteria. Research on this problem is still in its infancy, with many works manually processing corpora for locations and few cross-domain studies. In this paper, we develop a fully automatic pipeline to extract and represent relevant locations from scientific articles, applying it to two varied corpora. We obtain good performance, with full pipeline precision of 0.84 for an environmental corpus, and 0.78 for a biomedical corpus. Our results can be visualized as simple global maps, allowing human annotators to both explore corpus patterns in space and triage results for downstream analysis. Future work should not only focus on improving individual pipeline components, but also be informed by user needs derived from the potential spatial analysis and exploration of such corpora."
https://openalex.org/W3121084929,"Characterization of poultry microbiota is becoming increasingly important due to the growing need for microbiome-based interventions to improve poultry health and production performance. However, the lack of standardized protocols for sampling, sample processing, DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis can hinder data comparison between studies. Here, we investigated how the DNA extraction process affects microbial community compositions and diversity metrics in different chicken respiratory sample types including choanal and tracheal swabs, nasal cavity and tracheal washes, and lower respiratory lavage. We did a side-by-side comparison of the performances of Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue (BT) and ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep (ZB) kits. In general, samples extracted with the BT kit yielded higher concentrations of total DNA while those extracted with the ZB kit contained higher numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies per unit volume. Therefore, the samples were normalized to equal amounts of 16S rRNA gene copies prior to sequencing. For each sample type, all predominant bacterial taxa detected in samples extracted with one kit were present in replicate samples extracted with the other kit and did not show significant differences at the class level. However, a few differentially abundant shared taxa were observed at family and genus levels. Furthermore, between-kit differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics at the amplicon sequence variant level were statistically indistinguishable. Therefore, both kits perform similarly in terms of 16S rRNA gene-based poultry microbiome analysis for the sample types analyzed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3118790240,"Human perception is based on expectations. We expect visual upright and gravity upright, sensed through vision, vestibular and other sensory systems, to agree. Equally, we expect that visual and vestibular information about self-motion will correspond. What happens when these assumptions are violated? Tilting a person from upright so that gravity is not where it should be impacts both visually induced self-motion (vection) and the perception of upright. How might the two be connected? Using virtual reality, we varied the strength of visual orientation cues, and hence the probability of participants experiencing a visual reorientation illusion (VRI) in which visual cues to orientation dominate gravity, using an oriented corridor and a starfield while also varying head-on-trunk orientation and body posture. The effectiveness of the optic flow in simulating self-motion was assessed by how much visual motion was required to evoke the perception that the participant had reached the position of a previously presented target. VRI was assessed by questionnaire When participants reported higher levels of VRI they also required less visual motion to evoke the sense of traveling through a given distance, regardless of head or body posture, or the type of visual environment. We conclude that experiencing a VRI, in which visual-vestibular conflict is resolved and the direction of upright is reinterpreted, affects the effectiveness of optic flow at simulating motion through the environment. Therefore, any apparent effect of head or body posture or type of environment are largely indirect effects related instead, to the level of VRI experienced by the observer. We discuss potential mechanisms for this such as reinterpreting gravity information or altering the weighting of orientation cues."
https://openalex.org/W3119335223,"Introduction The global tobacco epidemic contributes to more than 8 million deaths annually. However, most tobacco control interventions have been driven by an emphasis on smoked tobacco. Globally and more so in Nigeria, less attention has been paid to the similarly harmful smokeless tobacco (SLT) whose use appeals to a different demography. We examined the prevalence, patterns of use and correlates of SLT in Nigerian adults to guide targeted control efforts. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2012 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) data. We obtained data on 9,765 non-institutionalised adults aged 15 years and older. Variables included current SLT use, sociodemographic characteristics and perceived harm of SLT use. We used Chi-square test to examine associations and binary logistic regression to assess predictors of current SLT use. All analyses were conducted with sample-weighted data. Results The prevalence of current SLT use was 1.9% of all adults. About 1.4% were daily users. The main types were snuff by nose (1.6%) and snuff by mouth (0.8%). There were higher odds of current SLT use for those in the South-East region (aOR = 13.99; 95% CI: 4.45–43.95), rural area residents (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04–2.35), males (aOR = 4.43; 95% CI: 2.75–7.11), the 45–64 years age-group (aOR = 10.00; 95% CI: 4.12–24.29), those with no formal education (aOR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.01–7.05), and those with no perception of harm from SLT use (aOR = 3.81, 95% CI: 2.61–5.56). Conclusion The prevalence of SLT use among Nigerian adults was low with clearly identified predictors. While a majority were aware of harm from SLT use, an unacceptably high proportion remain unaware. We recommended targeted interventions to increase awareness of the harmful effects of SLT use especially among residents of the South-East, those in rural areas, males, and individuals with no formal education. We also recommended a follow-up survey."
https://openalex.org/W3119723141,"ST266 is the biological secretome of cultured Amnion-derived Multipotent Progenitor cells containing multiple growth factors and cytokines. While intranasally-administered ST266 improves the phenotype in experimental optic neuritis, specific ST266 components mediating these effects are not known. We compared the effects of ST266 with and without removal of large molecular weight proteins both in vitro and in the multiple sclerosis model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were treated daily with intranasal vehicle, ST266 or lower molecular weight fraction of ST266. Retinal ganglion cells were counted in isolated retinas, and optic nerves were assessed for inflammation and demyelination. ST266 treatment significantly improved retinal ganglion cell survival and reduced optic nerve demyelination in EAE mice. The lower molecular weight ST266 fraction significantly improved optic nerve demyelination, but only showed a trend towards improved retinal ganglion cell survival. ST266 fractions below 50kDa increased Schwann cell proliferation in vitro, but were less effective than non-fractionated ST266. Demyelination attenuation was partially associated with the lower molecular weight ST266 fraction, but removal of higher molecular weight biomolecules from ST266 diminishes its neuroprotective effects, suggesting at least some high molecular weight proteins play a role in ST266-mediated neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W3119931259,"The loss of biodiversity—caused mainly by habitat destruction—is one of the environmental problems with major repercussions on ecosystem functioning. Nevertheless, our understanding of the functional consequences of habitat changes on the communities and ecosystems remains limited to a small number of case studies. We evaluated the change in taxonomic and functional diversity of copro-necrophagous beetles (Scarabaeinae) and their relationship with the varying environmental factors present in four habitats with different degrees of disturbance. Furthermore, we evaluated how changes in taxonomic and functional diversity affect the rates of excrement removal. The collections were carried out at four locations in the state of Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil, on natural systems with different degrees of disturbances (forests in advanced and initial succession) and agroecosystems (silviculture and pastures dedicated to livestock). We collected a total of 1266 dung beetles distributed in 35 species and classified into 11 functional groups. The taxonomic and functional diversity analyses showed that habitats that still maintain an arboreal stratum do not present differences between them, in contrast to habitats dedicated to livestock where there was a significant loss of species and functional groups. The distance between the trees, as well as the air and soil temperatures were determining factors in the selection of species and functional groups. Some of these environmental factors explain the differences in functional traits, represented as varying abundances of the species found. The rates of manure removal from the ecosystem were positively correlated to taxonomic and functional richness as well as biomass of beetles. Thus, we can conclude that habitats with tree strata have the capacity to preserve a larger proportion of the regional set of species as well as the important ones, while preserving the taxonomic and functional diversity and the ecosystem functions, such as the excrement removal rate."
https://openalex.org/W3120077972,"The participation of automated software agents known as social bots within online social network (OSN) engagements continues to grow at an immense pace. Choruses of concern speculate as to the impact social bots have within online communications as evidence shows that an increasing number of individuals are turning to OSNs as a primary source for information. This automated interaction proliferation within OSNs has led to the emergence of social bot detection efforts to better understand the extent and behavior of social bots. While rapidly evolving and continually improving, current social bot detection efforts are quite varied in their design and performance characteristics. Therefore, social bot research efforts that rely upon only a single bot detection source will produce very limited results. Our study expands beyond the limitation of current social bot detection research by introducing an ensemble bot detection coverage framework that harnesses the power of multiple detection sources to detect a wider variety of bots within a given OSN corpus of Twitter data. To test this framework, we focused on identifying social bot activity within OSN interactions taking place on Twitter related to the 2018 U.S. Midterm Election by using three available bot detection sources. This approach clearly showed that minimal overlap existed between the bot accounts detected within the same tweet corpus. Our findings suggest that social bot research efforts must incorporate multiple detection sources to account for the variety of social bots operating in OSNs, while incorporating improved or new detection methods to keep pace with the constant evolution of bot complexity."

The participants comprised 563 children from four Chinese kindergartens (4.41±0.96) whose parents reported measures of parent-child attachment, parental involvement, psychological Suzhi, and good behavior habits in their children. The results indicated that (1) Parental attachment, parental involvement and psychological Suzhi were positively correlated with good behavior habits of young children; (2) Parental involvement and psychological Suzhi mediated the relationship between parent-child attachment and good behavior habits in children separately; (3) Parent-child attachment indirectly affected children's good behavior habits through the path of ""parental involvement and psychological Suzhi."""
https://openalex.org/W3120204199,"Objectives The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic. Methods We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (&lt; one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year. Results Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4–6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31–38% of the population, within 3–4 months of initial relaxation. Conclusion Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3120422731,"Leaf angle of maize is a fundamental determinant of plant architecture and an important trait influencing photosynthetic efficiency and crop yields. To broaden our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of leaf angle formation, we constructed a F 3:4 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population to map QTL for leaf angle. The RIL was derived from a cross between a model inbred line (B73) with expanded leaf architecture and an elite inbred line (Zheng58) with compact leaf architecture. A sum of eight QTL were detected on chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8. Single QTL explained 4.3 to 14.2% of the leaf angle variance. Additionally, some important QTL were confirmed through a heterogeneous inbred family (HIF) approach. Furthermore, twenty-four candidate genes for leaf angle were predicted through whole-genome re-sequencing and expression analysis in qLA02-01and qLA08-01 regions. These results will be helpful to elucidate the genetic mechanism of leaf angle formation in maize and benefit to clone the favorable allele for leaf angle. Besides, this will be helpful to develop the novel maize varieties with ideal plant architecture through marker-assisted selection."
https://openalex.org/W3046526887,"Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease, as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variability."
https://openalex.org/W3119609482,"The ectomycorrhizal fungal symbiont Cenococcum geophilum is of high interest as it is globally distributed, associates with many plant species, and has resistance to multiple environmental stressors. C . geophilum is only known from asexual states but is often considered a cryptic species complex, since extreme phylogenetic divergence is often observed within nearly morphologically identical strains. Alternatively, C . geophilum may represent a highly diverse single species, which would suggest cryptic but frequent recombination. Here we describe a new isolate collection of 229 C . geophilum isolates from soils under Populus trichocarpa at 123 collection sites spanning a ~283 mile north-south transect in Western Washington and Oregon, USA (PNW). To further understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within C . geophilum , we performed maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to assess divergence within the PNW isolate collection, as well as a global phylogenetic analysis of 789 isolates with publicly available data from the United States, Japan, and European countries. Phylogenetic analyses of the PNW isolates revealed three distinct phylogenetic groups, with 15 clades that strongly resolved at &gt;80% bootstrap support based on a GAPDH phylogeny and one clade segregating strongly in two principle component analyses. The abundance and representation of PNW isolate clades varied greatly across the North-South range, including a monophyletic group of isolates that spanned nearly the entire gradient at ~250 miles. A direct comparison between the GAPDH and ITS rRNA gene region phylogenies, combined with additional analyses revealed stark incongruence between the ITS and GAPDH gene regions, consistent with intra-species recombination between PNW isolates. In the global isolate collection phylogeny, 34 clades were strongly resolved using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches (at &gt;80% MLBS and &gt;0.90 BPP respectively), with some clades having intra- and intercontinental distributions. Together these data are highly suggestive of divergence within multiple cryptic species, however additional analyses such as higher resolution genotype-by-sequencing approaches are needed to distinguish potential species boundaries and the mode and tempo of recombination patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3120027619,"Loss in the availability of early successional habitat is a threat to pollinator populations. Given that powerline rights-of-way (ROW) must be managed to maintain early successional habitat, preventing vegetation from interfering with electrical lines, they have the potential to provide conservation benefits for wild pollinators. Moreover, it is possible to provide conservation benefits with no additional cost to land managers. We surveyed flower-visiting insects over two years in different vegetation management treatments in a long-term research ROW to determine which best promoted pollinator abundance and species richness. We found that the ROW had stabilized in an early successional state soon after its establishment and that this early successional state could be maintained with low levels of periodic maintenance. We collected a high diversity of flower-visiting insects (126 bee species and 179 non-bee morphospecies) in six ROW plots. Higher levels of herbicide application had a negative effect on bee species richness, but low levels of herbicide application were compatible with a high abundance and species richness of flower-visiting insects, including several rare species. Moreover, this effect was seen only in the bee community, and not in non-bee flower-visiting insects. Our results suggest further research into the conservation value of ROW for pollinators is warranted. We demonstrate that there is substantial potential for pollinator conservation in ROW, compatible with low-cost vegetation management."
https://openalex.org/W3120569360,"This study aimed to investigate the long-term changes in awareness of and knowledge about mother-to-child infections across 6 years in Japan. A questionnaire survey was conducted at our facility from October 2012 to January 2018, and the study periods were divided into 4 phases comprising 16 months each. A multiple-choice questionnaire assessed participants’ awareness of the following 13 pathogens of mother-to-child infections: cytomegalovirus (CMV), Toxoplasma gondii ( T . gondii ), hepatitis B virus, rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T cell leukemia virus type-1, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus, Chlamydia trachomatis , and Treponema pallidum . For the selected four pathogens (i.e., CMV, rubella virus, T . gondii , and parvovirus B19), the questionnaire also evaluated participants’ knowledge of transmission routes, the most susceptible time of infection that could yield severe fetal disease during pregnancy, the maximum frequency of fetal infection in cases of maternal infection, and methods to prevent maternal infection. In total, 1433 pregnant Japanese women were included in this study. There was no secular change in awareness of the pathogens concerning mother-to-child infections over time, and we also clarified that the detailed knowledge of the four pathogens of typical mother-to-child infections did not improve. Since knowledge about methods to prevent maternal infection is still insufficient for all pathogens, further advocacy is required to prevent mother-to-child infections."
https://openalex.org/W3014098901,"Background There is a lack of accurate information on the prevalence and causes of musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) in low income countries. The WHO prevalence estimate does not help plan services for specific national income levels or countries. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence, impact, causes and factors associated with musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi. We wished to undertake a national cluster randomized survey of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi, one of the UN Least Developed Countries (LDC), that involved a reliable sampling methodology with a case definition and diagnostic criteria that could clearly be related to the classification system used in the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Methods A sample size of 1,481 households was calculated using data from the latest national census and an expected prevalence based on similar surveys conducted in Rwanda and Cameroon. We randomly selected clusters across the whole country through probability proportional to size sampling with an urban/rural and demographic split that matched the distribution of the population. In the field, randomization of households in a cluster was based on a ground bottle spin. All household members present were screened, and all MSI cases identified were examined in more detail by medical students under supervision, using a standardized interview and examination protocol. Data collection was carried out from 1st July to 30th August 2016. Extrapolation was done based on study size compared to the population of Malawi. MSI severity was classified using the parameters for the percentage of function outlined in the WHO International Classification of Functioning (ICF). A loss of function of 5–24% was mild, 25–49% was moderate and 50–90% was severe. The Malawian version of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire was used, and EQ-5D index scores were calculated using population values from Zimbabwe, as a population value set for Malawi is not currently available. Chi-square test was used to test categorical variables. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated with a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender, location and education. Results A total of 8,801 individuals were enumerated in 1,481 households. Of the 8,548 participants that were screened and examined (response rate of 97.1%), 810 cases of MSI were diagnosed of which 18% (108) had mild, 54% (329) had moderate and 28% (167) had severe MSI as classified by ICF. There was an overall prevalence of MSI of 9.5% (CI 8.9–10.1). The prevalence of MSI increased with age, and was similar in men (9.3%) and women (9.6%). People without formal education were more likely to have MSI [13.3% (CI 11.8–14.8)] compared to those with formal education levels [8.9% (CI 8.1–9.7), p&lt;0.001] for primary school and [5.9% (4.6–7.2), p&lt;0.001] for secondary school. Overall, 33.2% of MSIs were due to congenital causes, 25.6% were neurological in origin, 19.2% due to acquired non-traumatic non-infective causes, 16.8% due to trauma and 5.2% due to infection. Extrapolation of these findings indicated that there are approximately one million cases of MSI in Malawi that need further treatment. MSI had a profound impact on quality of life. Analysis of disaggregated quality of life measures using EQ-5D showed clear correlation with the ICF class. A large proportion of patients with moderate and severe MSI were confined to bed, unable to wash or undress or unable to perform usual daily activities. Conclusion This study has uncovered a high prevalence of MSI in Malawi and its profound impact on a large proportion of the population. These findings suggest that MSI places a considerable strain on social and financial structures in this low-income country. The Quality of Life of those with severe MSI is considerably affected. The huge burden of musculoskeletal impairment in Malawi is mostly unattended, revealing an urgent need to scale up surgical and rehabilitation services in the country."

https://openalex.org/W3118535139,"A traceable biomarker is a member of a disease's molecular pathway. A disease may be associated with several molecular pathways. Each different combination of these molecular pathways, to which detected traceable biomarkers belong, may serve as an indicative of the elicitation of the disease at a different time frame in the future. Based on this notion, we introduce a novel methodology for personalizing an individual's degree of future susceptibility to a specific disease. We implemented the methodology in a working system called Susceptibility Degree to a Disease Predictor (SDDP). For a specific disease d, let S be the set of molecular pathways, to which traceable biomarkers detected from most patients of d belong. For the same disease d, let S' be the set of molecular pathways, to which traceable biomarkers detected from a certain individual belong. SDDP is able to infer the subset S'' ⊆{S-S'} of undetected molecular pathways for the individual. Thus, SDDP can infer undetected molecular pathways of a disease for an individual based on few molecular pathways detected from the individual. SDDP can also help in inferring the combination of molecular pathways in the set {S'+S''}, whose traceable biomarkers collectively is an indicative of the disease. SDDP is composed of the following four components: information extractor, interrelationship between molecular pathways modeler, logic inferencer, and risk indicator. The information extractor takes advantage of the exponential increase of biomedical literature to automatically extract the common traceable biomarkers for a specific disease. The interrelationship between molecular pathways modeler models the hierarchical interrelationships between the molecular pathways of the traceable biomarkers. The logic inferencer transforms the hierarchical interrelationships between the molecular pathways into rule-based specifications. It employs the specification rules and the inference rules for predicate logic to infer as many as possible undetected molecular pathways of a disease for an individual. The risk indicator outputs a risk indicator value that reflects the individual's degree of future susceptibility to the disease. We evaluated SDDP by comparing it experimentally with other methods. Results revealed marked improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3118646370,"Background Preterm delivery is a common pregnancy complication that can result in significant neonatal morbidity and mortality. Limited tools exist to predict preterm birth, and none to predict neonatal morbidity, from early in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine if the progesterone metabolites 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 16-alpha hydroxyprogesterone (16α-OHP), when combined with patient demographic and obstetric history known during the pregnancy, are predictive of preterm delivery-associated neonatal morbidity, neonatal length of stay, and risk for spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks’ gestation. Methods and findings We conducted a cohort study of pregnant women with plasma samples collected as part of Building Blocks of Pregnancy Biobank at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The progesterone metabolites, DOC and 16α-OHP, were quantified by mass spectroscopy from the plasma of 58 pregnant women collected in the late first trimester/early second trimester. Steroid levels were combined with patient demographic and obstetric history data in multivariable logistic regression models. The primary outcome was composite neonatal morbidity as measured by the Hassan scale. Secondary outcomes included neonatal length of stay and spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks’ gestation. The final neonatal morbidity model, which incorporated antenatal corticosteroid exposure and fetal sex, was able to predict high morbidity (Hassan score ≥ 2) with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.975 (95% CI 0.932, 1.00), while the model without corticosteroid and fetal sex predictors demonstrated an AUROC of 0.927 (95% CI 0.824, 1.00). The Hassan score was highly correlated with neonatal length of stay (p&lt;0.001), allowing the neonatal morbidity model to also predict increased neonatal length of stay (53 [IQR 22, 76] days vs. 4.5 [2, 31] days, above and below the model cut point, respectively; p = 0.0017). Spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks’ gestation was also predicted with an AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.869, 1.00). Conclusions Plasma levels of DOC and 16α-OHP in early gestation can be combined with patient demographic and clinical data to predict significant neonatal morbidity, neonatal length of stay, and risk for very preterm delivery, though validation studies are needed to verify these findings. Early identification of pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery and neonatal morbidity allows for timely implementation of multidisciplinary care to improve perinatal outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3119707978,"In this study, hierarchies of probabilistic models are evaluated for their ability to characterize the untemplated addition of adenine and uracil to the 3’ ends of mitochondrial mRNAs of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei , and for their generative abilities to reproduce populations of these untemplated adenine/uridine “tails”. We determined the most ideal Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for this biological system. While our HMMs were not able to generatively reproduce the length distribution of the tails, they fared better in reproducing nucleotide composition aspects of the tail populations. The HMMs robustly identified distinct states of nucleotide addition that correlate to experimentally verified tail nucleotide composition differences. However they also identified a surprising subclass of tails among the ND1 gene transcript populations that is unexpected given the current idea of sequential enzymatic action of untemplated tail addition in this system. Therefore, these models can not only be utilized to reflect biological states that we already know about, they can also identify hypotheses to be experimentally tested. Finally, our HMMs supplied a way to correct a portion of the sequencing errors present in our data. Importantly, these models constitute rare simple pedagogical examples of applied bioinformatic HMMs, due to their binary emissions."

Knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity and biological processes within wetlands provides essential baseline data for predicting and mitigating the effects of present and future environmental change on these critical ecosystems. To explore the potential for environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide such insights, we used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to characterise prokaryote communities and predict the distribution of prokaryote metabolic pathways in peats and sediments up to 4m below the surface across seven New Zealand wetlands. Our results reveal distinct vertical structuring of prokaryote communities and metabolic pathways in these wetlands. We also find evidence for differences in the relative abundance of certain metabolic pathways that may correspond to the degree of anthropogenic modification the wetlands have experienced. These patterns, specifically those for pathways related to aerobic respiration and the carbon cycle, can be explained predominantly by the expected effects of wetland drainage. Our study demonstrates that eDNA has the potential to be an important new tool for the assessment and monitoring of wetland health."

To enhance IF7 stability in vivo, we undertook mirror-image peptide phage display using a synthetic D-peptide representing the ANXA1 N-terminus as target. We then identified peptide sequences, synthesized them as D-amino acids, and designated the resulting peptide dTIT7, which we showed bound to the ANXA1 N-terminus. Whole body imaging of mouse brain tumor models injected with near infrared fluorescent IRDye-conjugated dTIT7 showed fluorescent signals in brain and kidney. Furthermore, orally-administered dTIT7/geldanamycin (GA) conjugates suppressed brain tumor growth.

https://openalex.org/W3120551187,"The objective of this study was to describe the care pathway of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) based on real-life textual data from a regional coordination network, the Ile-de-France ALS network. This coordination network provides care for 92% of patients diagnosed with ALS living in Ile-de-France. We developed a modular ontology (OntoPaRON) for the automatic processing of these unstructured textual data. OntoPaRON has different modules: the core, medical, socio-environmental, coordination, and consolidation modules. Our approach was unique in its creation of fully defined concepts at different levels of the modular ontology to address specific topics relating to healthcare trajectories. We also created a semantic annotation tool specific to the French language and the specificities of our corpus, the Ontology-Based Semantic Annotation Module (OnBaSAM), using the OntoPaRON ontology as a reference. We used these tools to annotate the records of 928 patients automatically. The semantic (qualitative) annotations of the concepts were transformed into quantitative data. By using these pipelines we were able to transform unstructured textual data into structured quantitative data. Based on data processing, semantic annotations, sociodemographic data for the patient and clinical variables, we found that the need and demand for human and technical assistance depend on the initial form of the disease, the motor state, and the patient age. The presence of exhaustion in care management, is related to the patient’s motor and cognitive state."

Materials and methods This study consisted of 51 patients with astrocytic brain tumors who underwent perfusion-weighted MRI with MultiHance® at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg prior to initial surgery. We measured the mean rCBV, the 5% &amp; 10% maximum rCBV, and the variation of rCBV in the tumors. Comparisons were made between patients with and without 2-year survival using two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the continuous data, or chi-square and Fisher exact tests for categorical data. The multivariate cox-proportional hazard regression was fit to evaluate the association between rCBV and overall survival time, with adjustment for clinical factors. Results Patients who survived less than 2 years after diagnosis had a higher mean and maximum rCBV and a larger variation of rCBV. After adjusting for clinical factors including therapeutic measures, we found no significant association of overall survival time within 2 years with any of these rCBV values. Conclusions Although patients who survived less than 2 years had a higher mean and maximum rCBV and a larger variation of rCBV, rCBV itself may not be used independently for predicting 2-year survival of patients with astrocytic brain tumors."

However, even with fluoroscopic guidance, uncertainty about the distance between the needle tip and the epidural space can remain. Using the contralateral oblique (CLO) view, determination of the epidural space can be easier with clearer identification of the interlaminar opening. We inserted the needle at the midpoint of the interlaminar opening on the fluoroscopic anteroposterior (AP) view and made the needle oriented toward the pedicle of the target side. Then, CLO view was created by rotating the intensifier approximately 45 degrees to the contralateral side of the target. Through the CLO view, the ventral interlaminar line (VILL) was confirmed and the needle was able to enter the epidural space more easily. The medical records of 29 patients who were conducted MIL approach using CLO view were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this procedure. The accessibility to the ventral epidural space was 93.1%. There was no procedure-related complication. Using CLO view, uncertainty can be reduced during the MIL approach, which in turn shortens procedure time and improves safety."
