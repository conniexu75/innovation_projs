https://openalex.org/W2027563442,"Background The integration of graphene in photovoltaic modules, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and devices for hydrogen generation offers opportunities to tackle challenges driven by the increasing global energy demand. Graphene’s two-dimensional (2D) nature leads to a theoretical surface-to-mass ratio of ~2600 m 2 /g, which combined with its high electrical conductivity and flexibility, gives it the potential to store electric charge, ions, or hydrogen. Other 2D crystals, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal oxides, are also promising and are now gaining increasing attention for energy applications. The advantage of using such 2D crystals is linked to the possibility of creating and designing layered artificial structures with “on-demand” properties by means of spin-on processes, or layer-by-layer assembly. This approach exploits the availability of materials with metallic, semiconducting, and insulating properties. Advances The success of graphene and related materials (GRMs) for energy applications crucially depends on the development and optimization of production methods. High-volume liquid-phase exfoliation is being developed for a wide variety of layered materials. This technique is being optimized to control the flake size and to increase the edge-to-surface ratio, which is crucial for optimizing electrode performance in fuel cells and batteries. Micro- or nanocrystal or flake edge control can also be achieved through chemical synthesis. This is an ideal route for functionalization, in order to improve storage capacity. Large-area growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated, producing material with high structural and electronic quality for the preparation of transparent conducting electrodes for displays and touch-screens, and is being evaluated for photovoltaic applications. CVD growth of other multicomponent layered materials is less mature and needs further development. Although many transfer techniques have been developed successfully, further improvement of high-volume manufacturing and transfer processes for multilayered heterostructures is needed. In this context, layer-by-layer assembly may enable the realization of devices with on-demand properties for targeted applications, such as photovoltaic devices in which photon absorption in TMDs is combined with charge transport in graphene. Outlook Substantial progress has been made on the preparation of GRMs at the laboratory level. However, cost-effective production of GRMs on an industrial scale is needed to create the future energy value chain. Applications that could benefit the most from GRMs include flexible electronics, batteries with efficient anodes and cathodes, supercapacitors with high energy density, and solar cells. The realization of GRMs with specific transport and insulating properties on demand is an important goal. Additional energy applications of GRMs comprise water splitting and hydrogen production. As an example, the edges of MoS 2 single layers can oxidize fuels—such as hydrogen, methanol, and ethanol—in fuel cells, and GRM membranes can be used in fuel cells to improve proton exchange. Functionalized graphene can be exploited for water splitting and hydrogen production. Flexible and wearable devices and membranes incorporating GRMs can also generate electricity from motion, as well as from water and gas flows. Tailored GRMs for energy applications. The ability to produce GRMs with desired specific properties paves the way to their integration in a variety of energy devices. Solution processing and chemical vapor deposition are the ideal means to produce thin films that can be used as electrodes in energy devices (such as solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, or in hydrogen storage). Chemical synthesis is an attractive route to produce “active” elements in solar cell or thermoelectric devices."

Tomasetti and Vogelstein conclude that these differences can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions. By plotting the lifetime incidence of various cancers against the estimated number of normal stem cell divisions in the corresponding tissues over a lifetime, they found a strong correlation extending over five orders of magnitude. This suggests that random errors occurring during DNA replication in normal stem cells are a major contributing factor in cancer development. Remarkably, this “bad luck” component explains a far greater number of cancers than do hereditary and environmental factors. Science , this issue p. 78"
https://openalex.org/W2136104403,"Variation in vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito species is determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and life history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial capacity and explore new avenues for vector control, we sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito species from diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution. Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss, elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron losses, relative to Drosophila. Some determinants of vectorial capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes. This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to their flexible capacity to take advantage of new ecological niches, including adapting to humans as primary hosts."

This has been true for decades—even though biochemical assays have long since descended into microgram territory—and results in part from the constraints of characterization methods. Buitrago Santanilla et al. present an automated dosing and characterization protocol for optimizing chemical reaction conditions on the microgram scale. This allowed them to screen numerous base and ligand combinations for catalytic C-N bond-forming reactions between complex pairs of compounds, in short supply, that resisted standard coupling conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1978680299,"Energy conversion in complex 1 ATP, the energy source of the cell, is synthesized by a protein residing in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The synthesis is driven by a proton gradient generated by redox reactions that transfer electrons between a series of enzymes in the membrane. The largest complex in this electron transfer chain is the 1-MD complex 1. It couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the translocation of four protons. Zickermann et al. report the crystal structure of a complex comprising the 14 central subunits and the largest accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex 1 from a yeast-genetic model at 3.6 Å resolution. The structure identifies four potential proton translocation pathways and gives insight into how energy from the redox reactions is transmitted to drive proton pumping. Science , this issue p. 44"
https://openalex.org/W2080001285,"Natural competence for transformation is a common mode of horizontal gene transfer and contributes to bacterial evolution. Transformation occurs through the uptake of external DNA and its integration into the genome. Here we show that the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which serves as a predatory killing device, is part of the competence regulon in the naturally transformable pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The T6SS-encoding gene cluster is under the positive control of the competence regulators TfoX and QstR and is induced by growth on chitinous surfaces. Live-cell imaging revealed that deliberate killing of nonimmune cells via competence-mediated induction of T6SS releases DNA and makes it accessible for horizontal gene transfer in V. cholerae."

Zhang et al. noticed that the fat layers in the skin of mice thickened after inoculation with the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (see the Perspective by Alcorn and Kolls). Mutant mice incapable of forming new fat cells were more susceptible to infection. The differentiating fat cells secreted a small-molecule peptide called cathelicidin, specifically in response to the infection. By contrast, mature fat cells produce less cathelicidin, and are thus less protective. Science , this issue p. 67 ; see also p. 26"
https://openalex.org/W1985387528,"Tagging truncated proteins with CAT tails During the translation of a messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein, ribosomes can sometimes stall. Truncated proteins thus formed can be toxic to the cell and must be destroyed. Shen et al. show that the proteins Ltn1p and Rqc2p, subunits of the ribosome quality control complex, bind to the stalled and partially disassembled ribosome. Ltn1p, a ubiquitin ligase, binds near the nascent polypeptide exit tunnel on the ribosome, well placed to tag the truncated protein for destruction. The Rqc2p protein interacts with the transfer RNA binding sites on the partial ribosome and recruits alanine- and threonine-bearing tRNAs. Rqc2p then catalyzes the addition of these amino acids onto the unfinished protein, in the absence of both the fully assembled ribosome and mRNA. These so-called CAT tails may promote the heat shock response, which helps buffer against malformed proteins. Science , this issue p. 75"

https://openalex.org/W2136704793,"Lysosomes signal the nucleus to control aging Folick et al. propose a mechanism by which a lysosomal enzyme influences nuclear events that control longevity in the worm (see the Perspective by Shuo and Brunet). Increased expression of the lysosomal acid lipase LIPL-4 increased longevity, and this effect depended on the presence of the lysosomal lipid-binding protein LBP-8. LBP-8 acts as a chaperone that helps carry lipds to the nucleus. The authors identified the fatty acid oleoylethanolamide (OEA) as a potential signaling molecule whose transport to the nucleus could activate nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors NHR-49 and NHR-80. The transcriptional targets of NHR-49 and NHR-80 in turn regulate longevity. Science , this issue p. 83"
https://openalex.org/W2035549583,"The dehydroformylation of aldehydes to generate olefins occurs during the biosynthesis of various sterols, including cholesterol in humans. Here, we implement a synthetic version that features the transfer of a formyl group and hydride from an aldehyde substrate to a strained olefin acceptor. A Rhodium (Xantphos)(benzoate) catalyst activates aldehyde carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds with high chemoselectivity to trigger carbon-carbon (C-C) bond cleavage and generate olefins at low loadings (0.3 to 2 mole percent) and temperatures (22° to 80°C). This mild protocol can be applied to various natural products and was used to achieve a three-step synthesis of (+)-yohimbenone. A study of the mechanism reveals that the benzoate counterion acts as a proton shuttle to enable transfer hydroformylation."
https://openalex.org/W1977041591,"Targeting EV-D68, a respiratory virus A recent outbreak of respiratory illness in U.S. children was caused by entorovirus D68 (EV-D68). Enteroviruses also include human pathogens such as human rhinovirus, which causes the common cold, and poliovirus. Most of these viruses are stabilized by a factor that binds in a hydrophobic pocket of the capsid protein VP1, and antiviral compounds can act by displacing this factor. Liu et al. report the crystal structure of EV-D68 and its complex with the antiviral compound peconaril. In EV-D68, the hydrophobic pocket contained a fatty acid that was displaced by peconaril. Peconaril efficiently inhibited EV-D68 infection of cells, making it a possible drug candidate against EV-D68. Science , this issue p. 71"
https://openalex.org/W1990873429,"Molecular cloning is utilized in nearly every facet of biological and medical research. We have developed a method, termed Hot Fusion, to efficiently clone one or multiple DNA fragments into plasmid vectors without the use of ligase. The method is directional, produces seamless junctions and is not dependent on the availability of restriction sites for inserts. Fragments are assembled based on shared homology regions of 17–30 bp at the junctions, which greatly simplifies the construct design. Hot Fusion is carried out in a one-step, single tube reaction at 50°C for one hour followed by cooling to room temperature. In addition to its utility for multi-fragment assembly Hot Fusion provides a highly efficient method for cloning DNA fragments containing inverted repeats for applications such as RNAi. The overall cloning efficiency is in the order of 90–95%."

Usually, a given collision bounces the participants right back out again, either in their original form or with the atoms shuffled around into distinct products. In certain cases, the reacting partners experience a brief lull, termed a resonance, before they rearrange. Yang et al. report the discovery of particularly short-lived resonances in certain reactive collisions of chlorine atoms with vibrationally excited hydrogen deuteride (HD). Their results suggest that similar, as yet overlooked, resonances may lurk in other reactions of vibrationally excited molecules. Science , this issue p. 60"
https://openalex.org/W1976056134,"P450 2D6 contributes significantly to the metabolism of >15% of the 200 most marketed drugs. Open and closed crystal structures of P450 2D6 thioridazine complexes were obtained using different crystallization conditions. The protonated piperidine moiety of thioridazine forms a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond with Asp-301 in the active sites of both complexes. The more open conformation exhibits a second molecule of thioridazine bound in an expanded substrate access channel antechamber with its piperidine moiety forming a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond with Glu-222. Incubation of the crystalline open thioridazine complex with alternative ligands, prinomastat, quinidine, quinine, or ajmalicine, displaced both thioridazines. Quinine and ajmalicine formed charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds with Glu-216, whereas the protonated nitrogen of quinidine is equidistant from Asp-301 and Glu-216 with protonated nitrogen H-bonded to a water molecule in the access channel. Prinomastat is not ionized. Adaptations of active site side-chain rotamers and polypeptide conformations were evident between the complexes, with the binding of ajmalicine eliciting a closure of the open structure reflecting in part the inward movement of Glu-216 to form a hydrogen bond with ajmalicine as well as sparse lattice restraints that would hinder adaptations. These results indicate that P450 2D6 exhibits sufficient elasticity within the crystal lattice to allow the passage of compounds between the active site and bulk solvent and to adopt a more closed form that adapts for binding alternative ligands with different degrees of closure. These crystals provide a means to characterize substrate and inhibitor binding to the enzyme after replacement of thioridazine with alternative compounds.

Many therapeutic drugs that are positively charged at physiologic pH undergo metabolic clearance by liver P450 2Cytochrome (or P450) is a generic term for a cytochrome P450 enzyme; individual P450s are identified using a number-letter-number format based on amino acid sequence relatedness. 2D6. These cationic drugs include thioridazine and other therapeutics that target the central nervous or cardiovascular systems (1.Wang B. Yang L.P. Zhang X.Z. Huang S.Q. Bartlam M. Zhou S.F. New insights into the structural characteristics and functional relevance of the human cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme.Drug Metab. Rev. 2009; 41: 573-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The prominence of P450 2D6 in the metabolism of cationic drugs is thought to reflect interactions of cationic substrates with the active site anionic amino acid side chains of Glu-216 and Asp-301, which are likely to orient substrates for metabolism. Thioridazine is a phenothiazine, antipsychotic drug that was widely used for treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis. P450 2D6 catalyzes the sulfoxidation of thioridazine (2.von Bahr C. Movin G. Nordin C. Lidén A. Hammarlund-Udenaes M. Hedberg A. Ring H. Sjöqvist F. Plasma levels of thioridazine and metabolites are influenced by the debrisoquine hydroxylation phenotype.Clin. Pharmacol.

It has been reported that these metabolites are more potent than thioridazine and may contribute to thioridazine's therapeutic effects (4.Niedzwiecki D.M. Mailman R.B. Cubeddu L.X. Greater potency of mesoridazine and sulforidazine compared with the parent compound, thioridazine, on striatal dopamine autoreceptors.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 228: 636-639PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of thioridazine by P450 2D6 at C7 has also been reported and can lead reactive products trapped as glutathione adducts (5.Wen B. Zhou M. Metabolic activation of the phenothiazine antipsychotics chlorpromazine and thioridazine to electrophilic iminoquinone species in human liver microsomes and recombinant P450s.Chem. Biol. Interact. 2009; 181: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thioridazine is used as a racemate, and P450 2D6 contributes extensively to the clearance of both enantiomers (6.Eap C.B. Guentert T.W. Schãublin-Loidl M. Stabl M. Koeb L. Powell K. Baumann P. Plasma levels of the enantiomers of thioridazine, thioridazine 2-sulfoxide, thioridazine 2-sulfone, and thioridazine 5-sulfoxide in poor and extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan and mephenytoin.Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 59: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Administration of thioridazine to patients that are genetically deficient in P450 2D6 expression can lead to over sedation (7.Meyer J.W. Woggon B. Baumann P. Meyer U.A. Clinical implications of slow sulphoxidation of thioridazine in a poor metabolizer of the debrisoquine type.Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 613-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This P450 2D6 “poor metabolizer” phenotype is evident in 5∼10% of the Caucasian population (8.Kroemer H.K. Eichelbaum M. “It's the genes, stupid”: molecular bases and clinical consequences of genetic cytochrome P450 2D6 polymorphism.Life Sci. 1995; 56: 2285-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a warning recommendation that thioridazine should not be used with patients receiving other drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 or with patients having reduced levels of the enzyme due to genetic variation because of a risk for increased cardiotoxicity. These considerations illustrate the need to better understand the binding of substrates and inhibitors to P450 2D6 in order to reduce the potential risks that arise from metabolic drug-drug interactions and individual variation in the contributions of P450 2D6 in the metabolism of new chemical entities. X-ray crystal structures have been reported for P450 2D6 crystallized with prinomastat (9.Wang A. Savas U. Hsu M.H. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7614-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) crystallized in the absence of a ligand (PDB code 2F9Q). The two structures display significant conformational differences for helix F-G, helix A, helix B-C, and β-sheet 1 regions of the protein that form the distal surfaces of the active site cavity (9.Wang A. Savas U. Hsu M.H. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Crystal structure of human cytochrome P450 2D6 with prinomastat bound.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10834-10843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As substrates and inhibitors vary greatly in size and in molecular properties, we determined structures of thioridazine complexed with P450 2D6 by x-ray crystallography to better understand the role of conformational changes and the role of ionic interactions in substrate binding to P450 2D6. Two crystal forms were obtained that reflect different conformations of the protein. The protein was crystallized in the C121 space group with one molecule of thioridazine bound in a closed active site and in a second crystalline form exhibiting the P212121 space group where P450 2D6 crystallized with two molecules of thioridazine bound in an expanded, more open active site cavity. In both structures the protonated nitrogen of the thioridazine methyl piperidine ring forms a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond with Asp-301 on helix I in the active site. The second thioridazine, which is bound in the entry channel, forms a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond with Glu-222, which may serve as the initial site for binding cationic substrates in the entrance channel to facilitate their entry into the active site. Protein Data Bank observed structure factor calculated structure factor R enantiomer of thioridazine. The sparse crystal lattice interactions near the portal to the active site in the P212121 crystal form suggested that P450 2D6 might be able to undergo elastic deformations to further open the entrance channel for ligand exchange between the buried active site and the bulk solvent followed by adaptive changes to accommodate alternative ligands. To test this hypothesis, alternative ligands were added to the mother liquor before harvesting crystals for data collection. The structures determined after this procedure indicated that a single molecule of each ligand occupied the active site and prevented the binding of thioridazine or a second molecule of the competitive ligand in the entrance channel. The ability of the enzyme to undergo adaptations for inhibitor binding in this crystal lattice was further demonstrated by comparisons of the structures obtained by competitive replacement of thioridazine with the 2D6 inhibitors prinomastat (9.Wang A. Savas U. Hsu M.H. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Crystal structure of human cytochrome P450 2D6 with prinomastat bound.J. Biol.

These structures identify binding interactions for the bound inhibitors as well as changes in the polypeptide backbone and side-chain rotamer torsion angles to accommodate substrate binding. Ajmalicine elicited the largest changes, which converted the open structure to one that was more similar to the closed 3QM4 structure. A modified form of human P450 2D6 used previously for determination of the structure of the prinomastat complex (PDB code 3QM4) was employed for the current studies. The expression of the protein in Escherichia coli and partial purification of the protein by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was essentially as described previously (9.Wang A. Savas U. Hsu M.H. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Crystal structure of human cytochrome P450 2D6 with prinomastat bound.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10834-10843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thioridazine (0.1 mm) was used instead of prinomastat as the stabilizing ligand during the purification procedure, and the protein was eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in a 120 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm histidine, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm thioridazine (Sigma), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 14 mm CHAPS detergent (Anatrace, Maumee, OH). After concentration of the protein to ∼200 μm by centrifugal filtration, the protein was purified further by size exclusion chromatography with Sephacryl 200 HR using the 120 mm KPi buffer without histidine. The concentration of the protein was estimated by UV-visible difference spectroscopy for the CO complex of the dithionite-reduced enzyme versus the reduced enzyme (14.Omura T. Sato R. The carbon monoxide-binding pigment of liver microsomes. II. Solubilization, purification, and properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted thioridazine complex was concentrated and used directly for crystallization under conditions similar to that used for the prinomastat complex. For crystallization of the thioridazine complex in the presence of zinc chloride, the phosphate concentration was lowered to 25 mm, and the detergent CHAPS was replaced by a new facial amphiphile FA-3 (15.Lee S.C.

Preparations of the modified CYP2D6 protein were crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. For crystallization of 2D6 in the C121 space group, a drop containing 1 μl of the concentrated P450 2D6 thioridazine complex (0.35 mm) in 120 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.4 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm thioridazine, 0.25 μl of 70 mm HEGA-10 (Anatrace), and 0.625 μl of precipitant solution (20% PEG-3350, 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0) was set to equilibrate against 0.5 ml of reservoir solution composed of the same precipitant solution with 0.2 m NaCl at 296 K. Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K that diffracted to >3.2 Å at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 7-1, and data integrated, scaled, and merged to 3.3 Å were used for refinement. As the space group and unit cell dimensions were highly similar to those of the crystal used to determine the 3QM4 structure of 2D6 complexed with prinomastat, initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement (R = 0.301) by rigid body refinement of the 2 polypeptide chains and hemes of the asymmetric unit of the 3QM4 structure and bulk solvent flattening with a resolution range of 39.4-3.3 Å using PHENIX (16.Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 2012; 68: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Initially, the 3QM4 structure and subsequently the input model served as reference models for restrained minimization. Additionally, weighting factors in the refinements were optimized to prevent over-refinement as judged by the divergence of R from Rfree (5% of the reflections). With the exception of residues 230–237 of chain B, the initial model contained residues 33 to the C-terminal residue 497 of the native protein. As electron density for the loop between helices C and D of both chains was not well defined, residues 143–146 and 143–147 were not included in chains A and B, respectively, of the final model. This model and the structure factors were deposited in the PDB with the accession code 4WNW. The conditions for crystallization of the protein in the presence of zinc ions were modified as follows. The drop was composed of 1.5 μl of protein solution, 0.25 μl of 70 mm HEGA-10 (Anatrace), and 0.3 μl of precipitant solution (16% PEG-3350, 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, and 2 mm zinc chloride). The dataset used for structure determination was collected from a single crystal at 100 K on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 7-1. A dataset indexed in the P212121 space group with a limiting resolution of 2.1 Å was used for structure solution and refinement. Four molecules were identified in the asymmetric unit with a log likelihood gain of 26,558 by a molecular replacement search using PHASER (19.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Likelihood-enhanced fast translation functions.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) with chain B of the 3QM4 2D6 structure and a resolution range of 54.8–2.04 Å. The initial model (R = 0.351) was subjected to repeated rounds of adjustment and torsion angle dynamics with simulated annealing, conjugate gradient minimization, and individual isotropic B-factor refinement using CNS (20.Brunger A.T. Version 1.2 of the crystallography and NMR system.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) with a final R = 0.222. This model and structure factors were deposited in the PDB with the accession code 3TBG. Crystals produced in this manner with thioridazine as the 2D6 ligand were used in subsequent experiments to test whether competitive ligands could replace thioridazine after addition to the mother liquor. For prinomastat, 0.125 μl of 200 mm prinomastat in DMSO was added to a drop containing crystals grown in the presence of thioridazine as described in the previous paragraph. Crystals were harvested after a 24-h incubation. The mother liquor was supplemented with glycerol (15% v/v) before harvest to protect crystals before freezing them in liquid nitrogen. The structure of the resulting prinomastat complex with 2D6 was determined using a data set collected from a single crystal at 100 K on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 11-1 with a limiting resolution of 2.67 Å. As the unit cell dimensions and space group were highly similar to that of the crystal used for determination of the 3TBG structure, molecular replacement by rigid body refinement of the four chains of 3TBG structure representative of the starting crystals and bulk solvent correction for the resolution range 42.1–2.8 Å were used for initial phasing (R = 0.340). Adjustments to the model and further refinement were performed as described for the 3TBG structure. The final model (R = 0.217) was deposited in the PDB with the accession code 3TDA. Structures of P450 2D6 with quinidine (PDB code 4WNU) or quinine (PDB code 4WNV) bound in the active site were obtained after exposures of crystals to 0.125 μl of 100 mm quinidine in DMSO or 0.2 μl of 70 mm quinine sulfate in methanol added directly to the mother liquor. The datasets used for determination of the quinidine and quinine complexes were collected from single crystals at 100 K on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 7-1. Molecular replacement by rigid body refinement of four chains of the 3TBG structure and bulk solvent correction was used for the quinidine complex (R = 0.304) with a resolution range of 53.5–2.26 Å and for the quinine complex (R = 0.289) with a resolution range of 57.0–2.35 Å. The models were adjusted and refined to limiting resolutions of 2.26 and 2.35 Å with R = 0.190 and R = 0.202, respectively, for the quinidine and quinine complexes using CNS initially and PHENIX for the final rounds of refinement. Similarly, a 0.2-μl aliquot of 12 mm ajmalicine (MP Biomedicals) in methanol was added to the mother liquor containing crystals of the 2D6 thioridazine complex. Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 7-1. This crystal exhibited the P21212 space group with the length of one axis reduced by half relative to the P212121 crystals. Two molecules were identified in the asymmetric unit with a log likelihood gain of 6469 by a molecular replacement search using PHASER (19.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Likelihood-enhanced fast translation functions.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

The initial model (R = 0.368) was adjusted and refined to a limiting resolution of 2.6 Å using CNS initially and followed by PHENIX for the final stages of model building and refinement (R = 0.192).

To better understand the role of 2D6 conformational flexibility in substrate binding, 2D6 was isolated and crystallized in the presence of thioridazine under conditions used for determination of the 3QM4 structure of the prinomastat-2D6 complex. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the tricyclic phenothiazine moiety of thioridazine is oriented almost perpendicular to the plane of the heme with the side chain of the protonated N-methylpiperidine group projecting outward parallel with helix I and above Phe-120 toward the helix B-C loop. Electron density for the tricyclic phenothiazine ring conforms to its overall shape, but for omit maps the density is weak at the end of the thiophenazine ring closest to the heme. This is likely to reflect the conformational heterogeneity of thioridazine and relatively relaxed steric restraints near the heme when compared with the upper portion of the cavity. As the location of the methylsulfide group is ambiguous, the phenothiazine ring was modeled for two alternative conformations of the phenothiazine moiety. One orientation places the S-methyl group in close proximity to the heme. Although the model indicates that the S-methyl rotamer could approach within 4.8 Å of the heme iron, its position is not defined by electron density. P450 2D6 converts thioridazine to the methyl sulfone, which is likely to reflect direct oxidation of the sulfur. This would require a closer approach of the sulfur to the heme iron as would also be required for hydroxylation at C7 for the alternative orientation of the phenothiazine group. Both sites of metabolism are about 7 Å from the heme iron. Modeling the substrate in close proximity to the reactive oxene suggests that changes in torsion angles for the side chain and a small translation of the phenothiazine ring would facilitate the reaction with the iron bound oxene. These small changes are likely to be commensurate with thermal motion in the active site at normal temperatures. Thioridazine is used clinically as a racemic mixture, and 2D6 is thought to oxidize both enantiomers (6.Eap C.B. Guentert T.W. Schãublin-Loidl M. Stabl M. Koeb L. Powell K. Baumann P.

https://openalex.org/W2110025562,"The action of Janus kinases (JAKs) is required for multiple cytokine signaling pathways, and as such, JAK inhibitors hold promise for treatment of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. However, due to high similarity in the active sites of the four members (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2), developing selective inhibitors within this family is challenging. We have designed and characterized substituted, tricyclic Jak3 inhibitors that selectively avoid inhibition of the other JAKs. This is accomplished through a covalent interaction between an inhibitor containing a terminal electrophile and an active site cysteine (Cys-909). We found that these ATP competitive compounds are irreversible inhibitors of Jak3 enzyme activity in vitro. They possess high selectivity against other kinases and can potently (IC50 < 100 nm) inhibit Jak3 activity in cell-based assays. These results suggest irreversible inhibitors of this class may be useful selective agents, both as tools to probe Jak3 biology and potentially as therapies for autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2016284098,"Complex ecological and epidemiological systems require multidisciplinary and innovative research. Low cost unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can provide information on the spatial pattern of hosts’ distribution and abundance, which is crucial as regards modelling the determinants of disease transmission and persistence on a fine spatial scale. In this context we have studied the spatial epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in the ungulate community of Doñana National Park (South-western Spain) by modelling species host (red deer, fallow deer and cattle) abundance at fine spatial scale. The use of UAS high-resolution images has allowed us to collect data to model the environmental determinants of host abundance, and in a further step to evaluate their relationships with the spatial risk of TB throughout the ungulate community. We discuss the ecological, epidemiological and logistic conditions under which UAS may contribute to study the wildlife/livestock sanitary interface, where the spatial aggregation of hosts becomes crucial. These findings are relevant for planning and implementing research, fundamentally when managing disease in multi-host systems, and focusing on risky areas. Therefore, managers should prioritize the implementation of control strategies to reduce disease of conservation, economic and social relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2051710738,"The association of unesterified fatty acid (FA) with the scavenger receptor CD36 has been actively researched, with focuses on FA and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake. CD36 has been shown to bind FA, but this interaction has been poorly characterized to date. To gain new insights into the physiological relevance of binding of FA to CD36, we characterized FA binding to the ectodomain of CD36 by the biophysical method surface plasmon resonance. Five structurally distinct FAs (saturated, monounsaturated (cis and trans), polyunsaturated, and oxidized) were pulsed across surface plasmon resonance channels, generating association and dissociation binding curves. Except for the oxidized FA HODE, all FAs bound to CD36, with rapid association and dissociation kinetics similar to HSA. Next, to elucidate the role that each FA might play in CD36-mediated oxLDL uptake, we used a fluorescent oxLDL (Dii-oxLDL) live cell assay with confocal microscopy imaging. CD36-mediated uptake in serum-free medium was very low but greatly increased when serum was present. The addition of exogenous FA in serum-free medium increased oxLDL binding and uptake to levels found with serum and affected CD36 plasma membrane distribution. Binding/uptake of oxLDL was dependent upon the FA dose, except for docosahexaenoic acid, which exhibited binding to CD36 but did not activate the uptake of oxLDL. HODE also did not affect oxLDL uptake. High affinity FA binding to CD36 and the effects of each FA on oxLDL uptake have important implications for protein conformation, binding of other ligands, functional properties of CD36, and high plasma FA levels in obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2018427566,"In many studies for chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma, the Lipiodol emulsion preparation protocols, especially the mixing steps, were unclear or even unrevealed at all. However, doxorubicin (DOX) release may depend on the composition and volume ratio (Lipiodol to DOX solution) of a Lipiodol emulsion. Therefore, we conducted a preclinical study to compare in-vitro drug release and in-vivo pharmacokinetics of DOX from diverse Lipiodol emulsions and drug-eluting beads (DEBs) and to compare the tumor response in a rabbit VX2 carcinoma model. DOX release profiles of four types of Lipiodol emulsions with different media (normal saline or Pamiray as an iodinated contrast medium), volume ratio (Lipiodol to DOX solution), and DEBs were investigated in-vitro. For the in-vivo study, 15 rabbits bearing VX2 carcinoma in the liver were treated with 4∶1 volume ratio Lipiodol emulsion (group A), 1∶1 volume ratio Lipiodol emulsion (group B), and DEBs (group C) chemoembolization. Blood and tissue sampling was conducted to evaluate DOX concentration in plasma and tissues, histological changes, and liver toxicity. The most stable emulsion was formed with Pamiray (including DOX) at a 4∶1 volume ratio. The AUC value of group A was significantly lower than that of group B (p = 0.003) but comparable to that of group C (p = 0.071). The Cmax value of group A was significantly different compared with those of group B (p = 0.004) and C (p = 0.015). The tissue drug concentration in group A was comparable to that in group C (p = 0.251). No viable tumor was detected in rabbits of group A and B. In group C, viable tumor less than 10% was seen in two of the five rabbits. There were no significant differences in liver enzyme levels after the procedure. In conclusion, DOX release and pharmacokinetics of presented emulsion systems depend substantially on their composition. Therefore, Lipiodol emulsion type should be considered when interpreting data and designing new studies dealing with chemoembolization."
https://openalex.org/W1990538976,"SMARCAL1 catalyzes replication fork remodeling to maintain genome stability. It is recruited to replication forks via an interaction with replication protein A (RPA), the major ssDNA-binding protein in eukaryotic cells. In addition to directing its localization, RPA also activates SMARCAL1 on some fork substrates but inhibits it on others, thereby conferring substrate specificity to SMARCAL1 fork-remodeling reactions. We investigated the mechanism by which RPA regulates SMARCAL1. Our results indicate that although an interaction between SMARCAL1 and RPA is essential for SMARCAL1 activation, the location of the interacting surface on RPA is not. Counterintuitively, high-affinity DNA binding of RPA DNA-binding domain (DBD) A and DBD-B near the fork junction makes it easier for SMARCAL1 to remodel the fork, which requires removing RPA. We also found that RPA DBD-C and DBD-D are not required for SMARCAL1 regulation. Thus, the orientation of the high-affinity RPA DBDs at forks dictates SMARCAL1 substrate specificity."

Here, we used comparative transcriptomic analysis of all major organs and tissues in the human body, in combination with kidney tissue micro array based immunohistochemistry, to generate a comprehensive description of the kidney-specific transcriptome and proteome. A special emphasis was placed on the identification of genes and proteins that were elevated in specific kidney subcompartments. Our analysis identified close to 400 genes that had elevated expression in the kidney, as compared to the other analysed tissues, and these were further subdivided, depending on expression levels, into tissue enriched, group enriched or tissue enhanced. Immunohistochemistry allowed us to identify proteins with distinct localisation to the glomeruli (n = 11), proximal tubules (n = 120), distal tubules (n = 9) or collecting ducts (n = 8). Among the identified kidney elevated transcripts, we found several proteins not previously characterised or identified as elevated in kidney. This description of the kidney specific transcriptome and proteome provides a resource for basic and clinical research to facilitate studies to understand kidney biology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2043723822,"Cuticular wax covers aerial organs of plants and functions as the outermost barrier against non-stomatal water loss. We reported here the functional characterization of the Glossy1(GL1)-homologous gene OsGL1-3 in rice using overexpression and RNAi transgenic rice plants. OsGL1-3 gene was ubiquitously expressed at different level in rice plants except root and its expression was up-regulated under ABA and PEG treatments. The transient expression of OsGL1-3–GFP fusion protein indicated that OsGL1-3 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane. Compared to the wild type, overexpression rice plants exhibited stunted growth, more wax crystallization on leaf surface, and significantly increased total cuticular wax load due to the prominent changes of C30–C32 aldehydes and C30 primary alcohols. While the RNAi knockdown mutant of OsGL1-3 exhibited no significant difference in plant height, but less wax crystallization and decreased total cuticular wax accumulation on leaf surface. All these evidences, together with the effects of OsGL1-3 on the expression of some wax synthesis related genes, suggest that OsGL1-3 is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis. Overexpression of OsGL1-3 decreased chlorophyll leaching and water loss rate whereas increased tolerance to water deficit at both seedling and late-tillering stages, suggesting an important role of OsGL1-3 in drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1996085327,"A relatively large number of studies reassert the strong relationship between galling insect diversity and extreme hydric and thermal status in some habitats, and an overall pattern of a greater number of galling species in the understory of scleromorphic vegetation. We compared galling insect diversity in the forest canopy and its relationship with tree richness among upland terra firme, várzea, and igapó floodplains in Amazonia, Brazil. The soils of these forest types have highly different hydric and nutritional status. Overall, we examined the upper layer of 1,091 tree crowns. Galling species richness and abundance were higher in terra firme forests compared to várzea and igapó forests. GLM-ANCOVA models revealed that the number of tree species sampled in each forest type was determinant in the gall-forming insect diversity. The ratio between galling insect richness and number of tree species sampled (GIR/TSS ratio) was higher in the terra firme forest and in seasonally flooded igapó, while the várzea presented the lowest GIR/TSS ratio. In this study, we recorded unprecedented values of galling species diversity and abundance per sampling point. The GIR/TSS ratio from várzea was approximately 2.5 times higher than the highest value of this ratio ever reported in the literature. Based on this fact, we ascertained that várzea and igapó floodplain forests (with lower GIA and GIR), together with the speciose terra firme galling community emerge as the gall diversity apex landscape among all biogeographic regions already investigated. Contrary to expectation, our results also support the “harsh environment hypothesis”, and unveil the Amazonian upper canopy as similar to Mediterranean vegetation habitats, hygrothermically stressed environments with leaf temperature at lethal limits and high levels of leaf sclerophylly."

https://openalex.org/W2063223078,"Normal and painful stimuli are detected by specialized subgroups of peripheral sensory neurons. The understanding of the functional differences of each neuronal subgroup would be strongly enhanced by knowledge of the respective subgroup transcriptome. The separation of the subgroup of interest, however, has proven challenging as they can hardly be enriched. Instead of enriching, we now rapidly eliminated the subgroup of neurons expressing the heat-gated cation channel TRPV1 from dissociated rat sensory ganglia. Elimination was accomplished by brief treatment with TRPV1 agonists followed by the removal of compromised TRPV1(+) neurons using density centrifugation. By differential microarray and sequencing (RNA-Seq) based expression profiling we compared the transcriptome of all cells within sensory ganglia versus the same cells lacking TRPV1 expressing neurons, which revealed 240 differentially expressed genes (adj. p<0.05, fold-change>1.5). Corroborating the specificity of the approach, many of these genes have been reported to be involved in noxious heat or pain sensitization. Beyond the expected enrichment of ion channels, we found the TRPV1 transcriptome to be enriched for GPCRs and other signaling proteins involved in adenosine, calcium, and phosphatidylinositol signaling. Quantitative population analysis using a recent High Content Screening (HCS) microscopy approach identified substantial heterogeneity of expressed target proteins even within TRPV1-positive neurons. Signaling components defined distinct further subgroups within the population of TRPV1-positive neurons. Analysis of one such signaling system showed that the pain sensitizing prostaglandin PGD2 activates DP1 receptors expressed predominantly on TRPV1(+) neurons. In contrast, we found the PGD2 producing prostaglandin D synthase to be expressed exclusively in myelinated large-diameter neurons lacking TRPV1, which suggests a novel paracrine neuron-neuron communication. Thus, subgroup analysis based on the elimination rather than enrichment of the subgroup of interest revealed proteins that define subclasses of TRPV1-positive neurons and suggests a novel paracrine circuit."

https://openalex.org/W2040186550,"Climate warming is expected to increase the exposure of insects to hot events (involving a few hours at extreme high temperatures). These events are unlikely to cause widespread mortality but may modify population dynamics via impacting life history traits such as adult fecundity and egg hatching. These effects and their potential impact on population predictions are still largely unknown. In this study, we simulated a single hot event (maximum of 38°C lasting for 4 h) of a magnitude increasingly found under field conditions and examined its effect in the oriental fruit moth, Grapholitha molesta. This hot event had no impact on the survival of G. molesta adults, copulation periods or male longevity. However, the event increased female lifespan and the length of the oviposition period, leading to a potential increase in lifetime fecundity and suggesting hormesis. In contrast, exposure of males to this event markedly reduced the net reproductive value. Male heat treatment delayed the onset of oviposition in the females they mated with, as well as causing a decrease in the duration of oviposition period and lifetime fecundity. Both male and female stress also reduced egg hatch. Our findings of hormetic effects on female performance but concurrent detrimental effects on egg hatch suggest that hot events have unpredictable consequences on the population dynamics of this pest species with implications for likely effects associated with climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2034004391,"Objective To explore the structural basis of post-stroke apathy by using voxel-based analysis (VBA) of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Methods We enrolled 54 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke during convalescence, and divided them into apathy (n = 31) and non-apathy (n = 23) groups. We obtained magnetic resonance images of their brains, including T1, T2 and DTI sequences. Age, sex, education level, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, and infarct locations for the two groups were compared. Finally, to investigate the structural basis of post-stroke apathy, VBA of FA maps was performed in which we included the variables that a univariate analysis determined had P-values less than 0.20 as covariates. Results HAMD (P = 0.01) and MMSE (P<0.01) scores differed significantly between the apathy and non-apathy groups. After controlling for age, education level, HAMD scores, and MMSE scores, significant FA reduction was detected in four clusters with peak voxels at the genu of the corpus callosum (X = −16, Y = 30, Z = 8), left anterior corona radiata (−22, 30, 10), splenium of the corpus callosum (−24, −56, 18), and right inferior frontal gyrus white matter (52, 24, 18), after family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions Post-stroke apathy is related to depression and cognitive decline. Damage to the genu of the corpus callosum, left anterior corona radiata, splenium of the corpus callosum, and white matter in the right inferior frontal gyrus may lead to apathy after ischemic stroke."

Although the biological functions of CDKL5 remain largely unknown, recent pieces of evidence suggest that CDKL5 is involved in neuronal plasticity. Herein, we show that, at all stages of development, neuronal depolarization induces a rapid increase in CDKL5 levels, mostly mediated by extrasomatic synthesis. In young neurons, this induction is prolonged, whereas in more mature neurons, NMDA receptor stimulation induces a protein phosphatase 1-dependent dephosphorylation of CDKL5 that is mandatory for its proteasome-dependent degradation. As a corollary, neuronal activity leads to a prolonged induction of CDKL5 levels in immature neurons but to a short lasting increase of the kinase in mature neurons. Recent results demonstrate that many genes associated with autism spectrum disorders are crucial components of the activity-dependent signaling networks regulating the composition, shape, and strength of the synapse.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether birth weight and birth length were related to FPG levels at the first prenatal visit.Research samples were collected from pregnant women who took an FPG test at their first prenatal visit (10-24 gestational weeks), received regular prenatal care, and delivered in our center. FPG value, maternal pre-gravid BMI, weight gain before FPG test, before and after Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), neonatal birthweight, birth length, Ponderal Index and birthing method were recorded for analysis. Data were analyzed by independent sample t test, Pearson correlation, and Chi-square test, followed by partial correlation or logistic regression to confirm differences. Statistical significance level was α = 0.05.2284 pregnant women, including 462 GDM and 1822 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were recruited for the present study. FPG concentration at the first prenatal visit was associated with neonatal birth weight (partial correlation coefficient r' = 0.089, P<0.001) and birth length (partial correlation coefficient r' = 0.061, P = 0.005), but not with Ponderal Index or birthing method. Maternal pre-gravid BMI was associated with FPG value (partial correlation coefficient r' = 0.113, P<0.001). FPG concentration at the first prenatal visit (OR = 2.945, P<0.001), weight gain before OGTT test (OR = 1.039, P = 0.010), and age (OR = 1.107, P<0.001) were independent related factors of GDM.Fasting plasma glucose concentration at the first prenatal visit is associated with fetal growth. Maternal pre-gravid BMI and weight gain are related to glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2087713263,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common tumor predisposition disorder affecting 1/3500 worldwide. Patients are at risk of developing benign (neurofibromas) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase has been implicated in several kinds of cancers, but so far no studies have investigated the role of AXL in NF1 related tumorigenesis. Recently, the soluble fraction from the extracellular domain of AXL (sAXL) has been found in human plasma, and its level was correlated to poor prognosis in patients with renal cancer. Compared to normal human Schwann cells, a significantly high expression level of AXL was found in three of the four MPNST cell lines and two of the three primary MPNST tissues. Similarly, the level of sAXL in conditioned media corresponded to the protein and mRNA levels of AXL in the MPNST cell lines. Furthermore, in two different human MPNST xenograft models, the human sAXL could be detected in the mouse plasma. Its level was proportionate to the size of the xenograft tumors, while no human sAXL was detect prior to the formation of the tumors. Treatment with a newly developed photodynamic therapy, prevented further tumor growth and resulted in drastically reduced the levels of sAXL compared to that of the control group. Finally, the level of sAXL was significantly increased in patients with plexiform tumors compared to patients with only dermal neurofibromas, further supporting the role of sAXL as a marker for NF1 related tumor burden."
https://openalex.org/W2046252681,"β amyloid peptide plays an important role in both the manifestation and progression of Alzheimer disease. It has a tendency to aggregate, forming low-molecular weight soluble oligomers, higher-molecular weight protofibrillar oligomers and insoluble fibrils. The relative importance of these single oligomeric-polymeric species, in relation to the morbidity of the disease, is currently being debated. Here we present an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) study of Aβ(25–35) aggregation on hydrophobic dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and DOPC/docosahexaenoic 22∶6 acid (DHA) lipid bilayers. Aβ(25–35) is the smallest fragment retaining the biological activity of the full-length peptide, whereas DOPC and DOPC/DHA lipid bilayers were selected as models of cell-membrane environments characterized by different fluidity. Our results provide evidence that in hydrophobic DOPC and DOPC/DHA lipid bilayers, Aβ(25-35) forms layered aggregates composed of mainly annular structures. The mutual interaction between annular structures and lipid surfaces end-results into a membrane solubilization. The presence of DHA as a membrane-fluidizing agent is essential to protect the membrane from damage caused by interactions with peptide aggregates; to reduces the bilayer defects where the delipidation process starts."
https://openalex.org/W2019462408,"Effects of the kampo medicine yokukansan on gene expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xc−, which protects against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, were examined in Pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells). Yokukansan inhibited glutamate-induced PC12 cell death. Similar cytoprotective effects were found in Uncaria hook. Experiments to clarify the active compounds revealed that geissoschizine methyl ether, hirsuteine, hirsutine, and procyanidin B1 in Uncaria hook, had cytoprotective effects. These components enhanced gene expressions of system Xc− subunits xCT and 4F2hc, and also ameliorated the glutamate-induced decrease in glutathione levels. These results suggest that the cytoprotective effect of yokukansan may be attributed to geissoschizine methyl ether, hirsuteine, hirsutine, and procyanidin B1 in Uncaria hook."
https://openalex.org/W2312324212,"Evidence supporting nitric oxide (NO) as a mediator of plant biochemistry continues to grow, but its functions at the molecular level remains poorly understood and, in some cases, controversial. To study the role of NO at the transcriptional level in Betula platyphylla cells, we conducted a genome-scale transcriptome analysis of these cells. The transcriptome of untreated birch cells and those treated by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were analyzed using the Solexa sequencing. Data were collected by sequencing cDNA libraries of birch cells, which had a long period to adapt to the suspension culture conditions before SNP-treated cells and untreated cells were sampled. Among the 34,100 UniGenes detected, BLASTX search revealed that 20,631 genes showed significant (E-values≤10−5) sequence similarity with proteins from the NR-database. Numerous expressed sequence tags (i.e., 1374) were identified as differentially expressed between the 12 h SNP-treated cells and control cells samples: 403 up-regulated and 971 down-regulated. From this, we specifically examined a core set of NO-related transcripts. The altered expression levels of several transcripts, as determined by transcriptome analysis, was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The results of transcriptome analysis, gene expression quantification, the content of triterpenoid and activities of defensive enzymes elucidated NO has a significant effect on many processes including triterpenoid production, carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2143916184,"During social interactions, our own physiological responses influence those of others. Synchronization of physiological (and behavioural) responses can facilitate emotional understanding and group coherence through inter-subjectivity. Here we investigate if observing cues indicating a change in another's body temperature results in a corresponding temperature change in the observer.Thirty-six healthy participants (age; 22.9±3.1 yrs) each observed, then rated, eight purpose-made videos (3 min duration) that depicted actors with either their right or left hand in visibly warm (warm videos) or cold water (cold videos). Four control videos with the actors' hand in front of the water were also shown. Temperature of participant observers' right and left hands was concurrently measured using a thermistor within a Wheatstone bridge with a theoretical temperature sensitivity of <0.0001°C. Temperature data were analysed in a repeated measures ANOVA (temperature × actor's hand × observer's hand).Participants rated the videos showing hands immersed in cold water as being significantly cooler than hands immersed in warm water, F(1,34) = 256.67, p<0.001. Participants' own hands also showed a significant temperature-dependent effect: hands were significantly colder when observing cold vs. warm videos F(1,34) = 13.83, p = 0.001 with post-hoc t-test demonstrating a significant reduction in participants' own left (t(35) = -3.54, p = 0.001) and right (t(35) = -2.33, p = 0.026) hand temperature during observation of cold videos but no change to warm videos (p>0.1). There was however no evidence of left-right mirroring of these temperature effects p>0.1). Sensitivity to temperature contagion was also predicted by inter-individual differences in self-report empathy.We illustrate physiological contagion of temperature in healthy individuals, suggesting that empathetic understanding for primary low-level physiological challenges (as well as more complex emotions) are grounded in somatic simulation."
https://openalex.org/W1978375825,"Platelets are anuclear cell fragments derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes that safeguard vascular integrity by forming thrombi at sites of vascular injury. Although the early events of thrombus formation--platelet adhesion and aggregation--have been intensively studied, less is known about the mechanisms and receptors that stabilize platelet-platelet interactions once a thrombus has formed. One receptor that has been implicated in this process is the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family member CD84, which can undergo homophilic interactions and becomes phosphorylated upon platelet aggregation.The role of CD84 in platelet physiology and thrombus formation was investigated in CD84-deficient mice.We generated CD84-deficient mice and analyzed their platelets in vitro and in vivo. Cd84(-/-) platelets exhibited normal activation and aggregation responses to classical platelet agonists. Furthermore, CD84 deficiency did not affect integrin-mediated clot retraction and spreading of activated platelets on fibrinogen. Notably, also the formation of stable three-dimensional thrombi on collagen-coated surfaces under flow ex vivo was unaltered in the blood of Cd84(-/-) mice. In vivo, Cd84(-/-) mice exhibited unaltered hemostatic function and arterial thrombus formation.These results show that CD84 is dispensable for thrombus formation and stabilization, indicating that its deficiency may be functionally compensated by other receptors or that it may be important for platelet functions different from platelet-platelet interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2032630997,"Boolean networks are a simple but efficient model for describing gene regulatory systems. A number of algorithms have been proposed to infer Boolean networks. However, these methods do not take full consideration of the effects of noise and model uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a full Bayesian approach to infer Boolean genetic networks. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are used to obtain the posterior samples of both the network structure and the related parameters. In addition to regular link addition and removal moves, which can guarantee the irreducibility of the Markov chain for traversing the whole network space, carefully constructed mixture proposals are used to improve the Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence. Both simulations and a real application on cell-cycle data show that our method is more powerful than existing methods for the inference of both the topology and logic relations of the Boolean network from observed data."
https://openalex.org/W2062327645,"Patient specific therapy is emerging as an important possibility for many cancer patients. However, to identify such therapies it is essential to determine the genomic and transcriptional alterations present in one tumor relative to control samples. This presents a challenge since use of a single sample precludes many standard statistical analysis techniques. We reasoned that one means of addressing this issue is by comparing transcriptional changes in one tumor with those observed in a large cohort of patients analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To test this directly, we devised a bioinformatics pipeline to identify differentially expressed genes in tumors resected from patients suffering from the most common malignant adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). We performed RNA sequencing on tumors from individual GBM patients and filtered the results through the TCGA database in order to identify possible gene networks that are overrepresented in GBM samples relative to controls. Importantly, we demonstrate that hypergeometric-based analysis of gene pairs identifies gene networks that validate experimentally. These studies identify a putative workflow for uncovering differentially expressed patient specific genes and gene networks for GBM and other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2025433274,"Snake lungs show a remarkable diversity of organ asymmetries. The right lung is always fully developed, while the left lung is either absent, vestigial, or well-developed (but smaller than the right). A ‘tracheal lung’ is present in some taxa. These asymmetries are reflected in the pulmonary arteries. Lung asymmetry is known to appear at early stages of development in Thamnophis radix and Natrix natrix. Unfortunately, there is no developmental data on snakes with a well-developed or absent left lung. We examine the adult and developmental morphology of the lung and pulmonary arteries in the snakes Python curtus breitensteini, Pantherophis guttata guttata, Elaphe obsoleta spiloides, Calloselasma rhodostoma and Causus rhombeatus using gross dissection, MicroCT scanning and 3D reconstruction. We find that the right and tracheal lung develop similarly in these species. By contrast, the left lung either: (1) fails to develop; (2) elongates more slowly and aborts early without (2a) or with (2b) subsequent development of faveoli; (3) or develops normally. A right pulmonary artery always develops, but the left develops only if the left lung develops. No pulmonary artery develops in relation to the tracheal lung. We conclude that heterochrony in lung bud development contributes to lung asymmetry in several snake taxa. Secondly, the development of the pulmonary arteries is asymmetric at early stages, possibly because the splanchnic plexus fails to develop when the left lung is reduced. Finally, some changes in the topography of the pulmonary arteries are consequent on ontogenetic displacement of the heart down the body. Our findings show that the left-right asymmetry in the cardiorespiratory system of snakes is expressed early in development and may become phenotypically expressed through heterochronic shifts in growth, and changes in axial relations of organs and vessels. We propose a step-wise model for reduction of the left lung during snake evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2042091114,"Multinucleated giant cells, formed by the fusion of monocytes/macrophages, are features of chronic granulomatous inflammation associated with infections or the persistent presence of foreign material. The tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 regulate multinucleated giant cell formation: soluble recombinant proteins corresponding to the large extracellular domain (EC2) of human but not mouse CD9 can inhibit multinucleated giant cell formation, whereas human CD81 EC2 can antagonise this effect. Tetraspanin EC2 are all likely to have a conserved three helix sub-domain and a much less well-conserved or hypervariable sub-domain formed by short helices and interconnecting loops stabilised by two or more disulfide bridges. Using CD9/CD81 EC2 chimeras and point mutants we have mapped the specific regions of the CD9 EC2 involved in multinucleated giant cell formation. These were primarily located in two helices, one in each sub-domain. The cysteine residues involved in the formation of the disulfide bridges in CD9 EC2 were all essential for inhibitory activity but a conserved glycine residue in the tetraspanin-defining 'CCG' motif was not. A tyrosine residue in one of the active regions that is not conserved between human and mouse CD9 EC2, predicted to be solvent-exposed, was found to be only peripherally involved in this activity. We have defined two spatially-distinct sites on the CD9 EC2 that are required for inhibitory activity. Agents that target these sites could have therapeutic applications in diseases in which multinucleated giant cells play a pathogenic role."
https://openalex.org/W2088224892,"Many bacteriophage populations display heterogeneity in their adsorption characteristics; a portion of the phage population remains free in solution throughout adsorption experiments (residual fraction). This residual fraction generally constitutes a minority of phages that exhibit significantly slower adsorption kinetics than the main phage stock (main fraction). While this phenomenon is likely the result of evolutionary driving forces, the present study demonstrates that the residual fraction is not always the result of phenotypic variations within a single genotype, as is generally thought. Experiments with phage T4 showed that two subgroups with distinct adsorption traits that were passed on to their progeny could be isolated from the original phage stock. Sequencing of genes involved in adsorption revealed two point mutations in gene 37 of residual fraction isolates, which resulted in modifications to the long tail-fiber, the organelle of attachment and host cell recognition. Adsorption studies consistently showed that T4 phage stocks amplified from residual fraction isolates had significantly lower adsorption efficiencies than those amplified from main fractions. The conducted experiments provide convincing evidence that the observed heterogeneity in T4 adsorption behavior is the result of conserved mutations to the phage genome and is not exclusively the result of phenotypic variations within the population. While it is believed high mutation rates exist to hasten phage adaptation, this study shows that this bet hedging strategy can also, in the short term, inadvertently handicap the phage's adsorption capabilities to a given host under normal infection conditions, resulting in the residual fraction observed in adsorption experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2131061800,"Invasive species and habitat disturbance threaten biodiversity worldwide by modifying ecosystem performance and displacing native organisms. Similar homogenization impacts manifest locally when urbanization forces native species to relocate or reinvade perpetually altered habitat. This study investigated correlations between ant richness and abundance in response to urbanization and the nearby presence of invasive ant species, odorous house ants (Tapinoma sessile), within its native region. Surveying localized ant composition within natural, semi-natural, and urban habitat supported efforts to determine whether T. sessile appear to be primary (drivers) threats as instigators or secondary (passengers) threats as inheritors of indigenous ant decline. Sampling 180 sites, evenly split between all habitats with and without T. sessile present, yielded 45 total species. Although urbanization and T. sessile presence factors were significantly linked to ant decline, their interaction correlated to the greatest reduction of total ant richness (74%) and abundance (81%). Total richness appeared to decrease from 27 species to 18 when natural habitat is urbanized and from 18 species to 7 with T. sessile present in urban plots. Odorous house ant presence minimally influenced ant communities within natural and semi-natural habitat, highlighting the importance of habitat alteration and T. sessile presence interactions. Results suggest urbanization releases T. sessile from unknown constraints by decreasing ant richness and competition. Within urban environment, T. sessile are pre-adapted to quickly exploit new resources and grow to supercolony strength wherein T. sessile drive adjacent biodiversity loss. Odorous house ants act as passengers and drivers of ecological change throughout different phases of urban 'invasion'. This progression through surviving habitat alteration, exploiting new resources, thriving, and further reducing interspecific competition supports a ""back-seat driver"" role and affects pest management strategies. As demonstrated by T. sessile, this article concludes native species can become back-seat drivers of biodiversity loss and potentially thrive as ""metro-invasive"" species."
https://openalex.org/W2054687353,"Many animal species engage in various forms of solitary object play, but this activity seems to be of particular importance in primates. If playing objects constitute a valuable resource, and access to such objects is limited, a competitive context may arise. We inserted a unique toy within a mini-colony of long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and compared their behaviors to sessions without playing object. An automatic color-based 3D video device was used to track the positions of each animal and the toy, and this data was categorized into 5 exclusive behaviors (resting, locomotion, foraging, social contact and object play). As expected, the delay to first access to the object reflected the hierarchy of the colony, indicating that a competition took place to own this unique resource of entertainment. In addition, we found that the amount of object play was not correlated with social or foraging behavior, suggesting independent motivational mechanisms. Conversely, object playing time was negatively correlated with idling time, thus indicating its relation to pastime activities. Interestingly, the amount of social contacts in the group was significantly reduced by the heightened competitive context, suggesting that competitors are more likely to be perceived as potential threat requiring caution, as shown in humans. Experimental manipulation of competitive contexts in primates reveals common mental processes involved in social judgment, and shows that access to valuable resources can be a sufficient cause for variations in group cohesion."

https://openalex.org/W2131140921,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a commonly used model organism for neurodegenerative diseases. Its major advantages include a short lifespan and its susceptibility to manipulation using sophisticated genetic techniques. Here, we report the systematic comparison of fly models of two polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases. We induced expression of the normal and mutant forms of full-length Ataxin-1 and Huntingtin exon 1 in cholinergic, dopaminergic, and motor neurons, and glial cells using cell type-specific drivers. We systematically analyzed their effects based on multiple phenotypes: eclosion rate, lifespan, motor performance, and circadian rhythms of spontaneous activity. This systematic assay system enabled us to quantitatively evaluate and compare the functional disabilities of different genotypes. The results suggest different effects of Ataxin-1 and Huntingtin on specific types of neural cells during development and in adulthood. In addition, we confirmed the therapeutic effects of LiCl and butyrate using representative models. These results support the usefulness of this assay system for screening candidate chemical compounds that modify the pathologies of polyQ diseases."

Suppression of NPC1L1-mediated dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption is predicted to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia. In a screen for natural products that inhibit ezetimibe glucuronide binding to NPC1L1, we found a novel compound, fomiroid A, in extracts of the mushroom Fomitopsis nigra. Fomiroid A is a lanosterone derivative with molecular formula C30H48O3. Fomiroid A inhibited ezetimibe glucuronide binding to NPC1L1, and dose-dependently prevented NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake and formation of esterified cholesterol in NPC1L1-expressing Caco2 cells. Fomiroid A exhibited a pharmacological chaperone activity that corrected trafficking defects of the L1072T/L1168I mutant of NPC1L1. Because ezetimibe does not have such an activity, the binding site and mode of action of fomiroid A are likely to be distinct from those of ezetimibe."
https://openalex.org/W2101727182,"Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells are a potential source of cells for medical therapy and an ideal system to study fate decisions in early development. However, hPS cells cultured in vitro exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, presenting an obstacle to clinical translation. hPS cells grow in spatially patterned colony structures, necessitating quantitative single-cell image analysis. We offer a tool for analyzing the spatial population context of hPS cells that integrates automated fluorescent microscopy with an analysis pipeline. It enables high-throughput detection of colonies at low resolution, with single-cellular and sub-cellular analysis at high resolutions, generating seamless in situ maps of single-cellular data organized by colony. We demonstrate the tool's utility by analyzing inter- and intra-colony heterogeneity of hPS cell cycle regulation and pluripotency marker expression. We measured the heterogeneity within individual colonies by analyzing cell cycle as a function of distance. Cells loosely associated with the outside of the colony are more likely to be in G1, reflecting a less pluripotent state, while cells within the first pluripotent layer are more likely to be in G2, possibly reflecting a G2/M block. Our multi-scale analysis tool groups colony regions into density classes, and cells belonging to those classes have distinct distributions of pluripotency markers and respond differently to DNA damage induction. Lastly, we demonstrate that our pipeline can robustly handle high-content, high-resolution single molecular mRNA FISH data by using novel image processing techniques. Overall, the imaging informatics pipeline presented offers a novel approach to the analysis of hPS cells that includes not only single cell features but also colony wide, and more generally, multi-scale spatial configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1967061191,"Background Replacement of sugar-sweetened by non-nutritively sweetened beverages or water may reduce excess weight gain in children. However, it is unclear whether children like non-nutritively sweetened beverages as much as sugar-sweetened beverages. We examined whether children could taste a difference between non-nutritively sweetened beverages and matching sugar-sweetened beverages, and which of the two types of beverage they liked best. Methods 89 children aged 5 to 12 tasted seven non-nutritively sweetened beverages and matching sugar-sweetened beverages, for a total of 14 beverages. We used Triangle tests to check their ability to discriminate between the matched versions, and a 5-point scale to measure how much the children liked each individual beverage. Results Overall, 24% of children appeared to be genuinely capable of distinguishing between non-nutritively sweetened and sugar-sweetened beverages. The mean ± SD score for how much the children liked the non-nutritively sweetened beverages was 3.39±0.7 and that for the sugar-sweetened beverages 3.39±0.6 (P = 0.9) on a scale running from 1 (disgusting) to 5 (delicious). The children preferred some beverages to others irrespective of whether they were sugar-sweetened or non-nutritively sweetened (P = 0.000). Children who correctly identified which of three drinks contained the same sweetener and which one was different also showed no preference for either type. Conclusion We found that about one in four children were able to discriminate between non-nutritively sweetened and sugar-sweetened beverages but children liked both varieties equally. Non-nutritively sweetened beverages may therefore be an acceptable alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages although water remains the healthiest beverage for children."
