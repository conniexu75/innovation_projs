https://openalex.org/W2009948050,"RECENTLY, new sensitive assays have been reported for deoxy sugars1, 2-keto,3-deoxy sugar acids2–4, and sialic acids5,6. In these assays, the products of periodate oxidation, malonaldehyde from deoxy sugars and β-formylpyruvic acid from the latter two groups of compounds, are coupled with 2-thiobarbituric acid to produce a bright red chromophore. I wish to report an adaptation of these methods for spraying paper chromatograms."

https://openalex.org/W1992619720,"By means of microclectrophoresis in agar gel, we studied the hemolymph proteins of different species of the family Triatomidae (class Insecta) and different species of the families Ixodidae and Argasidae (clalss Arachnoidea). The results show a specific electrophoretic pattern for each species. Insects infected with pathogenic organisms have the same pattern as normal insects."

However, the converse is certainly not true: all glacial soils cannot be correlated with areas where the prevalence of multiple sclerosis is high. Maps showing the distribution of multiple sclerotic cases in Northern Ireland, south-eastern Ontario, Sweden, and Denmark are alike in one respect—they all bear a remarkable resemblance to maps illustrating the distribution of boulders or geochemical anomalies in any map prepared for the purpose of searching in a glaciated area for buried ore bodies."

https://openalex.org/W2012874383,"HAEMOLYTIC reactions following the ingestion of drugs such as primaquine and the broad bean (Vicia faba) have been shown to be due to an inherited abnormality of the erythrocytes which can be detected by an in vitro glutathione stability test devised by Beutler1. The use of this test in surveys has established that the incidence of the defect varies with peoples and race. American Negroes, Sephardic Jews and Sardinians have a much higher incidence of sensitive individuals than Ashkenazic Jews or American Caucasians. Beutler has recently reviewed the subject2. Many cases of favism have been seen locally during the past few years, and it was reasonable to assume that a survey of the glutathione stability of the erythrocytes in Iranians would show the presence of the abnormality in this area."

Neither hormone alone was effective. Luteinizing hormone repaired in part the atrophied theca interna and interstitial tissue, and follicle-stimulating hormone stimulated the development of the granulosa cells."

https://openalex.org/W2023521845,"THE inclusion of sorbitol in the diets of rats makes them able to survive and grow in the absence of dietary sources of B vitamins1. It is likely that the sorbitol acts by increasing the synthesis of these vitamins in the alimentary canal. We have investigated the possibility that sorbitol similarly increases synthesis in man. We have done this by determining the urinary output of three vitamins in a male subject aged 27 (J.D.W.) before, during and after the ingestion of sorbitol."

This radionuclide and others are produced by nuclear reactions with the construction materials of the cyclotron. Only zinc-65 has gained entry into the body, but in amounts of less than 1 percent of the maximum permissible amount."

Some reported normal growth3. Recently Walker and Syrett4 confirmed the inhibition of autotrophic growth of Chlorella by heavy water but found less inhibition in the presence of glucose."

https://openalex.org/W2031038103,"MANY chemical substances have been investigated for their ability to protect animals against the lethal effects of total-body radiation1. Of these, S-β-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide hydrobromide is one of the most effective if administered before exposure. It produces a remarkable degree of protection to total-body radiation in mice2. Similar protection is afforded to the monkey if given 150–250 mgm./kgm. prior to administration of 650 r. whole-body X-radiation3. The following experiments were carried out to test whether S-β-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide was capable of protecting tissues against local irradiation."

These results suggest that polymyxin might be used to extract enzymes from micro-organisms. The present communication is concerned with the extraction of a nitro-reductase from Nocardia V."

https://openalex.org/W2048733054,"IT is well known, that the damping off of coniferous seedlings causes serious damage and in many cases complete destruction up to the appearance of the foliage. Once the cotyledons are fully developed and foliage leaves have failed to appear, complete destruction may be expected. Following the appearance of the foliage leaves the percentage of the damping off is greatly reduced or totally stopped. Nor does the disease appear when it could be expected in the presence of suitable conditions (high temperature, abundant moisture and excessive decomposing organic substances1,2,3,4). Consequently it may be assumed that in these two developmental phases there must exist such a difference in the plant substance which is closely connected with the cause of damping off."
https://openalex.org/W2074176722,"RUMINANTS grazing pastures containing a large proportion of growing Phalaris tuberosa on occasions develop a nervous disorder, phalaris staggers1,2, the symptoms of which are an initial hyperexcitability followed by muscular tremors, unco-ordinated gait and stumbling or falling when driven. Demyelination in the spinal cord ensues and complete recovery has not been observed. On the grounds that similar symptoms and pathological changes occur in cats3, dogs4 and hens5 treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, Dr. J. H. Gaddum (personal communication to Dr. H. R. Marston) suggested that some knowledge of the cholinesterase activity in the blood of animals suffering from phalaris staggers might illuminate the origin of the disorder."
