In adults, new hepatocytes originate from the existing hepatocyte pool3–8, but the cellular source of renewing hepatocytes remains unclear. Telomerase is expressed in many stem cell populations, and mutations in telomerase pathway genes have been linked to liver diseases9–11. Here we identify a subset of hepatocytes that expresses high levels of telomerase and show that this hepatocyte subset repopulates the liver during homeostasis and injury. Using lineage tracing from the telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) locus in mice, we demonstrate that rare hepatocytes with high telomerase expression (TERTHigh hepatocytes) are distributed throughout the liver lobule. During homeostasis, these cells regenerate hepatocytes in all lobular zones, and both self-renew and differentiate to yield expanding hepatocyte clones that eventually dominate the liver. In response to injury, the repopulating activity of TERTHigh hepatocytes is accelerated and their progeny cross zonal boundaries. RNA sequencing shows that metabolic genes are downregulated in TERTHigh hepatocytes, indicating that metabolic activity and repopulating activity may be segregated within the hepatocyte lineage. Genetic ablation of TERTHigh hepatocytes combined with chemical injury causes a marked increase in stellate cell activation and fibrosis. These results provide support for a ‘distributed model’ of hepatocyte renewal in which a subset of hepatocytes dispersed throughout the lobule clonally expands to maintain liver mass. A population of hepatocytes expressing high levels of telomerase are distributed throughout the liver and regenerate the liver during homeostasis and after injury."

The structure of the LH1–RC complex can provide information on the arrangement of protein subunits and cofactors; however, so far it has been resolved only at a relatively low resolution. Here we report the crystal structure of the calcium-ion-bound LH1–RC supercomplex of Thermochromatium tepidum at a resolution of 1.9 Å. This atomic-resolution structure revealed several new features about the organization of protein subunits and cofactors. We describe the loop regions of RC in their intact states, the interaction of these loop regions with the LH1 subunits, the exchange route for the bound quinone QB with free quinone molecules, the transport of free quinones between the inside and outside of the LH1 ring structure, and the detailed calcium-ion-binding environment. This structure provides a solid basis for the detailed examination of the light reactions that occur during bacterial photosynthesis. The structure of the Thermochromatium tepidum calcium-ion-bound light-harvesting–reaction centre (LH1–RC) supercomplex, which performs the primary reactions of photosynthesis in purple photosynthetic bacteria, is resolved to the atomic level."

https://openalex.org/W2795660791,"Delivery of recombinant proteins to therapeutic cells is limited by a lack of efficient methods. This hinders the use of transcription factors or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) ribonucleoproteins to develop cell therapies. Here, we report a soluble peptide designed for the direct delivery of proteins to mammalian cells including human stem cells, hard-to-modify primary natural killer (NK) cells, and cancer cell models. This peptide is composed of a 6x histidine-rich domain fused to the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the cell penetrating peptide PTD4. A less than two-minute co-incubation of 6His-CM18-PTD4 peptide with spCas9 and/or asCpf1 CRISPR ribonucleoproteins achieves robust gene editing. The same procedure, co-incubating with the transcription factor HoxB4, achieves transcriptional regulation. The broad applicability and flexibility of this DNA- and chemical-free method across different cell types, particularly hard-to-transfect cells, opens the way for a direct use of proteins for biomedical research and cell therapy manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2795851392,"Recent advances have made it possible to readily derive cardiac myocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). HiPSC-CMs represent a valuable new experimental model for studying human cardiac muscle physiology and disease. Many laboratories have devoted substantial effort to examining the functional properties of isolated hiPSC-CMs, but to date, force production has not been adequately characterized. Here, we utilized traction force microscopy (TFM) with micro-patterning cell printing to investigate the maximum force production of isolated single hiPSC-CMs under varied culture and assay conditions. We examined the role of length of differentiation in culture and the effects of varied extracellular calcium concentration in the culture media on the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. Results show that hiPSC-CMs developing in culture for two weeks produced significantly less force than cells cultured from one to three months, with hiPSC-CMs cultured for three months resembling the cell morphology and function of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in terms of size, dimensions, and force production. Furthermore, hiPSC-CMs cultured long term in conditions of physiologic calcium concentrations were larger and produced more force than hiPSC-CMs cultured in standard media with sub-physiological calcium. We also examined relationships between cell morphology, substrate stiffness and force production. Results showed a significant relationship between cell area and force. Implementing directed modifications of substrate stiffness, by varying stiffness from embryonic-like to adult myocardium-like, hiPSC-CMs produced maximal forces on substrates with a lower modulus and significantly less force when assayed on increasingly stiff adult myocardium-like substrates. Calculated strain energy measurements paralleled these findings. Collectively, these findings further establish single cell TFM as a valuable approach to illuminate the quantitative physiological maturation of force in hiPSC-CMs."

Genetic and biochemical observations indicate that the eIF2αP-directed holophosphatase, a therapeutic target in diseases of protein misfolding, is comprised of a regulatory subunit, PPP1R15, and a catalytic subunit, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). In mammals, there are two isoforms of the regulatory subunit, PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B, with overlapping roles in the essential function of eIF2αP dephosphorylation. However, conflicting reports have appeared regarding the requirement for an additional co-factor, G-actin, in enabling substrate-specific dephosphorylation by PPP1R15-containing PP1 holoenzymes. An additional concern relates to the sensitivity of the holoenzyme to the [(o-chlorobenzylidene)amino]guanidines Sephin1 or guanabenz, putative small-molecule proteostasis modulators. It has been suggested that the source and method of purification of the PP1 catalytic subunit and the presence or absence of an N-terminal repeat–containing region in the PPP1R15A regulatory subunit might influence the requirement for G-actin and sensitivity of the holoenzyme to inhibitors. We found that eIF2αP dephosphorylation by PP1 was moderately stimulated by repeat-containing PPP1R15A in an unphysiological low ionic strength buffer, whereas stimulation imparted by the co-presence of PPP1R15A and G-actin was observed under a broad range of conditions, low and physiological ionic strength, regardless of whether the PPP1R15A regulatory subunit had or lacked the N-terminal repeat–containing region and whether it was paired with native PP1 purified from rabbit muscle or recombinant PP1 purified from bacteria.

https://openalex.org/W2795592077,"Background Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca2+-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process. Methods Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied in vitro, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways. Results Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused de novo expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca2+-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion. Conclusions tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium."

The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells. PPAR-γ activation can become an important tool to improve outcomes in liver surgery through decreasing the pro-inflammatory phenotype of KCs and IRI."

Growing evidence indicates an important role for this pathway in metal acquisition and virulence, including in lung and burn-wound infections (P. aeruginosa) and in blood and heart infections (S. aureus).

The structural basis for these differences was determined from five ODH X-ray crystal structures, ranging in resolution from 1.9 to 2.5 Å, with or without NADP+ bound. Variation in hydrogen bonding with NADPH suggested an explanation for the differential recognition of this substrate by these three enzymes.

Donkersloot J.A. N-(Carboxyalkyl) amino acids: occurence, synthesis, and functions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61 (1497319): 517-55710.1146/annurev.bi.61.070192.002505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Opines are composed of a variety α-keto acid and amino acid substrates and have diverse functional roles. Octopine, isolated from octopus muscle by Morizawa in 1927, was the first described opine, composed of pyruvate and arginine (2Van Thoai N. Robin Y. Biosynthése de l'octopine et répartition de l'enzyme l'opérant chez les invertebrés.Biochim. Biophys.

ODHs are widespread in cephalopods and mollusks, such as Pecten maximus, the king scallop, where they allow the continuation of glycolysis under anaerobic conditions by shunting pyruvate into opine products and regenerating NAD+ (3Grieshaber M.K.

Pharmacol. 1994; 125 (7984874): 43-14710.1007/BFb0030909PubMed Google Scholar). Opines are also associated with crown gall tumor pathogenesis caused by Agrobacterium tumifaciens. In these plant infections, ODHs are encoded by the Ti plasmid. When expressed in the infected plant cell, they convert plant metabolites into opines providing nutrients to the pathogen. Variant strains of A. tumifaciens have been shown to encode ODHs utilizing α-keto acids such as glyoxylate, pyruvate, and α-ketoglutarate and amino acids such as l-histidine, l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-methionine (4Moore L.W.

In S. aureus, murine bacteremia and urinary tract infections are attenuated when the staphylopine receptor CntA is deleted (15Remy L. Carrière M. Derré-Bobillot A. Martini C. Sanguinetti M.

Opine metallophore biosynthesis requires two enzymes, a nicotianamine synthase (NAS) and an ODH. The nicotianamine synthase is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent aminoalkyl transferase that forms a secondary amine between an amino acid and the aminobutyrate moiety of SAM (Fig. 2). These enzymes are commonly associated with the production of the plant metallophore nicotianamine, composed of three aminobutyrate moieties derived from SAM (20von Wiren N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C. Nicotianamine chelates both FeIII and FeII implications for metal transport in plants.Plant Physiol. 1999; 119 (10069850): 1107-111410.1104/pp.119.3.1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa NAS uses available l-histidine along with SAM in the production of l-His-nicotianamine (l-HisNA), the substrate for PaODH. S. aureus, however, encodes a third enzyme, a histidine racemase, that generates d-histidine for use by the SaNAS in the production of d-His-nicotianamine (d-HisNA), the substrate for SaODH. Each ODH binds HisNA substrate performing a reductive condensation with an α-keto acid, followed by reduction using NAD(P)H, and generating the opine metallophore product. We observe differential substrate specificity by yersinopine dehydrogenase (YpODH, Y. pestis), pseudopaline dehydrogenase (PaODH, P. aeruginosa), and staphylopine dehydrogenase (SaODH, S. aureus). The substrate specificity for each enzyme was demonstrated using a steady-state kinetic approach, and the structural determinants of this specificity were investigated using X-ray crystallography. We previously reported the enzymatic production of pseudopaline by the P. aeruginosa NAS and ODH (10McFarlane J.S. Lamb A.L. Biosynthesis of an opine metallophore by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (29091735): 5967-597110.1021/acs.biochem.7b00804Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and confirmed the production of staphylopine by the homologous S. aureus enzymes as first demonstrated by Ghssein et al. (9Ghssein G. Brutesco C. Ouerdane L. Fojcik C. Izaute A. Wang S. Hajjar C. Lobinski R. Lemaire D. Richaud P. Voulhoux R. Espaillat A. Cava F. Pignol D.

In that work, we examined the utilization of different α-keto acids by the ODH enzymes observing differential specificity. To better define this specificity, we determined steady-state kinetic parameters for the ODHs in the presence of pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and glyoxylate (YpODH and SaODH) or α-ketoglutarate (PaODH). Each ODH requires d- or l-HisNA substrate made by NAS. To produce this substrate in excess, NAS was first incubated with SAM and d-His (SaNAS) or l-His (PaNAS) before adding ODH and NAD(P)H to the parent mix. Reactions were then initiated by combining the parent mix with α-keto acid and measuring a loss of absorbance at 340 nm as NAD(P)H is oxidized to NAD(P)+. SaODH selects the α-keto acid substrate pyruvate (Table 1 and Fig. S1) but also exhibits limited turnover with oxaloacetate and glyoxylate. The SaODH kcat for oxaloacetate is equivalent to pyruvate, but kcat/Km is 49-fold lower. For glyoxylate, kcat is 3.5-fold lower, and kcat/Km is 370-fold lower. Catalysis in the presence of α-ketoglutarate was within an error of 0 as previously reported (10McFarlane J.S. Lamb A.L. Biosynthesis of an opine metallophore by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (29091735): 5967-597110.1021/acs.biochem.7b00804Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, PaODH uses α-ketoglutarate (Table 1 and Fig. S1). It is able to incorporate α-ketoglutarate with either NADH or NADPH as a substrate with a 2-fold higher catalytic efficiency using NADPH. This suggests that either NADPH or NADH may be used in vivo, dependent upon availability. We observe very limited catalysis for PaODH in the presence of glyoxylate (apparent kcat = 0.015 s−1; 3-fold higher than the detection limit of 0.005 s−1). Catalysis is within error of 0 for pyruvate and oxaloacetate as previously reported (10McFarlane J.S. Lamb A.L. Biosynthesis of an opine metallophore by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (29091735): 5967-597110.1021/acs.biochem.7b00804Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). YpODH selects pyruvate as its primary substrate (Table 1 and Fig. S1). The YpODH kcat for oxaloacetate is equivalent to pyruvate, but kcat/Km is 28-fold lower. For glyoxylate, kcat is 1.4-fold lower, and kcat/Km is 35-fold lower. Catalysis with α-ketoglutarate was within error of the detection limit. These data indicate that glyoxylate and oxaloacetate are not effective substrates for these enzymes. YpODH and SaODH are specific for pyruvate, whereas PaODH is specific for α-ketoglutarate.Table 1Kinetic parametersProteinInitiating substrateNAD(P)Hα-Keto acidHisNA substratekcat (s−1)Km (μm)kcat/Km (m−1s−1)SaODHPyruvateNADPHd-HisNA0.26 ± 0.0129 ± 28900 ± 700SaODHPyruvateNADPHl-HisNA0.85 ± 0.01280 ± 23000 ± 40SaODHOxaloacetateNADPHd-HisNA0.26 ± 0.011400 ± 100180 ± 10SaODHGlyoxylateNADPHd-HisNA0.074 ± 0.0033000 ± 20024 ± 2PaODHα-KetoglutarateNADPHl-HisNA0.42 ± 0.0114 ± 131000 ± 2000PaODHα-KetoglutarateNADHl-HisNA0.92 ± 0.0161 ± 315000 ± 800YpODHPyruvateNADPHl-HisNA0.30 ± 0.0173 ± 14200 ± 200YpODHOxaloacetateNADPHl-HisNA0.29 ± 0.031900 ± 400150 ± 40YpODHGlyoxylateNADPHl-HisNA0.22 ± 0.011900 ± 100120 ± 8SaODHNADPHPyruvated-HisNA0.26 ± 0.01SaODHNADHPyruvated-HisNA0.009 ± 0.002PaODHNADPHα-Ketoglutaratel-HisNA0.33 ± 0.02PaODHNADHα-Ketoglutaratel-HisNA0.71 ± 0.02YpODHNADPHPyruvatel-HisNA0.38 ± 0.02YpODHNADHPyruvatel-HisNA0.013 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab SaNAS produces d-HisNA, whereas PaNAS produces l-HisNA. Amino acid specificity for the final opine metallophore could be a result of the NAS alone, or the ODH may be stereospecific for one HisNA. Therefore, each ODH was tested with HisNA produced by SaNAS and by PaNAS, with excess NADPH, and initiated by α-keto acid (Sa and Yp, pyruvate; Pa, α-ketoglutarate) (Table 1). Remarkably, although SaODH produces staphylopine in vivo using d-HisNA (9Ghssein G. Brutesco C. Ouerdane L. Fojcik C. Izaute A. Wang S. Hajjar C. Lobinski R. Lemaire D. Richaud P. Voulhoux R. Espaillat A. Cava F. Pignol D. Borezée-Durant E. et al.Biosynthesis of a broad-spectrum nicotianamine-like metallophore in Staphylococcus aureus.Science. 2016; 352 (27230378): 1105-110910.1126/science.aaf1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it exhibits a kcat 3.3-fold higher in the presence of l-HisNA with a kcat/Km 3-fold lower. Both PaODH and YpODH select l-HisNA as their substrate. In the presence of d-HisNA, PaODH exhibits a kcat of 0.016 s−1 (3-fold above the detection limit), and YpODH kcat is within error of the detection limit. Therefore, the ODHs have differing tolerances for the amino acid stereochemistry incorporated by the NAS into the HisNA substrate. Although YpNAS has not yet been purified preventing analysis, catalysis by YpODH in the presence of pyruvate and l-HisNA suggests the production of a yersinopine metallophore in Y. pestis (Fig. 2). Future kinetic analysis with purified YpNAS will determine whether l-histidine or an alternate l-amino acid is incorporated into yersinopine. Although all three ODHs use NADPH, significant catalysis is observed for PaODH with NADH (Table 1). A comparison of relative kcat values for each ODH was performed in the presence of saturating amounts of α-keto acid and d- or l-HisNA product with either NADH or NADPH. Although both YpODH and SaODH show little turnover with NADH, 38- and 26-fold lower than the kcat for NADPH, respectively, the PaODH kcat is 2.2-fold higher than the kcat for NADPH. This is consistent with the kcat differences observed when α-ketoglutarate is the initiating substrate (Table 1). In summary, SaODH and YpODH show specificity for NADPH, whereas PaODH is nonspecific for the NAD(P)H substrate. X-ray diffraction data were collected to determine crystal structures for YpODH, PaODH, and SaODH (Table 2). Initially, opine-family dehydrogenases from P. maximus (PmODH, PDB code 3C7A) and Arthrobacter sp. strain 1C (ArODH, PDB code 1BG6) were used as models for molecular replacement trials, but a satisfactory phasing solution was not found. This was unsurprising given low sequence identity (15–18%). Selenomethionine-labeled YpODH was produced, and single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected to 2.15 Å with anomalous signal to 2.85 Å. Anomalous phasing and density modification were attempted with Phenix Autosol (27Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J.

Phasing and density modification were then performed using CRANK2 (24Skubák P. Pannu N.S. Automatic protein structure solution from weak X-ray data.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (24231803): 2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) in CCP4 (25Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G.

After refinement, YpODH–SeMet was used as a molecular replacement model for a 2.0 Å YpODH–Apo data set (Fig. 3A). YpODH–Apo was used as a molecular replacement model for the initial phasing of PaODH and SaODH (Fig. 3, B and C).

Open table in a new tab YpODH is composed of three domains (Fig. 4A). NADPH binds along a canonical GXGXXA loop within the N-terminal NAD(P)H-binding domain. This domain forms one half of the active site. The other half, and the proposed location for substrate binding, is formed by the catalytic domain. These domains are separated by a central cleft. Embedded within the catalytic domain is a third domain that forms a dimerization interface. The NAD(P)H-binding domain has a Rossmann-like fold. This domain contains twelve β-strands (1–12), five α-helices (A, B, and D–F), and one 310 helix (C). Helix G acts as a linker connecting the NAD(P)H-binding domain with the C-terminal, predominantly α-helical, domains. αH–J and N–P, as well as β13–14, form the catalytic domain, whereas αK–M form the dimerization domain. All YpODH structures solved to date have no density for two loops comprised of residues 158–181 and 349–360. The former contains three TQDIXAX sequence repeats of unknown function. The latter connects helix M to helix N between the catalytic and dimerization domains. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the missing amino acid sequences were present in both purified YpODH and YpODH crystals, indicating that these loops are present but disordered in this crystal condition (Fig. S2). PaODH and SaODH share the same domain and secondary structural elements as YpODH (Fig. 3). RMSDs reflect this, ranging from 1.47 to 2.09 Å (PDBeFold) (29Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

TM-align: a protein structure alignment algorithm based on the TM-score.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (15849316): 2302-230910.1093/nar/gki524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) of 0.91–0.93 over 418–428 Cα residues. Whereas both YpODH and SaODH have one monomer in the asymmetric unit, PaODH has two. The two PaODH monomers have an RMSD of 1.47 Å and a Tm score of 0.96 over 423 Cα. The YpODH TQDIXAX repeat loop (158–181) is not found in PaODH or SaODH. Instead, a short, five-residue loop connects β9–10. The disordered YpODH loop (349–360) connecting the dimerization and catalytic domains is ordered in PaODH and SaODH and composes part of the dimerization interface. The absence of these loops in the YpODH model accounts for the slightly higher RMSDs for comparisons with YpODH, whereas the Tm-align scores suggest equivalent structural similarity between the three enzymes. All three ODHs are dimers by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S3) and within their crystal structures (Fig. 4, B and C). Although the dimeric assembly is evident in the asymmetric unit of PaODH, the dimers for YpODH and SaODH are built using a crystallographic 2-fold rotation. The dimeric interface is formed by αL, αM, loop M–N, and the C terminus of αJ. PDBePISA calculates a buried surface area of 870 Å2 for YpODH, 1484 Å2 for PaODH, and 1457 Å2 for SaODH. The reduced surface area in YpODH is due to the disordered 349–360 loop. The interfaces are composed of 50–61% buried hydrophobic residues with minimal (0, 9, and 1, respectively) hydrogen bonds. Arthrobacter sp. strain 1C opine dehydrogenase (ArODH) and P. maximus opine dehydrogenase (PmODH) represent the nearest structurally characterized homologs with RMSDs of 2.43 and 2.85 Å over 307 Cα and 302 Cα residues. The core strands and helices of the NAD(P)H binding and catalytic domains show good alignment; however, an extended 310C, αP, αO, and β13–14, found in the three ODHs described here, are absent or abridged in ArODH (Fig. 4D) and PmODH. ArODH is reported to be a dimer (33Britton K.L. Asano Y. Rice D.W. Crystal structure and active site location of N-(1-D-carboxylethyl)-L- norvaline dehydrogenase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5 (9665174): 593-60110.1038/854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), yet its dimeric interface is formed by αJ and αO rather than αL–M as seen for Yp, Pa, and SaODH (Fig. 4E). Notably, the key helices in the YpODH dimer are missing (αL) or truncated (αM) in ArODH. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is also a structural homolog of opine dehydrogenases.

https://openalex.org/W2795934631,"Global introductions of aquatic species and their associated pathogens are threatening worldwide biodiversity. The introduction of two North American crayfish species, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, into Japan in 1927 seems to have negatively affected native Japanese crayfish populations of Cambaroides japonicus. Several studies have shown the decline of these native populations due to competition, predation and habitat colonization by the two invasive North American crayfish species. Here, we identify an additional factor contributing to this decline. We report the first crayfish plague outbreaks in C. japonicus populations in Japan, which were diagnosed using both histological and molecular approaches (analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region). Subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial ribosomal rnnS and rnnL regions of diseased specimens indicate that these outbreaks originated from a P. clarkii population and identify a novel haplotype of Aphanomyces astaci, d3-haplotype, hosted by P. clarkii. Overall, our findings demonstrate the first two cases of crayfish plague in Japan, and the first case in a non-European native crayfish species, which originated from the red swamp crayfish P. clarkii. This finding is a matter of concern for the conservation of the native freshwater species of Japan and also highlights the risk of introducing crayfish carrier species into biogeographic regions harboring species susceptible to the crayfish plague."
https://openalex.org/W2796199871,"The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium is a highly efficient hydroxylase of fatty acids, and there is a significant interest in using CYP102A1 for biotechnological applications. Here, we used size-exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis and negative-stain EM to investigate the molecular architecture of CYP102A1. The SEC-MALS analysis yielded a homogeneous peak with an average molecular mass of 235 ± 5 kDa, consistent with homodimeric CYP102A1. The negative-stain EM of dimeric CYP102A1 revealed four distinct lobes, representing the two heme and two reductase domains. Two of the lobes were in close contact, whereas the other two were often observed apart and at the ends of a U-shaped configuration. The overall dimension of the dimer was ∼130 Å. To determine the identity of the lobes, we FLAG-tagged the N or C terminus of CYP102A1 to visualize additional densities in EM and found that anti-FLAG Fab could bind only the N-tagged P450. Single-particle analysis of this anti-Flag Fab-CYP102A1 complex revealed additional density in the N-terminally tagged heme domains, indicating that the heme domains appear flexible, whereas the reductase domains remain tightly associated. The effects of truncation on CYP102A1 dimerization, identification of cross-linked sites by peptide mapping, and molecular modeling results all were consistent with the dimerization of the reductase domain. We conclude that functional CYP102A1 is a compact globular protein dimerized at its reductase domains, with its heme domains exhibiting multiple conformations that likely contribute to the highly efficient catalysis of CYP102A1."

Interest in this well-known siderophore was reignited by recent investigations suggesting that it plays a key role in mediating the enhanced virulence of a hypervirulent pathotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP). In contrast to classical opportunistic strains of K. pneumoniae, hvKP causes serious life-threatening infections in previously healthy individuals in the community. Multiple contemporary reports have confirmed fears that the convergence of multidrug-resistant and hvKP pathotypes has led to the evolution of a highly transmissible, drug-resistant, and virulent “super bug.” Despite hvKP harboring four distinct siderophore operons, knocking out production of only aerobactin led to a significant attenuation of virulence. Herein, we continue our structural and functional studies on the biosynthesis of this crucial virulence factor. In vivo heterologous production and in vitro reconstitution of aerobactin biosynthesis from hvKP was carried out, demonstrating the specificity, stereoselectivity, and kinetic throughput of the complete pathway.

Unfortunately, suitable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) have not been previously identified in M. separata for normalizing target gene expression. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of eight candidate genes (18S, ACT, EF1-α, GAPDH, RPS7, RPS13, RPL32 and TUB) in M. separata using the comparative ΔCt method, BestKeeper, Normfinder geNorm and ReFinder, a comprehensive software platform. The results indicated that the appropriate reference gene varied depending on the experimental conditions. We found that ACTIN, EF1-α and TUB were optimal for different developmental stages; TUB, RPS13 and EF1-α showed the most stable expresssion in different tissues; RPS13 and 18S were the best reference genes for monitoring expression under high temperature conditions; TUB, RPS13 and RPS7 exhibited the most stable expression under larval-crowding conditions; RPS7, EF1-α, RPL32 and GAPDH were the best for pesticide exposure experiments. This study provides tools for reliable normalization of qRT-PCR data and forms a foundation for functional studies of target gene expression in M. separata."
https://openalex.org/W2795735655,"We evaluated the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), which includes two Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen formulations (TB1 and TB2), for detection of latent tuberculosis infection during pregnancy. Eight-hundred-twenty-nine Ethiopian pregnant women (5.9% HIV-positive) were tested with QFT-Plus, with bacteriological sputum analysis performed for women with clinically suspected tuberculosis and HIV-positive women irrespective of clinical presentation. QFT-Plus read-out was categorized according to the conventional cut-off (0.35 IU/ml) for both antigen formulations. In addition, we analysed the distribution of QFT-Plus results within a borderline zone (0.20-0.70 IU/ml), and interferon-γ response in relation to HIV infection and gestational age. Two-hundred-seventy-seven women (33%) were QFT-Plus-positive (HIV-positive 16/49 [33%]; HIV-negative 261/780 [33%]). There was a strong agreement between the two antigen formulations (κ = 0.92), with discordant results in 29 cases (3.5%). Whereas discordant QFT-Plus results were rare in pregnancy, several results with both TB1 and TB2 within the borderline range were observed (11/49 [22%] vs. 43/780 [5.5%] in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, respectively; p<0.0001). HIV-positive women had lower absolute interferon-γ levels (TB1: 0.47 vs. 2.16 IU/ml; p<0.001, TB2: 0.49 vs. 2.24 IU/ml, p<0.001, considering results ≥0.20 IU/ml) compared to HIV-negative women. QFT-Plus-positive women who submitted samples at later stages of pregnancy had lower mitogen- (p<0.001) but higher TB-antigen-specific (p = 0.031 for TB1, p = 0.061 for TB2) interferon-γ response. Considering their lower capacity to produce TB-specific interferon-γ, a lower cut-off level for defining QFT-Plus-positivity may be considered in HIV-positive pregnant women."

This would allow effective characterisation of the population spatio-temporal dynamic of the C. capitata population at both the orchard level and the area-wide landscape. The aim of this study was to analyse population patterns of adult medflies caught using two trapping systems in a peach orchard located in central Italy. They were differentiated by adult sex (males or females) and mating status of females (unmated or mated females) to determine the spatio-temporal dynamic and evaluate the effect of cultivar and chemical treatments on trap catches. Female mating status was assessed by spermathecal dissection and a blind test was carried out to evaluate the reliability of the technique. Geostatistical methods, variogram and kriging, were used to produce distributional maps. Results showed a strong correlation between the distribution of males and unmated females, whereas males versus mated females and unmated females versus mated females showed a lower correlation. Both cultivar and chemical treatments had significant effects on trap catches, showing associations with sex and female mating status. Medfly adults showed aggregated distributions in the experimental field, but hot spots locations varied. The spatial pattern of unmated females reflected that of males, whereas mated females were largely distributed around ripening or ripe fruit. The results give relevant insights into pest management. Mated females may be distributed differently to unmated females and the identification of male hot spots through monitoring would allow localisation of virgin female populations. Based on our results, a more precise IPM strategy, coupled with effective sanitation practices, could represent a more effective approach to medfly control."
https://openalex.org/W2796436962,"The current study aimed to assess the potential of different exercises triggering an osteogenic response at the femoral neck in a group of postmenopausal women. The osteogenic potential was determined by ranking the peak hip contact forces (HCFs) and consequent peak tensile and compressive strains at the superior and inferior part of the femoral neck during activities such as (fast) walking, running and resistance training exercises. Results indicate that fast walking (5–6 km/h) running and hopping induced significantly higher strains at the femoral neck than walking at 4 km/h which is considered a baseline exercise for bone preservation. Exercises with a high fracture risk such as hopping, need to be considered carefully especially in a frail elderly population and may therefore not be suitable as a training exercise. Since superior femoral neck frailness is related to elevated hip fracture risk, exercises such as fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running can be highly recommended to stimulate this particular area. Our results suggest that a training program including fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running exercises may increase or preserve the bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck."

To gain more in-depth knowledge of how the act of caring and the adaption process affects caregiving spouses.Phenomenological, qualitative study. This study included spouses of stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: ""Caregiving and that´s all"" summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, ""Breaking the couple´s life together"" enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, ""Going through the (non) loss alone"" alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care. Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process."
https://openalex.org/W2795666638,"Background Inability to maintain a stable and beneficial microbiota is associated with chronic gut inflammation, which classically manifests as colitis but may more commonly exist as low-grade inflammation that promotes metabolic syndrome. Alterations in microbiota, and associated inflammation, can originate from dysfunction in host proteins that manage the microbiota, such as the flagellin receptor TLR5. That the complete absence of a microbiota (i.e. germfree conditions) eliminates all evidence of inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice demonstrates that this model of gut inflammation is microbiota-dependent. We hypothesize that such microbiota dependency reflects an inability to manage pathobionts, such as Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC). Herein, we examined the extent to which microbiota mismanagement and associated inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice would manifest in a limited and pathobiont-free microbiota. For this purpose, WT and TLR5-deficient mice were generated and maintained with the 8-member consortium of bacteria referred to as “Altered Schaedler Flora” (ASF). Such ASF animals were subsequently inoculated with AIEC reference strain LF82. Feces were assayed for bacterial loads, fecal lipopolysaccharide and flagellin loads, fecal inflammatory marker lipocalin-2 and microbiota composition. Results Relative to similarly maintained WT mice, mice lacking TLR5 (T5KO) did not display low-grade intestinal inflammation nor metabolic syndrome under ASF conditions. Concomitantly, the ASF microbial community was similar between WT and T5KO mice, while inoculation with AIEC strain LF82 resulted in alteration of the ASF community in T5KO mice compared to WT control animals. AIEC LF82 inoculation in ASF T5KO mice resulted in microbiota components having elevated levels of bioactive lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, a modest level of low-grade inflammation and increased adiposity. Conclusions In a limited-complexity pathobiont-free microbiota, loss of the flagellin receptor TLR5 does not impact microbiota composition nor its ability to promote inflammation. Addition of AIEC to this ecosystem perturbs microbiota composition, increases levels of lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, but only modestly promotes gut inflammation and adiposity, suggesting that the phenotypes previously associated with loss of this innate immune receptor require disruption of complex microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2796414099,"The propensity of a trait to vary within a population may have evolutionary, ecological, or clinical significance. In the present study we deploy sibling models to offer a novel and unbiased way to ascertain loci associated with the extent to which phenotypes vary (variance-controlling quantitative trait loci, or vQTLs). Previous methods for vQTL-mapping either exclude genetically related individuals or treat genetic relatedness among individuals as a complicating factor addressed by adjusting estimates for non-independence in phenotypes. The present method uses genetic relatedness as a tool to obtain unbiased estimates of variance effects rather than as a nuisance. The family-based approach, which utilizes random variation between siblings in minor allele counts at a locus, also allows controls for parental genotype, mean effects, and non-linear (dominance) effects that may spuriously appear to generate variation. Simulations show that the approach performs equally well as two existing methods (squared Z-score and DGLM) in controlling type I error rates when there is no unobserved confounding, and performs significantly better than these methods in the presence of small degrees of confounding. Using height and BMI as empirical applications, we investigate SNPs that alter within-family variation in height and BMI, as well as pathways that appear to be enriched. One significant SNP for BMI variability, in the MAST4 gene, replicated. Pathway analysis revealed one gene set, encoding members of several signaling pathways related to gap junction function, which appears significantly enriched for associations with within-family height variation in both datasets (while not enriched in analysis of mean levels). We recommend approximating laboratory random assignment of genotype using family data and more careful attention to the possible conflation of mean and variance effects."
https://openalex.org/W2795649050,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum–resident membrane protein that mediates cytosolic pathogen DNA–induced innate immunity and inflammatory responses in host defenses. STING is activated by cyclic di-nucleotides and is then translocated to the Golgi apparatus, an event that triggers STING assembly with the downstream enzyme TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). This assembly leads to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which in turn induces expression of type-I interferon (IFN) and chemokine genes. STING also mediates inflammatory responses independently of IRF3, but these molecular pathways are largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed the RAW264.7 macrophage secretome to comprehensively identify proinflammatory factors released into the extracellular medium upon STING activation. In total, we identified 1299 proteins in macrophage culture supernatants, of which 23 were significantly increased after STING activation. These proteins included IRF3-dependent cytokines, as well as previously unknown targets of STING, such as the immune semaphorin SEMA4D/CD100, which possesses proinflammatory cytokine-like activities. Unlike for canonical cytokines, the expression of the SEMA4D gene was not up-regulated. Instead, upon STING activation, membrane-bound SEMA4D was cleaved into a soluble form, suggesting the presence of a post-translational shedding machinery. Importantly, the SEMA4D shedding was blocked by TMI-1, an inhibitor of the sheddase ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) but not by the TBK1 inhibitor BX795.

Similarly, systemic inflammation characterized by interstitial lung disease, skin lesions, and hypercytokinemia in patients with activating mutations of the STING gene has been shown to be IRF3-independent using a mouse model (22Warner J.D.

Med. 2017; 214 (28951494): 3279-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that an additional signaling pathway or pathways are induced downstream of STING. Importantly, the lack of proinflammatory cytokine genes such as TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β has been shown to inhibit arthritis in DNase II–null mice (8Kawane K. Tanaka H. Kitahara Y. Shimaoka S. Nagata S.

Although STING activates another transcriptional factor, NF-κB, which induces proinflammatory cytokine gene expression, this activation is rather weak (11Ishikawa H. Barber G.N.

Thus, it is unclear whether NF-κB–mediated gene activation is sufficient for a STING-mediated inflammatory response. Here, we performed an unbiased comprehensive secretome analysis and determined that the activation of STING promoted the cleavage of the plasma membrane protein SEMA4D to release the inflammatory soluble form without its gene induction. We also found that TNFα protein was dramatically increased in the culture supernatant of STING-activated cells, although its mRNA expression was moderately induced in this condition. The production of soluble SEMA4D, as well as TNFα, was completely blocked by an inhibitor of the ADAM17 sheddase. On the other hand, the treatment of cycloheximide (CHX) or TBK1 inhibitor did not abrogate the shedding of SEMA4D. These results suggest that STING activates ADAM17-mediated post-translational shedding machinery. Because soluble SEMA4D is known to activate inflammatory cytokine production, the STING–ADAM17–SEMA4D axis may be required for optimal inflammatory response. To determine the inflammatory factors released from STING-activated cells, we prepared culture supernatants from Raw264.7 murine macrophage cells treated with or without DMXAA, a cell-permeable synthetic STING agonist. Like a natural ligand, DMXAA binds directly to murine STING and causes its conformational activation (15Gao P. Ascano M. Zillinger T. Wang W. Dai P. Serganov A.A. Gaffney B.L. Shuman S. Jones R.A.

The DMXAA-treated cells were cultured for 4 h under serum-free conditions to prevent contamination of serum-derived abundant proteins, but no significant cell death was observed, at least during the 4-h incubation period (data not shown). After collecting proteins from the conditioned medium, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis by “shotgun” LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1A). In total, we identified 1299 proteins, of which 23 proteins were significantly increased (q < 0.05, -fold increase > 4) by DMXAA stimulation (Fig. 1B, Table 1, and Table S1). These 23 significantly increased proteins included IRF3-dependent cytokines such as IFN-β and CXCL10, and the most increased protein was TNFα (about 150-fold increase). We also identified novel downstream targets of STING including SEMA4D, LRPAP1, and Fam3C. To confirm these results, we performed targeted LC-MS/MS analysis using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), which enables highly specific and accurate protein quantification of multiple proteins simultaneously (25Rauniyar N. Parallel reaction monitoring: A targeted experiment performed using high resolution and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015; 16 (26633379): 28566-2858110.3390/ijms161226120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As expected, the protein levels of SEMA4D, LRPAP1, and Fam3C in culture supernatants were increased about 3–6-fold by DMXAA (Fig. 1C and Table S2). DMXAA did not induce the release of another class 4 semaphorin member, SEMA4B, or of chemokine CCL9 (Fig. 1C and Table S2), confirming that specific sets of proteins were released by stimulation with the STING agonist. Among the 23 identified proteins, SEMA4D has been well-characterized as a proinflammatory protein (26Maleki K.T. Cornillet M. Björkström N.K.

Notably, the number of peptide spectrum matches of SEMA4D was relatively high among them (Table 1), suggesting that SEMA4D is an abundant protein in the culture supernatant of STING-activated cells. Thus, the activation of STING causes the release of the inflammatory factor SEMA4D in addition to known cytokines.Table 1Proteins increased by DMXAA stimulation on secretome analysisGene symbolDescriptionNo. of PSMsaPSM, peptide spectrum match.No. of peptides% Coverage-Fold increase DMXAA/DMSOCcl4C-C motif chemokine 491465580.1TnfTumor necrosis factor4241358141.9Glg1Golgi apparatus protein 126442459.4Sema4dSemaphorin 4D21820314.3Sdc4Syndecan-416852222.3Mthfd1C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase, cytoplasmic14028415.0H2-T23H-2 class I histocompatibility antigen, d-37 α-chain553195.6Cxcl10C-X-C motif chemokine 104553494.2Ccl2C-C motif chemokine 2454218.4Fam3cProtein FAM3C365266.6Hist1h1dHistone H1.3251265.0Tor3aTorsin 3A235186.0Ifnb1Interferon β1841828.0Lrpap1α-2-Macroglobulin receptor-associated protein144125.9Cxcl2C-X-C motif chemokine 21323618.9Ccl5C-C motif chemokine 5722141.9Icam2Intercellular adhesion molecule 27264.8Golim4Golgi integral membrane protein 464104.2Acvr1Activin receptor type-16126.4LifLeukemia inhibitory factor5158.3Ube2d3Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3422919.7Qsox2Sulfhydryl oxidase 24364.4Lrig2Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 21124.7a PSM, peptide spectrum match. Open table in a new tab To further confirm the STING-mediated release of SEMA4D, we performed Western blot analysis of culture supernatant using an antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain of SEMA4D. As shown in Fig. 2A, we detected SEMA4D release at 2 and 4 h after DMXAA stimulation. To determine whether STING is essential for DMXAA-induced release of SEMA4D, Raw264.7 cells lacking STING were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We confirmed again that SEMA4D was released along with TBK1 activation in DMXAA-stimulated wildtype (WT) cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, neither SEMA4D release nor TBK1 activation was observed in STING-deficient cells; this phenotype was rescued by ectopic expression of STING (Fig. 2B). Because STING activates the transcription of type-I IFN and inflammatory cytokine genes, we checked the induction of the SEMA4D gene after DMXAA stimulation. Real-time PCR analysis showed that DMXAA did not induce the expression of SEMA4D mRNA (Fig. 3A). As a control, we examined the expression levels of the canonical cytokine genes, and the IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA were dramatically increased, about 500–1500-fold, after DMXAA stimulation (Fig. 3A). The expression of TNFα mRNA was also up-regulated but only by an 8-fold increase, although the protein level in the cell medium was increased about 150-fold, which is comparable to IFN-β and CXCL10 (Figs. 1C and 3A). These observations prompted us to speculate that STING activates not only transcription but also post-translational machinery to release SEMA4D and TNFα. To confirm this possibility, the cells were treated with CHX to inhibit de novo protein synthesis and then stimulated with DMXAA. As expected, the production of CXCL10 was blocked by treatment with CHX in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SEMA4D was still released even in the presence of high-dose CHX (Fig. 3B). Because SEMA4D is a plasma membrane protein and its soluble ectodomain is generated by proteolytic cleavage (26Maleki K.T. Cornillet M. Björkström N.K. Soluble SEMA4D/CD100: A novel immunoregulator in infectious and inflammatory diseases.Clin. Immunol. 2016; 163 (26732857): 52-5910.1016/j.clim.2015.12.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we tested for whether the STING agonist promotes shedding of SEMA4D. The total cell lysates and culture supernatants were prepared at the same time, and the cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, the full-length membrane form of SEMA4D was reduced by DMXAA treatment in the cell lysates, concomitant with an increase of the cleaved form of SEMA4D in the culture supernatants. Although an intracellular cleaved form was observed in the cell lysates, its amount did not change after DMXAA stimulation. These results indicated that STING activates the post-translational processing of SEMA4D on the cell surface to release the soluble ectodomain.Figure 3.Activation of STING induces shedding of SEMA4D in a transcription-independent manner. A and C, Raw264.7 cells were cultured in 0.1% FCS/DMEM containing DMSO (−) or 100 μg/ml DMXAA for 4 h. In A, the mRNA levels of the indicated genes were determined by real-time PCR.

Invest. 2014; 124 (25401470): 5516-552010.1172/JCI79100Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These mutations encode an active form of the STING protein that triggers IRF3-dependent gene induction at steady state. However, a recent study revealed that IRF3 is dispensable for the development of systemic inflammation caused by the disease-associated mutant of STING in mice (22Warner J.D. Irizarry-Caro R.A. Bennion B.G. Ai T.L. Smith A.M. Miner C.A. Sakai T. Gonugunta V.K. Wu J. Platt D.J. Yan N. Miner J.J. STING-associated vasculopathy develops independently of IRF3 in mice.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 (28951494): 3279-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the shedding of SEMA4D might be involved in inflammation caused by this STING mutant. To test whether the STING mutant could induce SEMA4D shedding, we established stable cell lines that lack endogenous STING but inducibly express WT or the corresponding disease-associated mutant of mouse STING (V146L). After treatment with doxycycline, the STING V146L mutant but not STING WT accumulated in the perinuclear region, where most of it was co-localized with a cis-Golgi matrix protein, GM130 (Fig. 4A). We also observed phosphorylation of TBK1 in cells expressing STING V146L but not STING WT (Fig. 4B), confirming the constitutive activation of this STING mutant. Then, we collected the culture supernatants and found that release of soluble SEMA4D was provoked by the expression of the STING mutant. Thus, SEMA4D shedding is an additional phenotype induced by the disease-associated mutant of STING. Because the active mutant STING that was constitutively localized to the Golgi apparatus was able to induce SEMA4D shedding, we propose that STING trafficking may regulate its shedding machinery. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor, brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, completely blocked DMXAA-induced release of CXCL10, TNFα, and SEMA4D, suggesting that the Golgi apparatus acts as a platform for the induction of all downstream signaling events of STING. It should be noted that BFA also seemed to block SEMA4D trafficking to the plasma membrane, as the smear bands of SEMA4D migrated faster in the BFA-treated cells, which may imply incomplete glycosylation or degradation in the ER. After translocation to the Golgi apparatus, STING associates with TBK1, triggering CXCL10 and TNFα gene induction by phosphorylation of IRF3 and NF-κB, respectively (29Abe T. Barber G.N. Cytosolic-DNA-mediated, STING-dependent proinflammatory gene induction necessitates canonical NF-κB activation through TBK1.J. Virol. 2014; 88 (24600004): 5328-534110.1128/JVI.00037-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, DMXAA-induced SEMA4D shedding was not blocked by BX795, a specific TBK1 inhibitor, although it inhibited the induction of CXCL10 (Fig. 5A), indicating that SEMA4D shedding is TBK1-independent. Blocking of NF-κB–dependent transcription by BX795 partially but not completely inhibited the release of TNFα, further supporting the idea that STING promotes its production through a transcription-independent pathway. In addition to SEMA4D, our proteomic analysis revealed that TNFα, SDC4, TGFBR1, and SORL1 were also released into extracellular space by STING activation (Table 1 and Table S1). All of them are plasma membrane proteins that commonly undergo proteolytic cleavage by ADAM17 (30Dreymueller D. Pruessmeyer J. Groth E. Ludwig A. The role of ADAM-mediated shedding in vascular biology.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2012; 91 (22138087): 472-48510.1016/j.ejcb.2011.09.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 31Liu C. Xu P.

Mol. Med. 2014; 46 (24699135): e8910.1038/emm.2013.161Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that ADAM17 is required for STING-mediated SEMA4D release. The inhibition of ADAM17 sheddase activity by a pharmacological inhibitor, TMI-1, abolished DMXAA-induced release of TNFα and SEMA4D but not CXCL10 (Fig. 5A). We also confirmed that TMI-1 inhibited the SEMA4D shedding induced by the active mutant of STING without affecting TBK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that STING activates two independent downstream signaling pathways after trafficking to the Golgi: one is TBK1-mediated gene induction, and another is ADAM17-mediated cleavage of plasma membrane proteins (Fig. 5C). In this study, we identified novel STING-dependent signaling in which a cell surface protein, SEMA4D, is cleaved to produce its soluble ectodomain. The increased concentration of soluble SEMA4D in serum or plasma is associated with numerous inflammatory conditions in humans and mice (26Maleki K.T. Cornillet M. Björkström N.K.

https://openalex.org/W2796060558,"Determining and understanding drug target engagement is critical for drug discovery. This can be challenging within living cells as selective readouts are often unavailable. Here we describe a novel method for measuring target engagement in living cells based on the principle of altered protein thermal stabilization / destabilization in response to ligand binding. This assay (HCIF-CETSA) utilizes high content, high throughput single cell immunofluorescent detection to determine target protein levels following heating of adherent cells in a 96 well plate format. We have used target engagement of Chk1 by potent small molecule inhibitors to validate the assay. Target engagement measured by this method was subsequently compared to target engagement measured by two alternative methods (autophosphorylation and CETSA). The HCIF-CETSA method appeared robust and a good correlation in target engagement measured by this method and CETSA for the selective Chk1 inhibitor V158411 was observed. However, these EC50 values were 23- and 12-fold greater than the autophosphorylation IC50. The described method is therefore a valuable advance in the CETSA method allowing the high throughput determination of target engagement in adherent cells."

In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240-340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.RIC 1 group showed significantly (p<0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p<0.01 RIC 1-2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p<0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p<0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2796245544,"Rap1 proteins are members of the Ras subfamily of small GTPases involved in many biological responses, including adhesion, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Like all small GTPases, they work as molecular allosteric units that are active in signaling only when associated with the proper membrane compartment. Prenylation, occurring in the cytosol, is an enzymatic posttranslational event that anchors small GTPases at the membrane, and prenyl-binding proteins are needed to mask the cytoplasm-exposed lipid during transit to the target membrane. However, several of these proteins still await discovery. In this study, we report that cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) binds Rap1. We found that this binding is GTP-independent, does not involve Rap1's effector domain, and is fully contained in its C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR). Furthermore, Rap1 prenylation was required for high-affinity interactions with CAP1 in a geranylgeranyl-specific manner. The prenyl binding specifically involved CAP1's C-terminal hydrophobic β-sheet domain. We present a combination of experimental and computational approaches, yielding a model whereby the high-affinity binding between Rap1 and CAP1 involves electrostatic and nonpolar side-chain interactions between Rap1's HVR residues, lipid, and CAP1 β-sheet domain. The binding was stabilized by the lipid insertion into the β-solenoid whose interior was occupied by nonpolar side chains. This model was reminiscent of the recently solved structure of the PDEδ-K-Ras complex; accordingly, disruptors of this complex, e.g. deltarasin, blocked the Rap1-CAP1 interaction. These findings indicate that CAP1 is a geranylgeranyl-binding partner of Rap1."
https://openalex.org/W2795601058,"One histopathological characteristic of intracranial germinoma is abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) showing a two-cell pattern with large undifferentiated tumor cells. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L) axis has recently been recognized as an anti-tumor immune system. To evaluate intratumor immune status in intracranial germinoma, we examined expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 (clone 28–8) and subtypes of TILs. Expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 were detected immunohistochemically in 25 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 24 patients with intracranial germinoma consisting of 22 primary and 3 recurrent tumors. To evaluate subtypes of TILs, quantification of lymphocytes with CD3, CD8, CD4, and Foxp3 was performed. Statistical analyses were performed among PD-1, PD-L1 and subtypes of TILs. In 25 tumor tissue, expressions of PD-1 in TILs and PD-L1 in tumor cells were identified in 96% (24/25) and 92% (23/25), respectively. Expression of PD-1 was associated with CD3+ TIL density. Expression of PD-1 correlated with Foxp3+ TIL density and CD8+ TIL density, but not with CD4+ TIL density. Furthermore, expression of PD-1 correlated strongly with Foxp3+/CD4+ ratio. Taken together, increase of PD-1+ expression is associated with accumulation of Foxp3+ and CD8+ TILs. These findings intimate that PD-1/PD-L1 axis might shape the immune infiltration suggesting a modulation of the immune response and subsequent tumor growth in intracranial germinoma. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 are potential immune therapeutic strategies in intracranial germinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2795787989,"The E2F transcription factors control key elements of development, including mammary gland branching morphogenesis, with several E2Fs playing essential roles. Additional prior data has demonstrated that loss of individual E2Fs can be compensated by other E2F family members, but this has not been tested in a mammary gland developmental context. Here we have explored the role of the E2Fs and their ability to functionally compensate for each other during mammary gland development. Using gene expression from terminal end buds and chromatin immunoprecipitation data for E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3, we noted both overlapping and unique mammary development genes regulated by each of the E2Fs. Based on our computational findings and the fact that E2Fs share a common binding motif, we hypothesized that E2F transcription factors would compensate for each other during mammary development and function. To test this hypothesis, we generated RNA from E2F1-/-, E2F2-/- and E2F3+/- mouse mammary glands. QRT-PCR on mammary glands during pregnancy demonstrated increases in E2F2 and E2F3a in the E2F1-/- mice and an increase in E2F2 levels in E2F3+/- mice. During lactation we noted that E2F3b transcript levels were increased in the E2F2-/- mice. Given that E2Fs have previously been noted to have the most striking effects on development during puberty, we hypothesized that loss of individual E2Fs would be compensated for at that time. Double mutant mice were generated and compared with the single knockouts. Loss of both E2F1 and E2F2 revealed a more striking phenotype than either knockout alone, indicating that E2F2 was compensating for E2F1 loss. Interestingly, while E2F2 was not able to functionally compensate for E2F3+/- during mammary outgrowth, increased E2F2 expression was observed in E2F3+/- mammary glands during pregnancy day 14.5 and lactation day 5. Together, these findings illustrate the specificity of E2F family members to compensate during development of the mammary gland."

TG2-mediated cross-linking occurs via a transamidation reaction between γ-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamines (glutamine donors) and ∈-amino groups of peptide-bound lysines (lysine donors), resulting in the formation of ∈-(γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide bonds (11Folk J.E.

Because TG2 is a prominent stress response enzyme and the primary autoantigen in celiac disease (14Dieterich W. Ehnis T. Bauer M. Donner P. Volta U. Riecken E.O. Schuppan D. Identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen of celiac disease.Nat. Med. 1997; 3 (9212111): 797-80110.1038/nm0797-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), TG2-mediated protein complex formation has been investigated as a possible mechanism by which immune tolerance can be broken to self-molecules. Here we note the presence of high-molecular weight HMGB1 protein complexes (designated HMGB1c hereafter) that were enriched in plasma and PBMCs from SLE patients. These complexes were partially resistant to reducing agents, which was suggestive of covalent HMGB1 binding that was independent of disulfide bonding. Subsequent studies revealed that these HMGB1c form via TG2 transamidation activity, demonstrating that HMGB1 is a TG2–cross-linking substrate. Moreover, TG2 mediated HMGB1c formation in response to stimulation with LPS or the adjuvant alum. Some cross-linking sites are mapped to nuclear localization signal (NLS) regions of the HMGB1 polypeptide, and constituents of in vitro cross-linked HMGB1c included a number of autoantigens. These results identify and characterize, for the first time, HMGB1-TG2 interaction as well as the presence of TG2-dependent HMGB1c, with significant implications for cellular stress responses, innate immunity, and autoimmune disease. Elevated levels of HMGB1 have been described in SLE (15Abdulahad D.A. Westra J. Limburg P.C. Kallenberg C.G. Bijl M. HMGB1 in systemic lupus erythematosus: its role in cutaneous lesion development.Autoimmun. Rev. 2010; 9 (20546955): 661-66510.1016/j.autrev.2010.05.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we further demonstrated the presence of HMGB1 in large protein complexes in SLE patients. In standard SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis, the plasma levels of the prototypical 29-kDa HMGB1 varied slightly among individual samples, but there were no significant differences observed between SLE patients and healthy controls (Fig. 1A, bottom panels). However, an additional and larger HMGB1 signal of ∼150 kDa was observed in three of four SLE patients but not in all three controls (Fig. 1A, top panels, and Fig. S1). To further characterize the larger HMGB1 species, next we performed semidenaturing detergent–agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE), a well-established technique for separating large, SDS-denaturing resistant protein complexes (16Halfmann R. Lindquist S. Screening for amyloid aggregation by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis.J. Vis. Exp. 2008; (19066511): e83810.3791/838PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bagriantsev S.N.

SDD-AGE followed by Western blotting resolved two distinct patterns of the high-molecular weight HMGB1 complex: a faster-migrating complex that was uniformly observed in all plasma samples and a lupus-associated slower-migrating complex (Fig. 1B). Notably, the 29-kDa and the 150-kDa HMGB1 signals seen with SDS-PAGE were not detected by SDD-AGE. Because staining of the membrane showed a lack of proteins in the immediate regions of 25 kDa, the 29-kDa HMGB1 species could have been lost by diffusion. Alternately, under the less stringent condition of SDD-AGE, the partially unfolded 29-kDa HMGB1 could migrate aberrantly or, more likely, remain associated with its interacting proteins and yielded signals with retarded gel mobility. Both SDS-PAGE and SDD-AGE analysis show that HMGB1 circulates in the blood as large protein complexes and that the levels of such complexes are significantly higher in SLE patients than in healthy subjects. A similar pattern of HMGB1 expression was observed in the corresponding PBMCs: near-uniform expression of the 29-kDa HMGB1 in all samples but an enrichment of slower-migrating HMGB1c bands spanning from 75 to 250 kDa in three of four SLE patients (Fig. 1C). Although SDD-AGE proved useful for separating large complexes that are likely too large to enter SDS-PAGE gels, HMGB1c detected under the conditions of SDD-AGE could involve covalent as well as noncovalent linkages. Because we were interested in mechanisms that could catalyze the novel, covalently linked form of HMGB1 complexes, standard SDS-PAGE (that is, the presence of a reducing agent and heating of the samples before gel loading) was employed for subsequent experiments. Immunoblotting of unstimulated PBMC protein lysates from healthy subjects revealed the presence of a single 29-kDa HMGB1 band (Fig. 1D, lane 1). In contrast, LPS increased p29 HMGB1 levels after 4 h and also induced the formation of an HMGB1c migrating in excess of the 250-kDa size marker at 10 min and peaking at 2 h (Fig. 1D, lanes 2–5). Next we stimulated RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage-like cell line, with LPS and found that HMGB1c is also induced in this cell line in a time-dependent manner. Low levels of a 150-kDa HMGB1c were present in control cells (Fig. 1E, lane 1) but increased over time, resulting in a substantial increase the p150 HMGB1c and appearance of a slower-migrating band near the top of the gel (Fig. 1E, lane 6). LPS is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome through TLR4 ligation, which also is induced through an reactive oxygen species–dependent mechanism (18Martinon F. Agostini L. Meylan E. Tschopp J. Identification of bacterial muramyl dipeptide as activator of the NALP3/cryopyrin inflammasome.Curr.

Remarkably the NLRP-3 agonist alum (20Eisenbarth S.C. Colegio O.R. O'Connor W. Sutterwala F.S. Flavell R.A. Crucial role for the Nalp3 inflammasome in the immunostimulatory properties of aluminium adjuvants.Nature. 2008; 453 (18496530): 1122-112610.1038/nature06939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) induced the formation of HMGB1c in a concentration-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1F). Formation of HMGB1c despite exposure to heat and reducing agents was suggestive of disulfide-independent covalent bonding. Moreover, induction of HMGB1c described above by LPS and alum in cells suggested that the formation of these putative covalent linkages is induced in response to an inflammatory state. Given that LPS induced the formation of HMGB1c and is known to increase calcium flux (21Watanabe N. Suzuki J. Kobayashi Y. Role of calcium in tumor necrosis factor-α production by activated macrophages.J. Biochem. 1996; 120 (9010769): 1190-119510.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021540Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and raise intracellular reactive oxygen species levels (22Gandhirajan R.K. Meng S. Chandramoorthy H.C. Mallilankaraman K. Mancarella S. Gao H. Razmpour R. Yang X.F. Houser S.R. Chen J. Koch W.J. Wang H. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. Madesh M. Blockade of NOX2 and STIM1 signaling limits lipopolysaccharide-induced vascular inflammation.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 (23348743): 887-902PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that HMGB1c formation may be driven by the reactive oxygen species- and calcium-activated protein–cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). TG2 mediates cross-linking via a protein transamidation reaction between an ∈-amino group of a lysine residue (designated as Lys donor hereafter) and a γ-carboxamide group of glutamine residue (Gln donor). Because TG2 expression and cross-linking activity have been shown to be induced by LPS in rodent models (23Bowness J.M. Tarr A.H. Increase in transglutaminase and its extracellular products in response to an inflammatory stimulus by lipopolysaccharide.Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 169 (9089643): 157-16310.1023/A:1006846400478Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we first examined HMGB1 and TG2 expression in spleens and livers at 2 h and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS (2 mg/kg) into mice (n = 3–4) by Western blot analysis. Minimal amounts of HMGB1, HMGB1c, and TG2 were detected in spleens of unstimulated mice (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). However, LPS significantly increased the expression of HMGB1 and HMGB1c at 2 h and 24 h post-injection (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–9). In the liver, in addition to the 29-kDa HMGB1 band, modest amounts of HMGB1c were observed in unstimulated mice (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). The expression of HMGB1c was significantly induced by LPS at 2 h but returned to near basal levels at 24 h (Fig. 2, B, lanes 5-12, and C). Consistent with a previous report (23Bowness J.M. Tarr A.H. Increase in transglutaminase and its extracellular products in response to an inflammatory stimulus by lipopolysaccharide.Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 169 (9089643): 157-16310.1023/A:1006846400478Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), TG2 levels in the liver were increased 24 h after LPS administration (Fig. 2, B and D). Similarly, immunohistochemistry followed by confocal microscopy showed that stimulation with LPS for 2 h led to translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it exhibited increased co-localization with TG2 (Fig. 2E). These observations are in agreement with previous reports showing that LPS induces the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol (24Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A. Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. Monocytic cells hyperacetylate chromatin protein HMGB1 to redirect it towards secretion.EMBO J. 2003; 22 (14532127): 5551-556010.1093/emboj/cdg516Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the formation of HMGB1c is mediated by TG2, we first transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells with expression vectors for HMGB1, TG2, or both. For the ease of monitoring by microscopy, these recombinant proteins were tagged with a fluorochrome: mCherry for HMGB1 (mch-HMGB1, red fluorescence) and GFP for TG2 (TG2-GFP, green fluorescence). Twenty-four hours after transfection, imaging with confocal microscopy revealed that, in individual transfections, mch-HMGB1 was mainly localized in the nucleus, whereas TG2-GFP was in the cytosol (Fig. 3A). In co-transfection experiments, however, TG2-GFP was also observed in the nucleus and co-localized with mch-HGBM1 (Fig. 3A, arrows). Furthermore, when co-transfected cells were stimulated with ionomycin, an agent that increases intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and activates TG2, mch-HMGB1 was observed in the cytosol, co-localizing with TG2-GFP (Fig. 3A, arrowheads). These data suggest that HMGB1 and TG2 are interacting, as they can affect the subcellular localization of each other in transient transfection experiments. Formation of HMGB1c in these transfection experiments was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Using total cell lysates, mCherry antibodies yielded a signal of ∼58 kDa from mch-HMGB1 singly transfected cells, the expected size of mCherry fused to HMGB1 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). A slightly faster-migrating species, most likely a partial degradation product of mch-HMGB1, was also observed. However, no signals with slower gel mobility were observed. In contrast, co-transfecting mch-HMGB1 with TG2-GFP yielded slower-migrating mch-HMGB1c, whose formation was further induced by ionomycin (Fig. 3B). We conclude that TG2 was sufficient to induce the formation of HMGB1c, which was further stimulated by ionomycin. Next we demonstrated that HMGB1 interacted with TG2 by co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Constructs for enhanced GFP-HMGB1 or the vector control (expressing GFP only) were transfected into 293T cells. Subsequently, total lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using GFP-Trap coupled to magnetic agarose beads. Silver staining of the protein gel showed that GFP was 27 kDa, whereas GFP-HMGB1 was 53 kDa (Fig. 3C). In Western blotting, both recombinant proteins reacted with GFP antibodies. However, only the eluate from the GFP-HMGB1 sample but not the GFP sample yielded an appropriate TG2 signal of 75 kDa with TG2 antibodies. Hence, the result of the immunoprecipitation experiment showed that HMGB1 interacts with TG2. To demonstrate that TG2 mediates the formation of HMGB1c, we incubated recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1, His6 tag fused to human recombinant HMGB1 produced in Escherichia coli) with porcine liver TG2 protein in a buffer supplemented with Ca2+ (5 mm). Western blotting of the reaction mixtures demonstrated that TG2 was sufficient for the formation of HMGB1c, which formed in a TG2 concentration–dependent manner up to a TG2 enzyme concentration of 0.25 milliunits/μl (Fig. 3D, lane 5). Reaction products with more TG2 were less reactive to the anti-HMGB1 antibody used to process the Western blots in Fig. 3D, lanes 6 and 7, but may have been too large to enter the SDS-PAGE gels. Next we incubated TG2 with total RAW 264.7 cell lysates to determine whether TG2 mediates the formation of HMGB1c with endogenous HMGB1 as a substrate. Western blot analysis showed that, in RAW 264.7 cells, HMGB1 exists as a 29-kDa band as well as HMGB1c variants with sizes ranging from ∼150 kDa to in excess of 250 kDa (Fig. 3E, lane 1). Activation of TG2 with Ca2+ culminated in a decrease of HMGB1 p29 and the formation of HMGB1c accumulating near the top of the gel (Fig. 3E, lane 6, arrow). These complexes migrated with an apparent narrower size range but may also have been too large to enter the gel. Significantly, cystamine, a TG2 transamidation inhibitor, suppressed the formation of HMGB1c while inducing a smaller HMGB1c of 60 kDa and 100 kDa (Fig. 3E, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the latter could be intermediates. Because HMGB1 is 29 kDa, the 60-kDa HMGB1c could represent HMGB1 homodimers or HMGB1 associated with another protein of similar size. We also examined the effect of TG2 loss of function on HMGB1c. Knockdown of TG2 expression with TG2-targeting siRNAs in primary human pulmonary fibroblasts (hPFBs), a cell line shown previously to have high basal levels of TG2 expression and transamidation activity (25Willis W.L. Hariharan S. David J.J. Strauch A.R. Transglutaminase-2 mediates calcium-regulated crosslinking of the Y-box 1 (YB-1) translation-regulatory protein in TGFβ1-activated myofibroblasts.J. Cell.

To confirm the specificity of the anti-HMGB1 antibody used to detect HMGB1c so far, a peptide-blocking experiment was performed (Fig. 3G), where HMGB1 immunoblots were incubated with or without a synthetic peptide used to raise the HMGB1 antibody. Notably, the blocking peptide suppressed the signals from recombinant HMGB1 (Fig. 1G, lane 1), HMGB1c catalyzed by the addition of TG2 and recombinant HMGB1 to a cell lysate (Fig. 3G, lane 2), as well as endogenous HMGB1 and HMGB1c from mouse liver and hPFB cell lysates (Fig. 3G, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Suppression of the multiple HMGB1c forms in the in vitro cross-link reaction as well as endogenous forms in cell and tissue lysates confirms the specificity of the HMGB1 antibody for HMGB1c. The data suggest, for the first time, that, in addition to the well-characterized p29 form, HMGB1 exists as covalent, cross-linked protein complexes in various cells and tissues. TG2 has multiple functions, including GTPase-, protein kinase-, protein disulfide isomerase-, and Ca2+-dependent transamidation activity (reviewed in Ref. 26Gundemir S. Colak G. Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. Transglutaminase 2: a molecular Swiss army knife.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823 (22015769): 406-41910.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.09.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). So far, our data demonstrate Ca2+ dependence and TG2 inhibitor antagonism of the HMGB1c formation, which supports the notion that TG2 catalyzes the formation of HMGB1c via its transamidation activity. Therefore, the side chains of one or more glutamyl (Gln) and lysinyl (Lys) residues in HMGB1 should serve as TG2 substrates, and, potentially, HMGB1c could consist of HMGB1 forming intra- and/or intermolecular isopeptide bonds. To determine whether HMGB1 harbors such Gln and/or Lys donors, we first performed substrate incorporation assays using two well-characterized biotinylated TG2 substrates as affinity probes. These probes were 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine (BP), a TG2 K donor substrate, and the synthetic biotinylated peptide TVQQEL (A25), a Gln donor substrate (27Ruoppolo M. Orrù S. D'Amato A. Francese S. Rovero P. Marino G. Esposito C. Analysis of transglutaminase protein substrates by functional proteomics.Protein Sci. 2003; 12 (12761400): 1290-129710.1110/ps.0239103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). rHMGB1 was incubated with TG2 in the presence of either BP or A25. Subsequently, the cross-linking reactions were stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer and subjected to Western blotting with anti-HMGB1 antibodies to detect HMGB1 (Fig. 4A). A duplicated blot was incubated with NeutrAvidin-HRP (N-HRP) to determine whether one or both biotinylated peptides were incorporated into rHMGB1 (Fig. 4D). For the BP incorporation assay, anti-HMGB1 yielded a signal of 29 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 4, band 2), but no signal at the corresponding region using N-HRP was seen (Fig. 4D, lane 4). Hence, these results suggest that the p29 HMGB1 isoform does not form isopeptide bonds with BP and lacks Gln donors. Weak signals from larger species ranging from 50 kDa and distributed to the top of the gel were also observed. Those signals could be derived from contamination in the TG2 preparation or some from TG2. For A25, the HMGB1 antibodies did not yield a signal from p29 (Fig. 4A, lane 5), whereas N-HRP yielded two prominent signals of 75 kDa and 37 kDa (Fig. 4D, lane 5). The former species likely was TG2 cross-linked to A25, and the latter was HMGB1 cross-linked to multiple A25. Because A25 was ∼0.9 kDa in size, the data suggest that multiple A25 Gln donors were incorporated into the HMGB1 polypeptide, resulting in an approximate size shift from 29 to 37 kDa in SDS-PAGE. In addition, the data suggest that HMGB1 may not contain any Gln donor targeted by TG2 in substrate incorporation assays. Formation of HMGB1c was also was observed when TG2 was incubated with rHMGB1 (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Notably, HMGB1c formation was partially diminished by BP (lane 4) and almost completely suppressed by A25 (lane 5). These observations were in agreement with the substrate incorporation assay, which showed that A25 was efficiently incorporated into HMGB1 whereas BP was not. To identify the cross-linking sites in the substrate incorporation assays, three protein regions, including bands 1 and 2 (Fig. 4A) and band 3 (Fig. 4D), were excised from the gels and subjected to tandem LC-MS analysis followed by cross-link mapping using the MassMatrix database search software (28Xu H. Hsu P.H. Zhang L. Tsai M.D. Freitas M.A. Database search algorithm for identification of intact cross-links in proteins and peptides using tandem mass spectrometry.J. Proteome. Res. 2010; 9 (20469931): 3384-339310.1021/pr100369yCrossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because mass loss of -NH3+, a unique characteristic of cross-linking via transamidation, was included in the search criteria for analysis of the mass spectra, all cross-links identified from the excised gel bands were TG2-mediated. The identified cross-links are depicted in Fig. 4, B and E, as probability maps, where each cell represents a potential ∈-(γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide bond formed between the Gln donors and Lys donors. For band 1, two TG2-HMGB1 cross-links were identified in which HMGB1 Lys-44 and Lys-68 individually cross-linked to Gln-636 of TG2. Significantly, the results show that HMGB1 as a substrate was covalently cross-linked to its enzyme TG2 in HMGB1c. In addition, multiple TG2-TG2 isopeptide bonds were detected (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that TG2 also cross-linked itself, as reported previously (29Fleckenstein B. Qiao S.W. Larsen M.R. Jung G.

To understand how climate change will affect present-day species, it is necessary to assess their adaptive potential and distinguish it from the effects of random processes. This will allow predicting how different genotypes will respond to forecasted environmental change. Space for time substitution experiments are an elegant way to test the response of present day populations to climate variation in real time. Here we assess neutral and putatively adaptive variation in 11 populations of Festuca rubra situated along crossed gradients of temperature and moisture using molecular markers and phenotypic measurements, respectively. By comparing population differentiation in putatively neutral molecular markers and phenotypic traits (QST-FST comparisons), we show the existence of adaptive differentiation in phenotypic traits and their plasticity across the climatic gradient. The observed patterns of differentiation are due to the high genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the populations from the coldest (and wettest) environment. Finally, we observe statistically significant covariation between markers and phenotypic traits, which is likely caused by isolation by adaptation. These results contribute to a better understanding of the current adaptation and evolutionary potential to face climate change of a widespread species. They can also be extrapolated to understand how the studied populations will adjust to upcoming climate change without going through the lengthy process of phenotyping."
https://openalex.org/W2795997524,"ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 11 (ARL11) is a cancer-predisposing gene that has remained functionally uncharacterized to date. In this study, we report that ARL11 is endogenously expressed in mouse and human macrophages and regulates their activation in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Accordingly, depletion of ARL11 impaired both LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages and their ability to control intracellular replication of Salmonella. LPS-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was substantially compromised in Arl11-silenced macrophages. In contrast, increased expression of ARL11 led to constitutive ERK1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in macrophage exhaustion. Finally, we found that ARL11 forms a complex with phospho-ERK in macrophages within minutes of LPS stimulation. Taken together, our findings establish ARL11 as a novel regulator of ERK signaling in macrophages, required for macrophage activation and immune function."

https://openalex.org/W2796176945,"Skeletal muscle function is highly dependent on the ability to regenerate, however, during ageing or disease, the proliferative capacity is reduced, leading to loss of muscle function. We have previously demonstrated the presence of vitamin K2 in bovine skeletal muscles, but whether vitamin K has a role in muscle regulation and function is unknown. In this study, we used primary bovine skeletal muscle cells, cultured in monolayers in vitro, to assess a potential effect of vitamin K2 (MK-4) during myogenesis of muscle cells. Cell viability experiments demonstrate that the amount of ATP produced by the cells was unchanged when MK-4 was added, indicating viable cells. Cytotoxicity analysis show that MK-4 reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the media, suggesting that MK-4 was beneficial to the muscle cells. Cell migration, proliferation and differentiation was characterised after MK-4 incubation using wound scratch analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis. Adding MK-4 to the cells led to an increased muscle proliferation, increased gene expression of the myogenic transcription factor myod as well as increased cell migration. In addition, we observed a reduction in the fusion index and relative gene expression of muscle differentiation markers, with fewer complex myotubes formed in MK-4 stimulated cells compared to control cells, indicating that the MK-4 plays a significant role during the early phases of muscle proliferation. Likewise, we see the same pattern for the relative gene expression of collagen 1A, showing increased gene expression in proliferating cells, and reduced expression in differentiating cells. Our results also suggest that MK-4 incubation affect low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) with a peak in gene expression after 45 min of MK-4 incubation. Altogether, our experiments show that MK-4 has a positive effect on muscle cell migration and proliferation, which are two important steps during early myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2795590958,"Background Delivery of effective healthcare is contingent on the quality of communication between the patient and the healthcare provider. Little is known about primary healthcare providers’ perceptions of communication with patients in Rwanda. Aim To explore providers’ perceptions of patient-provider communication (PPC) and analyse the ways in which providers present and reflect on communication practice and problems. Methods Qualitative, in-depth, semi structured interviews with nine primary health care providers. An abductive analysis supplemented by the framework method was applied. A narrative approach allowed the emergence of archetypical narratives on PPC. Results Providers shared rich reflections on the importance of proper communication with patients and appeared committed to making their interaction work optimally. Still, providers had difficulty critically analysing limitations of their communication in practice. Reported communication issues included lack of communication training as well as time and workload issues. Two archetypes of narratives on PPC issues and practice emerged and are discussed. Conclusion While providers’ narratives put patients at the centre of care, there were indications that patient-provider communication training and practice need further development. In-depth exploration of highlighted issues and adapted strategies to tackle communication drawbacks are prerequisites to improvement. This study contributes to the advancement of knowledge related to communication between the patient and the provider in a resource-limited setting."
https://openalex.org/W2795722194,"Prostasin (CAP1/PRSS8) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored serine protease that is essential for epithelial development and overall survival in mice. Prostasin is regulated primarily by the transmembrane serine protease inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-2, and loss of HAI-2 function leads to early embryonic lethality in mice due to an unregulated prostasin activity. We have recently reported that critical in vivo functions of prostasin can be performed by proteolytically-inactive or zymogen-locked variants of the protease. Here we show that the zymogen form of prostasin does not bind to HAI-2 and, as a result, loss of HAI-2 does not affect prenatal development and survival of mice expressing only zymogen-locked variant of prostasin (Prss8 R44Q). Indeed, HAI-2-deficient mice homozygous for R44Q mutation (Spint2-/-;Prss8R44Q/R44Q) are born in the expected numbers and do not exhibit any obvious developmental abnormality at birth. However, postnatal growth in these mice is severely impaired and they all die within 4 to 7 days after birth due to a critical failure in the development of small and large intestines, characterized by a widespread villous atrophy, tufted villi, near-complete loss of mucin-producing goblet cells, loss of colonic crypt structure, and bleeding into the intestinal lumen. Intestines of Spint2-/-;Prss8R44Q/R44Q mice showed altered expression of epithelial junctional proteins, including reduced levels of EpCAM, E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-1 and -7, as well as an increased level of claudin-4, indicating that the loss of HAI-2 compromises intestinal epithelial barrier function. Our data indicate that the loss of HAI-2 in Prss8R44Q/R44Q mice leads to development of progressive intestinal failure that at both histological and molecular level bears a striking resemblance to human congenital tufting enteropathy, and may provide important clues for understanding and treating this debilitating human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2796416249,"Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.001). ATX was significantly decreased between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment in overall, male, and female SVR patients (all P < 0.001). In subjects with low necroinflammatory activity in the liver (i.e., alanine aminotransferase < 30 U/L), ATX levels were significantly reduced from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment and remained low (P < 0.001) in patients with a SVR. Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2795627411,"Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations."
https://openalex.org/W2795760411,"Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range Acca sellowiana (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer Araucaria angustifolia (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds-pinhão). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when Pinhão is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species."
https://openalex.org/W2796461567,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A450) of 0.655 (0.262-1.293) and 0.493 (0.284-0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41-50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51-67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2795942502,"An estimated 2.4 billion people lack access to improved sanitation which has devastating consequences for human health and the environment. Understanding what constitute sanitation demand is crucial for accelerating the spread of improved sanitation. This study aims to understand the adoption mechanisms for improved sanitation. An informal peri-urban settlement in Cochabamba, Bolivia was selected as a case study to understand adoption patterns. Various qualitative methods of data collection and analysis were employed. The findings showed that pour-flush toilets was the only preferred sanitation alternative at the study site. An adoption framework for waterborne toilets was developed based on diffusion of innovation theory. Factors that influence adoption were identified. Some functioned as triggers and initiated adoption, whereas some factors blocked adoption and constituted veto-barriers. Most factors were connected to the individual household situation and its members, but neighborhood development also affected pour-flush adoption. Based on adoption time the residents were divided into the following adoption groups: first adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards and non-adopters. Each adoption group followed its own adoption route with specific characteristics and respective triggers or veto-barriers. We argue that the strong demand for waterborne toilets in peri-urban areas need to be recognized and the developed framework could be used for customizing sanitation improvement programs for certain target groups."

Understanding the factors responsible for this heterogeneity in HIV spread may guide prevention efforts.We evaluated the relationship between HIV prevalence by ethnic group and a range of risk factors as well as the prevalence of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), syphilis and symptomatic STIs in the 2004/2005 Uganda HIV/AIDS Sero-Behavioural Survey-a two stage, nationally representative, population based survey of 15-59-year-olds. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the relationship between HIV prevalence and each variable.There was a positive association between HIV prevalence and HSV-2, symptomatic STIs and high-risk sex (sex with a non-cohabiting, non-marital partner) for women. Non-significant positive associations were present between HIV and high-risk sex for men and lifetime number of partners for men and women.Variation in sexual behavior may contribute to the variations in HIV, HSV-2 and other STI prevalence by ethnic group in Uganda. Further work is necessary to delineate which combinations of risk factors determine differential STI spread in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W2796038664,"The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR."
https://openalex.org/W2795380118,"Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% vs. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2796229625,"Skeletal muscle (SM) health and integrity is dependent on the dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and central to this process is the availability of amino acids (AA) in the amino pool. While Doxorubicin (DOX) remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, little is known of the effect of the drug on SM, particularly its effect on the availability of amino acids in the tissue. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P<0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P<0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P<0.05). Intracellular TAA, essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) where significantly increased in each muscle group analyzed, following the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg doses compared to control. This study provides important insight into the amino acid response following DOX chemotherapy and presents a substantial foundation for future studies focused on reducing SM damage and recovery by targeting amino acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2795629277,"The posterior auricular muscle (PAM) reflex to sounds has been used clinically to determine hearing threshold as an alternative to other audiological diagnostic measures such as the auditory brainstem response. We have shown that the PAM response is also sensitive to interaural timing differences in normally hearing adults. PAM responses were evoked by both ipsilateral/ contralateral monaural stimulation and by binaural stimulation. Introducing sound delays ipsilaterally or contralaterally decreased the PAM response amplitude and increased its latency. The PAM response in this study shows a qualitatively similar pattern to that seen by the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem potential to binaural clicks described in previous studies, in that both: have their shortest latency and maximal amplitudes centred around zero interaural timing differences, have response latencies increase with increasing interaural delays up to 1.2 ms and have response amplitudes decrease with increasing interaural delays of up to 1.2 ms. Our data show that the PAM response may be useful in measuring binaural integration in humans non-invasively for diagnostic or research studies."
https://openalex.org/W2795942383,"As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19–49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision. Migration of center of pressure was decomposed into a slow and a fast component denoting postural sway and lateral forces controlling postural sway, analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Main effects of group for the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions showed that patients displayed larger amplitudes (AP, p = 0.002; ML, p = 0.021) and lower frequencies (AP, p < 0.001; ML, p < 0.001) for the slow component, as well as for the fast component (amplitudes: AP, p = 0.010; ML, p = 0.001 and frequencies: AP, p = 0.001; ML, p = 0.029) compared to controls. Post hoc analyses showed no significant differences between patient groups. In conclusion, both the CFS- and the FM-group differed from the control group.

https://openalex.org/W2796134512,"Background and purpose T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Materials and methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient's age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke. Conclusions For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization. Assessment of ischemic lesions from the venous side appears to be useful for considering the etiology and revascularization therapy."

In this study, we reported that dimerization of p15RS is required for its inhibition on the transcription regulation of Wnt-targeted genes. We found that p15RS forms a dimer through a highly conserved leucine zipper–like motif in the coiled-coil terminus domain. In particular, residues Leu-248 and Leu-255 were identified as being responsible for p15RS dimerization, as mutation of these two leucines into prolines disrupted the homodimer formation of p15RS and weakened its suppression of Wnt signaling.

It was also found that p15RS down-regulates the mRNA levels of proteins known to promote cell invasion, such as cathepsin B and MMP-9 (13Zhang X. Cao Q. Liu X. Liu S. Wang J. Sun S. Wang O. Tian Z.

In particular, we have reported that p15RS attenuates the transcriptional regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. p15RS was found to not only block the complex formation of β-catenin·TCF4 (12Wu Y.

Protein dimerization is crucial in the functional regulation of proteins such as transcription factors (18Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M. The power of two: protein dimerization in biology.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29 (15501681): 618-62510.1016/j.tibs.2004.09.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Dimerization of transcription-associated factors facilitates the formation of multiprotein complexes required for transcription initiation by enabling proteins to bind simultaneously to different partners with overlapping binding sites (19Beckett D. Regulated assembly of transcription factors and control of transcription initiation.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314 (11846548): 335-35210.1006/jmbi.2001.5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As these multiprotein complexes are dynamic, protein dimerization also acts as a reversible switch to control the off/on status of the information flow during signal transduction (20Amoutzias G.D. Robertson D.L. Van de Peer Y. Oliver S.G. Choose your partners: dimerization in eukaryotic transcription factors.Trends Biochem.

Previous studies revealed that one of the most important motifs mediating protein dimerization is the leucine zipper, a parallel coiled-coil domain (21Vinson C. Acharya A. Taparowsky E.J. Deciphering B-ZIP transcription factor interactions in vitro and in vivo.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759 (16580748): 4-1210.1016/j.bbaexp.2005.12.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A typical leucine zipper consists of a series of heptads, a seven-amino acid motif, with the presence of a leucine residue in each heptad (22Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. The leucine zipper: a hypothetical structure common to a new class of DNA binding proteins.Science. 1988; 240 (3289117): 1759-176410.1126/science.3289117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). Previous studies observed that the CCT (coiled-coil terminus) domain of p15RS owns a potential to form homodimer (14Ni Z. Xu C. Guo X. Hunter G.O. Kuznetsova O.V. Tempel W. Marcon E. Zhong G. Guo H.

In this study, we attempt to examine whether the dimerization of p15RS via a leucine zipper–like motif affects the complex formation of β-catenin·TCF4 and thereafter inhibits Wnt signaling during tumorigenesis. A previously resolved crystal structure suggested that the CCT domain of p15RS forms dimers (14Ni Z. Xu C. Guo X. Hunter G.O. Kuznetsova O.V. Tempel W. Marcon E. Zhong G. Guo H. Kuo W.W. Li J. Young P. Olsen J.B. Wan C. Loppnau P. El Bakkouri M. et al.RPRD1A and RPRD1B are human RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain scaffolds for Ser5 dephosphorylation.Nat. Struct. Mol.

To examine whether full-length p15RS dimerizes in vitro, we performed a reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment, co-expressing Myc-p15RS and Flag-p15RS in HEK293T cells. The results showed that Flag-p15RS and Myc-p15RS interacted with each other, as precipitated by either an anti-FLAG (Fig. 1A) or an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1B). As p15RS contains a RPR (regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA) domain and a CCT domain (Fig. 1C), we questioned the exact domain responsible for p15RS dimerization. For this purpose, different domains of FLAG-tagged p15RS were co-expressed with full-length Myc-p15RS in HEK293T cells for an IP assay. The result indicated that the CCT domain (Fig. 1D, fifth lane) interacted with full-length p15RS but the RPR domain (Fig. 1D, fourth lane) lost this ability. Another IP experiment showed that the CCT domain formed a homodimer as well (Fig. 1E, fourth lane). These data suggested that the CCT domain of p15RS is responsible for its dimeric interaction in vitro. To further confirm whether full-length p15RS forms a homologous dimer, we performed formaldehyde cross-linking assays in HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length, RPR or CCT domain of p15RS. Western blot analysis of the cross-linked cells transfected with full-length p15RS demonstrated the presence of an additional band of about 80 kDa, twice the size of a p15RS monomer (about 39 kDa with tag) (Fig. 1F). This result suggested that full-length p15RS dimerizes. We also observed that the CCT domain per se formed homodimers, whereas the RPR domain failed to dimerize (Fig. 1G), corresponding to the IP results. Interestingly, we observed two bands around the dimerized position when the CCT domain was expressed (Fig. 1G). We speculated that the higher band represented dimers of the CCT domain with the endogenous full-length p15RS and the lower band represented dimers of the homo CCT domain. This result was consistent with observations from the IP experiments, showing that the CCT domain interacts with the CCT domain and full-length p15RS (Fig. 1, D and E). Taken together, these results indicated that full-length p15RS dimerizes due to its CCT domain. To reveal the exact motif responsible for the homologous interaction of p15RS, we analyzed the amino acid sequence in the CCT domain. Interestingly, we identified that from residue 217 to 276, the amino acid sequence of p15RS shares a high similarity with the leucine zipper motif, based on an alignment analysis of p15RS with typical leucine zipper family proteins including C/EBP, Jun, Fos, and GCN4 (Fig. 2A) (23Hattori T.

C/EBP family transcription factors are degraded by the proteasome but stabilized by forming dimer.Oncogene. 2003; 22 (12618752): 1273-128010.1038/sj.onc.1206204Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Halazonetis T.D.

In particular, p15RS was observed to contain 4 typical leucine zipper heptads from residue Leu-245. This finding suggested that p15RS contains a leucine zipper–like motif in its CCT domain. As leucine zipper motif is well-recognized to specifically regulate protein dimerization (21Vinson C. Acharya A. Taparowsky E.J. Deciphering B-ZIP transcription factor interactions in vitro and in vivo.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1759 (16580748): 4-1210.1016/j.bbaexp.2005.12.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we speculated that it is this leucine zipper–like motif within the p15RS CCT domain that mediate p15RS dimerization. To clarify this, point mutations were introduced to substitute the first two heptadic leucines at residues 248 and 255 into prolines (p15RSL248P/L255P) or alanines (p15RSL248A/L255A) (Fig. 2B) (26Yaku H. Mizuno T. The membrane-located osmosensory kinase, EnvZ, that contains a leucine zipper–like motif functions as a dimer in Escherichia coli.FEBS Lett. 1997; 417 (9409762): 409-41310.1016/S0014-5793(97)01329-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Xie W.

An immunostaining experiment showed that both mutants were located in the nucleus, similar to the WT p15RS (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the leucine zipper–like motif had no effect on protein distribution. To determine whether this leucine zipper–like motif regulates p15RS dimerization, we performed an immunoprecipitation co-expressing WT Flag-p15RS with Myc-tagged mutants (Fig. 2D). Intriguingly, we observed that Flag-p15RS failed to interact with Myc-p15RSL248P/L255P but weakly interacted with Myc-p15RSL248A/L255A. Furthermore, GST pulldown experiments using purified proteins from either Escherichia coli (Fig. 2E) or mammalian cells (Fig. 2F) showed that p15RSL248P/L255P no longer interacted with WT p15RS, whereas p15RSL248A/L255Aremained a weak dimeric interaction in mammalian cells. A cross-linking assay strengthened these findings, showing that p15RSL248P/L255P lost the ability to form dimers (Fig. 2G, P), whereas p15RSL248A/L255A maintained dimerization ability when it was subjected to a sufficient formaldehyde treatment (Fig. 2G, A), consistent with the eukaryotic GST pulldown results (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data revealed that mutations of the leucines into prolines at the leucine zipper–like motif abolishes the dimerization of p15RS. p15RS was previously reported as an intrinsic inhibitor of Wnt signaling (12Wu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang H. Yang X. Wang Y. Ren F. Liu H. Zhai Y. Jia B. Yu J. Chang Z. p15RS attenuates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by disrupting β-catenin-TCF4 interaction.J. Biol.

To address whether dimerization contributes to the inhibitory effect of p15RS on Wnt signaling, we examined the transcriptional activity of Wnt-targeted genes using the SuperTop-luciferase reporter. Luciferase assays in both HEK293T (Fig. 3A) and A375 cells (Fig. 3B) showed that expression of p15RSL248P/L255P failed to inhibit the Wnt1-stimulated luciferase activities, whereas p15RSL248A/L255A, similar to WT p15RS, remained to suppress Wnt signaling. These results suggested that dimerization of p15RS is crucial for its inhibition on the Wnt signaling pathway. p15RS was proved to interact with β-catenin and TCF4 (12Wu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang H. Yang X. Wang Y. Ren F. Liu H. Zhai Y. Jia B. Yu J. Chang Z. p15RS attenuates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by disrupting β-catenin-TCF4 interaction.J. Biol.

To address whether the dimeric interaction of p15RS alters its affinity in forming a complex with β-catenin or TCF4, we performed IP experiments to examine the association of TCF4, β-catenin, and p15RS mutants. The results showed that the interaction of p15RSL248P/L255P with TCF4 was decreased compared with the affinity of WT p15RS with TCF4 (Fig. 3C, P versus WT). However, the interaction of p15RSL248P/L255P with β-catenin was dramatically increased compared with WT p15RS and p15RSL248A/L255A (Fig. 3D, P). These results suggested that dimerized p15RS (WT) prefers to interact with TCF4, whereas p15RS monomer (L245P/L255P mutant) tends to associate with β-catenin. Consistently, a GST-pulldown assay using proteins purified from eukaryotic cells confirmed that p15RSL248P/L255P interacted with β-catenin with a higher affinity (Fig. 3E). To further address whether dimerization of p15RS affects the complex formation of β-catenin·TCF4, we examined the interaction of β-catenin and TCF4 under overexpression of WT or mutated p15RS. An IP result showed that the interaction of FLAG-β-catenin with HA-TCF4 was recovered when p15RSL248P/L255P was co-expressed (Fig. 3F, P), whereas WT p15RS and p15RSL248A/L255A decreased the interaction compared with the positive control (Fig. 3F, WT and A versus EV). This result indicated that WT p15RS and p15RSL248A/L255Ablocked the interaction of β-catenin and TCF4, whereas p15RSL248P/L255P failed to maintain this blockage. All these data further suggested that dimerization of p15RS participates in interrupting TCF4·β-catenin complex formation. To investigate whether the dimerization of p15RS is required for its occupancy on promoters of Wnt-targeted genes (12Wu Y. Zhang Y. Zhang H. Yang X. Wang Y. Ren F. Liu H. Zhai Y. Jia B. Yu J. Chang Z. p15RS attenuates Wnt/β-catenin signaling by disrupting β-catenin-TCF4 interaction.J. Biol.

The results showed that unlike WT p15RS and p15RSL248A/L255A, occupancies of p15RSL248P/L255P on the TBS of CCND1 (Fig. 3G) or c-MYC (Fig. 3H) were weakened, suggesting that aberrant dimerization of p15RS impairs its occupancy on the promoters of Wnt-targeted genes. Furthermore, we observed that both WT p15RS and p15RSL248A/L255A significantly inhibited the binding of β-catenin and TCF4 on the TBS, whereas p15RSL248P/L255P failed to block their occupancy (Fig. 3I). These results suggested that dimerization of p15RS facilitates its inhibition on Wnt downstream genes transcription. To examine whether β-catenin affects the dimerization of p15RS, we performed a GST pulldown assay using cells overexpressing GST-tagged and Myc-tagged p15RS together with β-catenin (Fig. 3J). The result showed that the presence of β-catenin decreased homo-interaction of p15RS, indicating that β-catenin might disassociate the dimerized p15RS. Further analyses revealed that the RPR domain of p15RS exhibited an enhanced interaction with β-catenin compared with full-length p15RS, whereas the CCT domain failed to interact with β-catenin (Fig. S1A). We also confirmed that a region from residue 407 to 533 in β-catenin was required for its interaction with p15RS (Fig. S1, B and C). Based on these observations, we proposed that β-catenin may compete with p15RS through its high affinity with the p15RS monomer and prevent p15RS from inhibiting the transcription of Wnt-targeted genes. To address whether dimerization of p15RS affects cell growth through its participation in the Wnt signaling pathway, we examined cell proliferation in metastatic melanoma A375 cells lines stably overexpressing pLVX-GFP-p15RS, pLVX-GFP-p15RSL248P/L255P, or pLVX-GFP-p15RSL248A/L255A. Right after lentivirus infection, the same number of GFP-positive cells among groups were seeded (Fig. 4A, top panels). Along cell passages, we were surprised to observe that the amounts of GFP-positive cells overexpressing p15RS or p15RSL248A/L255A decreased dramatically, whereas p15RSL248P/L255P overexpression exerted no inhibitory effect in cell growth, similar with the negative control cell line overexpressing pLVX vector (Fig. 4A, bottom panels). FACS analyses indicated that GFP-positive cells account for 90.56 and 73.37% in the mock and p15RSL248P/L255Pgroups but decreased to 8.61 and 8.49% in the groups overexpressing p15RS and p15RSL248A/L255A (Fig. 4A, FACS). Consistently, a MTT assay confirmed that p15RSL248P/L255P loses the ability to inhibit cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggested that the ability of p15RS to inhibit cell proliferation was weakened by aberrant dimerization. To examine whether dimerization of p15RS influences the colony formation ability of tumor cells, we performed a clone formation experiment in the A375 cells. The result showed that stable overexpression of p15RS or p15RSL248A/L255A inhibited clone formation but p15RSL248P/L255P overexpressing cells formed more colonies (Fig. 4C). A statistics analysis confirmed that the colony numbers of p15RSL248P/L255P cells were significantly increased compared with other groups (Fig. 4D). To address whether p15RS dimerization affects the invasion of tumor cells, we performed a wound-healing experiment. The data showed that overexpression of p15RSL248P/L255P failed to inhibit cell migration (Fig. 4, E and F). Taken together, these results suggested that p15RS loses its ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and invasion when its dimerization ability is broken. To investigate whether the dimeric ability of p15RS is involved in its inhibition on tumor growth, we performed a tumorigenesis assay by injecting A375 overexpressing cell lines into BALB/c nude mice through their armpits (Fig. 5A). The results showed that p15RS suppressed tumor formation compared with mock cells, whereas p15RSL248P/L255P-overexpressing cells exhibited a similar ability to form tumors compared with the mock cells (Fig. 5B). Consistently, we observed that the weight (Fig. 5C) and size (Fig. 5D) of the tumors were dramatically decreased by the overexpression of WT p15RS, whereas restored, although not completely, by p15RSL248P/L255P. All these results suggested that dimerization of p15RS is critical for tumor suppression. Based on all the results, we proposed that dimerization of p15RS is critical for its down-regulation of Wnt signaling and thus for tumor suppression (Fig. 5E). Dimerization of p15RS facilitates its association with TCF4 and thereafter maintains TCF4 in an inactive status without Wnt signaling. However, when Wnt signaling is activated, nuclear β-catenin binds with p15RS monomer with increased affinity so that it may break down the dimerized p15RS. Due to decreased association between monomer p15RS and TCF4, dimerized p15RS is removed from TCF4 so as to allow β-catenin to associate with TCF4, and to initiate transcription of Wnt-targeted genes. Dimerization is proved to be a key process in the activity regulation of proteins, including enzymes, ion channels, receptors, and transcription factors (18Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M.

We retrospectively determined factors associated with having a patient-nominated supporter among people living with HIV (PLWH), and its association with retention in care and viral suppression. We analysed registries of adults evaluated by social workers (n = 1345) at a referral hospital in Peru between 2011-2014. Nondisclosure of HIV status was associated with lacking supporters (aPR: 5.41, 95% CI: 3.83-7.64). Retention in care was 76.4% and 34.2% after one and two years of enrolment, respectively. PLWH with supporters were more likely to be retained in care after two years (aRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02-1.81), but not after one year (aRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98-1.23) compared to PLWH without supporters. Having supporters who were parents or friends was associated with an increased probability of being retained in care after one and two years of enrolment. Viral suppression after one year of enrolment was 58.7%. Having a supporter was not associated with viral suppression (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99-1.41), but PLWH with supporters were more likely to have viral load measurements (p = 0.005). Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH."

This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO2) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO2. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO2 and cold, dry (CD) CO2. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO2 into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p<0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p<0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO2 into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO2 (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO2 insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO2, as shown by infrared thermography. This study reports for the first time the use of LASCA to measure visceral perfusion in open abdominal surgery and shows that insufflation of open abdominal cavities with HH CO2 significantly increases visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature."
