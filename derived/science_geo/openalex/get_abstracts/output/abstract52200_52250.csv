Amorphous membrane fragments depleted in P-lipids and cytochrome oxidase were isolated from bovine heart mitochondria and were reconstituted with P-lipids and coupling factors to yield vesicular structures. These vesicles catalyzed a 32Pi—ATP exchange and showed an induced enhancement of anilinonaphthalene sulfonate fluorescence on addition of ATP 2. 32Pi—ATP exchange and fluorescence enhancement were abolished by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and by energy transfer inhibitors. The ATPase activity was inhibited by energy transfer inhibitors, but stimulated by uncouplers or by the combined action of nigericin and valinomycin in the presence of K+. Both ATPase activity and 32Pi—ATP exchange were inhibited by a specific antibody against coupling factor 1. 3. It was shown that the reconstitution of vesicular structures with functional activity required several hours. Rapid reconstitution resulted in inactive vesicles. Evidence for the formation of new vesicles from solubilized P-lipids was obtained by demonstrating inclusion of macromolecules such as 14C-labeled inulin or ferritin which could not be removed by washing."
https://openalex.org/W1614733900,"Abstract Human plasminogen and plasmin were found to be monomers by physical measurements. The cleavage of a single disulfide bond in both the proenzyme and enzyme, at pH 9, by reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol in 8 m urea, resulted in complete loss of proteolytic activity. At pH 3, activity losses paralleled the number of disulfide bonds cleaved with complete loss in activity only after total cleavage of all the disulfide bonds (21 to 22). The cleavage of the single interchain disulfide bond of plasmin at pH 9 resulted in the formation of two major chains (α and β) which were first demonstrated by starch gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea-2-mercaptoethanol systems at pH 3. S-Sulfo and S-carboxymethyl derivatives of plasmin were prepared; they were also found to contain two major chains on electrophoresis in starch gels. Sedimentation velocity measurements of both proenzyme and enzyme and their S-carboxymethyl derivatives, in urea-2-mercaptoethanol systems, confirmed the presence of plasmin chains. The amino-terminal amino acid residue of plasminogen and one plasmin chain was found to be lysine, and the amino-terminal amino acid residue of the second plasmin chain was found to be valine. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of plasminogen and one plasmin chain was found to be Leu-Asn-COOH, and the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of the second plasmin chain was found to be Lys-Arg-COOH. The activation of human plasminogen monomer to plasmin monomer by urokinase is probably due to the cleavage of a single arginyl-valine bond by the activator, which results in a two-chain molecule held together by a single disulfide bond. The spontaneous proteolytic activity of human plasminogen preparations is probably due to contaminating plasmin. It is suggested that the activation of human plasminogen by other activators, such as streptokinase, trypsin, and pig heart activator, may involve a similar hydrolytic cleavage of an arginyl-valine bond."
https://openalex.org/W1912085582,"The particulate hexokinase of ascites tumor, Sarcoma 37, is shown to be mitochondrial. The activity is readily solubilized by glucose 6-phosphate, ribonucleoside triphosphates, or high salt concentration with differing pH dependencies. Specificity and kinetic studies suggest that the effect of glucose-6-P is related to the regulator site on the enzyme. The enzyme can be bound again to previously eluted mitochondria in a Mg++-dependent equilibrium (and, more weakly, in the absence of added metal ions). The interaction follows a simple over-all equation, (binding sites) + (enzyme) + (Mg++) ⇄ (complex), represented by a single equilibrium constant. Mitochondria from tumor, liver, and brain have binding sites. Soluble enzyme from tumor, brain, and skeletal muscle can be bound to a large extent to tumor mitochondria. Soluble liver hexokinase and eluted tumor hexokinase which has been incubated with liver extract are not bound. Loss of ability to bind is attributed to a lysosomal cathepsin, and is also brought about by very small amounts of chymotrypsin. The tumor mitochondrial hexokinase is not in the compartment of oxidative phosphorylation, as shown by kinetic competition studies for oxidatively generated adenosine triphosphate and the lack of effect of atractyloside on the action of hexokinase on added ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2004763870,"The activity of adenosine triphosphatase activated by sodium and potassium ions is greatly increased in the gill and pseudobranch of the euryhaline killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, after its adaptation to seawater. Adenosine triphosphatase activity in gills of fish in salt water is reduced by hypophysectomy. The data suggest that this enzyme is involved in the excretion of sodiumions by the gill and that the adaptive increase which occurs in seawater is influenced by the hypophysis."
https://openalex.org/W95753805,"Abstract Purified rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase required K+ ion for maximal activity and was inactive at pH 7 unless the Mg++ concentration exceeded the total adenosine triphosphate concentration. Enzymatic activity was proportional to sulfhydryl reduction, and was reversibly lost by sulfhydryl oxidation with oxidized glutathione. The molecular weight of enzyme crystallized in the presence of adenosine triphosphate was determined. The smallest fully active form had a molecular weight of 3.8 x 105 and could be reversibly dissociated into units of either one-half or one-quarter this size; 95 to 98% of the enzymatic activity was lost by dilution at pH 6.7, by urea treatment at pH 5.8, or by lowering the pH to 5.0, all of which decrease the molecular weight to 1.92 x 105. Protein of this size had an intrinsic activity 0.02 to 0.05 times that of the higher molecular weight form and was completely reactivated by reaggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1550856778,"Abstract Keratosulfate from old human rib cartilage (KS II) was fractionated into two fractions on Bio-Gel P-6 resin. Glutamic acid or glutamine, serine, proline, and galactosamine were concentrated in the higher molecular weight fraction, whereas aspartic acid or asparagine was concentrated in the retarded peak. During alkaline treatment the higher molecular weight fraction became polydisperse through breaking of bonds involving N-acetylgalactosamine as well as serine and threonine. Studies of the action of alkali on KS II in the presence and absence of borohydride have led to the following conclusions: (a) The predominant O-glycosyl group linked to the hydroxyamino acids appears to be N-acetylgalactosamine. (b) A direct Ehrlich's chromogen is produced during the alkaline elimination, which parallels the decrease in seryl and threonyl groups. (c) When KS II or a product of KS II produced by partial hydrolysis with n acetic acid is treated with alkali in the presence of borohydride at 24°, a new ninhydrin-positive fraction is produced after hydrolysis in HCl. This is presumably derived from a 3-substituted N-acetylgalactosamine. The same fraction appears when N-acetylchondrosine or a tetrasaccharide derived from chondroitin 6-sulfate is treated with alkaline borohydride but not when a tetrasaccharide of hyaluronic acid is thus treated. The unknown derivative of N-acetylgalactosamine apparently is a reduction product of the unsaturated chromogen I postulated by Kuhn. (d) The chromogen produced by alkaline elimination appears to be still attached to a high molecular weight product. Therefore, it must be linked in the original substance via an O-glycosidic bond to the hydroxyl groups of the hydroxyamino acids; it is substituted in position 3 and is further linked to position 6 by an alkali-stable bond. The methylpentose of KS II was isolated and characterized as fucose by its methylphenylhydrazone."
https://openalex.org/W1913326387,"Abstract The interaction of actin with myosin and heavy meromyosin was studied in the presence of Mg++ ion and adenosine triphosphate at low ionic strength. When the heavy meromyosin ATPase was 17-fold activated by actin, the actoheavy meromyosin complex responsible for this activation did not give rise to a measurable increase in the viscosity of the sample above that predicted for a noninteracting mixture of actin and myosin. In the case of myosin, simultaneous measurements of turbidity, viscosity, and ATPase activity in the presence of actin showed, first, that considerable activation of the myosin ATPase could occur in the absence of any measurable precipitation of the actomyosin, and second, that in contrast to the behavior of the acto-heavy meromyosin system, ATPase activation was always accompanied by a corresponding viscosity increase indicating the formation of a relatively stable actomyosin complex in the cleared state. Comparison of the ATPase activity of acto-heavy meromyosin and actomyosin, under conditions where both systems were in solution (0.1 m KCl), indicated a distinct difference in the response of the actomyosin and acto-heavy meromyosin ATPases to falling ATP concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1550090658,"Abstract Mammalian livers contain an enzyme system which can oxidize N1-methylnicotinamide to N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4-pyridone) and N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-pyridone). Many of the properties of this enzyme system are similar to those which have been reported for rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase. Both pyridones are made in all the mammals examined, although in varying ratios. The ratio of the 2-pyridone to the 4-pyridone is constant for a a given species. The ratio characteristic of the oxidation of N1-methylnicotinamide by the enzyme system in the livers of mice and hogs is maintained under a variety of conditions including purification, heat denaturation, variation in type and amount of oxygen accepter, variation in substrate concentration, inhibition by cyanide, and loss of activity due to storage at -15°. These data have been taken as preliminary evidence in support of the concept that the two pyridones are synthesized from N1-methylnicotinamide by a single enzyme. The differential effects on the synthesis of the two pyridones exerted by Amytal and variation in the pH of the assay media have been observed. These findings may be indicative of different binding states or catalytic requirements for the two different oxidation processes or both. The gross similarities in the hog, mouse, and rabbit activities are compatible with all being attributable to aldehyde oxidases having similar but not identical structures."

https://openalex.org/W1502202285,"Abstract A 10-fold difference in activity of the liver enzyme, N1-methylnicotinamide oxidase, was found between mice of strains C57BL/6 and DBA/2. The Km value for the enzyme from DBA/2 mice with low activity was twice that of the enzyme from C57BL/6 mice. The activity difference segregated in F1, F2, and backcross generations as though it were genetically controlled by a single autosomal locus with alleles acting in an additive manner. The 2- to 4-fold higher activity in the adult male as compared to the adult female within each strain indicated that hormonal control of N1-methylnicotinamide oxidation was operating in addition to direct genetic control. Evidence from immature mice and from castrated and testosterone-treated animals supports the role of testosterone in increasing N1-methylnicotinamide oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1586340881,"Abstract The ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid-sensitizing factor extracted from natural actomyosin at low ionic strength was concentrated in the fraction obtained between 40 and 60% ammonium sulfate saturation. Fractionation within narrower salt limits and at low protein concentrations yielded a troponin-rich fraction at 40 to 53% saturation and a tropomyosin-rich fraction at 53 to 60% saturation. These ammonium sulfate fractions could be further purified by isoelectric precipitation at pH 4.6. The supernatant of the 40 to 53% fraction was shown to contain primarily troponin, while the precipitate of the 53 to 60% fraction was pure tropomyosin. It was found that for maximal EGTA-sensitizing factor activity a ratio of tropomyosin to troponin of 1:1.3, w/w, was required. This combination appears to form a complex which sediments as a single peak in the ultracentrifuge with a sedimentation constant of 5.15 S."
https://openalex.org/W1518895385,"Abstract Proteinpolysaccharide can be extracted readily at 37° from bovine cartilage without destruction of the collagenous structure. The proteinpolysaccharide, regardless of the method of extraction, contains a variable ratio of chondroitin sulfate chains to protein as shown by preparative electrophoretic fractionation. More vigorous methods of extraction cause degradation of the proteinpolysaccharide and gel filtration distinguishes between single chains of chondroitin sulfate and multichain proteinpolysaccharide. Electrophoretic fractions which are richer in chondroitin sulfate chains show a corresponding increase in alkali-sensitive serine residues. These serines are not evenly distributed with respect to the core material. Other considerations make it unlikely that the sensitive serines are sequentially located in a core protein."

https://openalex.org/W1511532725,"Abstract The genetic basis of the variation in activity of the mammalian enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of N1-methylnicotinamide to N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide has been investigated. The data indicate that in mice the magnitude of the enzyme activity depends on a pair of autosomal alleles, one of which determines a high level, the other a low level, of enzyme activity. Differences in enzyme activity between males and females and the effect of administration of estradiol and of testosterone to intact animals indicate that the level of enzyme activity is subject to hormonal influence as well. Thus, whereas the distinction between classes with low and high enzyme activity is under genetic control, levels of enzyme activity within these classes appear to be regulated by the endocrine system."
https://openalex.org/W1540428237,"Abstract Evidence is presented which establishes that chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate are part of the same macromolecular proteinpolysaccharide in bovine nasal septum. Degradation of the proteinpolysaccharide with papain releases single chains of chondroitin sulfate with a characteristic residual peptide still attached. A larger molecular weight fragment contains the keratan sulfate which retains a different distribution of amino acids and some chondroitin sulfate chains which can be separated by treatment with alkali with the loss of serine and theronine residues. While the ratio of protein to chondroitin sulfate varies widely in proteinpolysaccharide, the ratio of protein to keratan sulfate remains remarkably constant and different methods of degradation which release single chains of chondroitin sulfate from the macromolecule normally retain the keratan sulfate in the high molecular weight residue."
https://openalex.org/W1569090774,"K+ is required for the stimulation by the antibiotic nigericin of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis in rat liver mitochondria. This action does not occur when K+ is replaced by other monovalent cations. It requires slightly hypotonic conditions and is not related to the swelling phenomena linked to the accumulation of K+ in mitochondria. ATPase is inhibited by small anion molecules to which the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable, less so if the anion is translocated inside the mitochondria. High concentrations of Rb+ or Na+ and low concentrations of Ca++ inhibit the ATPase stimulated by nigericin. The ATPase activity of submitochondrial sonic fragments, and of Racker's coupling factor F1, are not stimulated by nigericin. β-Hydroxybutyrate and succinate partially inhibit the hydrolysis of ATP stimulated by nigericin in K+ media. Neither glutamate, malate, pyruvate, nor α-ketoglutarate inhibits this enzymatic activity. The inhibition of ATPase by oxidizable substrates is ascribed to the reincorporation of the liberated inorganic orthophosphate into ADP by way of the phosphorylation linked to the oxidation of succinate and β-hydroxybutyrate. Low concentrations of nigericin partially inhibit the ATPase stimulated by uncoupling agents requiring the presence of alkali metal cations for their mechanism of action; the inhibition depends on the ionic environment of the mitochondria. Nigericin does not affect ATPase activities induced by agents with no alkali metal cation requirement. Dianemycin, an antibiotic with properties similar to nigericin regarding induced ion movement and spectra of respiratory inhibition, does not stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP in any of several media tried. The K+-dependent ATPase stimulated by nigericin appears not to be related to a translocation of alkali metal cations induced by the antibiotic. The possibility that the induction of this activity is related to the participation of a potassium-dependent step in the sequence of reactions leading to the synthesis of ATP in mitochondria is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608375457,"Abstract Ultracentrifugal transport and equilibrium dialysis methods have been used to measure the number of ADP-binding sites per molecule of myosin and its enzymically active tryptic fragments (heavy meromyosin and Subfragment I). Over the range of nucleotide concentrations examined, both myosin and heavy meromyosin maximally bind close to 3 moles of ADP per mole of protein. Approximately 1 mole of ADP is bound per mole of Subfragment I with an affinity which closely parallels that observed for myosin and heavy meromyosin. These results are consistent with the idea that the heavy meromyosin region of myosin possesses three identical catalytically active sites for the hydrolysis of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W2083250813,"Peptides obtained from pepsin digestion of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of a preparation of brain microsomal sodium-potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase were treated at pH 5.4 with N-(n-propyl-2,3-3H)hydroxylamine of high specific activity, then separated by column chromatography, and further digested with pronase. A compound isolated in higher amounts from the phosphorylated enzyme than from the nonphosphorylated enzyme migrated with authentic L-glutamyl-γ-propylhydroxamate in four chromatographic systems and on electrophoresis on paper at three different pH's. The acyl phosphate ""intermediate"" in the phosphorylated form of the adenosine-triphosphatase therefore appears to be an L-glutamyl-γ-phosphate residue."
https://openalex.org/W1567115130,"Abstract A plant proteinpolysaccharide complex extracted from corn (Zea mays) pericarp with 15% trichloracetic acid contains hydroxyproline as a significant constituent of its protein or polypeptide moiety. Hydroxyproline, serine, and threonine, present in nearly equimolar amounts, constitute one-third of the amino acid residues. The polysaccharide portion of this material contains glucose in major amounts along with galactose, arabinose, and xylose. It also contains glucosamine. Enzymic digestions remove much of the hexose-containing polysaccharide, leaving a homogeneous core that contains most of the hydroxyamino acids and glucosamine. The resistance to extensive efforts to resolve the carbohydrate and protein moieties by physical means suggests the associated material to be a mucopolysaccharide."

https://openalex.org/W1531744847,"Abstract Streptokinase is shown to react with either human plasmin or human plasminogen to form an equimolar product which migrates in starch gel electrophoresis at pH 6.0 or 8.0 with a migration rate intermediate between the rates of migration of the two proteins. When streptokinase was present in molar excess in the reaction mixtures, the uncombined streptokinase displayed a migration rate at pH 6.0 (but not at pH 8.0) which was different from that of native streptokinase. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the reaction product with diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate did not cause dissociation of the complex, although no reaction product was observed in starch gel electrophoresis with mixtures of streptokinase and diisopropylphosphoryl plasmin. When equimolar mixtures of human plasminogen or human plasmin and streptokinase were subjected to electrophoresis at pH 6.0 in starch gels containing 6.4 m urea, the equimolar product was not observed; instead, plasmin and modified streptokinase were in evidence. On the other hand, when electrophoresis was carried out at pH 8.0 to 8.5 in urea-starch gels, reaction mixtures of human plasmin or human plasminogen and streptokinase displayed a number of electrophoretically distinct products which were derived from streptokinase. This marked degradation was not observed with human plasminogen-streptokinase reaction mixtures when the proteins were dissolved in 6.4 m urea prior to interaction and incubation, but it was noted in reaction mixtures made by mixing solutions of human plasmin and streptokinase which were individually dissolved in 6.4 m urea. The equimolar reaction product formed by reaction of streptokinase with human plasminogen was subjected to gel filtration chromatography in lysine-tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane buffer, and the isolated main peak was shown to display potent bovine plasminogen activator activity and weak proteolytic activity. The sequence of events occurring in the interaction of streptokinase with human plasminogen or human plasmin is discussed on the basis of the present findings and those reported previously from this laboratory. The results are taken to support the theory that the observed reaction product is a complex of human plasmin and structurally modified streptokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1499965696,"Abstract The accumulation of lactate and phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates, as well as the variation in adenosine triphosphate, diphosphate, and 5'-monophosphate, were measured over the first 4 min after addition of 0.77 mm glucose to Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells in 54 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 370 and 300. The rates of glucose flux through the phosphofructokinase step (Vpfk) and the lactate dehydrogenase step (Vldh) were calculated and compared with each other and the rate of oxygen consumption (Vr), measured by means of a bare, vibrating reed platinum electrode. During the period from 10 to 90 set or more after glucose addition, both Vr and Vpfk are linearly related to Vldh; at 370, Vpfk = 2.5 (Vldh - 1.1) and Vr = 0.38 (Vldh), where velocities are measured in micromoles per ml of cells per min; at 300, Vpfk = 4.1 (Vldh - 1.3) and Vr = 0.32 (Vldh). These results suggest a common controlling mechanism for all three rates. During the period from 10 to 60 sec approximately linear relationships between Vpfk, Vldh, and Vr and the ADP concentration are observed, but the slopes and intercepts of the lines vary considerably from one experiment to another unlike the relationships among the velocities themselves, which are almost identical in all experiments at the same temperature. In a given experiment, both Vldh and Vr extrapolate to the same ADP concentration (0 to 1.0 µmole per ml of cells) at zero velocity, which implies that if ADP is governing these rates only a fraction of the ADP may be involved in the control, but the same fraction or pool controls both respiration and glycolysis. The velocities are also approximately linear functions of esterified phosphate concentration. Since the increase in esters such as fructose diphosphate probably occurs at the expense of intracellular inorganic phosphate, this observation could be consistent with control of the rates by inorganic phosphate. The kinetic data do not identify either ADP or inorganic phosphate as the major controlling agent, but they do indicate a close coordination among the initial segment of glycolysis, the terminal segment of glycolysis, and respiration which is not fully explainable in terms of variations in either the ADP or phosphate levels in the whole cell."
