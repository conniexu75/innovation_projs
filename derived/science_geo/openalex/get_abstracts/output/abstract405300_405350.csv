https://openalex.org/W2110951885,"The extraordinary virulence of the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses has spurred intensive research into the molecular mechanisms by which they multiply and cause disease. Carette et al. use a genome-wide genetic screen in human cells to identify factors required for entry of Ebola virus. The screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes, and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1). Côté et al. report the identification of a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound that inhibits EboV infection in cell culture, with NPC1 being the target. The unexpected role for the hereditary disease gene NPC1 in Ebola virus infection may facilitate the development of antifilovirus therapeutics. Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are available1. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them to endosomes and catalyses fusion between viral and endosomal membranes2. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are probably required for viral membrane fusion; however, despite considerable efforts, these critical host factors have defied molecular identification3,4,5. Here we describe a genome-wide haploid genetic screen in human cells to identify host factors required for Ebola virus entry. Our screen uncovered 67 mutations disrupting all six members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein-sorting (HOPS) multisubunit tethering complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes6, and 39 independent mutations that disrupt the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1)7. Cells defective for the HOPS complex or NPC1 function, including primary fibroblasts derived from human Niemann–Pick type C1 disease patients, are resistant to infection by Ebola virus and Marburg virus, but remain fully susceptible to a suite of unrelated viruses. We show that membrane fusion mediated by filovirus glycoproteins and viral escape from the vesicular compartment require the NPC1 protein, independent of its known function in cholesterol transport. Our findings uncover unique features of the entry pathway used by filoviruses and indicate potential antiviral strategies to combat these deadly agents."
https://openalex.org/W1995109133,"A substantial source of cloud condensation nuclei in the atmospheric boundary layer is thought to originate from the nucleation of trace sulphuric acid vapour. Despite extensive research, we still lack a quantitative understanding of the nucleation mechanism and the possible role of cosmic rays, creating one of the largest uncertainties in atmospheric models and climate predictions. Jasper Kirkby and colleagues present the first results from the CLOUD experiment at CERN, which studies nucleation and other ion-aerosol cloud interactions under precisely controlled conditions. They find that atmospherically relevant ammonia mixing ratios of 100 parts per trillion by volume increase the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles by more than a factor of 100 to 1,000. They also find that ion-induced binary nucleation of H2SO4–H2O can occur in the mid-troposphere, but is negligible in the boundary layer and so additional species are necessary. Even with the large enhancements in rate caused by ammonia and ions, they conclude that atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and sulphuric acid are insufficient to account for observed boundary layer nucleation. Atmospheric aerosols exert an important influence on climate1 through their effects on stratiform cloud albedo and lifetime2 and the invigoration of convective storms3. Model calculations suggest that almost half of the global cloud condensation nuclei in the atmospheric boundary layer may originate from the nucleation of aerosols from trace condensable vapours4, although the sensitivity of the number of cloud condensation nuclei to changes of nucleation rate may be small5,6. Despite extensive research, fundamental questions remain about the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles and the mechanisms responsible, including the roles of galactic cosmic rays and other chemical species such as ammonia7. Here we present the first results from the CLOUD experiment at CERN. We find that atmospherically relevant ammonia mixing ratios of 100 parts per trillion by volume, or less, increase the nucleation rate of sulphuric acid particles more than 100–1,000-fold. Time-resolved molecular measurements reveal that nucleation proceeds by a base-stabilization mechanism involving the stepwise accretion of ammonia molecules. Ions increase the nucleation rate by an additional factor of between two and more than ten at ground-level galactic-cosmic-ray intensities, provided that the nucleation rate lies below the limiting ion-pair production rate. We find that ion-induced binary nucleation of H2SO4–H2O can occur in the mid-troposphere but is negligible in the boundary layer. However, even with the large enhancements in rate due to ammonia and ions, atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and sulphuric acid are insufficient to account for observed boundary-layer nucleation."
https://openalex.org/W2011074553,"The hippocampus is critical to remembering the flow of events in distinct experiences and, in doing so, bridges temporal gaps between discontiguous events. Here, we report a robust hippocampal representation of sequence memories, highlighted by ""time cells"" that encode successive moments during an empty temporal gap between the key events, while also encoding location and ongoing behavior. Furthermore, just as most place cells ""remap"" when a salient spatial cue is altered, most time cells form qualitatively different representations (""retime"") when the main temporal parameter is altered. Hippocampal neurons also differentially encode the key events and disambiguate different event sequences to compose unique, temporally organized representations of specific experiences. These findings suggest that hippocampal neural ensembles segment temporally organized memories much the same as they represent locations of important events in spatially defined environments."
https://openalex.org/W2052558548,"Vibrio cholerae is a globally important pathogen that is endemic in many areas of the world and causes 3-5 million reported cases of cholera every year. Historically, there have been seven acknowledged cholera pandemics; recent outbreaks in Zimbabwe and Haiti are included in the seventh and ongoing pandemic. Only isolates in serogroup O1 (consisting of two biotypes known as 'classical' and 'El Tor') and the derivative O139 can cause epidemic cholera. It is believed that the first six cholera pandemics were caused by the classical biotype, but El Tor has subsequently spread globally and replaced the classical biotype in the current pandemic. Detailed molecular epidemiological mapping of cholera has been compromised by a reliance on sub-genomic regions such as mobile elements to infer relationships, making El Tor isolates associated with the seventh pandemic seem superficially diverse. To understand the underlying phylogeny of the lineage responsible for the current pandemic, we identified high-resolution markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) in 154 whole-genome sequences of globally and temporally representative V. cholerae isolates. Using this phylogeny, we show here that the seventh pandemic has spread from the Bay of Bengal in at least three independent but overlapping waves with a common ancestor in the 1950s, and identify several transcontinental transmission events. Additionally, we show how the acquisition of the SXT family of antibiotic resistance elements has shaped pandemic spread, and show that this family was first acquired at least ten years before its discovery in V. cholerae."

The unexpected role for the hereditary disease gene NPC1 in Ebola virus infection may facilitate the development of antifilovirus therapeutics. Ebola virus (EboV) is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus that causes outbreaks of zoonotic infection in Africa. The clinical symptoms are manifestations of the massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection1 and in many outbreaks, mortality exceeds 75%. The unpredictable onset, ease of transmission, rapid progression of disease, high mortality and lack of effective vaccine or therapy have created a high level of public concern about EboV2. Here we report the identification of a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound that inhibits EboV infection. Using mutant cell lines and informative derivatives of the lead compound, we show that the target of the inhibitor is the endosomal membrane protein Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1). We find that NPC1 is essential for infection, that it binds to the virus glycoprotein (GP), and that antiviral compounds interfere with GP binding to NPC1. Combined with the results of previous studies of GP structure and function, our findings support a model of EboV infection in which cleavage of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains to expose the amino-terminal domain3,4,5,6,7, which is a ligand for NPC1 and regulates membrane fusion by the GP2 subunit8. Thus, NPC1 is essential for EboV entry and a target for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2111348189,"Massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies. They can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from a large gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star, and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light. Continuous accretion drives Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which are known to be variable but have never been observed to turn on or off. Tidal disruption of stars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on- set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. Here we report the first discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the new extragalactic transient, Swift J164449.3+573451. The behaviour of this new source differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events and observations of the jet-dominated AGN known as blazars. These differences may stem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. Such an event in the massive black hole at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy could strongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the Earth, if beamed towards us."
https://openalex.org/W2070255306,"The regrowth of amputated limbs and the distal tips of digits represent models of tissue regeneration in amphibians, fish and mice. For decades it had been assumed that limb regeneration derived from the blastema, an undifferentiated pluripotent cell population thought to be derived from mature cells via dedifferentiation. Here we show that a wide range of tissue stem/progenitor cells contribute towards the restoration of the mouse distal digit. Genetic fate mapping and clonal analysis of individual cells revealed that these stem cells are lineage restricted, mimicking digit growth during development. Transplantation of cyan-fluorescent-protein-expressing haematopoietic stem cells, and parabiosis between genetically marked mice, confirmed that the stem/progenitor cells are tissue resident, including the cells involved in angiogenesis. These results, combined with those from appendage regeneration in other vertebrate subphyla, collectively demonstrate that tissue stem cells rather than pluripotent blastema cells are an evolutionarily conserved cellular mode for limb regeneration after amputation."
https://openalex.org/W2155172869,"Two groups report observations of the X-ray source Swift J164449.3+573451, which was discovered when it triggered the Swift Burst Alert Telescope on 28 March 2011. Burrows et al. report that the source has increased in brightness in the X-ray band more than 10,000-fold since 1990, and by more than 100-fold since early 2010. They conclude that we are observing the onset of relativistic jet activity from a supermassive black hole. Zauderer et al. arrive at a similar conclusion based on their observation of a radio transient associated with the source, and extensive monitoring at centimetre to millimetre wavelengths during the first month of its evolution. They estimate the mass of the black hole at around 106 solar masses. Active galactic nuclei, which are powered by long-term accretion onto central supermassive black holes, produce1 relativistic jets with lifetimes of at least one million years, and the observation of the birth of such a jet is therefore unlikely. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption2,3 of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found4, potentially representing5,6 such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides7 with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to γ-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z ≈ 6."

https://openalex.org/W2030337024,"Glycoprotein-deleted (ΔG) rabies virus is a powerful tool for studies of neural circuit structure. Here, we describe the development and demonstrate the utility of new resources that allow experiments directly investigating relationships between the structure and function of neural circuits. New methods and reagents allowed efficient production of 12 novel ΔG rabies variants from plasmid DNA. These new rabies viruses express useful neuroscience tools, including the Ca(2+) indicator GCaMP3 for monitoring activity; Channelrhodopsin-2 for photoactivation; allatostatin receptor for inactivation by ligand application; and rtTA, ER(T2)CreER(T2), or FLPo, for control of gene expression. These new tools allow neurons targeted on the basis of their connectivity to have their function assayed or their activity or gene expression manipulated. Combining these tools with in vivo imaging and optogenetic methods and/or inducible gene expression in transgenic mice will facilitate experiments investigating neural circuit development, plasticity, and function that have not been possible with existing reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2064741852,"In the mammalian cortex, neurons and glia form a patterned structure across six layers whose complex cytoarchitectonic arrangement is likely to contribute to cognition. We sequenced transcriptomes from layers 1-6b of different areas (primary and secondary) of the adult (postnatal day 56) mouse somatosensory cortex to understand the transcriptional levels and functional repertoires of coding and noncoding loci for cells constituting these layers. A total of 5,835 protein-coding genes and 66 noncoding RNA loci are differentially expressed (""patterned"") across the layers, on the basis of a machine-learning model (naive Bayes) approach. Layers 2-6b are each associated with specific functional and disease annotations that provide insights into their biological roles. This new resource (http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/layers) greatly extends currently available resources, such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and microarray data sets, by providing quantitative expression levels, by being genome-wide, by including novel loci, and by identifying candidate alternatively spliced transcripts that are differentially expressed across layers."

Here, we identify repressive histone methylation in nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important brain reward region, as a key mechanism linking cocaine exposure to increased stress vulnerability. Repeated cocaine administration prior to subchronic social defeat stress potentiated depressive-like behaviors in mice through decreased levels of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation in NAc. Cre-mediated reduction of the histone methyltransferase, G9a, in NAc promoted increased susceptibility to social stress, similar to that observed with repeated cocaine. Conversely, G9a overexpression in NAc after repeated cocaine protected mice from the consequences of subsequent stress. This resilience was mediated, in part, through repression of BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling, which was induced after repeated cocaine or stress.

The convergence of aversive and rewarding symptoms suggests shared neural mechanisms, a hypothesis supported by high rates of comorbid mood and substance abuse disorders in humans (Ford et al., 2009Ford J.D.

Indeed, it is well known that a mood disorder increases an individual's risk for substance abuse, and this has been widely corroborated in animal models, which illustrate that stress, like cocaine itself, can directly promote subsequent drug taking (Covington et al., 2005Covington 3rd, H.E.

Conversely, clinical evidence shows that substance abuse can increase an individual's risk for a mood disorder; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. Chromatin regulation, whereby postmitotic neurons incorporate changes in transcriptional activity without altering DNA sequence, has received increasing attention for its role in mediating the lasting effects of drugs of abuse and stress on brain function (Borrelli et al., 2008Borrelli E.

One prominent type of chromatin modification, histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), is controlled by a complex interaction between two histone methyltransferases, G9a and G9a-like protein (GLP) (Rice and Allis, 2001Rice J.C.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that decreased expression of G9a in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, along with corresponding reductions in H3K9me2, are important in mediating heightened levels of transcriptional and behavioral responses to repeated cocaine (Maze et al., 2010Maze I.

Data obtained from postmortem human brain tissue, as well as from animal models, have further indicated a role for histone methylation in the promulgation of depressive-like behaviors and other psychiatric syndromes (Akbarian et al., 2005Akbarian S.

However, the specific genes at which cocaine- or stress-induced alterations in H3K9me2 influence addiction or depression symptoms have not yet been identified. Here, we examine a possible role for H3K9me2 in mediating the effects of repeated cocaine on vulnerability to stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. We first show that, as seen in humans, cocaine increases the susceptibility of mice to chronic social defeat stress, an ethologically valid model of depression (Berton et al., 2006Berton O. McClung C.A. Dileone R.J. Krishnan V. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Graham D. Tsankova N.M. Bolanos C.A.

Anhedonia and motivational deficits in rats: impact of chronic social stress.Behav. Brain Res. 2005; 162: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We go on to show that cocaine-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 in NAc is a key mechanism by which the drug renders the animals more vulnerable to social stress. Subsequent investigation of G9a-dependent molecular mechanisms common to both cocaine- and stress-induced behavioral phenotypes uncovered an essential role for BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling, which has been implicated in NAc in mediating both addiction- and depression-related phenomena (see Discussion). We show that chronic cocaine induces the small G protein, Ras, which in turn promotes BDNF-TrkB signaling and its subsequent activation of CREB, in NAc and thereby increases vulnerability to social defeat stress. Together, these results provide fundamental insight into how prior exposure to a drug of abuse enhances vulnerability to depression and other stress-related disorders. To investigate the impact of repeated cocaine on stress vulnerability, we utilized a submaximal version of social defeat. Previous work has shown that 10 days of defeat stress induces several cardinal depressive-like behaviors, such as social avoidance and reduced sucrose preference (Berton et al., 2006Berton O. McClung C.A. Dileone R.J. Krishnan V. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Graham D. Tsankova N.M. Bolanos C.A.

Han M.H. Graham D.L. Berton O. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Laplant Q. Graham A. Lutter M. Lagace D.C. et al.Molecular adaptations underlying susceptibility and resistance to social defeat in brain reward regions.Cell. 2007; 131: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Here, only 8 days of defeat stress were used, which in initial studies did not induce these symptoms. Next, either saline or a sensitizing regimen of cocaine was administered prior to initiating 8 days of defeat stress (Figure 1A ). Seven days of repeated cocaine (20 mg/kg/day), immediately followed by 8 days of defeat stress, revealed social avoidance (Figure 1B) and diminished sucrose preference (Figure 1D). This is in contrast to control animals receiving saline prior to chronic stress, which showed no such deleterious behavioral responses. To further verify the potential long-lasting effects of cocaine on behavioral deficits observed after 8 days of defeat stress, animals were re-exposed to a low dose of cocaine (5 mg/kg) 24 hr after the social interaction test (see Figure S1A available online). Both stressed and nonstressed cocaine-treated animals displayed sensitized locomotor responses to cocaine. The social stress did not, however, potentiate cocaine-induced locomotor activity in cocaine-naive mice (Figure S1B). Animals exposed to cocaine, in the absence of later social stress, displayed more rapid social interaction (i.e., decreased latency to interact)—an effect of cocaine that was completely reversed by exposure to 8 days of defeat stress (Figure 1C). The effects of cocaine, stress, or the combination of both stimuli had no impact on general levels of locomotor activity (Figure 1E). Cocaine, when self-administered during binges, increases thresholds for intracranial self-stimulation, indicating a withdrawal syndrome characterized by anhedonia (Markou and Koob, 1991Markou A. Koob G.F. Postcocaine anhedonia. An animal model of cocaine withdrawal.Neuropsychopharmacology. 1991; 4: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in Figures 1B and 1D, we did not observe an effect of cocaine alone on social interaction or sucrose preference. We have shown recently that, following repeated (not acute) cocaine, the repressive histone modification, H3K9me2, and its associated “writer” enzymes, G9a and GLP, are reduced in NAc, leading to the activation of numerous synaptic plasticity-related transcripts, increased dendritic spine density on medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and enhanced cocaine reward (Maze et al., 2010Maze I. Covington 3rd, H.E. Dietz D.M. LaPlant Q. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Mechanic M. Mouzon E. Neve R.L. Haggarty S.J. et al.Essential role of the histone methyltransferase G9a in cocaine-induced plasticity.Science. 2010; 327: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To validate these earlier findings, animals were treated with either saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg/day) for 7 days. At 24 hr after the final injection, NAc dissections were collected and analyzed for global alterations in G9a and H3K9me2 expression. Consistent with previous data, levels of G9a mRNA (saline versus repeated cocaine, t10 = 2.559; p < 0.05) and protein (Figure 2A ) and of H3K9me2 (Figure 2B) were reduced in NAc of animals treated with repeated, but not acute, cocaine. Such changes were absent in dorsal striatum (Figures S2A and S2B). Next, to examine potential similarities between cocaine- and stress-induced regulation of histone methylation in this brain region, the standard 10 day chronic social defeat stress protocol was used (Berton et al., 2006Berton O. McClung C.A. Dileone R.J. Krishnan V. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Graham D. Tsankova N.M. Bolanos C.A.

As previously reported (Krishnan et al., 2007Krishnan V. Han M.H. Graham D.L. Berton O. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Laplant Q. Graham A. Lutter M.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), two distinguishable groups of defeated mice, susceptible and unsusceptible, were observed based on a measure of social avoidance, in which susceptible mice displayed decreased social interaction compared to both control and unsusceptible mice (Figure 2C). Ten days after the final defeat, susceptible and unsusceptible mice, as well as nondefeated controls, were analyzed for G9a protein levels in NAc. G9a expression was significantly decreased in NAc of susceptible mice compared to unsusceptible animals (Figure 2D), which were no different from nonstressed controls. These effects were not observed in dorsal striatum (Figure S2C). Consistent with a reduction in G9a expression in susceptible animals, global levels of H3K9me2 were decreased in NAc of these mice compared to both control and unsusceptible mice (Figure 2E). Additionally, Glp mRNA, similar to G9a mRNA, was significantly reduced in NAc of susceptible mice, a molecular response that was absent in unsusceptible mice (Figure 2H). Numerous other repressive chromatin modifiers, such as Suv39h1, many of which form multimeric-binding complexes with G9a and GLP (Fritsch et al., 2010Fritsch L. Robin P. Mathieu J.R. Souidi M. Hinaux H. Rougeulle C. Harel-Bellan A. Ameyar-Zazoua M. Ait-Si-Ali S. A subset of the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferases Suv39h1, G9a, GLP, and SETDB1 participate in a multimeric complex.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 46-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), were also significantly induced in NAc of unsusceptible mice (Figure 2H), indicating that increased repressive chromatin regulation may contribute to proadaptive responses to stressful stimuli. In dorsal striatum, in contrast, H3K9me2 was significantly increased after social stress in both susceptible and unsusceptible mice (Figure S2D). Regulation of H3K9me2 in NAc after chronic social stress is specific for this mark, which is euchromatic, as global levels of the associated heterochromatic mark H3K9me3 were unaltered in NAc of both susceptible and unsusceptible mice (Figure S3A). To extend these findings in mice to clinical depression, we evaluated G9a and Glp levels, as well as other repressive chromatin modifiers, in NAc of postmortem human depressed patients (all symptomatic at their time of death; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for detailed methods on tissue collection). Similar to results observed in mice susceptible to social stress, G9a (Figure 2F) and Glp (Figure 2H) mRNA levels were significantly reduced in these patients. Numerous other enzymes involved in transcriptional repression—shown to be significantly induced in NAc of unsusceptible mice—were also downregulated in NAc of human depressed subjects (Figure 2H). Consistent with decreased G9a and Glp expression in NAc of depressed humans, global levels of H3K9me2 were also significantly reduced (Figure 2G). Unexpectedly, H3K9me3 protein expression was decreased in NAc of human depressed cases (Figure S3B), a finding inconsistent with data from our social defeat model, where no changes occurred in susceptible or unsusceptible mice. We next investigated the role of stress-induced alterations in G9a/GLP and H3K9me2 in NAc in controlling vulnerability to social stress. Animals were subjected to 10 days of chronic social defeat, and 24 hr after the final stress episode following a social interaction test, randomly selected susceptible mice received intra-NAc injections of herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors expressing either wild-type G9a-GFP, which has previously been demonstrated to induce H3K9me2 in this brain region (Maze et al., 2010Maze I. Covington 3rd, H.E. Dietz D.M. LaPlant Q. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Mechanic M. Mouzon E. Neve R.L. Haggarty S.J. et al.Essential role of the histone methyltransferase G9a in cocaine-induced plasticity.Science. 2010; 327: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), or GFP as a control (Figure 3A ). Mice were tested for social interaction 4 days after viral surgery, a time at which maximal transgene expression is seen (Figure 3B), as verified by western blotting (Figure 3C) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figure S4A). As expected, stressed animals overexpressing GFP displayed reduced social interaction compared to GFP-expressing nonstressed controls. In contrast, G9a overexpression, which mimics induction of endogenous G9a in NAc of unsusceptible animals, blocked the chronic stress-induced deficits in social interaction (Figure 3D). GFP and G9a overexpression in both stressed and nonstressed animals had no effect on general locomotor activity (Figure 3E). These data support a role for G9a and H3K9me2 in mediating resilience to chronic social stress. To directly test whether G9a and H3K9me2 repression in response to repeated cocaine mediates the increased susceptibility to social defeat stress observed under these conditions, we examined the influence of knocking down G9a in NAc (Maze et al., 2010Maze I. Covington 3rd, H.E. Dietz D.M. LaPlant Q. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Mechanic M. Mouzon E. Neve R.L. Haggarty S.J. et al.Essential role of the histone methyltransferase G9a in cocaine-induced plasticity.Science. 2010; 327: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) on the development of stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. G9afl/fl mice were injected intra-NAc with HSV vectors expressing GFP or Cre-GFP before being subjected to submaximal (8 days) defeat stress (Figure 4A ). G9a knockdown in NAc, which was confirmed immunohistochemically (Figure 4B) and quantitatively via western blotting (Figure 4C) and qPCR (Figure S4B), promoted increased susceptibility to social stress, similar to the effect of repeated cocaine (Figure 4D). This G9a knockdown also reduced sucrose preference after social defeat (Figure 4E) but had no effect on baseline locomotor activity (Figure 4F). The findings that G9a repression in NAc, which occurs after repeated cocaine, increases an animal's vulnerability to subsequent stress, and that G9a overexpression, which occurs in unsusceptible mice, reverses the behavioral deficits observed in susceptible animals, support the interpretation that cocaine-induced repression of G9a and H3K9me2 in this brain region renders animals more vulnerable to future stress experiences. To directly examine this possibility, we increased G9a expression in NAc after repeated cocaine to test whether such gene “replacement” was sufficient to prevent cocaine-induced vulnerability to subsequent stress episodes. A compressed submaximal social defeat protocol was employed to accommodate the time course of HSV expression: animals were injected daily with saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, followed by 8 defeats over a course of 4 days of twice per day (Figure 5A ). Using this compressed protocol, animals receiving prior cocaine still exhibited increased susceptibility to repeated social stress, as evidenced by increased levels of social avoidance (Figure 5B), without deficits in general locomotor activity (Figure 5C), similar to observations using the 8 day submaximal protocol. To test the role of G9a in cocaine-induced vulnerability to social stress, animals were injected once a day for 7 days with cocaine (20 mg/kg/day), before being injected intra-NAc with HSV-GFP or HSV-G9a-GFP, followed by 8 social defeats over 4 days (Figure 5D). As expected, cocaine-treated HSV-GFP animals displayed increased vulnerability to social stress, as measured by social avoidance behavior. In contrast, cocaine-treated HSV-G9a-GFP animals did not display such deficits (Figure 5E), indicating that increasing G9a expression in NAc after repeated cocaine—and thereby opposing the cocaine-induced repression of endogenous G9a/GLP—is sufficient to prevent drug-induced vulnerability to subsequent stressful experiences without affecting baseline locomotor activity (Figure 5F). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which alterations in G9a/GLP and H3K9me2 in NAc mediate cocaine-induced vulnerability to stress, we focused on BDNF-TrkB signaling, given the considerable overlap between the regulation of this pathway (Figure 6A ) in the development of addictive- and depressive-like behaviors (see Discussion). Animals were treated with repeated cocaine (20 mg/kg/day) once daily for 7 days, before being injected intra-NAc with HSV-GFP or HSV-G9a-GFP, followed by 8 social defeats over 4 days (twice per day) (Figure 6B). As was shown in Figure 5, such G9a “replacement” in NAc after repeated cocaine reversed cocaine's enhancement of stress vulnerability. At 48 hr after the final defeat experience, virally infected NAc tissue was analyzed for alterations in BDNF-TrkB signaling. Consistent with increased BDNF-TrkB signaling observed in NAc after chronic social defeat stress (see Krishnan et al., 2007Krishnan V. Han M.H. Graham D.L. Berton O. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Laplant Q. Graham A. Lutter M. Lagace D.C. et al.Molecular adaptations underlying susceptibility and resistance to social defeat in brain reward regions.Cell. 2007; 131: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), numerous other components of this signaling cascade, not previously examined, were upregulated by social stress in cocaine-experienced animals: including increased levels of phospho-Raf, phospho-MEK1/2, and phospho-CREB (Figure 6C, Figures S5C, S5E, and S5G). Although ERK1/2 has previously been demonstrated to display robust phosphorylation/activation after chronic social stress (Krishnan et al., 2007Krishnan V. Han M.H. Graham D.L. Berton O. Renthal W. Russo S.J. Laplant Q. Graham A. Lutter M. Lagace D.C. et al.Molecular adaptations underlying susceptibility and resistance to social defeat in brain reward regions.Cell. 2007; 131: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), such phosphorylation was not observed using our modified defeat protocol, possibly the result of an increased baseline level of phospho-ERK1/2 in NAc due to prior cocaine in these animals, as reported for cocaine previously (Valjent et al., 2000Valjent E. Corvol J.C. Pages C. Besson M.J. Maldonado R. Caboche J. Involvement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade for cocaine-rewarding properties.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, such differences in ERK1/2 phosphorylation may result from the submaximal defeat protocol used. We also observed induction of total levels of Ras in NAc of mice treated chronically with cocaine followed by repeated social defeat (Figure 6C). In contrast, total levels of other proteins in this cascade, including BDNF, TrkB, Raf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and CREB, were not altered. Also unaltered was Ras-GRF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates Ras (Figure 6C, inset). These results suggest that induction of Ras expression per se may be responsible for activating downstream components of this signaling pathway necessary for the cocaine enhancement of depressive-like behaviors (Figure 6C). Overexpression of G9a, which blocks cocaine-induced vulnerability to stress, significantly reduced cocaine- and stress-mediated increases in Ras expression in NAc, without affecting total protein levels of any of the other members of this pathway examined (Figure 6C and Figures S5A–S5H). NAc-specific overexpression of G9a did, however, significantly reduce the phosphorylation state of all downstream-signaling molecules, including phospho-Raf, phospho-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-CREB, indicating that transcriptional repression of Ras activity by G9a suppresses the activity of this entire signaling cascade. It is important to note that G9a overexpression had no effect on total levels or phosphorylation state of any of the proteins examined in this pathway under control conditions (i.e., HSV-G9a in cocaine- and stress-naive mice), suggesting that G9a acts in a stimulus-dependent manner to block BDNF-TrkB signaling. To further investigate the possibility that cocaine's induction of Ras contributes to increased stress vulnerability, we examined expression of H-Ras1, the Ras transcript most predominately expressed in adult brain, in NAc of animals receiving either saline, acute, or repeated cocaine, either immediately after cocaine exposure (1 hr) or 24 hr after the final drug dose. Although H-Ras1 mRNA expression was unaffected by a single dose of cocaine, it was significantly induced by repeated cocaine at 1 hr, an effect that persisted for 24 hr (Figure 6D). A substantial literature indicates functional differences between NAc and dorsal striatum in the development of stress- and drug-induced behaviors (Saka et al., 2004Saka E. Goodrich C. Harlan P.

Behavioral performance, however, relies on population activity, and the accuracy of a population code is constrained by correlated noise among neurons. We tested whether training changes interneuronal correlations in the dorsal medial superior temporal area, which is involved in multisensory heading perception. Pairs of single units were recorded simultaneously in two groups of subjects: animals trained extensively in a heading discrimination task, and “naive” animals that performed a passive fixation task. Correlated noise was significantly weaker in trained versus naive animals, which might be expected to improve coding efficiency. However, we show that the observed uniform reduction in noise correlations leads to little change in population coding efficiency when all neurons are decoded.

Extensive training can improve behavioral sensitivity (perceptual learning) Training alters the pattern of correlated noise among neurons in area MSTd Reductions in correlated noise are independent of signal correlations As a result, changes in correlated noise are unlikely to improve population coding Perceptual learning enhances sensory perception and leads to improved behavioral performance (Goldstone, 1998Goldstone R.L. Perceptual learning.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1998; 49: 585-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), but the neural basis of this phenomenon remains incompletely understood. One hypothesis is that responses of sensory neurons are altered by learning to increase the information that is encoded. In this case, one would expect to observe neural correlates of increased sensitivity in early sensory areas. However, previous studies have found little or no change in the tuning properties of single neurons in early visual cortex, and it remains unclear whether these changes could account for perceptual learning (Chowdhury and DeAngelis, 2008Chowdhury S.A.

Alternatively, perceptual learning may arise from changes in how sensory information is decoded and interpreted by higher brain areas (Dosher and Lu, 1999Dosher B.A. Lu Z.L.

Most neurophysiological studies of perceptual learning focused on the activity of individual neurons; however, behavior arises from population activity. By pooling information from many cells, the noise inherent in responses of single neurons could be reduced, thus improving coding efficiency. Theorists have shown that the information capacity of a population code depends on the correlated noise among neurons (Abbott and Dayan, 1999Abbott L.F. Dayan P.

In general, correlated noise could either decrease or increase the information transmitted by a population of neurons, depending on how correlated noise varies with the similarity of tuning between neurons (“signal correlations”; Averbeck et al., 2006Averbeck B.B.

Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), but how these correlations differ between untrained and trained animals has not, to our knowledge, been tested. To examine the effect of training on correlated noise, we simultaneously recorded pairs of single neurons in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd), a multisensory area thought to be involved in heading perception based on optic flow and vestibular signals (Angelaki et al., 2009Angelaki D.E. Gu Y. DeAngelis G.C. Multisensory integration: psychophysics, neurophysiology, and computation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Britten, 2008Britten K.H. Mechanisms of self-motion perception.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 389-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Correlated noise among pairs of neurons was examined in two groups of animals: one group (“naive”) was only trained to fixate; the other group (“trained”) also learned to perform a fine heading discrimination task. Noise correlations were significantly weaker in trained than naive animals, whereas tuning curves, response variability, and discrimination thresholds of individual neurons were similar. Importantly, training reduced noise correlations uniformly, regardless of tuning similarity between pairs of neurons. As a result, if all neurons contribute equally to perception, this change in correlated noise is unlikely to account for improvements in perceptual sensitivity with training. Monkeys were presented with two types of heading stimuli while maintaining fixation on a head-fixed target: inertial motion delivered by a motion platform in the absence of optic flow (vestibular condition) and optic flow stimuli presented while the animal was stationary (visual condition, see Experimental Procedures for details). Consistent with previous findings (Gu et al., 2006Gu Y. Watkins P.V. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. Visual and nonvisual contributions to three-dimensional heading selectivity in the medial superior temporal area.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Gu Y. May P.J. Newlands S.D. DeAngelis G.C. Angelaki D.E.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9742-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), many MSTd neurons were tuned to heading direction, and their responses mainly followed the Gaussian velocity profile of the stimulus (Figure 1A ). We analyzed responses obtained during the middle 1 s of the stimulus period, during which neuronal activity was robust. Tuning curves of two simultaneously recorded cells are shown in Figures 1B and 1C. The similarity of heading tuning between pairs of neurons was quantified as the Pearson correlation coefficient of mean responses across all stimulus directions (“signal correlation”, rsignal). For this example pair of neurons, rsignal = 0.83 and 0.79 for the visual and vestibular conditions, respectively. As in other cortical areas, the spike counts of MSTd neurons in response to an identical stimulus vary from trial to trial, as illustrated in Figure 1D (visual condition) and Figure 1E (vestibular condition). Each datum in these plots represents the spike counts of the two neurons from a single trial. Because heading direction varied across trials, spike counts from individual trials have been z-scored to remove the stimulus effect and allow pooling of data across directions (see Experimental Procedures). “Noise correlation” is then computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient of the normalized trial-by-trial spike counts, and reflects the degree of correlated variability across trials. For this example pair of cells, there was a weak positive correlation, such that when one neuron fired more spikes, the other neuron did as well (visual condition: rnoise = 0.29, p = 0.04, Figure 1D; vestibular condition: R = 0.14, p = 0.3, Figure 1E). We first examined whether correlated noise in MSTd depends on stimulus modality (Figure 1F). Noise correlations computed from visual and vestibular responses were significantly correlated across 179 pairs of neurons (R = 0.38, p << 0.001, Spearman rank correlation), and their means were not significantly different (vestibular: 0.035 ± 0.014 SEM, visual: 0.039 ± 0.015, p > 0.8, paired t test). Thus, to gain statistical power, we recomputed rnoise by pooling z-scored responses across stimulus conditions, thereby obtaining a single value of rnoise for each pair of neurons. As observed in other visual areas (Huang and Lisberger, 2009Huang X. Lisberger S.G. Noise correlations in cortical area MT and their potential impact on trial-by-trial variation in the direction and speed of smooth-pursuit eye movements.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 3012-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Smith and Kohn, 2008Smith M.A. Kohn A. Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12591-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), noise correlations depended on the distance between two simultaneously recorded MSTd neurons, as illustrated in Figure S1, which shows distributions of rnoise for three distance groups: <0.05 mm, 0.05–1 mm, and >1 mm. Average noise correlations were significantly greater than zero for the first two groups (<0.05 mm: 0.042 ± 0.021 SEM, p = 0.049, t test; 0.05–1 mm: 0.062 ± 0.024, p = 0.011), but not for the group of distant pairs (>1 mm: 0 ± 0.15, p = 0.9). Thus, the following analyses were focused on 127 neuronal pairs separated by <1 mm (results were similar for the whole data set). Our main goal was to examine whether training modifies interneuronal correlations. Five animals were previously trained to perform a heading discrimination task, in which they reported whether their heading was leftward or rightward relative to straight ahead (Gu et al., 2007Gu Y.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These monkeys' heading discrimination thresholds (corresponding to 84% correct) were high (>10°) at early stages of training, and gradually decreased to a plateau of only a few degrees (1∼3°), as illustrated in Figure 2A (Fetsch et al., 2009Fetsch C.R.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 15601-15612Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Gu et al., 2007Gu Y. DeAngelis G.C. Angelaki D.E.

Angelaki D.E. Deangelis G.C. Neural correlates of multisensory cue integration in macaque MSTd.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We measured noise correlations after these “trained” animals had reached asymptotic performance, and we compared them with correlations measured in three “naive” animals that had never been trained to perform any task other than visual fixation. Our most conspicuous finding was a difference in mean rnoise between trained and naive animals (Figure 2B). Correlations in trained animals were shifted toward zero, as compared with those in naive animals. The mean noise correlation in the trained group (0.023 ± 0.017 SEM, n = 89) was significantly smaller than that for naive animals (0.116 ± 0.031, n = 38, p = 0.006, t test). Note that, for both groups of animals, rnoise was measured during an identical passive fixation task (see Experimental Procedures). Because the stimulus was dynamic (Figure 1A, gray curve), we examined the time course of noise correlation in trained and naive animals by computing rnoise in 500 ms sliding windows (with 50 ms steps). As illustrated in Figure 2C, rnoise was significantly greater in naive than trained animals throughout the time course of the neural response (p = 0.002, permutation test, see Experimental Procedures). The difference in rnoise between naive and trained animals was largest at the beginning of the trial and gradually decreased with time (R = −0.9, p < < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation, Figure S2A). Importantly, these observations held true when correlations were examined for individual animals (Figure S2B). Thus, the overall reduction in correlated noise among MSTd neurons was a robust finding in trained animals. It is possible that the difference in correlated noise between naive and trained animals could be an indirect effect of training on the response properties of individual neurons. Moreover, training-related changes in correlated noise might emerge in parallel with changes in the heading sensitivity of single neurons. To address these issues, we examined the effect of training on the time courses of firing rates and response variability. As illustrated in Figures 3A and 3C , the time course of the population-average response to the preferred heading was indistinguishable between trained and naive animals (p = 0.8, permutation test, see Experimental Procedures). There was also no significant effect (p = 0.5, permutation test) of training on the time course of the Fano factor, which measures the ratio of response variance to mean response (Figures 3B and 3D, see also Experimental Procedures and Figure S3). This finding contrasts with a previous report that Fano factor in area V4 was significantly reduced after animals were trained to discriminate orientation (Raiguel et al., 2006Raiguel S. Vogels R. Mysore S.G. Orban G.A. Learning to see the difference specifically alters the most informative V4 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6589-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In MSTd, the difference in noise correlation between naive and trained animals does not appear to be linked to changes in firing rates or Fano factors. We further explored whether training shaped the tuning properties of individual MSTd neurons. For this analysis, we only included neurons with significant heading tuning in the horizontal plane (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). To gain statistical power, we exploited a much larger database of single-unit responses from naive and trained animals, recorded with a single electrode (vestibular: n = 556; visual: n = 992). As shown in Figures 4A and 4E , distributions of tuning width (full width at half-height) were very similar for naive and trained animals. There was no significant difference in median tuning width for the visual condition (naive: 124.5° versus trained: 126°, p = 0.21, Wilcoxon rank- sum test). The difference in median tuning width was significant for the vestibular condition (naive: 121° versus trained: 131°, p = 0.045). However, this effect was weak and, notably, training slightly increased tuning width in the vestibular condition, an effect opposite to that expected if training increases discriminability (e.g., Yang and Maunsell, 2004Yang T. Maunsell J.H. The effect of perceptual learning on neuronal responses in monkey visual area V4.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Similarly, as shown in Figures 4B and 4F, training did not have any significant effect on the distribution of tuning curve amplitudes in either the visual condition (naive: 35.4 spks/s versus trained: 31.8 spks/s, p = 0.24, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) or the vestibular condition (naive: 17.4 spks/s versus trained: 17.2 spks/s, p = 0.36). Thus, training animals to perform a fine heading discrimination task did not significantly shape the heading tuning of individual MSTd neurons. However, it remains possible that training only shaped the tuning of a subset of neurons that were most informative for heading discrimination around the straight-forward reference used in training (e.g., Raiguel et al., 2006Raiguel S. Vogels R. Mysore S.G. Orban G.A. Learning to see the difference specifically alters the most informative V4 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6589-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Schoups et al., 2001Schoups A. Vogels R. Qian N. Orban G. Practising orientation identification improves orientation coding in V1 neurons.Nature. 2001; 412: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). If so, then effects might only be seen for neurons most sensitive to heading variations around straight forward, and may have been missed in the above analysis. To examine this further, we interpolated tuning curves and used Fisher information analysis (Gu et al., 2010Gu Y. Fetsch C.R. Adeyemo B. Deangelis G.C. Angelaki D.E. Decoding of MSTd population activity accounts for variations in the precision of heading perception.Neuron. 2010; 66: 596-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, see Experimental Procedures) to compute the sensitivity of each neuron for discriminating heading around straight forward. As shown in Figures 4C and 4G, the most sensitive neurons (lowest thresholds) are generally those that prefer lateral headings, such that their tuning curves have a steep slope around straight-ahead. For quantitative analysis, neurons were divided into two groups by heading preference: “fore-aft” neurons with heading preferences within 45° of forward (0°) or backward (±180°) motion, and “lateral” neurons with heading preferences within 45° of leftward (−90°) or rightward (90°) movements. Consistent with previous findings (Gu et al., 2008aGu Y. Angelaki D.E. Deangelis G.C. Neural correlates of multisensory cue integration in macaque MSTd.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, Gu et al., 2010Gu Y. Fetsch C.R. Adeyemo B. Deangelis G.C. Angelaki D.E. Decoding of MSTd population activity accounts for variations in the precision of heading perception.Neuron. 2010; 66: 596-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), lateral neurons were significantly more sensitive than fore-aft neurons for heading discrimination around straight ahead (p << 0.001, Factorial ANOVA, Figures 4D and 4H). However, neuronal sensitivity was not significantly different between naive and trained animals (p > 0.5, factorial ANOVA) for either group of neurons, with no significant interaction effect (p > 0.3). In summary, whereas heading discrimination training clearly reduced correlated noise among MSTd neurons, we find no clear evidence that training altered the basic tuning properties or sensitivity of individual neurons, including those neurons that are most informative for performing the task. This result also generalizes to neuronal discrimination of heading about any arbitrary reference (Figure S4). It is well established that rnoise is related to rsignal (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H. Attention improves performance primarily by reducing interneuronal correlations.Nat.

Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), so it is important to evaluate whether training alters this relationship. Figures 5A and 5B show the relationship between rnoise and rsignal, with each datum corresponding to a pair of MSTd neurons. This relationship was quantified using general linear models (analysis of covariance, ANCOVA), with rsignal in each stimulus condition (visual or vestibular) as a continuous variable and training group (trained or naive) as a categorical factor. There was a significant positive correlation between rnoise and rsignal in both stimulus conditions (vestibular: p = 0.0001; visual: p = 0.0004, ANCOVA), reflecting the fact that noise correlations tended to be positive for pairs of neurons with similar tuning (rsignal > 0) and near zero or negative for pairs with opposite tuning (rsignal < 0). Importantly, the slope of the relationship between rnoise and rsignal (Figures 5A and 5B) was not significantly affected by training (vestibular: p = 0.9; visual: p = 0.9, ANCOVA interaction effect), as also indicated by overlap of the 95% confidence intervals around the regression slopes (Figure 5C, nearly identical slopes were obtained by Type II regression). In contrast, training had a significant main effect on rnoise (vestibular: p = 0.02; visual; p = 0.008 ANCOVA), and the 95% confidence intervals around the regression intercepts were non-overlapping for naive and trained animals (Figure 5D). Thus, training reduced noise correlations uniformly across all signal correlations, such that the dependency of rnoise on rsignal remained unchanged. Multisensory MSTd neurons can have matched visual and vestibular heading preferences (“congruent” cells) or mismatched preferences (“opposite” cells) (Gu et al., 2006Gu Y. Watkins P.V. Angelaki D"
https://openalex.org/W2005669816,"Many of the plastid-localized metabolic pathways of plants, including the C4 photosynthetic pathway that operates in many crop plants, depend critically on the import of pyruvate. The pyruvate transporter has proved elusive, but has now been identified as the bile acid:sodium symporter family protein 2 (BASS2). The BASS2 protein is found in the chloroplast envelope membrane, and is highly abundant in C4 plants. Orthologues of BASS2 are present in all the genomes of land plants characterized so far, thus indicating the widespread importance of sodium-coupled pyruvate import in plastids. Pyruvate serves as a metabolic precursor for many plastid-localized biosynthetic pathways, such as those for fatty acids1, terpenoids2 and branched-chain amino acids3. In spite of the importance of pyruvate uptake into plastids (organelles within cells of plants and algae), the molecular mechanisms of this uptake have not yet been explored. This is mainly because pyruvate is a relatively small compound that is able to passively permeate lipid bilayers4, which precludes accurate measurement of pyruvate transport activity in reconstituted liposomes. Using differential transcriptome analyses of C3 and C4 plants of the genera Flaveria and Cleome, here we have identified a novel gene that is abundant in C4 species, named BASS2 (BILE ACID:SODIUM SYMPORTER FAMILY PROTEIN 2). The BASS2 protein is localized at the chloroplast envelope membrane, and is highly abundant in C4 plants that have the sodium-dependent pyruvate transporter. Recombinant BASS2 shows sodium-dependent pyruvate uptake activity. Sodium influx is balanced by a sodium:proton antiporter (NHD1), which was mimicked in recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing both BASS2 and NHD1. Arabidopsis thaliana bass2 mutants lack pyruvate uptake into chloroplasts, which affects plastid-localized isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis, as evidenced by increased sensitivity of such mutants to mevastatin, an inhibitor of cytosolic isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis. We thus provide molecular evidence for a sodium-coupled metabolite transporter in plastid envelopes. Orthologues of BASS2 can be detected in all the genomes of land plants that have been characterized so far, thus indicating the widespread importance of sodium-coupled pyruvate import into plastids."
https://openalex.org/W2105659895,"The primary graft-related complication during the first clinical trial evaluating the use of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) was stenosis. We investigated the role of macrophages in the formation of TEVG stenosis in a murine model. We analyzed the natural history of TEVG macrophage infiltration at critical time points and evaluated the role of cell seeding on neovessel formation. To assess the function of infiltrating macrophages, we implanted TEVGs into mice that had been macrophage depleted using clodronate liposomes. To confirm this, we used a CD11b-diphtheria toxin-receptor (DTR) transgenic mouse model. Monocytes infiltrated the scaffold within the first few days and initially transformed into M1 macrophages. As the scaffold degraded, the macrophage infiltrate disappeared. Cell seeding decreased the incidence of stenosis (32% seeded, 64% unseeded, P= 0.024) and the degree of macrophage infiltration at 2 wk. Unseeded TEVGs demonstrated conversion from M1 to M2 phenotype, whereas seeded grafts did not. Clodronate and DTR inhibited macrophage infiltration and decreased stenosis but blocked formation of vascular neotissue, evidenced by the absence of endothelial and smooth muscle cells and collagen. These findings suggest that macrophage infiltration is critical for neovessel formation and provides a strategy for predicting, detecting, and inhibiting stenosis in TEVGs.—Hibino, N., Yi, T., Duncan, D.

Here, we investigate the formation of synapses between hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurons and their target CA3 neurons and find that DG neurons preferentially form synapses with CA3 rather than DG or CA1 neurons in culture, suggesting that specific interactions between DG and CA3 neurons drive synapse formation. Cadherin-9 is expressed selectively in DG and CA3 neurons, and downregulation of cadherin-9 in CA3 neurons leads to a selective decrease in the number and size of DG synapses onto CA3 neurons. In addition, loss of cadherin-9 from DG or CA3 neurons in vivo leads to striking defects in the formation and differentiation of the DG-CA3 mossy fiber synapse.

Synaptic specificity occurs in dissociated hippocampal cultures Cadherin-9 specifically regulates DG-CA3 synapse formation in vitro Cadherin-9 regulates mossy fiber synapses via bidirectional signaling in vivo During the development of neural circuits, axons navigate complex cellular environments to form synapses with specific cell types and at specific subcellular locations. Consequently, a neuron that receives synaptic input from multiple presynaptic sources will often develop distinct types of synapses unique to each input. Although progress has been made in understanding general mechanisms of axon guidance and synaptogenesis, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation and differentiation of specific classes of synapses in the mammalian central nervous system are poorly understood. The hippocampus is an excellent model for studying the development of specific classes of synapses because the pattern of connectivity between different cell types is well characterized, and different classes of synapses are structurally distinct (Figures 1A–1D ). This is most strikingly exemplified by mossy fiber synapses that connect dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 neurons. The mossy fiber presynaptic terminal consists of a large and complex presynaptic bouton that grows 50–100 times larger in volume than a typical asymmetric synapse and can contain over 30 separate vesicle release sites (Chicurel and Harris, 1992Chicurel M.E.

Structural determinants of transmission at large hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10434-10444Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The postsynaptic structure on the CA3 dendrite consists of an equally elaborate multiheaded spine known as a thorny excrescence (TE) (Figure 1D) (Amaral and Dent, 1981Amaral D.G. Dent J.A. Development of the mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus: I. A light and electron microscopic study of the mossy fibers and their expansions.J. Comp. Neurol. 1981; 195: 51-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Because of its enormous size and position near the soma of CA3 neurons, activation of a single mossy fiber synapse can cause the CA3 neuron to fire and, therefore, has been called a “detonator” synapse (McNaughton and Morris, 1987McNaughton B.L. Morris R.G.M. Hippocampal synaptic enhancement and information storage within a distributed memory system.Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 408-415Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Farther from the soma, CA3 neurons also receive synaptic input from other CA3 neurons and the entorhinal cortex onto typical asymmetric synapses (Figures 1B and 1C). The molecular mechanisms that drive initial formation and maturation of these unique hippocampal mossy fiber synapses remain unknown and are likely to be distinct from those signals that govern typical asymmetric synapse formation. Evidence in support for a role of molecular interactions in regulating the differentiation of specific classes of synapses comes largely from genetic studies in invertebrates (Ackley and Jin, 2004Ackley B.D.

For example, in C. elegans the adhesion molecules SYG-1 and SYG-2 are required for the correct localization of a particular synapse, but not for axon growth or synaptogenesis (Shen and Bargmann, 2003Shen K.

Our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate synapse-specific differentiation in mammalian systems has lagged behind other systems partly because it is difficult to assess the complete connectivity of individual neurons in the brain. Cultured neurons are an invaluable tool for investigating general aspects of synapse form and function, but it is often assumed that specificity is lost in dissociated culture. Here, we show that, contrary to expectation, several aspects of synaptic specificity are well preserved in dissociated hippocampal cultures. Using cell- and synapse-specific markers, we developed two in vitro assays and discovered that DG neurons preferentially make synapses with appropriate CA3 target neurons rather than DG or CA1 neurons in culture. We then used the culture system to identify cell adhesion molecules that selectively regulate the formation of one type of synapse over another. Through these experiments we identified cadherin-9 as a critical mediator of DG-CA3 synapse formation. Cadherins are single-pass transmembrane molecules that mediate cell-cell interactions, and their differential expression in the brain has led to the speculation that they regulate the formation of specific synaptic connections, but this has never been tested. We found that cadherin-9, a classic type II cadherin expressed exclusively by DG and CA3 neurons in the hippocampus (Bekirov et al., 2002Bekirov I.H. Needleman L.A. Zhang W. Benson D.L. Identification and localization of multiple classic cadherins in developing rat limbic system.Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), is required specifically for formation of DG but not CA1 or CA3 synapses in culture. In vivo, loss of cadherin-9 from either DG or CA3 neurons severely disrupts mossy fiber bouton and TE spine formation through trans-synaptic interactions. Furthermore, cadherin-9 has a specific role at the mossy fiber synapse because it is not required for typical spine formation on DG and CA1 dendrites. Taken together, these experiments indicate that cadherin-9 regulates the formation and differentiation of DG-CA3 synapses and provide direct evidence that differentially expressed cadherins regulate the formation of specific neural circuits. DG neurons synapse onto CA3 pyramidal neurons while avoiding synaptic contact with nearby CA1 pyramidal neurons and other DG neurons. Because primary cultures offer several advantages for molecular perturbation and analysis, we developed two in vitro culture assays to investigate synapse-specific development. We first determined whether the ability of DG neurons to selectively innervate CA3 neurons is preserved in vitro using the “microisland assay.” In this assay, hippocampal neurons from neonatal rats were dissociated and plated to glial microislands on glass coverslips so that each island had approximately 10–30 neurons (Segal and Furshpan, 1990Segal M.M. Furshpan E.J. Epileptiform activity in microcultures containing small numbers of hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 64: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A ). Cultures were transfected with synaptophysin-GFP to visualize synaptic terminals of transfected cells. For analysis only islands containing one transfected DG neuron were selected so that every synaptophysin-GFP punctum could be uniquely associated with the transfected neuron (Figure 2A). To determine whether DG neurons recognize correct targets in microcultures, we used antibodies to identify hippocampal cell types in culture. Anti-Prox1 specifically labels DG neurons (Bagri et al., 2002Bagri A. Gurney T. He X. Zou Y.R. Littman D.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Pleasure S.J. The chemokine SDF1 regulates migration of dentate granule cells.Development. 2002; 129: 4249-4260PubMed Google Scholar), anti-PY labels CA3 pyramidal neurons and some interneurons (Woodhams et al., 1989Woodhams P.L. Webb M. Atkinson D.J. Seeley P.J. A monoclonal antibody, Py, distinguishes different classes of hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2170-2181PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-CTIP2 labels CA1 pyramidal neurons and most DG neurons (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). These antibodies, when used in combination, uniquely identify each principal cell type in the hippocampus (Figures 2B and 2C; see Figure S1 available online), and every island analyzed included both correct and incorrect targets so that DG neurons always had a target choice. An island with one transfected DG neuron and several surrounding untransfected neurons is shown in Figure 2D. Synaptophysin-GFP puncta are represented in yellow and were expanded for visibility at this magnification. An example of each cell type is shown at higher magnification with the anti-GFP signal (Figure 2E). Although positioned nearby on the island, many more synaptophysin-GFP puncta are found on the dendrites of the CA3 neuron compared to the DG or CA1 neuron (Figure 2E). To quantify this, the total number of synaptophysin-GFP puncta on every neuron from 21 islands was counted, normalized to dendrite length, and sorted by cell type. Analysis of the data indicates that DG neurons form significantly more synapses with CA3 neurons than with DG or CA1 neurons (Figure 2F). Furthermore, we calculated the expected number of synapses if all cells were innervated equally and represented this average by the dotted line in Figure 2F. Because CA3 neurons are innervated significantly above this value, it suggests that there is a signal that promotes DG synapse formation onto these cells. Conversely, CA1 neurons were innervated significantly below this average value, suggesting the potential presence of a negative cue that inhibits synapse formation by DG neurons. DG neurons formed synapses with other DG neurons near the frequency expected by chance (Figure 2F). To determine if the synaptic bias of DG neurons for CA3 dendrites measured by synaptophysin-GFP reflects a bias in functional connectivity, we analyzed synaptic responses of neurons in microcultures by whole-cell recordings. For these experiments, pairs of neurons on an island were recorded simultaneously and tested for synaptic connectivity. One neuron was held in current clamp and stimulated to produce action potentials, whereas evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded from the second neuron held in voltage clamp. Paired recording was followed by immunofluorescence-based identification of cell type. Recovering cells for immunofluorescence after paired recording has a high failure rate because it requires the integrity of the cell to be maintained when the patch electrodes are withdrawn. Therefore, only those pairs where the identity of both neurons could be unambiguously determined post hoc were used for analysis. Analysis of paired recordings in which a DG neuron was the presynaptic neuron showed that the evoked response varied depending on the postsynaptic cell (Figures 2G and 2H). Whereas DG-DG and DG-CA1 pairs produced weak synaptic responses, DG-CA3 recordings elicited strong evoked responses (Figures 2G and 2H). This suggests that DG neurons make more numerous or stronger synapses onto CA3 neurons than onto other cell types and indicates that DG neurons also develop a functional synaptic bias for CA3 neurons in culture. This selection of correct targets is particularly impressive because, on average, microcultures contain fewer CA3 than DG or CA1 neurons (Figure 2I). These results on synapse function closely correlate with the analysis of synaptophysin-GFP puncta and demonstrate that DG neurons preferentially connect with appropriate targets using only cues present in microcultures. We found that DG neurons synapse primarily with correct targets by 12 days in vitro (DIV), but from our previous experiments we cannot determine whether this specificity arises from a mechanism of biased axon outgrowth or biased synaptogenesis. For example, specificity between DG and CA3 neurons could arise via selective axon growth toward CA3 neurons followed by nonselective synapse formation. Alternatively, DG axons may contact all cell types equally but selectively form synapses with CA3 neurons. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed DG axon growth using time-lapse imaging in the microisland assay. Islands containing one neuron transfected with GFP were imaged using phase contrast and fluorescence every 24 hr from 5 to 12 DIV and then immunostained to determine the cell type of every neuron on the island (Figure 3A ). As shown in the example, cultured DG neurons often develop appropriate morphology with dendrites projecting from one side of the soma and an axon projecting in the opposite direction. There is growth and remodeling of the axon arbor between 5 and 9 DIV, during which several branches are eliminated and others added. From 9 to 12 DIV, the arbor morphology is relatively stable, although there is addition and retraction of minor branches. On this large island the DG axon only grows on half the island, but it contacts dendrites of all neurons on that half of the island regardless of cell type (Figure 3A). For quantification we immunostained similar GFP-transfected islands and analyzed the area of the transfected DG axon that overlapped dendrites of each cell at 12 DIV when synaptic preference is established (Figures 3B and 3C). We also quantified the percentage of each cell type that had contact with the DG axon (Figure 3D). The data indicate that DG axons do not grow preferentially to CA3 neurons but contact all cell types at comparable levels (Figures 3C and 3D). Therefore, DG synapse formation is biased for CA3 neurons in culture, but not through directed axon guidance. Instead, our data suggest that molecular cues on specific cell types actively promote DG synapses with CA3 neurons and prevent DG synapses with CA1 neurons independent of axon guidance mechanisms. We next investigated two additional questions about the mechanisms regulating synaptic specificity in culture. First, are CA3 neurons simply more synaptogenic than other neurons in culture? Second, does the development of synaptic specificity require elimination of synapses from incorrect targets? To address these questions, we developed a second in vitro assay called the “synaptoporin assay” (Figure 4A ). In this assay we use cell and synapse-specific markers to uniquely identify subtypes of synapses made onto an identified postsynaptic target cell grown in standard low-density mass hippocampal cultures. To establish the synaptoporin (SPO) assay, we determined that DG mossy fiber synapses are identified by coexpression of the presynaptic markers VGlut1 and SPO (synaptophysin II). VGlut1 is expressed at all excitatory, glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and, therefore, labels presynaptic sites originating from DG, CA3, and CA1 neurons (Bellocchio et al., 1998Bellocchio E.E. Hu H. Pohorille A. Chan J. Pickel V.M. Edwards R.H. The localization of the brain-specific inorganic phosphate transporter suggests a specific presynaptic role in glutamatergic transmission.J.

Immunohistochemical localization of candidates for vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 444: 39-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In contrast, SPO has more restricted expression. Although SPO is expressed in a subset of GABAergic synapses, the only excitatory synapses in the hippocampus that express SPO are DG mossy fiber synapses (Figure S2) (Grabs et al., 1994Grabs D. Bergmann M. Schuster T. Fox P.A. Brich M. Gratz M. Differential expression of synaptophysin and synaptoporin during pre- and postnatal development of the rat hippocampal network.Eur. J.

Synaptic vesicle protein synaptoporin is differently expressed by subpopulations of mouse hippocampal neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We confirmed the specificity of these presynaptic markers in sections of postnatal rat brain and in hippocampal cultures by immunostaining individual neurons transfected with synaptophysin-GFP (Figure S2). When a DG neuron expresses synaptophysin-GFP, synapses marked by synaptophysin-GFP express VGlut1 and SPO (Figures S2B and S2C). In contrast when CA3 or CA1 neurons express synaptophysin-GFP, synapses marked by synaptophysin-GFP express VGlut1, but not SPO (Figures S2B and S2C). These results indicate that DG synapses express both VGlut1 and SPO, whereas CA synapses from both CA1 and CA3 neurons express only VGlut1. Therefore, coimmunostaining with antibodies against SPO, VGlut1, and cell type markers allows examination of the development of different kinds of synapses onto different types of hippocampal neurons (Figure 4A). We carried out the SPO assay on neurons grown for 8, 12, and 15 DIV, by immunostaining cultures with antibodies against SPO and VGlut1 to identify different types of synapses. In addition to these synaptic markers, neurons were immunostained for CAMKII to label the dendrites of excitatory neurons and CTIP2 and Prox1 to identify cell types (Figures 4A–4C). We counted the total number of excitatory synapses, DG synapses, and CA synapses formed onto different neuron types over time. At all time points, dendrites of CA1 and CA3 neurons developed very similar numbers of excitatory synapses. This indicates that neither cell type has any more synaptogenic potential than the other (Figure 4D). However, CA3 neurons developed significantly more DG synapses (up to 2.4 times greater) than CA1 neurons at all time points (Figure 4E). During our analyses we noticed that, like mossy fiber terminals in vivo, SPO-positive synapses were often much larger than typical excitatory presynaptic sites. Therefore, we determined whether these extra-large excitatory presynaptic terminals were also preferentially located on CA3 neurons. Indeed, when we limited our analysis to synapses greater than 1.0 μm2, we discovered that CA3 neurons have up to 4.4 times more extra-large DG synapses than CA1 neurons (Figure 4F), and the average size of a DG synapse is greater on CA3 neurons (Figure 4G). We also observed that CA1 neurons developed significantly more CA synapses than CA3 neurons, which indicates that specificity may not be limited to DG synapses but that other types of synapses also undergo selective formation in culture (Figure 4H). Together, these experiments support the conclusion that mechanisms driving specific synapse formation in culture function without spatial cues present in the brain. Because we observe a strong synaptic bias as early as 8 DIV, it suggests that this specificity is largely driven by selective synapse formation onto correct targets, and not by elimination of synapses from incorrect targets. To identify molecules that might regulate the formation of DG-CA3 synapses, we analyzed expression patterns of genes that encode transmembrane proteins with extracellular domains that could mediate cell-cell interactions. The initial analysis was based on gene expression data published in the Allen Brain Atlas (http://www.brain-map.org/) and led to identification of the cadherin gene family as potential mediators of connectivity. There are about 20 classic cadherin genes thought to mediate cell-cell interactions, although the specific function of most cadherins is unknown. Several cadherins are expressed in the hippocampus, but only one, cadherin-9, is strongly and specifically expressed in DG and CA3 regions (Figure 5A ) (Bekirov et al., 2002Bekirov I.H. Needleman L.A. Zhang W. Benson D.L. Identification and localization of multiple classic cadherins in developing rat limbic system.Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that cadherin-9 interactions between DG axons and CA3 dendrites may be important for regulating mossy fiber synapse development but not other types of synapses in the hippocampus. Cadherin-9 is a relatively uncharacterized gene predicted to encode a classic type II cadherin, and therefore, cadherin-9 may signal via homophilic binding. To test this, we cloned the predicted full-length cadherin-9 cDNA from postnatal day 7 (P7) mouse hippocampal mRNA and generated an Fc fusion of the extracellular domain of cadherin-9. We found that cadherin-9-Fc but not control Fc binds the surface of 293T cells expressing cadherin-9 in a calcium-dependent manner indicating that, like other classic cadherins, cadherin-9 undergoes homophilic binding (Figures 5B and 5C) (Shimoyama et al., 2000Shimoyama Y. Tsujimoto G. Kitajima M. Natori M. Identification of three human type-II classic cadherins and frequent heterophilic interactions between different subclasses of type-II classic cadherins.Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One consequence of cadherin binding is recruitment and activation of β-catenin (Arikkath and Reichardt, 2008Arikkath J.

Radice G.L. Vasioukhin V. Adhesive and signaling functions of cadherins and catenins in vertebrate development.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a002949Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine if cadherin-9-mediated adhesion recruits β-catenin, we expressed cadherin-9 in 293T cells and found that β-catenin is recruited to the interface between cadherin-9 cells (Figure 5D). Additionally, epitope-tagged cadherin-9 colocalizes with β-catenin in neurons (Figure 5E). These results suggest that cadherin-9 is capable of intracellular signaling via catenin proteins. We next analyzed the location of cadherin-9 protein in neurons. Consistent with in situ hybridization results showing that cadherin-9 is expressed selectively by DG and CA3 neurons, we found that endogenous cadherin-9 protein is found in puncta along axons and dendrites in a subset of cultured hippocampal neurons (Figures 5F and 5G). Cadherin-9 puncta do not directly overlap with synaptic vesicles or the postsynaptic density but are frequently found adjacent to synaptic active zones (Figure 5H), similar to what has been observed for other cadherins (Fannon and Colman, 1996Fannon A.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Antibody incompatibility prevented us from determining precisely which cell types are cadherin-9 positive in culture and from analyzing endogenous cadherin-9 protein in vivo. However, we were able to examine the location of epitope-tagged cadherin-9 in DG neurons in the brain. DG neurons of P5 rats were infected with a lentivirus expressing cadherin-9 and GFP using a 2A peptide to drive expression of both genes from a single promoter (Figure S3A). Because the 2A peptide remains attached to cadherin-9, it was used as an epitope tag to visualize cadherin-9 with anti-2A antibodies. We found that at P14 cadherin-9-2A localizes to dendrites and axons of DG neurons (Figures S3B–S3E). Although cadherin-9-2A was found diffusely throughout the dendrites, it localized to discrete bands at mossy fiber terminals adjacent to but not overlapping presynaptic vesicles marked by VGlut1 (Figures 5I and S3B–S3E), consistent with a role as a synaptic organizer. To examine the role of cadherin-9 in synapse formation, we generated a cadherin-9 shRNA that markedly reduces expression of a tagged cadherin-9 construct in 293T cells (Figure 6A ). The construct does not significantly affect expression of several other cadherins expressed in the hippocampus, including cadherin-2 (N-cadherin), cadherin-8, and cadherin-10, based on western blot and quantitative PCR analysis (Figures 6B and 6C, and S4). We also generated a codon-substituted cadherin-9 rescue construct insensitive to the cadherin-9 shRNA (Figures 6A and 6C). To determine whether knockdown of cadherin-9 selectively affects DG-CA3 synapse formation, we transfected hippocampal neurons with scrambled control or cadherin-9 shRNA, and examined the formation of DG and CA synapses onto different types of neurons using the SPO assay. Knockdown of cadherin-9 led to significant reductions in the total number of DG synapses and the number of extra-large DG synapses onto CA3 neurons but did not affect the number of CA synapses onto the same cells (Figures 6D–6G), indicating that cadherin-9 regulates a specific class of synapses. In addition, DG synapses that remained on knockdown CA3 neurons were significantly reduced in size compared to controls (Figure 6H), suggesting that cadherin-9 might also control the growth of DG-CA3 synapses. These defects were rescued by coexpression of shRNA-insensitive cadherin-9, which indicates that the observed effects are due to specific loss of cadherin-9 (Figures 6D–6H).

Immunoassays for total and oligomeric forms of both normal and phosphorylated (at Ser-129) α-syn have been used to assay plasma samples from a longitudinal cohort of 32 patients with PD (sampled at mo 0, 1, 2, 3), as well as single plasma samples from a group of 30 healthy control participants. The levels of α-syn in plasma varied greatly between individuals, but were remarkably consistent over time within the same individual with PD. The mean level of phospho-α-syn was found to be higher (P=0.053) in the PD samples than the controls, whereas this was not the case for total α-syn (P=0.244), oligo-α-syn (P=0.221), or oligo-phospho-α-syn (P=0.181). Immunoblots of plasma revealed bands (at 21, 24, and 50-60 kDa) corresponding to phosphorylated α-syn. Thus, phosphorylated α-syn can be detected in blood plasma and shows more promise as a diagnostic marker than the nonphosphorylated protein. Longitudinal studies undertaken over a more extended time period will be required to determine whether α-syn can act as a marker of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1966236299,"Tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum are chaperoned by cytosolic targeting factors that deliver them to a membrane receptor for insertion. Although a basic framework for TA protein recognition is now emerging, the decisive targeting and membrane insertion steps are not understood. Here we reconstitute the TA protein insertion cycle with purified components, present crystal structures of key complexes between these components and perform mutational analyses based on the structures. We show that a committed targeting complex, formed by a TA protein bound to the chaperone ATPase Get3, is initially recruited to the membrane through an interaction with Get2. Once the targeting complex has been recruited, Get1 interacts with Get3 to drive TA protein release in an ATPase-dependent reaction. After releasing its TA protein cargo, the now-vacant Get3 recycles back to the cytosol concomitant with ATP binding. This work provides a detailed structural and mechanistic framework for the minimal TA protein insertion cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2018120701,"Neural circuits consist of highly precise connections among specific types of neurons that serve a common functional goal. How neurons distinguish among different synaptic targets to form functionally precise circuits remains largely unknown. Here, we show that during development, the adhesion molecule cadherin-6 (Cdh6) is expressed by a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and also by their targets in the brain. All of the Cdh6-expressing retinorecipient nuclei mediate non-image-forming visual functions. A screen of mice expressing GFP in specific subsets of RGCs revealed that Cdh3-RGCs which also express Cdh6 selectively innervate Cdh6-expressing retinorecipient targets. Moreover, in Cdh6-deficient mice, the axons of Cdh3-RGCs fail to properly innervate their targets and instead project to other visual nuclei. These findings provide functional evidence that classical cadherins promote mammalian CNS circuit development by ensuring that axons of specific cell types connect to their appropriate synaptic targets."

Early-generated GABA neurons display a hub network function Stimulation of a single early-generated GABA neuron alters network synchrony in the developing hippocampus Early-generated GABA neurons acquire characteristics of GABA projection neurons One approach to unraveling the complexity of neuronal circuits is to understand how their connectivity emerges during brain maturation. Neuronal connectivity is very often reflected in the activity dynamics that a given network of neurons can produce. Interestingly, most developing neuronal networks spontaneously produce a variety of correlated activity dynamics that are thought to be essential for proper circuit maturation (Ben-Ari, 2001Ben-Ari Y. Developing networks play a similar melody.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 353-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Blankenship and Feller, 2010Blankenship A.G. Feller M.B. Mechanisms underlying spontaneous patterned activity in developing neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). At early postnatal stages, the hippocampus displays spontaneous, synapse-driven network synchronizations in the form of giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) (Ben-Ari et al., 1989Ben-Ari Y.

We have recently shown that, during this developmental period, the CA3 region displayed a “scale-free” functional topology (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) characterized by the presence of rare, superconnected hub neurons. Hub neurons are characterized by the following features (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar): (1) they possess high output functional connectivity; (2) their stimulation significantly affects network dynamics (whereas stimulating other neurons does not); (3) they are GABA neurons with a widespread axonal arborization crossing subfield boundaries; and (4) they receive more excitatory postsynaptic potentials and have a lower threshold for action potential generation than other interneurons. Thus, the study (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) confirmed the leading role of GABA neurons in shaping network oscillations (Ellender et al., 2010Ellender T.J.

Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), that emerges as soon as the first functional synapses start to develop. However, it is at present unknown whether hub neurons are only present transiently during development or if they persist into adulthood. If the latter, it is also unclear whether this population represents one or many morphophysiological subtypes of interneurons. Determining the subtypes of hub neurons is experimentally challenging for several reasons. First, hub neurons are a sparse cell population (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Second, cortical GABA neurons are characterized by a bewildering heterogeneity that results in several classification challenges. This complexity is further confounded during brain development by the fact that most GABA neurons have not yet developed the characteristics that enable investigators to identify and classify them in adulthood (Hennou et al., 2002Hennou S. Khalilov I. Diabira D. Ben-Ari Y. Gozlan H. Early sequential formation of functional GABA(A) and glutamatergic synapses on CA1 interneurons of the rat foetal hippocampus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To address the above issues, it is essential to permanently label hub neurons in a manner such that they can be examined both for their dynamics during GDPs, as well as in the adult. Based on the following arguments, we hypothesized that hub neurons could be early-generated interneurons (EGins) that pioneer hippocampal circuits. First, hub neurons were characterized by their advanced morphophysiological features compared to other developing GABA neurons (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Second, theoretical models predict that scale-free networks grow according to “preferential attachment rules,” meaning that early connected neurons would turn into hub cells (Barabasi and Albert, 1999Barabasi A.L. Albert R. Emergence of scaling in random networks.Science. 1999; 286: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (23705) Google Scholar). In rodents, cortical GABA neurons are generated in the subpallium, mainly from two transient structures, the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (Anderson et al., 1997Anderson S.A. Eisenstat D.D.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Peak neurogenesis of hippocampal GABA interneurons in the mouse occurs between E12 and E15 (Danglot et al., 2006Danglot L. Triller A. Marty S. The development of hippocampal interneurons in rodents.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 1032-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, some GABA neurons are postmitotic and start migrating as early as embryonic day 10 (Danglot et al., 2006Danglot L. Triller A. Marty S. The development of hippocampal interneurons in rodents.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 1032-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). From the above, we inferred that hub neurons may be generated during the earliest phases of neurogenesis. Interestingly, recent advances in molecular genetics have produced novel tools to control the permanent expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the interneurons of transgenic mice in accordance with their spatio-temporal embryonic origin (Miyoshi and Fishell, 2006Miyoshi G. Fishell G. Directing neuron-specific transgene expression in the mouse CNS.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we have performed a compound analysis of EGins, using a combination of genetic fate mapping (Miyoshi and Fishell, 2006Miyoshi G. Fishell G. Directing neuron-specific transgene expression in the mouse CNS.Curr. Opin.

We find that at early postnatal stages, EGins turn into a distinct functional subclass of hub neurons (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. GABAergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony in developing hippocampal networks.Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that EGins persist in adult hippocampal networks and express markers identifying them as putative long-range projecting GABA neurons (Jinno, 2009Jinno S. Structural organization of long-range GABAergic projection system of the hippocampus.Front Neuroanat. 2009; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This indicates that these cells may retain, at least anatomically, the capacity to coordinate the timing of neuronal activity across structures. Moreover, this finding provides the means to study the involvement of hub cells in other synchronization processes such as epilepsy (Morgan and Soltesz, 2008Morgan R.J. Soltesz I. Nonrandom connectivity of the epileptic dentate gyrus predicts a major role for neuronal hubs in seizures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6179-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), independently from calcium data analysis. Despite their varied sites of origin, most, if not all, hippocampal GABA interneurons require the expression of Dlx1 and/or Dlx2 for their generation, as evidenced by the near absence of GABA interneurons in Dlx1/Dlx2 null compound mutants (Anderson et al., 1997Anderson S.A.

Cortex. 2009; 19: i96-i106Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to label as many EGins as possible we have fate mapped hippocampal interneuron precursors expressing Dlx1/2, by transiently activating a Dlx1/2CreERTM driver line (Batista-Brito et al., 2008Batista-Brito R. Close J. Machold R. Fishell G. The distinct temporal origins of olfactory bulb interneuron subtypes.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3966-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) crossed with a Cre-dependent EGFP reporter line RCE:LoxP (Sousa et al., 2009Sousa V.H. Miyoshi G. Hjerling-Leffler J. Karayannis T. Fishell G. Characterization of Nkx6-2-derived neocortical interneuron lineages.Cereb. Cortex. 2009; 19: i1-i10Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recombination of the reporter allele is achieved within 24 hr upon administration of tamoxifen, therefore providing temporal precision in the labeling of cells expressing Dlx1/2 (see Experimental Procedures). Temporal control also requires Dlx1/2 expression to be confined to postmitotic cells, as any labeling of progenitors would overtime produce labeled cells at later ages. This condition is satisfied by using the driver Dlx1/2CreERTM because in this transgenic line Dlx1/2 is only expressed shortly after interneurons become postmitotic (Batista-Brito et al., 2008Batista-Brito R. Close J. Machold R. Fishell G. The distinct temporal origins of olfactory bulb interneuron subtypes.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3966-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In order to further confirm the temporal resolution of our fate mapping approach at such unusually early force-feeding time period, we (1) performed a short term fate mapping of Dlx1/2 progenitors at E12.5 (induction at E7.5 or E9.5) and observed that GFP-positive cells could be detected along the lateral border of the ganglionic eminences, but excluded from the progenitor cell region lying in the embryonic ventricular zone (see Figure S1 available online). GFP-positive cells presented relatively developed processes (Figure S1C) and could even be found heading toward the hippocampal neuroepithelium, indicating an already advanced stage of migration (Figure S1C). We also (2) performed BrdU injections within a time window of 20 hr following tamoxifen force-feeding (at E9.5) and found significant GFP/BrdU colabeling in E12.5 embryos (28%, n = 1067 cells; Figures S1A and S1B) whereas a BrdU injection performed later than E10.5 did not result in any labeling of GFP cells (data not shown). This indicates that the EGins labeled here are likely to be born before E10.5. We next analyzed the population of EGins using immunohistochemical approaches at two separate time points: early postnatal (P7) and adult stages (>P30). We first examined the distribution of GFP labeled cells within the adult hippocampus. Although a precise quantification of the density of EGins is impossible due to the variability in our labeling method, it is striking how few cells are labeled at these stages. Indeed, on average 4.8 ± 1.6 GFP neurons are present per hippocampal section in adult mice (n = 263 sections, seven mice; Figures 1A and 1B ). On average, a similar number of GFP cells could be found at P7 (4.4 ± 1.2; n = 147 sections, seven mice; Figure 1C and Figure 2A ), indicating that this subpopulation of cells is unlikely to experience massive developmental cell loss. The GFP reporter line used here provides the considerable benefit that after enhancement by immunohistochemistry, it produces a strong enough signal for the fine neuronal processes including axons to be examined. Although EGins represented only a few cells per hippocampal section, GFP axonal labeling displayed a remarkable web-like coverage of the entire hippocampal region in both age groups (Figures 1A and 1B and Figure 2A). Low-density but extensive axonal arbors were distributed in all hippocampal layers. However, no prominent axonal labeling could be found in the pyramidal cell layers (Figure 1B and Figure 2A), indicating that EGins were not principally targeting perisomatic regions. Axonal labeling was also frequently observed in the fimbria (Figure 2C). This is in marked contrast with the spatially patterned and confined labeling obtained when interneurons are fate mapped at later developmental time points (Figure 2B) or with a preferred perisomatic innervation like PV-expressing cells (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). EGins could be multipolar or bipolar with horizontally or vertically oriented dendrites that, to a varying extent, were sparsely spiny (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3). Their somata were evenly found in all hippocampal areas (Figure 1 and Figure 2), with a slightly higher proportion of them being located in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus (Figures 1A and 1C). We also examined within each region, the laminar distribution of EGins. These were found in all layers but with a preference for the CA1 stratum oriens, CA3 stratum radiatum and hilar region of the dentate gyrus (Figure 1C). Similar layer distributions were found in P7 and P30 hippocampal sections (Figure 1C; p < 0.05 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).Figure 2The Morphological and Neurochemical Properties of EGins in Horizontal Sections of the Hippocampus at P7Show full caption(A and B) Distribution of GFP-expressing early-generated neurons (EGins, induction: E7.5) and late generated neurons (LGins) in horizontal sections of the hippocampus of P7 mice.

Interestingly, both the regional distribution and axonal pattern of EGins were reminiscent of those reported for interneurons with an extrahippocampal projection (Jinno et al., 2007Jinno S.

This subclass of interneurons was studied in great detail using immunohistochemical approaches (Gulyás et al., 2003Gulyás A.I. Hájos N. Katona I. Freund T.F.

We next immunostained hippocampal sections containing EGins with a variety of classic interneuron markers. Given the late maturation of interneurons' neurochemical content, only sections from adult mice were included here. Although parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calretinin (CR), or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are prominently expressed by most hippocampal interneuron classes, almost none of the EGins were positive for these markers (Figures 3B and 3G–K). In contrast, a significant fraction of them were immunopositive for somatostatin (SOM) (45% ± 6%, n = 9 animals; Figures 3A and 3L). SOM-expressing hippocampal interneurons constitute a heterogenous population that includes O-LM and HIPP cells, hippocampo-subicular and hippocampo-septal projection neurons (Jinno et al., 2007Jinno S. Klausberger T. Marton L.F. Dalezios Y. Roberts J.D. Fuentealba P. Bushong E.A. Henze D. Buzsáki G. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity in GABAergic long-range projections from the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8790-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as well as bistratified interneurons. In addition to SOM, O-LM cells also express PV (Ferraguti et al., 2004Ferraguti F. Cobden P. Pollard M. Cope D. Shigemoto R. Watanabe M. Somogyi P. Immunolocalization of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha (mGluR1alpha) in distinct classes of interneuron in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 193-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and receive strong VIP positive inputs (Acsády et al., 1996Acsády L. Görcs T.J. Freund T.F. Different populations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive interneurons are specialized to control pyramidal cells or interneurons in the hippocampus.Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). None of the EGins was positive for both SOM and PV (Figures 3C–3E and Figure S2B). Moreover, EGins did not receive strong VIP positive inputs (Figure S2A). Therefore, we can exclude that a large number of EGins become O-LM cells. Given this last result and the fact that the distribution and axonal arborization pattern of EGins resembled that of long-range projecting neurons, we next tested for the expression of mGluR1α and M2 receptor, both being additional characteristic markers of interneurons with extrahippocampal projections (Jinno et al., 2007Jinno S. Klausberger T. Marton L.F. Dalezios Y. Roberts J.D. Fuentealba P. Bushong E.A. Henze D. Buzsáki G. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity in GABAergic long-range projections from the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8790-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We found that a large majority of EGins was positive for mGluR1α (72.2% ± 7.7%, n = 5 mice; Figures 3A and 3L) and that a significant fraction of them expressed the M2 receptor (18.4% ± 2.5%, n = 4 mice; Figures 3F and 3L). In addition we tested for the coexpression of SOM and mGluR1α and found that 53.4% ± 7.5% (n = 4 mice) of EGins coexpressed both markers, further indicating a long-range projecting phenotype. Because neurochemical marker expression is developmentally regulated, systematic testing and quantification of their presence within EGins was difficult to assess at P7. Nevertheless, SOM, mGluR1α, and M2 receptor immunoreactivities were found in EGins at early postnatal stages (Figures 2D–2F). In order to further exclude that EGins develop into basket-like or O-LM interneurons, we have patch-clamped and filled with neurobiotin EGins focusing on t"
https://openalex.org/W1993306129,"In the retina, presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms that shape directionally selective (DS) responses in output ganglion cells are well established. However, the nature of inhibition-independent forms of directional selectivity remains poorly defined. Here, we describe a genetically specified set of ON-OFF DS ganglion cells (DSGCs) that code anterior motion. This entire population of DSGCs exhibits asymmetric dendritic arborizations that orientate toward the preferred direction. We demonstrate that morphological asymmetries along with nonlinear dendritic conductances generate a centrifugal (soma-to-dendrite) preference that does not critically depend upon, but works in parallel with the GABAergic circuitry. We also show that in symmetrical DSGCs, such dendritic DS mechanisms are aligned with, or are in opposition to, the inhibitory DS circuitry in distinct dendritic subfields where they differentially interact to promote or weaken directional preferences. Thus, pre- and postsynaptic DS mechanisms interact uniquely in distinct ganglion cell populations, enabling efficient DS coding under diverse conditions."

H2O2- and LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation were effectively abolished by a variety of selective p38 MAPK inhibitors.

Zhang et al. suggested that in an immature monocyte cell line, PMA-induced ROS/RNS attack the cysteinyl thiol of the prodomain, nullifying its inhibitory effect on TACE (14Zhang Z. Kolls J.K.

However, the role of ROS in stimulation-induced up-regulation of TACE activity on primary cells is unknown. Furthermore, if ROS are involved, their mechanism of action should not involve a “direct” oxidizing effect on the prodomain because it was already removed from the cell surface TACE. ROS have emerged as essential effectors of a variety of intracellular signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (20Matsuzawa A. Saegusa K. Noguchi T.

J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3419-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38 MAPK has been shown to attenuate the shedding of some TACE substrates (22Pedron T. Girard R. Chaby R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20555-20564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Rizoli S.B. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. J. Biol.

Therefore, we considered that ROS may mediate TACE activity up-regulation “indirectly,” by activating intracellular signaling pathways. Previous studies of TACE activity regulation have relied upon shedding of TACE substrates as a surrogate for catalytic activity estimation. We previously developed a highly sensitive fluorometric assay to directly quantify cell surface TACE activity (27Alvarez-Iglesias M. Wayne G. O'Dea K.P. Amour A. Takata M. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We employed this assay to investigate the regulation of TACE activity on primary human monocytes in response to LPS stimulation. We took a pharmacological approach and used freshly isolated monocytes to preserve, as far as possible, their in vivo phenotype. We identified the crucial role of ROS in mediating LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation in human monocytes. Further investigation revealed that ROS mediate TACE activity up-regulation indirectly, via the activation of p38 MAPK and downstream MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2). Finally, we explored the ultimate mechanism responsible for TACE activity regulation and implicated disulfide exchange facilitated by cell surface oxidoreductases. PBS, dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), FCS, and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Invitrogen. Sigma supplied the following: saponin, dimethyl sulfoxide, BSA, desferrioxamine (DFO), diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), EDTA, H2O2, manganese(III) 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)-21H,23H-porphine chloride tetrakis (MnPyP), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, BioXtra grade), SB203580, SB202190, U0126, dithiothreitol (DTT), 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, and Ponceau S staining solution. N-Nitro-l-Arginine Methyl Ester hydrochloride (l-NAME) and MK2 Inhibitor III were from Merck. LPS (Escherichia coli, strain 01111:B4) was from InvivoGen (Wiltshire, UK). EO 1428 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Biomol International LP (Exeter, UK) supplied the fluorescein-tetramethylrhodamine (FAM-TAMRA) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide that consists of a TACE-sensitive TNF sequence (FAM-SPLAQAVRSSSRK-TAMRA) (27Alvarez-Iglesias M. Wayne G. O'Dea K.P. Amour A. Takata M. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). R&D Systems supplied fluorophore-conjugated anti-human TACE ectodomain mAb and relevant isotype control; BD Biosciences supplied anti-human CD14 mAb and 7-amino actinomycin D. Fluorophore-conjugated anti-human phospho-p38, phospho-ERK, and phospho-MK2 mAbs were from Cell Signaling Technology. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donor blood by density gradient centrifugation through Ficoll (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) in Leukosep tubes (Greiner Bio One Ltd., Gloucester, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMCs were washed and resuspended in separation buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 2 mm EDTA). CD14+ monocytes were purified from PBMCs by negative immunomagnetic bead separation according to the manufacturer's (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, UK) instructions. Briefly, nonmonocytes were labeled with a mixture of biotinylated antibodies (against CD3, CD7, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD123, and CD235a) followed by addition of anti-biotin microbeads and anti-CD61 microbeads (to ensure platelet removal) before depletion on a magnetic separation column. Monocytes separated by this method were typically >90% pure CD14+, low side-scatter cells as assessed by flow cytometry. In acknowledgment of the physiological heterogeneity between individuals, blood was taken from a pool of >10 donors. In addition, the repeats of each experiment were performed with monocytes isolated from a minimum of 3 donors. Monocytes were stimulated at 37 ºC in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 5% FCS at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. The kinetics and dose dependence of LPS stimulation were assessed with incubation times varying between 15 min and 3 h and increasing LPS concentrations from 100 pg/ml to 10 μg/ml. To investigate the role of ROS, monocytes were preincubated with NAC (neutral pH adjusted), MnPyP, DPI, DFO, or l-NAME for 30 min before 30-min LPS stimulation. In addition, cells were stimulated with H2O2. MAPK pathways were investigated by pretreating monocytes with p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190, and EO 1428), MK2 Inhibitor III, or the ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 before stimulation. To inhibit cell surface oxidoreductase, monocytes were pretreated with 4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino)phenylarsenoxide (GSAO), a membrane-impermeable, specific, vicinal thiol blocker (28Donoghue N. Yam P.T. Jiang X.M. Hogg P.J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2436-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), for 30 min. Concentrations of all pharmacological agents used (described under “Results”) are considered to be “saturating doses,” consistent with those found within the relevant literature. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the vehicle for some agents up to a maximum concentration of 0.4% which had no effect in the relevant experiments (data not shown). Following stimulation, cells were washed, and a small fraction was used for flow cytometric analysis. To quantify TACE expression, cells were stained with anti-human TACE mAb or the relevant isotype control and anti-human CD14 for 10 min at room temperature before being washed and resuspended in FACS wash buffer (FWB-PBS supplemented with 2% FCS, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide). CALTAG Counting Beads (Invitrogen) were then added to each sample. For quantification of intracellular phospho-p38, monocytes were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then washed twice in permeabilization/wash buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% FCS, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.2% saponin) and stained with anti-human phospho-p38 mAb and anti-human CD14 for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, before a further wash and resuspension in permeabilization/wash buffer. Analysis of TACE and phospho-p38 expression was performed with a CyAn ADP Analyzer flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Expression is reported as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD14+, low side-scatter gated cells with the appropriate isotype control subtracted. Measurement of phospho-MK2 and phospho-ERK expression was performed as for phospho-p38. Cell viability following stimulation (>90% for all experiments) was assessed by adding the nuclear dye 7-amino actinomycin D to samples prior to acquisition according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following stimulation, monocytes were washed and resuspended in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1% BSA). Monocyte number and viability were assessed as described above before being plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in black 96-well plates (Corning). Cells were plated in duplicate or, number permitting, triplicate. Well volumes totaled 100 μl with 5 μm FAM-TAMRA TNF peptide and an appropriate volume of assay buffer. TACE enzymatic activity was quantified by continuous measurement of fluorescence intensity in a microplate fluorometer (Flx-800; Bio-tek Instruments Inc., Bedfordshire, UK) at 37 ºC and at λex 485 nm and λem 535 nm in accordance with the protocol described previously (27Alvarez-Iglesias M. Wayne G. O'Dea K.P. Amour A. Takata M. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Data were acquired with KC4 data analysis software (Bio-tek Instruments Inc.). Following an initial equilibration period of ∼5 min, enzymatic activity was calculated as the gradient of the fluorescence-time plot over a 10-min period, giving values in fluorescence units/min. When applicable, activity was calculated as the mean of multiple wells. To investigate monocyte ROS production, we used the ROS-reactive dye DHR which is converted to cationic (trapping it intracellularly), green fluorescent rhodamine 123 upon oxidation and can be detected by flow cytometry. Monocytes were preincubated at 37 ºC for 30 min with 10 μm DHR before being stimulated with LPS for 1 h. Inhibitors were added with either DHR (DPI) or with LPS (NAC). Following stimulation, monocytes were washed, stained with fluorophore-conjugated anti-human CD14 mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry. ROS quantification is reported as DHR MFI for CD14+ cells. Samples were resolved on NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels using the Xcell SurelockTM Mini-cell system (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes using the iBlot® Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). After probing with biotinylated GSAO (GSAO-B), labeled proteins were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Cell Signaling Technology) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling Technology) using a Syngene G:Box and Gene Tools 4.02(b) software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Results are reported as the mean of repeated experiments ± S.D. of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed either by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni tests or paired t tests, using SPSS 14.00 (Chicago, IL). Significance was attributed at the 5% level. TACE activity was quantified by monitoring the rate of increase in fluorescent signal due to cleavage of the FAM-TAMRA peptide with a TACE-specific TNF sequence (27Alvarez-Iglesias M. Wayne G. O'Dea K.P. Amour A. Takata M. Lab. Invest. 2005; 85: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although previously described in cell lines, we confirmed in primary human monocytes that the rate of peptide cleavage was stable and proportional to cell number, indicating that the TACE activity assay was quantitative (Fig. 1A). To investigate the kinetics of TACE activity up-regulation, monocytes were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for between 15 min and 3 h and subsequently applied to the assay. Up-regulation of TACE activity occurred after only 15-min stimulation, and we observed close to maximal up-regulation by 30 min, with a 3-fold increase in activity compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 1B, 91 ± 16 versus 30 ± 16 fluorescence units/min at 30-min stimulation, p < 0.01). Further experiments demonstrated that LPS stimulation was dose-dependent with maximal activity up-regulation at 1 μg/ml and above (Fig. 1C). In subsequent investigations of TACE activity, monocytes were stimulated for 30 min with 1 μg/ml LPS. Cell surface TACE expression remained unchanged between treated and untreated cells throughout the time period assessed (Fig. 1, D and E, 137 ± 28 versus 136 ± 39 MFI, p = not significant). LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation was therefore due to an increase in catalytic activity per se. This rapid up-regulation of activity with no change in expression is indicative of post-translational modification of the enzyme, potentially mediated by ROS. To assess the involvement of ROS, monocytes were stimulated in the presence of 5 mm NAC, a broad spectrum free radical scavenger. NAC completely attenuated LPS-induced up-regulation of TACE activity (Fig. 2A, 84 ± 13% attenuation, p < 0.001), while having no effect on basal activity. We confirmed that LPS stimulation induced increased ROS production by preloading monocytes with the redox-sensitive fluorescent dye, DHR. Flow cytometric analysis of cells stimulated with LPS for 1 h revealed a significant increase in rhodamine fluorescence over untreated controls (Fig. 2B, 2737 ± 386 versus 1762 ± 146 MFI, p < 0.001), indicating ROS generation. LPS stimulation for 1 h, rather than 30 min, was necessary to optimize the signal:noise ratio in ROS measurement, although increased ROS could be detected after just 30-min LPS treatment (data not shown). The presence of NAC during stimulation effectively abolished LPS-induced rhodamine fluorescence (Fig. 2B, 99 ± 24% attenuation, p < 0.001), confirming the ROS-scavenging efficacy of NAC. The production of superoxide (O2⨪) by flavoprotein oxidoreductases, such as NADPH oxidase, is one of the major intracellular pathways of ROS generation (delineated in Fig. 3). Pretreatment of monocytes with 20 μm DPI, a flavoprotein oxidoreductase inhibitor, attenuated TACE activity up-regulation following LPS stimulation while having no effect on basal activity (Fig. 4A, 70 ± 6%, p < 0.05). DPI also inhibited LPS-induced ROS production (Fig. 2B, 139 ± 38%, p < 0.001). Nitric oxide (.NO) production by nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) constitutes another pathway of radical production. As DPI has been shown to inhibit NOS (29Stuehr D.J. Fasehun O.A. Kwon N.S. Gross S.S. Gonzalez J.A. Levi R. Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), we confirmed that its mechanism of action in the present study was limited to oxidoreductase inhibition: pretreatment of monocytes with 10 mm l-NAME, a NOS inhibitor, had no effect on LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Flavoprotein oxidoreductase-derived ROS mediate LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation. A, monocytes were pretreated with either DPI (20 μm) or l-NAME (10 mm) before LPS stimulation. DPI caused significant attenuation of LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation whereas l-NAME had no effect (*, p < 0.05 different from each other, n = 5; error bars, S.D.). B, LPS stimulation of monocytes in the presence of MnPyP (5 μm) had no significant effect on TACE activity up-regulation (n = 4). C, treatment of monocytes for 30 min with H2O2 (5 mm) resulted in up-regulation of TACE activity similar to that seen with LPS (*, p < 0.001 versus control, n = 4). D, monocytes were pretreated with DFO (10 mm) before LPS stimulation. DFO abrogated TACE activity up-regulation by LPS (*, p < 0.01 different from each other, n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In vivo, superoxide is dismutated by superoxide dismutase to produce H2O2. We questioned whether superoxide directly, or rather one of its downstream products, mediates TACE activity up-regulation. Co-incubation of cells with LPS and 5 μm MnPyP, a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimic, had no effect on LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation (Fig. 4B), indicating that the superoxide anion was not directly involved. Downstream of superoxide, H2O2 is not particularly reactive, but its Fe2+-catalyzed reduction (the Fenton reaction) yields the extremely reactive hydroxyl radical (O⨪). Treatment of monocytes with 5 mm H2O2 induced a significant, 4-fold increase in TACE activity (Fig. 4C, 104 ± 3 versus 26 ± 10 fluorescence units/min, p < 0.001), similar to that observed with LPS. Inhibition of O⨪ production by pretreating monocytes with 10 mm DFO, an Fe2+ chelator, caused a significant reduction in LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation (Fig. 4D, 63 ± 15%, p < 0.01). These data suggest that H2O2/O⨪, rather than superoxide, is the principal ROS involved. LPS-induced innate immune responses have been found to require ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK (20Matsuzawa A. Saegusa K. Noguchi T. Sadamitsu C. Nishitoh H. Nagai S. Koyasu S. Matsumoto K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), prompting us to investigate whether p38 was involved in TACE activity up-regulation. Pretreatment of monocytes with 10 μm SB203580, a selective p38 inhibitor (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar), completely abolished LPS-stimulated up-regulation of TACE activity (Fig. 5A, 97 ± 13%, p < 0.001). Given the potential for pharmacological inhibitors to have off-target effects, we confirmed the involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway using two further inhibitors: SB202190, which is in the same class as SB203580 (pyridinyl imidazoles); and EO 1428, a novel, highly specific inhibitor of p38 of the aminobenzophenone class (31Ottosen E.R.

Furthermore, block of nodal Na+ channels or axotomy of the first node in intrinsically bursting neurons depolarized the somatic AP voltage threshold (∼5 mV) and eliminated APs selectively within a high-frequency cluster in response to steady currents or simulated synaptic inputs.

Action potentials during a burst initiate in the axon initial segment The first node produces a persistent Na+ current Nodal Na+ currents hyperpolarize AP threshold and amplify the afterdepolarization The first node facilitates the generation of high-frequency bursts Nodes of Ranvier are the periodic interruptions of myelin sheaths in axons (Ranvier, 1871Ranvier L. Contributions à l'histologie et à la physiologie des nerfs périphériques.Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences. 1871; 73: 1168-1171Google Scholar). These axonal domains are generated by interacting myelinating glial cells and axons and are characterized by a dense clustering of voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels within the ∼1 μm nodal gap, flanked by potassium (K+) channels in juxtaparanodal regions (Caldwell et al., 2000Caldwell J.H.

By limiting the ionic current flow to the nodes, minimal charge is lost in the myelinated internodes, making AP conduction fast, energy efficient, and saltatory (Huxley and Stämpfli, 1949Huxley A.F.

The first node of Ranvier is typically localized at the first branchpoint at the end of the internode, only ∼50–100 μm from the axon initial segment (AIS). Similar to the node, the AIS contains a high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels (Caldwell et al., 2000Caldwell J.H. Schaller K.L. Lasher R.S. Peles E. Levinson S.R.

Given the close proximity of the node to the cell body and high density of Na+ channels, it has been postulated that, in addition to securing propagation, the first node could potentially generate the upstroke of the action potential (AP) (Coombs et al., 1957Coombs J.S. Curtis D.R. Eccles J.C. The interpretation of spike potentials of motoneurones.J. Physiol. 1957; 139: 198-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although there is some experimental evidence for AP initiation in the node (Clark et al., 2005Clark B.A. Monsivais P. Branco T. London M. Häusser M.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6676-6686PubMed Google Scholar), more recent electrophysiological investigations showed that the AIS initiates all APs, and the first node faithfully follows spike frequencies with a ∼100 μs delay (Foust et al., 2010Foust A.

It remains an open question whether the first node can influence the generation of APs. In mechanosensory leech axons, a direct role of branchpoints to neural computation has been demonstrated by a facilitation of transmitter release after the AP fails at a branchpoint and subsequently propagates in both reverse and forward directions (Baccus, 1998Baccus S.A.

Also, in mammalian axons there is evidence that the strategic placing of Na+ channels at axonal branchpoints exerts computational roles by counteracting impedance mismatches when APs invade daughter collaterals at axonal bifurcations and thereby increase the safety factor for high-frequency spike propagation toward the presynaptic terminals (Goldstein and Rall, 1974Goldstein S.S.

To address whether the first node in mammalian axons plays a role in the input-output function, electrophysiological recordings of rat neocortical L5 neurons were made in combination with targeted inactivation of visually identified nodes. The results show that the first node facilitates the initiation of APs in the AIS selectively during high-frequency bursts (≥100 Hz). Inactivation of nodal Na+ channels demonstrated that the first node generates a TTX-sensitive persistent Na+ current, which lowers the axosomatic AP voltage threshold and amplifies the afterdepolarization (ADP). These results unveil a role for the first node of Ranvier in the temporal encoding of synaptic inputs into high-frequency APs in axons. Branchpoints in neocortical axons contain ultrastructural markers of nodes (Khattab, 1968Khattab F.I.

Sci. 1979; 285: 173-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous work showed that the first branchpoint in rodent L5 axons is physiologically characterized by AP-mediated Na+ influx and acts as an acceleration point in the saltatory propagation of APs (Fleidervish et al., 2010Fleidervish I.A. Lasser-Ross N. Gutnick M.J. Ross W.N. Na+ imaging reveals little difference in action potential-evoked Na+ influx between axon and soma.Nat.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1854-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the present study, it is therefore assumed that the first node is localized at the first branchpoint of the primary axon. To obtain detailed insight into the location and geometrical properties of the branchpoint, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from large L5 pyramidal neurons in parasagittal slices in combination with two-photon laser scanning microscopy (n = 13) or post hoc biocytin staining (n = 9). Figure 1A shows that the first branchpoint gave rise to multiple secondary axon collaterals (2.1 ± 0.2 collaterals/branchpoint, range 1–3, n = 22, Figures 1A and 1B). Axon collaterals were on average 3-fold smaller in diameter compared to the parent axons (collaterals, 0.43 ± 0.02 μm; first internodes, 1.2 ± 0.06 μm; paired t test p < 0.001, n = 8). The average distance from the base of the soma to the first branchpoint was 128.2 ± 5.4 μm (range 85–173 μm, n = 22) while the second node was located at 200 ± 24 μm from the soma (n = 5, biocytin staining). Some axon parameters (e.g., diameter) are dependent on the size of the cell (Sloper and Powell, 1979Sloper J.J. Powell T.P. A study of the axon initial segment and proximal axon of neurons in the primate motor and somatic sensory cortices.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1979; 285: 173-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test whether the variability in location of the node can be explained by cell size, the branchpoint location was plotted against the somatic surface area (Figure 1C). The results show that the first branchpoint distance from the soma was linearly related to the soma size, with larger neurons having the first node located more distally (r2 = 0.53, p < 0.001, n = 22). These data show that the first branchpoint in L5 neurons is on average located at ∼130 μm and within a range of ∼90–180 μm from the soma. As a first step to test the functional contribution of the node to AP generation, the somatically recorded firing properties were compared between neurons with an intact axon, including a first branchpoint, and L5 neurons with axons cut proximal to the branchpoint during the slice preparation procedure (Figure 2A ). Axon lengths were either ad hoc determined in the bright-field/fluorescence image or post hoc with biocytin staining (soma-bleb distance range, 15–1590 μm; n = 69). A commonly observed characteristic of L5 neocortical pyramidal neurons is the existence of two subpopulations generating distinct firing patterns called intrinsic bursts (IBs), characterized by a first interspike interval (ISI) less than 10 ms (firing frequency ≥ 100 Hz) or regular spiking (RS) with nonadapting ISI of ∼100–200 ms (Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990Chagnac-Amitai Y. Luhmann H.J. Prince D.A. Burst generating and regular spiking layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat neocortex have different morphological features.J. Comp.

Mechanisms and consequences of action potential burst firing in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 467-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Figure 2A shows a typical example of a L5 neuron with the axon cut proximally to the first node at a distance of 98 μm. In response to constant suprathreshold current injections, the neuron responded with RS patterns (9.7 Hz at threshold). In contrast, many instances of IB firing were found when recording from neurons with axons cut at more distal locations (e.g., 750 μm, Figure 2A). The collected results revealed a striking dependence of the intrinsic excitability on the remaining axon length; L5 neurons with axons cut proximal to the average first branchpoint location (<130 μm) only generated RS output patterns (frequency ∼10.7 ± 0.6 Hz, range 5.3–15.6 Hz, n = 22), whereas L5 neurons with longer primary axons responded with both RS (8.2 ± 0.6 Hz, n = 23) and IB firing (234.0 ± 11.5 Hz, n = 24, Figures 2B and 2C). The probability of burst firing with axons cut proximal was 0%, compared to 50% in longer axons (χ2 test p < 0.001, Figure 2C). Plotting the firing frequency (f) of the first interval against the primary axon length revealed that the minimum axon length for high-frequency bursts was 180 μm (293 Hz, Figure 2D, n = 68). Beyond this location, a ∼50% burst probability was found, which appeared further independent of increasing length of the axon. Although proximal and distal groups had a similar input resistance (proximal, 27.0 ± 3.0 MΩ; versus distal, 22.1 ± 1.0 MΩ; p > 0.14) and resting membrane potential (LJP corrected; proximal, −77.1 ± 0.5 mV; versus distal, −77.5 ± 0.5 mV; p > 0.65), the voltage threshold of APs during steady suprathreshold current injections was significantly more hyperpolarized (∼1.7 mV) in neurons with L5 axons cut distally (proximal, −52.9 ± 1.0 mV; n = 20; distal, −54.6 ± 0.6; n = 45; t test p < 0.05; Figure 2B). To understand which mechanism underlies the reduced burst probability, the intrinsic excitability was further examined by single APs elicited with a brief depolarizing current injection (3 ms, 1–3 nA, Figure 2E). The somatic AP voltage threshold with brief current injections was not related to the axon length in the slice (proximal, −62.1 ± 0.4 mV; versus distal, −61.5 ± 0.6 mV; p > 0.80, n = 63), consistent with previous work (Palmer and Stuart, 2006Palmer L.M. Stuart G.J. Site of action potential initiation in layer 5 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1854-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). L5 neurons with proximal-cut axons had, however, larger AP amplitudes (104.8 ± 1.1 mV, n = 22) compared to axons with cuts at distal locations (102.1 ± 0.7 mV, p < 0.05, n = 45), probably due to the reflection at the sealed end (Goldstein and Rall, 1974Goldstein S.S. Rall W. Changes of action potential shape and velocity for changing core conductor geometry.Biophys. J. 1974; 14: 731-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, Manor et al., 1991Manor Y. Koch C. Segev I. Effect of geometrical irregularities on propagation delay in axonal trees.Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 1424-1437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the time derivatives of the AP upstroke demonstrated that the initial component in the second derivative, reflecting antidromic propagating axonal APs, was significantly reduced in neurons with axons cut proximally (p < 0.01, Figure S1). Furthermore, consistent with the lack of burst firing in proximal-cut L5 neurons, the spike ADP, measured relative to the voltage threshold of the preceding AP, was significantly smaller (proximal, −4.8 ± 1.0 mV, n = 21; versus distal, −1.8 ± 0.5 mV, n = 44; t test p < 0.005; Figure 2E). Large negative ADP amplitudes were in particular observed with axon lengths between 20 and 50 μm from the soma (in the AIS) as well as with lengths between 60 and 120 μm from the soma when axons are cut at the first internode. The ADP modestly increased in amplitude with the length of axon in distal axonal regions. These data indicate that the first branchpoint is required for a hyperpolarized AP voltage threshold, large ADP amplitude, and generating high-frequency bursts. There is substantial evidence that some of the variability in burst firing in the neocortex can be conferred to slender- and thick-tufted-type dendritic trees (Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990Chagnac-Amitai Y. Luhmann H.J. Prince D.A. Burst generating and regular spiking layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat neocortex have different morphological features.J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 296: 598-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, de Kock et al., 2007de Kock C.P.J. Bruno R.M. Spors H. Sakmann B.

Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. II. Electrophysiology.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1415-1428PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative explanation for the lack of IB with axons cut proximally is that slender-tufted L5 neurons, predominantly generating RS firing patterns, biased the proximal-cut axon population. To test this possibility, the dendritic geometry was analyzed in neurons filled with biocytin. Figure 3A shows representative examples of the two groups. Both neurons possessed an apical dendrite extending into the upper layers of the cortex. The primary axon length was plotted versus the sum of primary and higher-order axon collaterals with the predicted correlation for an axon length without branchpoints (r2 = 0.88, p < 0.001, n = 14, Figure 3B). The average primary axon length in the distal-cut axon group was 703 ± 90 μm (n = 7) and 60 ± 10 μm in the proximal group (p < 0.001, n = 7, Figure 3B). Importantly, the two main physiological observations from the large data set (Figure 2) were conserved in the small sample of reconstructed neurons; proximal-cut neurons lacked IB firing upon depolarizing current injections (proximal, 0% versus distal, 57%; χ2 test p < 0.05, n = 14, Figure 3B), and the somatic ADP was significantly reduced (proximal, −5.8 ± 1.8 mV; distal, −0.9 ± 0.9 mV; unpaired t test p < 0.05, n = 14). Next, the somatic and dendritic properties were assessed for the parameters separating slender-tufted from thick-tufted L5 neurons (Chagnac-Amitai et al., 1990Chagnac-Amitai Y. Luhmann H.J. Prince D.A. Burst generating and regular spiking layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat neocortex have different morphological features.J. Comp.

Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. II. Electrophysiology.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1415-1428PubMed Google Scholar). On average, the sum of the total dendritic length was similar (p > 0.34, n = 7, Figure 3C). Furthermore, the two groups had similar apical dendritic diameters (at 50 μm from the soma, p > 0.5, n = 7, Figure 3C), and the horizontal span width of the tuft dendrites, another indicator for thick-tufted L5 neurons, was not different (distal, 0.49 ± 0.05 mm; proximal, 0.47 ± 0.05 mm; p > 0.76, n = 7, Figure 3C). The somatic surface area was also comparable (distal, 553 ± 26 μm2; proximal, 480 ± 33 μm2; p > 0.11, n = 7). Finally, in slender-tufted L5 neurons, the sum of the apical dendrites is less than the sum of basal dendrites (de Kock et al., 2007de Kock C.P.J. Bruno R.M. Spors H. Sakmann B. Layer- and cell-type-specific suprathreshold stimulus representation in rat primary somatosensory cortex.J. Physiol. 2007; 581: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the two populations, however, the ratio of apical/basal dendritic length was >1.0 (proximal, 2.5 ± 1.5; distal, 1.7 ± 0.2; p > 0.45, n = 7). Taken together, these data suggest that independent of axon length in the slice, the targeted neurons belong to the class of thick-tufted L5 neurons. These findings further support the idea that in thick-tufted L5 neurons, the node of Ranvier is a minimum requirement for IB firing. To test the role of the first node of Ranvier more directly and within the same cell, two-photon laser axotomy was applied to cut targeted locations of visualized axons with micrometer-precise spatial control (Mejia-Gervacio et al., 2007Mejia-Gervacio S. Collin T. Pouzat C. Tan Y.P. Llano I. Marty A.

Cinar H. Cinar H.N. Chisholm A.D. Jin Y. Ben-Yakar A. Neurosurgery: functional regeneration after laser axotomy.Nature. 2004; 432: 822Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Single APs and firing frequencies were recorded from large L5 neurons with primary axons >200 μm (Figure 4A ). After this physiological characterization, the first branchpoint was identified using two-photon illumination, and recordings were switched to voltage-clamp. An axonal region of interest of ∼2 μm2 was selected and subjected to high laser intensities (50%–90% transmission) until a sudden increase in holding current (>500 pA). Within approximately 20 min, the resting membrane potential of most neurons returned to their initial values (81%, 17/21). Near the site of high-intensity laser exposure, a gap of ∼5 μm became visible, and distal parts of the axon showed typical beading and degeneration (Figures 4A and S2). Axotomy proximal to the node (P) was made either in the internode (P, 90–140 μm, n = 5, Figure 4A, right) or within the AIS (15–50 μm, n = 7). To isolate the impact of axotomizing the first branchpoint from nonspecific changes (asymmetric current flow at the sealed end, heat-related swelling, phototoxicity, etc.), a control group was included in which the axon was cut distal from the identified first node (D, 120–160 μm, n = 5, Figure 4A, middle). Figures 4A and 4B show an example in which the same axon was axotomized at two different locations with an interval of 25 min. The intrinsically burst firing neuron (236 Hz in control) continued firing at high frequency (240 Hz) when axotomized distal to the branchpoint, but switched to RS mode after a second cut proximal to the branchpoint (9.6 Hz). Data from multiple recordings showed that axotomy of the first branchpoint in IB neurons (230 ± 3 Hz) led to a RS mode (10.2 ± 0.4 Hz, n = 6; unpaired t test p < 0.001; Figure 4C). In contrast, in RS cells the firing rates at steady current injections remained similar to control (control, 7.7 Hz versus cut, 5.6 Hz, paired t test p > 0.09, Figure 5C ). Axotomy proximal to the branchpoint did not affect the input resistance at resting potential (1.9 ± 1.0 MΩ increase, paired t test p > 007, n = 12, Figure S2). Similar to axons cut in the slice preparation, axotomy proximal to the first node significantly increased the AP threshold during steady current injections (+6.8 ± 1.1 mV, p < 0.01, Figure 4D) and reduced the ADP amplitude (−3.8 ± 0.6 mV, n = 5, p < 0.05, Figure 4E). However, single APs were not affected when the axotomy was made distal of the first node; the AP amplitude (+0.3 ± 1.7 mV change), ADP (−0.5 ± 0.5 mV change), and voltage threshold (+1.6 ± 0.5 mV change) remained similar to control values (for all, paired t test p > 0.3, n = 5). The only specific impact of cutting within the AIS (on average 35 ± 5.4 μm, n = 7) was a significantly larger reduction in the ADP (−12.0 ± 2.7 mV, compared to internodal axotomy p < 0.05, n = 7, Figure 4E). Interestingly, large negative ADP amplitudes observed after laser axotomy in the AIS were quantitatively similar to the ADP amplitudes associated with axons that were cut in the AIS during the slice-cutting procedure (acute axotomy: −12.0 mV for a 35 μm axon versus slice cut: −10.5 mV for a 32 μm axon), suggesting that the functional consequences of acute transections (30 min) are comparable to the lasting impact by slice cutting (2–8 hr). Taken together, the results further support the idea that the first branchpoint is critical for a hyperpolarized AP voltage threshold, near-positive ADP amplitudes, and the generation of IB firing. Based on these observations, the first node either indirectly facilitates high-frequency bursts by generating an inward current at subthreshold potentials or directly initiates APs within a burst. APs during a high-frequency burst are known to be generated in the axon, but the role of the first node has not been precisely determined (Williams and Stuart, 1999Williams S.R. Stuart G.J. Mechanisms and consequences of action potential burst firing in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 467-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rare cases of initiation of APs in the first node have been reported in Purkinje axons (Palmer et al., 2010Palmer L.M. Clark B.A. Gründemann J. Roth A. Stuart G.J. Häusser M. Initiation of simple and complex spikes in cerebellar Purkinje cells.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the AIS and the node as possible initiation sites, axosomatic delays during high-frequency bursts were determined by making extracellular action potential (eAP) recordings simultaneously from both locations in combination with whole-cell somatic recording (Figure 5A). Using fluorescence-guided axon visualization, patch-pipettes filled with extracellular solution were placed near the end of the AIS (on average 40 ± 3 μm) and at the first node of the same axon (162 ± 34 μm distance from the soma). AP bursts were triggered with somatic suprathreshold current injections in IB neurons (98–211 Hz, n = 5). APs within a burst were separately averaged (40–80 trials) by alignment to the onset of the somatic AP (first peak in the d2V/dt2, Figure 5B). The results show that for the first spike in a burst, the eAP onset latency in the AIS was on average −74 ± 9.8 μs (range from −38 to −93 μs, n = 5) and preceding the eAP at the first node (+14 ± 10 μs, p < 0.01, n = 5, Figures 5B and 5C). For each paired recording, the AIS-to-node latency was negative (range from −30 to −110 μs, average −87 ± 16 μs, n = 5), indicating that the first AP within a high-frequency burst is starting in the AIS. This spatiotemporal sequence was almost identical for the second AP in the burst (AIS-to-node latency, −136 ± 20 μs, n = 5, p < 0.01, Figures 5B and 5C). Furthermore, in one case of an AP burst with three spikes, the third AP also had a negative AIS-to-node latency (−148 μs), suggesting spike initiation is robust in the AIS. Based on the distances between recording sites, the AIS-to-soma antidromic conduction velocity was estimated to be 0.67 ± 0.10 m s−1 and 1.48 ± 0.37 m s−1 for the orthodromic propagation through the first internode (n = 5). Thus, all APs during high-frequency firing are initiated in the AIS, and the importance of the first branchpoint is likely to be indirect (e.g., through a conductance active in the subthreshold voltage range). Voltage-gated Na+ channels are known to produce three types of currents, operationally defined by their distinct kinetics: a large and fast-inactivating Na+ current underlying the AP upstroke (INaT), a transient resurgent current activated during repolarization (INaR), and a noninactivating persistent current active in the subthreshold range (INaP). Since nodes of Ranvier contain a high density of Na+ channels (Caldwell et al., 2000Caldwell J.H. Schaller K.L. Lasher R.S. Pel"

It contains stars with ages ranging from a few million years to over a billion years, yet its star-formation history and the triggering process for star formation remain to be resolved. Recently, episodic star formation, powered by changes in the gas content, has been suggested. Classical Cepheid variable stars have pulsation periods that decrease with increasing age, so it is possible to probe the star-formation history on the basis of the distribution of their periods. Here we report the presence of three classical Cepheids in the nuclear bulge with pulsation periods of approximately 20 days, within 40 parsecs (projected distance) of the central black hole. No Cepheids with longer or shorter periods were found. We infer that there was a period about 25 million years ago, and possibly lasting until recently, in which star formation increased relative to the period of 30-70 million years ago."

https://openalex.org/W1992109285,"Self-assembly of the human pancreatic hormone amylin into toxic oligomers and aggregates is linked to dysfunction of islet β-cells and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent evidence suggests that cholesterol, an essential component of eukaryotic cells membranes, controls amylin aggregation on model membranes. However, the pathophysiological consequence of cholesterol-regulated amylin polymerization on membranes and biochemical mechanisms that protect β-cells from amylin toxicity are poorly understood. Here, we report that plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol plays a key role in molecular recognition, sorting, and internalization of toxic amylin oligomers but not monomers in pancreatic rat insulinoma and human islet cells. Depletion of PM cholesterol or the disruption of the cytoskeleton network inhibits internalization of amylin oligomers, which in turn enhances extracellular oligomer accumulation and potentiates amylin toxicity. Confocal microscopy reveals an increased nucleation of amylin oligomers across the plasma membrane in cholesterol-depleted cells, with a 2-fold increase in cell surface coverage and a 3-fold increase in their number on the PM. Biochemical studies confirm accumulation of amylin oligomers in the medium after depletion of PM cholesterol. Replenishment of PM cholesterol from intracellular cholesterol stores or by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol restores amylin oligomer clustering at the PM and internalization, which consequently diminishes cell surface coverage and toxicity of amylin oligomers. In contrast to oligomers, amylin monomers followed clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which is not sensitive to cholesterol depletion. Our studies identify an actin-mediated and cholesterol-dependent mechanism for selective uptake and clearance of amylin oligomers, impairment of which greatly potentiates amylin toxicity.

Human islet amyloid polypeptide or amylin is a 37-amino acid peptide hormone produced and co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells. Amylin has a broad range of both physiological and pathological effects on cells, ranging from the regulation of insulin release to β-cell apoptosis (1Wagoner P.K. Chen C. Worley J.F. Dukes I.D.

Ultrastructural studies frequently reveal physical associations of amylin aggregates with pancreatic β-cell plasma membranes (PM) and model membranes (36Clark A. Cooper G.J. Lewis C.E. Morris J.F.

Despite this, the role of membrane composition in amylin assembly and aggregation at the membrane interfaces has not been investigated until very recently (33Cho W.J. Jena B.P. Jeremic A.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 90: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Cho W.J. Trikha S. Jeremic A.M. J. Mol.

The N-terminal region and His-18 play crucial roles in the self-assembly and interactions of human amylin with membranes (24Brender J.R. Hartman K. Reid K.R. Kennedy R.T. Ramamoorthy A.

Concomitant with these structural studies, biochemical studies identify membranes as a potent determinant of amylin aggregation in vitro (33Cho W.J. Jena B.P. Jeremic A.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 90: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Jha S. Sellin D. Seidel R. Winter R. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9496-9508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These studies reveal that amylin undergoes facilitated aggregation and conformational change in the presence of membranes composed of anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS). Cholesterol inhibits phospholipid catalysis of amylin aggregation in solution and on planar membranes (33Cho W.J. Jena B.P. Jeremic A.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 90: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Cho W.J. Trikha S. Jeremic A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that cholesterol is a key factor in regulating amylin polymerization and deposition on planar membranes, acting in opposition to PS. Incorporation of cholesterol in anionic and neutral membranes has dual effects on amylin aggregation; it decreases overall amylin accumulation, whereas it facilitates formation of dense 200–500-nm protein clusters on planar membranes (34Cho W.J. Trikha S. Jeremic A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the question as to whether cholesterol also affects binding and aggregation of human amylin on native β-cell plasma membranes remains open. Based on the intrinsic property of cholesterol to regulate amylin oligomerization and aggregation on model membranes (34Cho W.J. Trikha S. Jeremic A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 765-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to expect that PM cholesterol may also influence amylin interactions with the native β-cell PM. To test this idea, in the current study we investigated amylin binding and internalization pathways in rat insulinoma and human islet cells with depleted, normal, and enriched PM cholesterol levels and explored the extent to which PM cholesterol contributes to amylin uptake and amylin-mediated cell death. Our studies demonstrate that PM cholesterol is required for uptake and clearance of toxic amylin oligomers but not monomers from the cell plasma membrane and that cell susceptibility to amylin insult is inversely related to PM cholesterol levels. Rat insulinoma (RIN-m5F) β-cells (ATCC, Gaithersburg, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were passage biweekly. Passages 10–50 were used for all the experiments. Rat insulinoma cells were plated at density 50,000 cells/well and cultured for 24 h before experiments with amylin. Human islets from non-diabetics with >90% purity and viability were obtained through the NIH Pilot Program for Human Islet Research. Upon arrival, islets were further purified by handpicking (≥98% based on dithizone staining), gently dissociated in TrypLe cell dissociation medium (Invitrogen) using a 1 ml-glass pipette, and plated on 96-well glass bottom SensoPlates (Greiner Bio-One) precoated with poly-d-lysine for confocal studies or on plastic 96-well cell culture plates for biochemical and toxicity studies at a density of ∼100 islet equivalents per well. Dissociated islets were cultured in CMRL medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 24 h before experiments. Lyophilized C-terminal amidated synthetic human amylin (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA) was used for preparations of amylin stock solution using hexafluoride isopropyl alcohol as a solvent. The appropriate amount of the peptide was solubilized in hexafluoride isopropyl alcohol overnight to completely dissolve the amylin. This approach efficiently removes any preformed amylin aggregates (33Cho W.J. Jena B.P. Jeremic A.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 90: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A 500 μm amylin stock was prepared, and before experiments hexafluoride isopropyl alcohol was evaporated under a stream of dry nitrogen gas to remove the organic solvent, which is toxic to cells. Human amylin was then reconstituted using freshly prepared culture medium or phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at a final concentration of 0.5–10 μm. For the dot-blot assay, samples (4 μl) of 10 μm amylin were spotted at the regular time intervals on the nitrocellulose membranes, and the extent of oligomer formation in the medium was determined by probing blots with conformation-specific, anti-oligomeric A11 antibody from Invitrogen (AHB0052) or Millipore Co. (AB9234) (1:1000 dilution). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Rockford, IL), and the intensity of the spots was determined using Eastman Kodak Co. Gel Logic 1500 Imaging system and Kodak Molecular Imaging Software Version 4.0. Both antibodies revealed similar time-courses of amylin oligomerization, and therefore, we used the Millipore antibody in all experiments for consistency. Amylin oligomerization and accumulation in solution and in the culture medium were quantified by Western blot analysis. Cells were exposed to amylin in the presence or absence of cholesterol-modulating agents or inhibitors as described for the toxicity studies. Samples (20 μl of cell culture medium) were collected and separated by 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (to resolve monomers and dimers) or by 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (to resolve oligomers). Resolved proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with human amylin antibody from Santa Cruz (sc-20936, 1:500) or A11 anti-oligomer antibody (Millipore, 1:1000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Fisher). Blots were developed using ECL and documented using the Kodak imaging station and software. Data are expressed as % change from controls. Actual in vivo concentrations of amylin required for formation of toxic oligomers and aggregates in the islet of Langerhans are yet to be determined. Hence, we used low μm amylin concentrations commonly adopted across the field to generate amylin oligomers and aggregates required to study their toxicity in cells (3Zhang S. Liu J. Dragunow M.

The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS (2×) and stained with 100 μg/ml filipin (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed to remove non-bound filipin and solubilized in DMSO:PBS (1:4 v/v). Samples were collected and transferred to black 96-well fluorescence microplates. The fluorescence intensities from each well, indicative of the PM cholesterol levels, were read in a Spectramax M5 microplate reader set at 338/480 nm (excitation/emission). Total cholesterol was measured by the Amplex Red cholesterol quantification kit (Invitrogen). Cholesterol was extracted from the cells by the addition of a chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) mixture followed by ice-cold PBS. The solution was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The top water phase was removed, and the lower cholesterol-containing organic solvent phase was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. To this, PBS, 5% Triton X-100 was added and then diluted with 1× Amplex Red reaction buffer. Samples containing the Amplex Red reaction mixture were distributed to the corresponding wells in black fluorescence plates and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. The fluorescence was measured at 530/590 nm (excitation/emission). Background fluorescence was corrected by subtracting the blanks. Data were expressed as % change from controls (PM cholesterol) or normalized to protein content in the sample and expressed as ng of cholesterol per μg of protein (total cholesterol). We adopted an approach by Saavedra et al. (47Saavedra L. Mohamed A. Ma V. Kar S. de Chaves E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35722-35732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) to generate and study internalization pathways of toxic amyloid oligomers. Human and rat insulinoma cells were first exposed to freshly prepared human amylin (2–10 μm) for the indicated periods of time, washed repeatedly with ice-cold PBS to remove non-bound monomers and oligomers, and then incubated with endocytotic markers, cholera toxin (CTX-Alexa555) or transferrin (Trf-Alexa633), for 30 min on ice or at 37 °C. CTX and Trf were purchased from Invitrogen and were used at 20 and 50 μg/ml final concentrations, respectively. After incubations with amylin and endocytotic markers, cross-linking of CTX-labeled lipid rafts with anti-CTX antibody (1:200 dilution; Invitrogen) was performed for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated in Image iT signal enhancer (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature to reduce background. Cells were then incubated in blocking/permeabilization solution (3% BSA, 0.5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. In some experiments the permeabilizing agent Triton X-100 was omitted from the labeling procedure. Membrane-bound and internalized soluble amylin monomers and oligomers were detected by incubating cells with rabbit anti-human amylin antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz) or rabbit anti-oligomer A11 antibody (1:200, Millipore) at 4 °C overnight, respectively. Cells were then exposed to goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300, Invitrogen) for 60 min at room temperature. Three random fields in each well (treatment) were imaged, with each treatment performed in three to six separate experiments. Single optical sections (1-μm z axis) through the middle of the cells were acquired for each field using an LSCM-510 meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with oil 63× and 100× (1.4 N.A.) objectives. The pinhole was adjusted to keep the same size of z-optical sections for all channels and objectives used. Multitrack imaging was performed to ensure that there was no cross-talk between the channels. The Pearson colocalization coefficient (R) was determined using the Zeiss colocalization software (release 4.0). The intensity thresholds of the channels were set using the Zeiss cross-hair function to avoid an arbitrary background threshold being set. In that way, the background pixels that might contribute to false colocalization were excluded from analysis. Images were also analyzed using the 1.37c software version of Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Image J confirmed R values obtained by the Zeiss colocalization software, and therefore, all data are reported using the Zeiss software for consistency. Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop software program (Adobe Systems Co., San Jose, CA). The extent of amylin binding and internalization in rat insulinoma and human islet cells was quantified using Zeiss and NIH Image J single particle analysis software as explained in the supplemental Methods (Image and Section Analysis). The GraphPad Prism 5 Program was used for plotting and statistical analysis. The unpaired Student's t test or one-way ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keul post hoc test were used for pairwise comparisons among groups when appropriate with significance established at p < 0.05. We investigated the extent to which variations in PM cholesterol levels affect amylin toxicity in rat insulinoma cells. Cells were incubated with 10 μm human amylin (hA) for 24 h in the presence or absence of the specific cholesterol-depleting drugs methyl-β-cyclodextrin (BCD), lovostatin (Lov), or filipin (48Simons K.

https://openalex.org/W2074434312,"Humans and monkeys can learn to classify perceptual information in a statistically optimal fashion if the functional groupings remain stable over many hundreds of trials, but little is known about categorization when the environment changes rapidly. Here, we used a combination of computational modeling and functional neuroimaging to understand how humans classify visual stimuli drawn from categories whose mean and variance jumped unpredictably. Models based on optimal learning (Bayesian model) and a cognitive strategy (working memory model) both explained unique variance in choice, reaction time, and brain activity. However, the working memory model was the best predictor of performance in volatile environments, whereas statistically optimal performance emerged in periods of relative stability. Bayesian and working memory models predicted decision-related activity in distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex and midbrain. These findings suggest that perceptual category judgments, like value-guided choices, may be guided by multiple controllers."
https://openalex.org/W1988320562,"γ-Secretase is a multiprotein intramembrane cleaving aspartyl protease (I-CLiP) that catalyzes the final cleavage of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloid β peptide (Aβ). Aβ is the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its mechanism of production has been studied intensely. γ-Secretase executes multiple cleavages within the transmembrane domain of APP, with cleavages producing Aβ and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), referred to as γ and ϵ, respectively.

Mutation of this lysine to alanine (K28A) shifts the primary site of γ-secretase cleavage from 1–40 to 1–33 without significant changes to ϵ cleavage.

Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11018) Google Scholar). Aβ is produced by the sequential proteolysis of APP, a type-I single-pass transmembrane protein (2Thinakaran G. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29615-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). First, β-secretase cleavage of the ectodomain releases secreted sAPPβ, leaving a carboxyl-terminal fragment in the membrane, known as the β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF or C99). C99 undergoes intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase at two primary sites to generate Aβ (termed γ-cleavage) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD, termed ϵ cleavage). The relationship between these two cleavage events by γ-secretase, their regulation, and the overall enzymatic mechanism is still not fully understood and is an active area of investigation. amyloid β amyloid β (A4) precursor protein amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain Alzheimer's disease γ-secretase modulator juxtamembrane domain immunoprecipitation. γ-Secretase has a broad substrate specificity and cleaves a number of type-I membrane proteins, typically following ectodomain shedding (3Beel A.J. Sanders C.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 1311-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A major physiologically relevant substrate is Notch1, which has well defined roles in cellular differentiation, survival, and growth. Notch is processed by γ-secretase in a similar manner to APP, producing Notch-β (Nβ, γ cleavage at the S4 site) and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD, ϵ cleavage at the S3 site) (4Okochi M.

Other substrates are thought to be processed in an analogous manner, although most have not been characterized to the same level of detail as APP and Notch1. One notable aspect of γ-secretase proteolysis is that the final cleavages that release Aβ, and the corresponding peptides from other substrates, occur at varying residues within the transmembrane domain. Thus, the length of Aβ produced from APP, or Aβ-like peptides, is variable. Moreover, the ratios of the various peptides vary between different substrates. For APP, the predominant Aβ produced is 40 amino acids in length, but smaller quantities of Aβ 1–42, Aβ 1–38, and other peptides can be detected in media from cells overexpressing APP or more physiological fluids such as human cerebral spinal fluid (6Ford M.J. Cantone J.L. Polson C. Toyn J.H. Meredith J.E. Drexler D.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2008; 168: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Longer membrane-associated Aβ peptides (1–46, 1–47) can also be detected that are thought to represent an intermediate cleavage (ζ) occurring between the ϵ and γ sites (7Zhao G. Mao G. Tan J. Dong Y.

The factors regulating the levels and ratios of Aβ 1–42 has been an intense area of research because Aβ 1–42 is hypothesized to be the initiating molecule in Alzheimer's disease (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11018) Google Scholar). A variety of mutations have been identified in APP that cause early-onset familial AD (9Brouwers N. Sleegers K. Van Broeckhoven C. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations elevate the levels of Aβ 1–42 or increase the 42/40 ratio. However, some APP mutations that alter residues within the Aβ peptide have also been identified and increase the propensity of Aβ to form higher-order aggregates or amyloid fibrils. It is an ongoing question exactly how mutations in APP lead to shifts in Aβ fragment ratios produced by γ-secretase although various mechanisms have been proposed, including changes in the conformation of the enzyme complex (10Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H. Haass C. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Berezovska O. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Different sites on APP have been identified that can regulate the levels of Aβ peptides or influence the length of Aβ peptides produced. Early studies have shown that γ-secretase displays loose specificity but that the site of cleavage was more dependent on the proximal portion of the transmembrane domain than on the distal portion (12Murphy M.P.

Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mutations in a GXXXG motif in the APP transmembrane domain have been reported to decrease Aβ 1–42 levels while at the same time increasing shorter Aβ fragments such as 34, 37, and 38 (14Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The effect of these mutations has been ascribed to decreases in the dimerization of C99, suggesting that Aβ 1–42 levels can be regulated by the degree of C99 dimer formation. Another group has reported similar mutations in this region of C99 that also lead to shifts in Aβ cleavage away from 42 toward shorter fragments (15Kienlen-Campard P. Tasiaux B. Van Hees J. Li M. Huysseune S. Sato T. Fei J.Z. Aimoto S. Courtoy P.J. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Octave J.N. J. Biol.

The changes in Aβ cleavage resulting from mutation of this region of APP is reminiscent of the pharmacological effects of γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), a class of compounds that typically shift γ cleavage away from the 42 site toward shorter fragments (i.e. 39, 38, 37, 34, 33). We have reported recently that GSMs bind directly to the C99 substrate (termed substrate-targeting GSMs (stGSMs)) and that this interaction appears be responsible for their ability to modulate γ cleavage of Aβ (16Kukar T.L.

(2011) EMBO J., in press.Google Scholar) do not appear to show such specificity. Amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of APP and other substrates have been reported to regulate both γ and ϵ cleavage. Specifically, mutations at lysine 28 were shown to allow ϵ cleavage and ICD release to occur, whereas γ cleavage and Aβ production were abolished (20Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggest that amino acids in the JMD region of the substrate could influence proteolysis C-terminal to the JMD, in the center of the lipid bilayer. We became interested in this region of C99 because we have observed that two substrate-targeting GSM photoprobes (fenofibrate and flurbiprofen) bind and label this region (Fig. 1A). We focused on lysine 28 (relative to C99 and Aβ, Lys-624 relative to APP695) in particular because we have observed that Aβ42-lowering GSMs require a carboxylic acid for their activity and hypothesized that these compounds interacted with the positive charge of the lysine head group (16Kukar T.L. Ladd T.B. Bann M.A. Fraering P.C. Narlawar R. Maharvi G.M. Healy B. Chapman R. Welzel A.T. Price R.W. Moore B. Rangachari V. Cusack B. Eriksen J. Jansen-West K. Verbeeck C. Yager D. Eckman C. Ye W.

We now report that mutations at Lys-28 facilitate additional γ-cleavages of APP. Specifically, they enable the production of novel short Aβ-like peptides with truncated carboxyl termini. The implication of these results for the proteolytic mechanism of γ-secretase and GSMs will be discussed. Construction of the pcDNA3.1-C99GVP and C99 juxtamembrane chimeras construct has been described previously (20Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Point mutations within the luminal juxtamembrane domain (i.e. APP695-K28A, APP695-S26L, and APP695-K28S as well as C99GVP-G2S, C99GVP-S26L, C99GVP-N27S, and C99GVP-K28S) were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. The Aβ and Aβ-like peptides generated from C99GVP and various mutant substrates were numbered with reference to the first N-terminal residue (Asp-1) of the Aβ peptide. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the last 20 amino acids of APP (CT20) was produced in house and used to detect expression of full-length APP, C99, C83, and AICD fragments. FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Two ELISAs to detect Aβ were used and have been described previously (22Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. Khan K. Gordon M. Tan H. Games D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 23Kukar T.

Briefly, amyloid-β peptides were captured by C-terminal-specific antibodies for Aβ40 (antibody 40.1) or Aβ42 (antibody 42.2) that were coated on Immulon 4 HBX ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific) at 25 μg ml−1 in PBS. Captured amyloid-β was then detected by an HRP-conjugated antibody reactive to the N-terminal epitope 1–16 of amyloid-β (antibody 9). Total Aβ was captured on antibody 9 ELISA plates and detected with 4G8-HRP (Covance). HRP was detected using TMB (KPL). Alternatively, Aβ40 and Aβ 42 in samples were captured onto 2G3 or 21F12 antibody-coated plates, respectively, and detected with a biotinylated 2H3 antibody (specific to Aβ 4–7). The fluorescence signal generated from a streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche) was measured with a CytoFluor microplate reader (Applied Biosystems). Synthetic Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides (rPeptide, ultra pure, Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)) were used to generate standard curves. Measurements were done in duplicate or triplicate. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK 293T) cells or H4 neuroglioma cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (37 °C, 5% CO2). Endotoxin-free (Qiagen) cDNA plasmids were transfected into 6- or 12-well tissue culture plates (Costar) using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells and conditioned media were harvested 48 h posttransfection for analysis by ELISA or Western blot analysis. Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) was added to media and lysis buffers for cells. After media collection, transfected or stable cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed on ice with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitor (Roche) for 20 min and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), normalized, diluted as necessary, and mixed 1:4 in XT sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were loaded onto Criterion XT Bis-Tris gels (4–12 or 12%) and separated using MES running buffer. Proteins were transferred with a modified protocol to facilitate transfer and retention of small APP CTF/Aβ/AICD fragments as well as full-length APP (24Otter T. King S.M. Witman G.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred to either 0.2 μm nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) or PVDF (Millipore, PSQ) in Tris-glycine buffer with 20% methanol at 0.2 A for 30 min followed by 0.5 A for 60 min. Membranes were rinsed in water following transfer, and then submerged for 5 min in PBS that had been heated to boiling in a microwave to increase Aβ and AICD detection via epitope retrieval (25Rosen, R. F., Tomidokoro, Y., Ghiso, J. A., Walker, L. C. (2010) J. Vis. Exp. doi: 10.3791/1916.Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked over night in 0.5% casein-PBS. Blots were probed with appropriate antibodies (82E1 (Immuno-Biological Laboratories) for Aβ and C99; 6E10 (Covance) for APP, C99, and Aβ; and CT20 (Sigma) for APP, C83, C99, and AICD). Two different secondary strategies were used. Secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were visualized with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) or Supersignal West Femto (Pierce). Alternatively, secondary antibodies conjugated to near-infrared dyes (Alexa Fluor 680, Invitrogen; IR800, Licor) were visualized with the Licor Odyssey system. Secreted Aβ and Aβ-like peptides were analyzed using immunoprecipitation followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (IP/MS) by minor modification of the technique described previously (16Kukar T.L.

Aβ (1 to X) was immunoprecipitated from conditioned cell culture medium with antibody 9 (epitope Aβ 1–16) using sheep anti-mouse IgG magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen, catalog no. 112-01D). Synthetic β-amyloid (1–22) (Anaspec) was added as an immunoprecipitation control and mass standard. Proteins were eluted into 0.1% formic acid and 75% acetonitrile. Samples were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in methanol:acetonitrile:water (36:56:8%) and spotted on a ProteinChip Gold Array (Bio-Rad, catalog no. C55-30033). Samples were analyzed on a ProteinChip surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry PCS4000 (Bio-Rad). Typical settings were positive ion mode, laser power = 3000 nJ, 10 shots per position, calibrated using all-in-one peptide standard (Bio-Rad). Samples were analyzed in duplicate using separate spots. The same protocol was used to analyze AICD fragments (supplemental data), but IP was performed with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma, catalog no. M8823). The theoretical average molecular weights of amyloid-β, Aβ-like, and AICD fragments were calculated using the ExPASy Compute pI/Mw tool. γ-Secretase activity was assayed as described previously in detail. Briefly, cells overexpressing the APP of interest were grown in 5- to 15-cm cell culture dishes to confluence and then treated overnight with the reversible γ-secretase IL-CHO (20 μm) to increase C99 substrate concentration. Microsomal membrane fractions were prepared and resuspended in 150 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.8) for 2 h at 37 °C to induce γ-secretase activity. Samples were then analyzed by ELISA for Aβ production and IP/MS (Aβ or AICD) or standard Western blot analysis for total γ-secretase activity (ϵ cleavage and AICD production). Urea-SDS-PAGE was necessary to resolve AICD fragments (49–99 and 50–99) and was performed as described previously (27Kawooya J.K. Emmons T.L. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P.A. Camp M.C. D'Andrea S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We made a series of site-directed mutations at lysine 28 in APP and investigated their effects on Aβ production. Lysine was changed to alanine to remove the positive charge and replace it with a small, hydrophobic amino acid or glutamine, which is neutral but polar (29Morrison K.L. Weiss G.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These cDNA constructs were transfected into H4 neuroglioma cells, stable clones were isolated, and then the effect of these mutations on Aβ production was evaluated. Using sandwich ELISAs to measure Aβ levels, we observed typical levels and ratios of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 from the APP wild-type clone. However, the APP K28Q and K28A mutants produced low or no detectable Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. Both APP K28Q and K28A produced similar levels of total Aβ (1-X) compared with wild-type APP (Fig. 1B). We subsequently used immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP/MS) to examine the full spectrum of Aβ peptides produced by the mutations and determine whether they shifted the γ-secretase cleavage site (26Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast to APP WT, the major species produced by APP K28Q was Aβ 1–33, followed by 1–40 (Fig. 1B). Smaller amounts of 1–37, 1–38, 1–39, 1–34, and 1–32 were also detected in the media. The APP K28A mutation predominantly produced Aβ 1–33 followed by Aβ 1–34, but no longer Aβ fragments were detectable (Fig. 1C). We next examined how these mutations affected release of the AICD fragment by ϵ-cleavage (Fig. 1A). In vitro γ-secretase assays were performed using membrane-enriched fractions from cells stably overexpressing APP K28Q, APP K28A, and APP V717F as a positive control known to alter ϵ cleavage. Samples from these assays were run on denaturing SDS/urea PAGE to examine production of AICD and specific cleavage sites (27Kawooya J.K. Emmons T.L. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P.A. Camp M.C. D'Andrea S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). AICD 50–99 was the predominant cleavage fragment observed for both APP wild-type and K28A (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the familial Alzheimer's disease mutation APP V717F produced mainly AICD 49–99, followed by AICD 50–99, in agreement with previous reports (Fig. 1D) (28Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). AICD produced from membranes isolated from cells expressing a C-terminal FLAG-tagged C99 construct, with wild-type sequence or K28A, was analyzed via IP/MS. These data support the identification of 49–99 and 50–99 as the major AICD fragments as well as the observation that these mutations do not modulate the site of ϵ cleavage (supplemental Fig. 1). It has been reported previously that mutations in the JMD of APP could selectively abolish γ cleavage as assessed by Aβ production while maintaining ϵ cleavage on the basis of AICD production (20Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our current observation demonstrates that mutation of juxtamembrane lysine 28 shifts the site of γ cleavage rather than abolishing it. We therefore re-examined if the previous juxtamembrane mutations in APP had a similar effects on Aβ length. As shown previously, substitution of the JMD of APP C99 with the analogous region of other γ-secretase substrates produces hybrid substrates that are processed by γ-secretase and are cleaved at the ϵ site to produce AICD fragments (see Fig. 3A in Ref. 20Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C99-GVP-SREBP1 produces similar levels and ratios of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 compared with wild-type C99-GVP (Fig. 2B). In contrast, C99-GVP-Notch1 produces 6.5-fold less Aβ 1–40 than wild-type C99-GVP and no detectable Aβ 1–42. Both C99-GVP-APLP2 and C99-GVP-SLSS produce no detectable Aβ 1–40 or 1–42, despite equivalent expression levels determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Again, we used IP/MS to determine whether alternative γ cleavage sites were generated. IP/MS analysis of conditioned media from HEK293T cells transfected with C99-GVP-SREBP1 revealed Aβ 40 as the predominant species, similar to C99-GVP (Fig. 2C). For C99-GVP-Notch1, Aβ 37 was the major peptide detected. The C99-GVP-APLP2 construct produced even smaller Aβ species with Aβ 33 > Aβ 34 > Aβ 37 > Aβ 38, whereas C99-GVP-SLSS had the greatest shift in Aβ size. Aβ 33 was the major peak detected, but we also observed small amounts of Aβ 29 and Aβ 30, which are the smallest Aβ fragments we have observed. Taken together, these results explain why “normal” Aβ 40 and 42 fragments were not detected in the initial report, wherein the ELISA assay relied on capture of Aβ species ending at 40 or 42, followed by detection with an N-terminally-directed antibody. Substitution of amino acids in the JMD region of APP can dramatically shift the final cleavage site of γ-secretase and, consequently, the length of Aβ secreted. The dramatic shifts in Aβ observed with the C99-GVP-SLSS mutant highlight the importance the GSNK region play in the final site of γ-secretase cleavage (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). We next examined point mutations in GSNK to dissect the contribution of each residue to Aβ production. These constructs were transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells and produced levels of total Aβ (1-X) that were comparable with WT levels (GSNK sequence) and inhibited by treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Fig. 3). When Aβ X-40 levels were measured, three constructs were significantly decreased: GLNK, GSNS, and SLSS, consistent with our previous report (see Fig. 5, B and C in Ref. 20Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Levels of Aβ X-40 were decreased by 25% in the GLNK construct. For GSNS and SLSS, Aβ X-40 levels were decreased to a greater extent and were nearly undetectable (Fig. 3). This result suggests that mutation of S26L can also affect the length of Aβ but to a lesser extent than mutation of K28S.FIGURE 5Serine 26 influences Aβ size to a lesser extent than Lysine 28. Rescue experiments, analogous to the ones performed for C99-GVP Notch1 (Fig. 4), were carried out for C99-GVP-APLP2. A, Aβ33 and 34 are the major species produced from C99-GVP-APLP2 following IP/MS analysis. B, following mutation of S28K in C99-GVP-APLP2, Aβ37 and 40 now predominant, demonstrating a shift toward longer species. C, double mutation (L26S, S28K) of C99-GVP-APLP2 is necessary to completely shift cleavage toward Aβ40 as the major detectable species. Mass spectra show the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) on the x axis. The y axis is signal intensity (μA, arbitrary units).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If Lys-28 is a key determinant of the final cleavage site of Aβ, we should be able to reverse the shift in cleavage that we have observed in these hybrid constructs. To test this hypothesis, we mutated glutamine 28 in C99-GVP-Notch1 to lysine. Although Aβ 37 is the major Aβ species in C99-GVP-Notch1, mutation of Glu to Lys eliminates the production of shorter fragments, i.e. Aβ 33, and shifts cleavage back to Aβ 40, with levels comparable with the wild type (Fig. 4). Next, we made the same mutation (S28K) in C99-GVP-APLP2 and observed the appearance of Aβ 40 but not at wild-type levels (Fig. 5). Double mutation (L26S, S28K) of C99-GVP-APLP2 produced a substrate that was predominantly cleaved at Aβ 40. The regulation of γ-secretase cleavage at the γ and ϵ sites has been an intense area of investigation. Inhibition of γ-secretase cleavage of APP to reduce Aβ is being pursued as a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, it is now widely accepted that inhibition of ϵ cleavage, which reduces levels of ICDs, can have serious side effects resultin"

In this study we found that pretreatment with Dex potentiates calcitriol effects by inhibiting cell growth and increasing vitamin D receptor (VDR) and VDR-mediated transcription. Treatment with actinomycin D inhibits Vdr mRNA synthesis, indicating that Dex regulates VDR expression at transcriptional level. Real time PCR shows that treatment with Dex increases Vdr transcripts in a time- and a dose-dependent manner, indicating that Dex directly regulates expression of Vdr. RU486, an inhibitor of glucocorticoids, inhibits Dex-induced Vdr expression. In addition, the silencing of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) abolishes the induction of Vdr by Dex, indicating that Dex increases Vdr transcripts in a GR-dependent manner. A fragment located 5.2 kb upstream of Vdr transcription start site containing two putative glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) was evaluated using a luciferase-based reporter assay. Treatment with 100 nm Dex induces transcription of luciferase driven by the fragment. Deletion of the GRE distal to transcription start site was sufficient to abolish Dex induction of luciferase. Also, chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals recruitment of GR to distal GRE with Dex treatment. We conclude that Dex increases VDR and vitamin D effects by increasing Vdr de novo transcription in a GR-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2067190952,"Macrophages play an essential role in innate immunity. We found that mouse resident peritoneal macrophages (mRPMs) express the aquaglyceroporin aquaporin-3 (AQP3) in a plasma membrane pattern. AQP3-deficient (AQP3(-/-)) mice showed significantly greater mortality than wild-type (AQP3(+/+)) mice in a model of bacterial peritonitis. To establish the cellular mechanism of the peritonitis phenotype, measurements were made of mRPM phagocytosis, migration, and water/glycerol permeability. We found significantly impaired engulfment of Escherichia coli and chicken erythrocytes in AQP3(-/-) vs. AQP3(+/+) mRPMs, as well as impaired migration of AQP3(-/-) mRPMs in response to a chemotactic stimulus. In AQP3(+/+) mRPMs, AQP3 was polarized to pseudopodia at the leading edge during migration and around the phagocytic cup during engulfment. Water and glycerol permeabilities in mRPMs from AQP3(-/-) mice were reduced compared to mRPMs from AQP3(+/+) mice. Cellular glycerol and ATP content were remarkably lower in AQP3(-/-) vs. AQP3(+/+) mRPMs, and glycerol supplementation partially rescued the reduced ATP content and impaired function of AQP3(-/-) mRPMs. These data implicate AQP3 as a novel determinant in macrophage immune function by a cellular mechanism involving facilitated water and glycerol transport, and consequent phagocytic and migration activity. This is the first study demonstrating involvement of an aquaporin in innate immunity. Our results suggest AQP3 as a novel therapeutic target in modulating the immune response in various infectious and inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2005988933,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major nosocomial pathogen that infects cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. The impermeability of the P. aeruginosa outer membrane contributes substantially to the notorious antibiotic resistance of this human pathogen. This impermeability is partially imparted by the outer membrane protein H (OprH). Here we have solved the structure of OprH in a lipid environment by solution NMR. The structure reveals an eight-stranded β-barrel protein with four extracellular loops of unequal size. Fast time-scale dynamics measurements show that the extracellular loops are disordered and unstructured. It was previously suggested that the function of OprH is to provide increased stability to the outer membranes of P. aeruginosa by directly interacting with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules. Using in vivo and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that OprH indeed interacts with LPS in P. aeruginosa outer membranes. Based upon NMR chemical shift perturbations observed upon the addition of LPS to OprH in lipid micelles, we conclude that the interaction is predominantly electrostatic and localized to charged regions near both rims of the barrel, but also through two conspicuous tyrosines in the middle of the bilayer. These results provide the first molecular structure of OprH and offer evidence for multiple interactions between OprH and LPS that likely contribute to the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2145694460,"The transcription factor neural retina leucine zipper (Nrl) is a critical determinant of rod photoreceptor cell fate and a key regulator of rod differentiation. Nrl(-/-) rod precursors fail to turn on rod genes and instead differentiate as cones. Furthermore, NRL mutations in humans cause retinitis pigmentosa. Despite the developmental and clinical significance of this gene, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of Nrl itself. In this study, we sought to define the cis- and trans-acting factors responsible for initiation and maintenance of Nrl transcription in the mouse retina. Utilizing a quantitative mouse retinal explant electroporation assay, we discovered a phylogenetically conserved, 30-base pair region immediately upstream of the transcription start site that is required for Nrl promoter activity. This region contains binding sites for the retinal transcription factors CRX, OTX2, and RORβ, and point mutations in these sites completely abolish promoter activity in living retinas. Gel-shift experiments show that CRX, OTX2, and RORβ can bind to the critical region in vitro, whereas ChIP experiments demonstrate binding of CRX and OTX2 to the critical region in vivo. Thus, our results indicate that CRX, OTX2, and RORβ directly regulate Nrl transcription by binding to critical sites within the Nrl promoter. We propose a model in which Nrl expression is primarily initiated by OTX2 and RORβ and later maintained at high levels by CRX and RORβ."
https://openalex.org/W2012297885,"When grown in green light, Fremyella diplosiphon strain UTEX 481 produces the red-colored protein phycoerythrin (PE) to maximize photosynthetic light harvesting. PE is composed of two subunits, CpeA and CpeB, which carry two and three phycoerythrobilin (PEB) chromophores, respectively, that are attached to specific Cys residues via thioether linkages. Specific bilin lyases are hypothesized to catalyze each PEB ligation. Using a heterologous, coexpression system in Escherichia coli, the PEB ligation activities of putative lyase subunits CpeY, CpeZ, and CpeS were tested on the CpeA and CpeB subunits from F. diplosiphon. Purified His(6)-tagged CpeA, obtained by coexpressing cpeA, cpeYZ, and the genes for PEB synthesis, had absorbance and fluorescence emission maxima at 566 and 574 nm, respectively. CpeY alone, but not CpeZ, could ligate PEB to CpeA, but the yield of CpeA-PEB was lower than achieved with CpeY and CpeZ together. Studies with site-specific variants of CpeA(C82S and C139S), together with mass spectrometric analysis of trypsin-digested CpeA-PEB, revealed that CpeY/CpeZ attached PEB at Cys(82) of CpeA. The CpeS bilin lyase ligated PEB at both Cys(82) and Cys(139) of CpeA but very inefficiently; the yield of PEB ligated at Cys(82) was much lower than observed with CpeY or CpeY/CpeZ. However, CpeS efficiently attached PEB to Cys(80) of CpeB but neither CpeY, CpeZ, nor CpeY/CpeZ could ligate PEB to CpeB."

https://openalex.org/W2080617827,"Orai1, the pore subunit of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channels, has four transmembrane segments (TMs). The first segment, TMI, lines the pore and plays an important role in channel activation and ion permeation. TMIII, on the other hand, does not line the pore but still regulates channel gating and permeation properties. To understand the role of TMIII, we have mutated and characterized several residues in this domain. Mutation of Trp-176 to Cys (W176C) and Gly-183 to Ala (G183A) had dramatic effects. Unlike wild-type channels, which exhibit little outward current and are activated by STIM1, W176C mutant channels exhibited a large outward current at positive potentials and were constitutively active in the absence of STIM1. G183A mutant channels also exhibited substantial outward currents but were active only in the presence of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), irrespective of STIM1. With W176C mutant channels inward, monovalent currents were blocked by Ca(2+) with a high affinity similar to the wild type, but the Ca(2+)-dependent blocking of outward currents differed in the two cases. Although a 50% block of the WT outward current required 250 μm Ca(2+), more than 6 mm was necessary to have the same effect on W176C mutant channels. In the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), W176C and G183A outward currents developed slowly in a voltage-dependent manner, whereas they developed almost instantaneously in the absence of Ca(2+). These changes in permeation and gating properties mimic the changes induced by mutations of Glu-190 in TMIII and Asp-110/Asp-112 in the TMI/TMII loop. On the basis of these data, we propose that TMIII maintains negatively charged residues at or near the selectivity filter in a conformation that facilitates Ca(2+) inward currents and prevents outward currents of monovalent cations. In addition, to controlling selectivity, TMIII may also stabilize channel gating in a closed state in the absence of STIM1 in a Trp-176-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2002231317,"Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, results in part from the accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the arterial wall and formation of lipid-laden macrophages, known as “foam cells.” Recently, we reported that CD36, a scavenger receptor, contributes to activation of Vav-family guanine nucleotide exchange factors by oxidatively modified LDL in macrophages. We also discovered that CD36-dependent uptake of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in vitro and foam cell formation in vitro and in vivo was significantly reduced in macrophages deficient of Vav proteins. The goal of the present study was to identify the mechanisms by which Vav proteins regulate CD36-dependent foam cell formation. We now show that a Vav-dynamin signaling axis plays a critical role in generating calcium signals in mouse macrophages exposed to CD36-specific oxidized phospholipid ligands. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ or inhibition of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) inhibited Vav activation (85 and 70%, respectively, compared with vehicle control) and reduced foam cell formation (approximately 75%).

Among the three structurally and functionally related members of the Vav family, Vav1 is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas Vav2 and Vav3 are ubiquitously expressed. Vav proteins have been linked to calcium responses via PLC-γ activation in many cell types (8Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Manetz T.S.

It has also been reported that during T cell activation dynamin, a large GTPase, interacts with Vav1 and regulates PLCγ1 activation and Ca2+ mobilization (28Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 29Gomez T.S. Hamann M.J. McCarney S. Savoy D.N. Lubking C.M. Heldebrant M.P. Labno C.M. McKean D.J. McNiven M.A. Burkhardt J.K.

Considerable evidence suggests that Ca2+ can increase endocytic vesicle size, accelerate membrane fission, and regulate endocytic membrane retrieval (30MacDonald P.E. Eliasson L. Rorsman P. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5911-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These calcium-dependent processes may be critical during endocytosis of oxLDL, an early event in foam cell formation. Given that dynamin plays a critical role in endocytosis, it is rational to hypothesize that activation of a Vav-dynamin pathway can regulate foam cell formation via Ca2+-dependent process. We now show that Vav plays an important role in activation of dynamin 2 and generation of calcium signaling in macrophages activated by CD36-specific oxidized phospholipid ligands. Mechanistically we show that dynamin-2 is essential for CD36-mediated foam cell formation, co-localizes with Vav1 and internalized oxLDL in macrophages, and mediates endocytosis of oxLDL-containing vesicles. Antibodies to PLCγ1 and its phosphorylated form were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to actin, Vav1, and Vav2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-dynamin2 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-mouse CD36 antibody was from Dr. Huy Ong (University of Montreal, Canada). Anti-p-tyrosine clone 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). KOdiA-PC (1-(palmitoyl)-2-(5-keto-6-octenedioyl) phosphatidylcholine) was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). LDL was isolated from fresh human plasma as described previously and stored under N2 gas until use. All LDL concentrations were expressed in terms of protein content as measured by Lowry assay. LDL oxidized by the leukocyte myeloperoxidase/nitrite system (NO2LDL) was prepared as described previously (2Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D. Silverstein R.L. Hajjar D.P. Cohen P.A. Frazier W.A. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). As controls for NO2LDL, the LDL particles were incubated with the system in the absence of nitrite (-NO2LDL). DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine iodide) and fura-2/AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and U73122, TFP (trifluoperazine), ionomycin, BAPTA/AM (O,O'-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethylene glycol-N,N, N',N'-tetraacetic acid/tetraacetomethyl ester) and dynasore were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The SMARTpool siRNA for mouse dynamin 2 and the non-targeted control siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon (Pittsburgh, PA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless indicated. cd36, apoe, lyn, and fyn null mice and vav1;vav3 double-null mice were described previously. vav1 null mice were provided by Dr. J. Rivera (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Mice were backcrossed at least six times to C57Bl/6 and background matched WT control lines were used in all studies. Thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) were isolated and maintained as described previously (5Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were derived from mouse bone marrow cells maintained in presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 6–10 days. MPM were pretreated with inhibitors or vehicle for 30 min and then incubated with DiI-NO2LDL (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C to assess binding. Fluorescence intensity was examined by confocal or epifluorescence microscopy. To examine internalization, cells were then warmed to 37 °C and imaged at timed points up to 30 min. MPM harvested from cd36 null mice were used to assess nonspecific binding. TG-elicited MPM from various strains were plated on coverslips in RPMI 1640 medium supplied with 10% FCS. After removing non-adherent cells, fresh medium was added and cells were maintained for 48h. MPM were then incubated with 50 μg/ml of NO2LDL for 8 h in the presence or absence of various inhibitors in the same media. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, stained with Oil-Red-O, and foam cells were counted by microscopy. For the in vivo assays, TG-elicited MPM were collected from donor mice and 107 cells were then injected intraperitoneally into each recipient apoe null mouse maintained on a diet containing 0.15% cholesterol and 42% milk fat (TD88137, Harlan-Teklad) for 6 weeks. After 3 days, recipient mice were lavaged and cells analyzed as above by Oil-Red-O staining. For IP studies, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptide. The cleared supernatant containing 300–500 μg protein was incubated with 2–3 μg of antibody immobilized on agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were extensively washed in the same buffer and then boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for subsequent IB. For CD36, coIP assays cells were treated with DSP (dithiobis-succinimidylpropionate) before harvesting in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPS. Lysates were subject to IP using monoclonal anti-CD36 IgA and protein L-agarose. IBs were analyzed with a chemiluminescence detection system. At day 6 of culture, BMDM were transfected with siRNA oligos using Accell siRNA delivery media according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dharmacon). After 72 h, cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis to examine knockdown efficacy and specificity. Cells (2 × 106/ml) were loaded with 4 μm fura-2/AM in Hanks' balanced salt solution (with or without Ca2+) for 60 min at 37 °C and then washed three times and diluted to 106/ml. Fluorescence was continuously monitored with a spectrophotometer with constant stirring using excitation at 340 and 380 nm and detecting emission at 510 nm. The ratio of 340/380 nm fluorescence was used to calculate intracellular Ca2+ concentration. MPM were seeded on glass coverslips in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS. After incubation with DiI-NO2LDL (5 μg/ml) for timed points at 37 °C cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and incubated with primary antibodies. Alexa Fluor-coupled secondary antibodies were then applied and cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Because intracellular calcium flux (8Bustelo X.R.

Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have been shown to participate in Vav activation in other systems, we examined the effect of selective pharmacologic inhibitors of these processes on CD36-mediated macrophage Vav activation. MPM pretreated with BAPTA/AM to chelate intracellular calcium, methyl-β-cyclodextrin to disrupt lipid rafts, cytochalasin-D to inhibit actin polymerization, or sodium orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases were exposed to NO2LDL (a highly specific ligand for CD36), and Vav phosphorylation was assayed by IP/IB. Cell viability measured by trypan blue exclusion was greater than 95% in all studies (data not shown). As shown in the representative blot in Fig. 1, Vav1 and Vav2 activation were blocked more than 85% by chelating intracellular calcium, whereas the other inhibitors had no effect. These data are consistent with previous reports that oxLDL can induce Ca2+ flux in leukocytes (32van Tits L.J. Hak-Lemmers H.L. Demacker P.N. Stalenhoef A.F. Willems P.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because PLC-γ plays a critical role in intracellular calcium signaling, we next demonstrated by IB with an antibody specific to phospho-PLC-γ1 (Fig. 2A) that NO2LDL induced a time-dependent increase in PLC-γ1 phosphorylation in MPM with a 3-fold increase seen at 30 min compared with the untreated control (0′ min). No increases were seen in MPM isolated from vav1;vav3 double-null mice, showing that PLC-γ1 activation by oxLDL was Vav-dependent. Using specific pharmacologic inhibitors, we found that inhibition of PLC-γ1 by U73122 decreased CD36-mediated Vav phosphorylation by 70% (Fig. 2B), whereas TFP, a calmodulin inhibitor, or ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, had no effect, suggesting a reciprocal oxLDL-CD36-mediated activating mechanism involving Vav and PLC-γ1. Interestingly, neither PLC-γ1 nor Vav1 were coprecipitated with anti-CD36 antibody from MPM (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the role of CD36 was indirect. To test the hypothesis that Vavs mediate macrophage Ca2+ flux generated by CD36-oxLDL interactions, Fura2-AM loaded MPM were monitored by recording continuous fluorescence for 200–300 s after addition of CD36-specific oxidized phospholipid KOdiA-PC. To assess the roles of Vavs in this process, we compared Ca2+ flux in WT, vav1 null, and vav1;vav3 double-null MPM in response to KOdiA-PC. Basal levels of intracellular Ca2+ were similar in all of the cells (not shown) but although an increase in intracellular Ca2+ was seen in WT cells (Fig. 3A), vav1;vav3 double-null cells showed approximately 50% less Ca2+ flux based on measured areas under the curve. Vav1 null-cells showed a reduction in the early rapid rise, but the overall area under the curve was similar to the WT (Fig. 3A) perhaps because of compensation by Vav3. Because Vav activation by CD36 is regulated by Src family kinases (SFKs) (7Rahaman S.O. Swat W. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7010-7017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and because Ca2+ flux generation is an early event after oxPL-CD36 engagement, we also examined Ca2+ responses in MPM from lyn and fyn null mice. Fig. 3B shows that the KOdiA-PC-induced Ca2+ flux was moderately decreased in fyn- and lyn null cells compared with WT. Pretreatment of WT cells with KOdiA-PC before addition of CaCl2 caused a marked increase in Ca2+ flux generation, possibly because of both internal and external sources of calcium. As shown in Fig. 3B (inset), in the absence of any external calcium source, a small but detectable rise of calcium flux by KOdiA-PC from intracellular stores was observed in WT cells, which supports this conclusion. Therefore, the robust increase in Ca2+ flux (Fig. 3B) after addition of CaCl2 in KOdiA-PC-pretreated cells is attributed to both external and internal sources of calcium. Together, these data show that Vav activation, presumably via SFKs, may be involved in Ca2+ signaling by oxLDL-CD36 engagement in macrophages. We also evaluated the role of dynamin, a Vav-interacting large GTPase known to regulate intracellular vesicle fission, in CD36-mediated Ca2+ flux generation. Dynasore, a specific dynamin GTPase inhibitor, markedly impaired the increase in intracellular Ca2+ induced by KOdiA-PC (Fig. 3C), suggesting that endocytic or phagocytic vesicle fission may be a source of Ca2+. To further examine the source of the increase in Ca2+ flux we used EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium and BAPTA/AM to chelate intracellular calcium and found that BAPTA/AM completely inhibited the rise in intracellular Ca2+, whereas EGTA inhibited it partially (Fig. 3D), suggesting that both intracellular and extracellular sources are responsible for CD36-generated Ca2+ flux. In the presence of EGTA, release of calcium from internal storage by addition of KOdiA-PC may have contributed to the observed rise in calcium flux. Altogether, these studies suggest a novel Ca2+-dependent positive feedback regulatory mechanism for activation of Vavs in macrophages. OxLDL-CD36 signaling induces Ca2+ flux via a SFK-Vav-PLCγ1 pathway, which is also essential for activation of Vavs by oxLDL. To address the pathophysiological importance of Ca2+ signaling in macrophages, we examined the binding and uptake of oxLDL by MPM treated with BAPTA/AM using NO2LDL tagged with the fluorophore DiI. Equivalent binding was observed to both treated and untreated cells, but the uptake was nearly completely disrupted in cells treated with the BAPTA (Fig. 4A). U73122, a pharmacologic inhibitor of PLC-γ1, also severely disrupted the uptake of NO2LDL without impacting binding (Fig. 4B), suggesting the possible involvement of PLC-γ1 activity in this process. Because Ca2+-dependent association of calmodulin (CaM) with the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor can regulate calcium release from intracellular stores (33Kasri N.N. Török K. Galione A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8332-8338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and because the calponin homology domain of Vav1 has been shown to interact with CaM in T cells (17Zhou Z. Yin J. Dou Z. Tang J. Zhang C. Cao Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23737-23744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we also assessed uptake and binding of NO2LDL in the presence of TFP, a specific CaM inhibitor (Fig. 4B). A similar pattern of NO2LDL binding and internalization was seen in vehicle and TFP-treated cells, suggesting a non-CaM-dependent mechanism involved in this process. Experiments were also performed by incubating cells with DiI-NO2LDL for 30 min at 4 °C to allow surface binding and then transferring to 37 °C to measure uptake at timed points to 30 min. As before, no significant differences in binding were seen but uptake was severely impaired throughout the 30-min warm phase in BAPTA/AM-treated cells (Fig. 4C). We next assessed the role of calcium signaling in macrophage transformation into foam cells. NO2LDL-induced foam cell formation was quantified by microscopy after Oil-Red-O staining of cells treated with BAPTA/AM, U73122, or TFP. Fig. 4D shows that intracellular calcium chelation or inhibition of PLC-γ1 activity caused up to 80% reduction in foam cell formation whereas inhibition of CaM activity had no significant effect. To examine the in vivo role of Ca2+ flux and Src kinase Lyn (which moderately regulates Ca2+ flux generation by oxLDL) in macrophage foam cell formation we used an in vivo foam cell assay involving transfer of BAPTA/AM-pretreated or lyn null MPM into the peritoneal cavities of hyperlipidemic, Western diet-fed, apoe null recipients. After 72 h, cells were recovered from the peritoneal cavities, and foam cells were quantified by Oil Red O staining. Results showed that in vivo foam cell formation was significantly impaired in both BAPTA-pretreated and lyn null macrophages (Fig. 5), suggesting a critical role of calcium signaling and Lyn kinase in this process. The Vav-binding mechanochemical enzyme dynamin is critically involved in fission of endosomes from the cell membrane during endocytosis and hence in receptor-mediated uptake of numerous ligands (28Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Because of the defect in oxLDL-containing endocytic vesicle formation/maturation seen in vav null cells (7Rahaman S.O. Swat W. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7010-7017A"

Cytoplasmic retention of PKCδ and its transport into the nucleus are essential for cell homeostasis, but how these processes are regulated is poorly understood. We show that PKCδ resides in the cytoplasm in a conformation that precludes binding of importin-α. A structural model of PKCδ in the inactive state suggests that the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) is prevented from binding to importin-α through intramolecular contacts between the C2 and catalytic domains. We have previously shown that PKCδ is phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues in response to apoptotic agents. Here, we show that phosphorylation of PKCδ at Tyr-64 and Tyr-155 results in a conformational change that allows exposure of the NLS and binding of importin-α. In addition, Hsp90 binds to PKCδ with similar kinetics as importin-α and is required for the interaction of importin-α with the NLS. Finally, we elucidate a role for a conserved PPxxP motif, which overlaps the NLS, in nuclear exclusion of PKCδ. Mutagenesis of the conserved prolines to alanines enhanced importin-α binding to PKCδ and induced its nuclear import in resting cells. Thus, the PPxxP motif is important for maintaining a conformation that facilitates cytosplasmic retention of PKCδ.

Mice deficient for PKCδ (δKO) develop normally, but with age develop systemic autoimmune disease associated with hyperproliferation of B cells, suggesting that PKCδ is important for the establishment of B-cell tolerance (2Miyamoto A.

In addition, studies in δKO mice show that loss of PKCδ protects against γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PKCδ is required for proper induction of apoptosis in epithelial cells (9Humphries M.J.

Furthermore, we have recently shown that PKCδ promotes proliferation and functions as a tumor promoter in lung cancer. The tumor promoter activity of PKCδ appears to be largely due to its ability to regulate survival signaling pathways (17Symonds J.M. Ohm A.M. Carter C.J. Heasley L.E. Boyle T.A. Franklin W.A. Reyland M.E. Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ability of PKCδ to regulate such diverse cellular functions as apoptosis and proliferation is dictated in part by tight regulation of its subcellular localization (18Rosse C. Linch M.

Inappropriate targeting of PKCδ is associated with tumor progression in bladder and endometrial cancer and with the development of autoimmune disease in mouse models (21Reno E.M. Haughian J.M.

Nature. 2004; 431: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PKCδ translocates to the nucleus in response to apoptotic signals, and that nuclear accumulation of PKCδ is necessary and sufficient for induction of apoptosis (23DeVries T.A.

Proteins that are >40 kDa must be actively transported through the nuclear pore complex. Most protein transport through the nuclear pore complex is facilitated through binding of importins to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) 3The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization sequenceWCLwhole cell lysate17-AAG17-allylamino-demethoxy geldanamycin. found on cargo proteins (25Feldherr C. Akin D. Littlewood T. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our lab has previously identified a bipartite NLS in the catalytic domain of PKCδ, and we have shown that mutations of specific residues in this NLS abolish the nuclear localization of PKCδ in response to apoptotic signals (23DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, in resting cells, PKCδ is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that additional regulatory steps may be involved in mediating nuclear import of this kinase. Notably, tyrosine phosphorylation at specific residues in the regulatory domain of PKCδ, and caspase cleavage of PKCδ in the hinge region are permissive for nuclear import, suggesting that the regulatory domain of PKCδ plays a role in its cytoplasmic retention (9Humphries M.J.

How these events are coordinated to facilitate nuclear import of PKCδ in response to apoptotic signals is not known. In the current studies, we show that translocation of PKCδ from the cytoplasm into the nucleus is regulated by access of importin-α to the NLS.

ParC5 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with the indicated DNA constructs. 18 h following transfection, cells were either left untreated or were treated with 5 mm H2O2 (Sigma, H1009) for 1 h. Immediately following treatment, cells were rinsed once with PBS and were air-dried. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min followed by three 15-min washes with PBS. Coverslips containing fixed cells were mounted on slides using Vectashield with DAPI mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, H-1200). Subcellular localization of GFP-PKCδ proteins was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Nuclear localization was quantified as the number of cells with predominantly nuclear localized GFP over the total number of GFP positive cells per field. More than 250 cells were counted for each variable per experiment. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated DNA constructs. 18 h following transfection cells were harvested, and whole cell lysate (WCL) or nuclear fractions were prepared. Nuclear fractions were isolated using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVision, Inc., K266-100) according to the manufacturer's protocol except that Triton X-100 was added to the nuclear extraction buffer at a final concentration of 1%. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, 500-0111). Nuclear fractions and WCL were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed with the following antibodies: anti-GFP (Invitrogen, 33-2600); anti-human PKCδ C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-937); and anti-lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6217). 293T or ParC5 cells were transfected with the indicated pGFP-PKCδ constructs. 18 h following transfection, cells were either left untreated or were treated with 1 mm H2O2, 5 mm H2O2 or 200 μm etoposide (Sigma, E1383) as indicated. For some experiments, cells were treated with 1 μm 17-AAG (A.G. Scientific, Inc, A-1298) for 3 h, or 10 μm Celastrol (Cayman Chemical, 70950) for 30 min. Immediately following treatment, cells were lysed with buffer A ((50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, 11697498001), and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science, 04906837001)). Total protein (0.5 mg) was mixed with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab290) for 3 h at 4 °C and an additional 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma, P6649). The immunocomplexes were then subjected to five 5-min washes with buffer A before they were separated by SDS-PAGE. The immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies: anti-importin-α (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610486); anti-Hsp90 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610419) 4G10 pan anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Millipore, 16-316), δanti-phospho-PKCδ (Tyr-64) (Assay Biotech), anti-phospho-PKCδ (Tyr-155) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-23770-R). Approximately 1% of the immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen, 33-2600). 10 μg of WCL was separated on SDS-PAGE, and the immunoblots were probed with anti-importin-α or anti-Hsp90 antibodies. Densitometric analysis was performed using Launch VisionWorksLS analysis software. ParC5 or COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. 18 h following transfection cells were either left untreated or were treated with 5 mm H2O2 for 30 min. Cells were lysed with JNK lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, 11697498001), and 1× phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science, 04906837001)). The GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above, and the immunocomplexes were washed at least three times with JNK lysis buffer. Kinase assays were performed using the PepTag® Non-Radioactive Protein Kinase C assay system (Promega Corp., V5330), following the manufacturer's protocol, except no lipid activator was added. Kinase activity was calculated as the phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated substrate ratio, normalized to the amount of GFP-tagged protein that was immunoprecipitated, and expressed as relative units. Primary mouse parotid cells were transduced with the indicated adenoviruses as described previously (27Humphries M.J. Ohm A.M. Schaack J. Adwan T.S. Reyland M.E. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection TMR Red kit (Roche Applied Science, 12156792910) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were stained with 5 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma, D9564) to visualize the nucleus. Cells expressing the GFP fusion proteins were visualized by immunofluorescent microscopy and counted using a 40× objective. For cells expressing GFP-PKCδ proteins, GFP-positive, TUNEL-positive (TMR Red fluor) cells exhibiting chromatin condensation were scored as apoptotic; > 400 cells were counted for each variable per experiment. For cells not expressing GFP-PKCδ proteins, TUNEL-positive (TMR Red fluor) cells exhibiting chromatin condensation were scored as apoptotic. Work from our lab and others have shown that PKCδ translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to apoptotic stimuli such as etoposide (23DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E.

In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, ParC5 cells were transfected with pGFP-WT-PKCδ and treated with H2O2 for the indicated times. H2O2 induced nuclear import of PKCδ as early as 5 min following treatment, with maximal accumulation in the nucleus at 15 min. Endogenous PKCδ translocated into the nucleus with identical kinetics as that of the ectopically expressed protein (Fig. 1A). PKCδ was imported into the nucleus with similar kinetics in 293T cells transfected with pGFP-WT-PKCδ and treated with H2O2 (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1B shows fluorescent imaging of nuclear PKCδ in ParC5 cells transfected with pGFP-WT-PKCδ and treated with H2O2. Transport through the nuclear pore complex is mediated by a family of nuclear transport receptors that recognize and bind to the NLS on cargo proteins, the most common of which are members of the importin family (25Feldherr C.

In resting cells, PKCδ could be retained in the cytoplasm bound to importin-α awaiting an apoptotic signal, or the interaction of PKCδ with importin-α could be induced by apoptotic signals. To address these possibilities, we analyzed the association of PKCδ and importin-α by co-immunoprecipitation in cells treated with H2O2 or etoposide. As shown in Fig. 1D, a small amount of PKCδ associates with importin-α in untreated cells, consistent with the basal level of PKCδ typically found in the nucleus under resting conditions (Fig. 1A). However, the association of importin-α with PKCδ dramatically increased as early as 5 min after treatment with H2O2, similar to the kinetics of nuclear import of PKCδ seen in Fig. 1A. Regulated association of importin-α with PKCδ also occurs in response to etoposide and was maximal at ∼15 min post-treatment (Fig. 1E). Interaction of importin-α with PKCδ occurred prior to etoposide induced nuclear import of PKCδ, which we have previously reported to be detectable at ∼30 min following treatment with etoposide (24DeVries-Seimon T.A. Ohm A.M. Humphries M.J. Reyland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As the association kinetics of PKCδ and importin-α in response to both agents closely parallels the nuclear import kinetics of PKCδ, this suggests that importin-α binding is rate-limiting for nuclear import. The observation that H2O2 and etoposide induce binding of PKCδ to importin-α suggests that regulated exposure of the NLS controls nuclear import. Our laboratory and others have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to various stimuli regulates its subcellular localization as well as other aspects of its function (9Humphries M.J.

To explore a potential role for tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating binding of importin-α to PKCδ in response to H2O2, we first examined the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to H2O2 using a pan phospho-tyrosine antibody (4G10). As shown in Fig. 2A, upper panels, total tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ is detected as early as 5 min post-treatment, following similar kinetics as that of importin-α binding to PKCδ (Fig. 1D). We have previously shown that phosphorylation at Tyr-64 and Tyr-155 in the regulatory domain of PKCδ is required for its nuclear import, and in turn apoptosis, in response to etoposide treatment (27Humphries M.J. Ohm A.M. Schaack J. Adwan T.S. Reyland M.E. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2A, lower panels, we show that the kinetics of phosphorylation of PKCδ at these residues parallels total tyrosine phosphorylation as detected with the pan-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Fig. 2A, upper panels). To confirm that Tyr-64 and Tyr-155 are the major sites for tyrosine phosphorylation in response to H2O2, we transfected ParC5 cells with pGFP-WT-PKCδ (WT), or mutants of PKCδ in which the tyrosine residues at amino acid 64 and 155 were mutated to phenylalanine: Y64F, Y155F, and Y64F/Y155F. As predicted, H2O2 treatment for 10 min resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild type PKCδ (Fig. 2B). However, the PKCδ Y64F and Y155F mutants exhibited a dramatic reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation that was nearly undetectable in the Y64F, Y155F, and Y64F/Y155F mutants (Fig. 2B), confirming that these residues are the major phosphorylation tyrosine sites in response to H2O2. In addition, we show that these residues are required for H2O2-induced apoptosis, as PKCδ mutated at Y64F, and the Y64F/Y155F mutants failed to reconstitute H2O2 induced apoptosis in primary salivary cells isolated from δKO mice (Fig. 2C). Our previous finding that a Y64D/Y155D phosphomimetic mutant of PKCδ accumulates in the nucleus in the absence of an apoptotic signal, suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation is sufficient to relieve the constraint on importin-α binding to the PKCδ NLS (27Humphries M.J. Ohm A.M. Schaack J. Adwan T.S. Reyland M.E. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation at Tyr-64 and Tyr-155 is sufficient for importin-α binding, 293T cells were transfected with pGFP-WT-PKCδ (WT) or pGFP-Y64D/Y155D-PKCδ, and binding of PKCδ to importin-α was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. As predicted, the GFP-Y64D/Y155D-PKCδ mutant had an increased ability to bind importin-α as compared with wild type PKCδ (Fig. 2D), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulatory domain of PKCδ is sufficient for importin-α binding. To explore the mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the interaction of PKCδ with importin-α, we examined a model of PKCδ in the inactive or “closed” conformation (Fig. 3A). This model is based on previous structural studies of inactive PKCδ (41Solodukhin A.S. Kretsinger R.H. Sando J.J. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 2035-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In reconstructing this model, we used the crystal structure of the C2-domain of PKCδ (41Solodukhin A.S. Kretsinger R.H. Sando J.J. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 2035-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and the catalytic domain of PKCβII (42Leonard T.A. Róycki B. Saidi L.F. Hummer G. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2011; 144: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which shares substantial structural homology with PKCδ. In the closed conformation, the C2-domain is folded back upon the catalytic domain and is predicted to make extensive contacts with the region that contains the NLS. This model predicts that contacts between the NLS and the C2-domain limit access of importin-α to the NLS. Therefore, to allow for importin-α binding to the NLS, PKCδ must first undergo a conformational change to expose the NLS. We predict that the addition of a negative charge imparted by phosphorylation at Tyr-64 and Tyr-155 facilitates a conformational change in the kinase such that the contacts between the C2 and the catalytic domains are disrupted, leading to exposure of the NLS. PKC activity in vitro in the absence of exogenous lipid is indicative of a conformation of the kinase in which the regulatory domain constraints on the catalytic domain are relieved, resulting in an active and “open” conformation of the kinase (37Konishi H.

https://openalex.org/W2025335702,"Previous studies have suggested that there are two signaling pathways leading from ligation of the Fas receptor to induction of apoptosis. Type I signaling involves Fas ligand-induced recruitment of large amounts of FADD (FAS-associated death domain protein) and procaspase 8, leading to direct activation of caspase 3, whereas type II signaling involves Bid-mediated mitochondrial perturbation to amplify a more modest death receptor-initiated signal. The biochemical basis for this dichotomy has previously been unclear. Here we show that type I cells have a longer half-life for Fas message and express higher amounts of cell surface Fas, explaining the increased recruitment of FADD and subsequent signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate that cells with type II Fas signaling (Jurkat or HCT-15) can signal through a type I pathway upon forced receptor overexpression and that shRNA-mediated Fas down-regulation converts cells with type I signaling (A498) to type II signaling. Importantly, the same cells can exhibit type I signaling for Fas and type II signaling for TRAIL (TNF-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), indicating that the choice of signaling pathway is related to the specific receptor, not some other cellular feature. Additional experiments revealed that up-regulation of cell surface death receptor 5 levels by treatment with 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin converted TRAIL signaling in HCT116 cells from type II to type I. Collectively, these results suggest that the type I/type II dichotomy reflects differences in cell surface death receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1992189637,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand cell surface receptor involved in various human diseases, as it binds to numerous molecules and proteins that modulate the activity of other proteins. Elucidating the three-dimensional structure of this receptor is therefore most important for understanding its function during activation and cellular signaling. The major alternative splice product of RAGE comprises its extracellular region that occurs as a soluble protein (sRAGE). Although the structures of sRAGE domains were available, their assembly into the functional full-length protein remained unknown. We observed that the protein has concentration-dependent oligomerization behavior, and this is also mediated by the presence of Ca(2+) ions. Moreover, using synchrotron small angle x-ray scattering, the solution structure of human sRAGE was determined in the monomeric and dimeric forms. The model for the monomer displays a J-like shape, whereas the dimer is formed through the association of the two N-terminal domains and has an elongated structure. These results provide insights into the assembly of the RAGE homodimer, which is essential for signal transduction, and the sRAGE:RAGE heterodimer that leads to blockage of the receptor signaling, paving the way for the design of therapeutic strategies for a large number of different pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2066918407,"Type 1 interferons (including IFNα/β) activate their cell surface receptor to induce the intracellular signal transduction pathways that play an important role in host defenses against infectious agents and tumors. The extent of cellular responses to IFNα is limited by several important mechanisms including the ligand-stimulated and specific serine phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the IFNAR1 chain of Type 1 IFN receptor. Previous studies revealed that acceleration of IFNAR1 degradation upon IFN stimulation requires activities of tyrosine kinase TYK2 and serine/threonine protein kinase D2 (PKD2), whose recruitment to IFNAR1 is also induced by the ligand. Here we report that activation of PKD2 by IFNα (but not its recruitment to the receptor) depends on TYK2 catalytic activity. PKD2 undergoes IFNα-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation on specific phospho-acceptor site (Tyr-438) within the plekstrin homology domain. Activated TYK2 is capable of facilitating this phosphorylation in vitro. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2 is required for IFNα-stimulated activation of this kinase as well as for efficient serine phosphorylation and degradation of IFNAR1 and ensuing restriction of the extent of cellular responses to IFNα.

To alleviate these detrimental effects of Type 1 IFN, cells evolved to develop the mechanisms that limit the magnitude and duration of their responses to these cytokines. For example, some of the IFN-stimulated genes encode the proteins that may interfere with the recruitment of JAK to IFNAR chains (8Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Luo J.K. Zou W. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Shuai K. Zhang D.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2358-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Additional modes of negative regulation that is commonly shared between most of cytokines-induced JAK-STAT pathways include inhibition of JAK activity/stimulation of JAK degradation by SOCS proteins, inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation by phosphatases, and inhibition of STAT-induced transcription by PIAS (for review, see Refs. 6Coccia E.M.

In addition to these modes of negative regulation, which occur in cells that have already executed the IFN-induced programs of signal transduction and transcriptional activation, a rapid elimination of Type 1 IFN receptors from the cell surface serves as a rapid and important mechanism that limits cell sensitivity to continuous exposure to the ligands. Elimination of the entire receptor is driven by ubiquitination and subsequent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the IFNAR1 chain (6Coccia E.M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. Cell Mol.

This ubiquitination is facilitated by the SCFβTrcp E3 ubiquitin ligase that is recruited to IFNAR1 upon its phosphorylation on specific Ser residues within a defined degron (534DSGNYS) (11Kumar K.G.

Stimulation of this phosphorylation in cells exposed to IFNα/β appears to play a key role in subsequent recruitment of βTrcp and stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation (11Kumar K.G.

Our previous studies also revealed the role of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) in ligand-stimulated IFNAR1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation (16Zheng H. Qian J. Varghese B. Baker D.P. Fuchs S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Whereas an increase in both recruitment of PKD2 to IFNAR1 and in catalytic activity of PKD2 were observed in cells treated with IFNα/β, the mechanisms that govern the ligand-inducible JAK and PKD2-stimulated phosphorylation of IFNAR1 degron remains largely to be understood. Here we report that kinase function of TYK2 is dispensable for basal activity of PKD2 or for induction of its recruitment to IFNAR1. Instead, TYK2 activity plays an important role in stimulation of kinase activity of PKD2 by IFNα through phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residue, Tyr-438. The latter mechanism is important for IFNAR1 degradation and for tempering the IFNα-induced signaling and anti-viral defenses.

Briefly, for co-immunoprecipitation, cells harvested from a 10-cm plate (1–5 × 106) were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, PMSF (50 μg/ml), and protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma) on ice. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the respective antibody for 1 h followed by a 2-h incubation with protein G-coupled Sepharose beads at 4 °C under rotary agitation. After washing by the above lysis buffer three times, immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then were subjected to further analyses. Immunoblot detection and quantification were carried out using the LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system. In vitro phosphorylation of PKD2 (purified from HeLa cells) by HA-tagged TYK2 immunopurified from 293T cells (untreated or treated with IFNα) or by recombinant Src (purchased from Cell Signaling) was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Alternatively, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of purified from 293T cells GST-PKD2 (WT or Y438F, “YF”) by the recombinant truncated GST-TYK2883–1187 kinase (molecular mass 68.8 kDa; PV4790, Invitrogen) was carried out in kinase buffer (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 2 mm DTT) at 30 °C for 1 h with ATP (0.3 mm). The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) followed by immunoblotting using anti-GST antibody. 2fTGH or 11.1 cells were plated on coverslips for 24 h and then treated with IFNα (2,000 units/ml) for 5 min. Cells were fixed by 3.7% paraformaldehyde at once and permeabilized by 0.3% Triton X-100. Then cells were incubated with anti-PKD2 and anti-TYK2 (sc-5271) for 1.5 h followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 25 °C. DAPI (Sigma) was used at 1 μg/ml for 2 min. The cells were embedded in Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen). The confocal images were acquired on a Leica Inverted DMI4000 microscope equipped with a 100× HCX PL APO 1.46 NA oil objective, a Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disk confocal system, and an ImagEM 16-bit cooled EMCCD camera (Hamamatus). Laser excitation was provided by a 488-nm (Spectra Physics) and a 561-nm laser (Cobolt Jive) controlled through LMM5 (Spectral Applied Research). The anti-viral effect of Type 1 IFN was determined in the derivatives of 2fTGH cells that harbor diverse PKD2 status. These cells were pretreated with IFNα (5 units/ml) for 1 h prior to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana serotype, a gift from R. Harty; propagated in HeLa cells) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 1 h. After removing the virus inoculums, cells were then fed with fresh medium and incubated for 20 h. Culture supernatant was harvested, and the viral titer was determined in HeLa cells overlaid with methylcellulose as described elsewhere (28Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R.

IFNα/β-stimulated and TYK2-dependent phosphorylation on Ser-535 was shown to play a key role in ligand-inducible ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1 (11Kumar K.G. Krolewski J.J. Fuchs S.Y. J.

Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although PKD2 was expressed in either human fibrosarcoma 2fTGH cells or their isogenic TYK2-null 11.1 derivatives, the activation of PKD2 by IFNα was not observed in 11.1 cells (16Zheng H. Qian J. Varghese B. Baker D.P. Fuchs S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previous work by Pellegrini group established that these cells fail to retain IFNAR1 on cell surface due to constitutive endocytosis of IFNAR1 (29Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of these cells with wild-type TYK2 restored the sensitivity of resulting cells (WT-5) to Type 1 IFN. When isogenic cell line (KR-2) was engineered using catalytically incompetent TYK2, it exhibited an attenuated JAK-STAT signaling (15Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S.

Ransohoff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1891-1897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Importantly, phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser-535 in these cells was not robustly stimulated by IFNα treatment (Fig. 1A) (14Liu J. Plotnikov A. Banerjee A. Suresh Kumar K.G. Ragimbeau J. Marijanovic Z. Baker D.P. Pellegrini S. Fuchs S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We sought to delineate the mechanisms by which PKD2 can be coerced to contribute to Ser-535 phosphorylation of IFNAR1 by IFNα and to determine the role of TYK2 in these mechanisms. Our hypothesis was that IFNα-induced activity of JAK/TYK2 may stimulate either recruitment of PKD2 to IFNAR1 or PKD2 kinase activity or both. Consistent with our previous results (16Zheng H. Qian J. Varghese B. Baker D.P. Fuchs S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), co-immunoprecipitation analysis determined that PKD2 can interact with IFNAR1 and that this interaction is stimulated by IFNα treatment in 293T cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in WT-5 cells that express wild-type TYK2 and were capable of responding to IFNα by activating STAT1 and phosphorylating IFNAR1 on Ser-535 (Fig. 1C). A greater level of PKD2 recovered in IFNAR1 immunoprecipitates was not reflective of overall levels of PKD2 that remained comparable in either treated or untreated cells under these conditions (see Fig. 3A). Importantly, upon adding IFNα, neither STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation nor Ser-535 phosphorylation of IFNAR1 was observed in KR-2 cells that express kinase-deficient TYK2. Yet, these KR-2 cells exhibited a ligand-stimulated increase in IFNAR1-PKD2 binding similar that seen in WT-5 cells (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that IFNα-stimulated recruitment of PKD2 to IFNAR1 does not depend on catalytic activity of TYK2. We next sought to determine whether TYK2 activity is involved in regulating the IFNα-induced increase in PKD2 kinase activity. To this end, we expressed GST-tagged PKD2 in either WT-5 or KR-2 cells, treated these cells with IFNα for various times, purified PKD2 using affinity beads, and incubated this kinase with bacterially produced GST-IFNAR1 protein as a substrate and ATP in vitro. The resulting kinase activity toward phosphorylation of Ser-535 on GST-IFNAR1 was measured by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibody as the mode for detection. Basal activity of GST-PKD2 (assessed by its ability to phosphorylate on Ser-535 in vitro) was detected in untreated WT-5 cells (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, whereas treatment of cells with IFNα noticeably increased the kinase activity of GST-PKD2 toward Ser-535 phosphorylation in WT-5 cells, this induction was not seen in KR-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the status of TYK2 had no bearing on the basal activity of expressed PKD2. These data suggest that TYK2 stimulated by IFNα contributes to catalytic activation of PKD2 in response to IFNα. We next investigated whether PKD2 and TYK2 interact in cells. Immunoprecipitation reactions carried out using anti-TYK2 antibody revealed the presence of PKD2 in a complex with TYK2 in the untreated cells. Treatment of cells with IFNα rapidly increased this interaction within 2–5 min followed by subsequent decrease in this interaction at later time points (Fig. 2B). We further sought to determine localization of endogenous PKD2 and TYK2 proteins using immunocytochemistry. We first characterized suitability of antibodies for these analyses. Signals detected using an antibody against TYK2 were readily seen in 2fTGH cells but not in TYK2-negative 11.1 cells (Fig. 2C). The pattern of staining in 2fTGH cells was similar to that reported by Lukashova et al. in monocytoid MonoMac-1 cells (32Lukashova V. Asselin C. Krolewski J.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stanková J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24113-24121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, immunochemical detection of PKD2 was much more efficient in 2fTGH cells that received control shRNA compared with those that were transduced with shRNA against PKD2 (Fig. 2D). We further used these antibodies against TYK2 and PKD2 for co-localization studies in 2fTGH cells. These analyses showed that PKD2 and TYK2 co-localize in untreated cells and that this co-localization is noticeably increased in cells treated with IFNα (Fig. 2E). In all, these data suggest that PKD2 is capable of interacting with TYK2 and that this interaction can be transiently stimulated by the ligand. Two nonexclusive mechanisms have been proposed for activation of a better studied PKD2-related kinase PKD1 by numerous stimuli. One is a phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKD on Ser-744/Ser-748 (33Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Sinnett-Smith J. Jacamo R. Kui R. Wang Y.M. Young S.H. Rey O. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Wang Q.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Another is a tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-463 that relieves an autoinhibitory effect of the plekstrin homology domain; this phosphorylation could be stimulated by Src (36Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, previous reports demonstrated that PKD2 can undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in cells (37Oppermann F.S. Gnad F. Olsen J.V. Hornberger R. Greff Z. Kéri G. Mann M. Daub H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1751-1764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We next assessed phosphorylation status of endogenous PKD2 in WT-5 and KR-2 cells. Phosphorylation of Ser-710 (analog of Ser-748 within PKD1) was indeed stimulated upon treating either WT-5 or KR-2 cells with IFNα (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that, similar to an increase in PKD2-IFNAR1 binding (Fig. 1), phosphorylation of Ser-710 can be stimulated by IFNα independently of TYK2 kinase activity. As TYK2 activity contributes to the ligand-induced catalytic activation of PKD2 (Fig. 2A) and phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser-535 (15Marijanovic Z. Ragimbeau J. Kumar K.G. Fuchs S.Y. Pellegrini S. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is plausible that IFNα-induced phosphorylation on Ser-710 is not sufficient for activation of PKD2 by this stimulus and that an additional signal is required. Given that TYK2 is a tyrosine kinase we next assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2. Indeed a ligand-inducible phosphorylation on Tyr residues observed on immunoprecipitated endogenous PKD2 in WT-5 (Fig. 3A) or HeLa (Fig. 3B) but not in KR-2 cells (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of this reaction in TYK2-competent cells revealed a peak at 2–5 min (Fig. 3, A and B) that resembled the kinetics of the PKD2-TYK2 interaction shown in Fig. 2B. In all, these results are consistent with a hypothesis that IFNα-induced catalytic activity of TYK2 directly contributes to Tyr phosphorylation of PKD2. To test this possibility, we turned to kinase assays in vitro. In these experiments, the HA-tagged TYK2 was expressed in and immunopurified from 293T cells, which were treated or not with IFNα prior to harvesting. After that, HA-TYK2 was incubated with PKD2 (purified from serum-starved and untreated HeLa cells) in the presence of ATP. The reaction was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In this assay, incubation of PKD2 with ATP in the absence of added tyrosine kinase did not produce any phosphotyrosine signals consistent with the fact that PKD2 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase (Fig. 3C, lane 1). Conversely, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD2 was easily detected when recombinant Src protein was used as positive control (Fig. 3C, lane 6). In the presence of activated HA-TYK2, a noticeable tyrosine phosphorylation signal on PKD2 was also observed in an ATP-dependent manner (compare lanes 2 and 5). A lesser extent of in Tyr phosphorylation of PKD2 was seen when HA-TYK2 was purified from untreated cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that ligand-stimulated TYK2 is capable of directly phosphorylating PKD2 on Tyr residues. Soluble tyrosine kinases including Abl and Src were shown to phosphorylate a related PKD1 on Tyr-463 (36Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). An increase in this phosphorylation in response to various PKD inducers could be detected using a phospho-specific antibody (38Arun S.N. Kaddour-Djebbar I. Shapiro B.A. Bollag W.B. Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1586-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A homologous tyrosine residue, Tyr-438, was found on PKD2 (Fig. 4A); this residue was proposed to play a role in modulating its activity (39Mihailovic T. Marx M. Auer A. Van Lint J. Schmid M. Weber C. Seufferlein T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8939-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We next aimed to determine the role of this site in IFNα-induced PKD2 activation and IFNAR1 phosphorylation. We generated the GST-PKD2Y438F mutant and expressed it in and purified from 293T cells to use in an in vitro kinase assay as a substrate. Compared with analogous wild-type GST-PKD2, the mutant lacking Tyr-438 revealed a lesser extent of overall tyrosine phosphorylation upon its incubation with recombinant truncated GST-TYK2833–1187 kinase (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). Given that the autophosphorylation activity of TYK2 was not inhibited by the presence of GST-PKD2Y438F mutant (Fig. 4B, lane 4), this result indicate a possibility that Tyr-438 may represent one of the phospho-acceptor sites used by TYK2 for PKD2 phosphorylation. Consistent with this possibility, overall tyrosine phosphorylation of GST-PKD2Y438F expressed in 293T cells treated with IFNα was noticeably less pronounced than that observed in GST-PKD2WT protein (Fig. 4C) despite the fact that Tyr-438 mutation did not affect the recruitment of PKD to IFNAR1 (Fig. 4D). Importantly, phosphorylation of these two proteins on Ser-710 was comparable (Fig. 4C), indicating that mutation"

https://openalex.org/W2088279255,"Members of the NR4A subgroup of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily have emerged as key transcriptional regulators of proliferation and inflammation. NOR1 constitutes a ligand-independent transcription factor of this subgroup and induces cell proliferation; however, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this mitogenic role remain to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that the F-box protein SKP2 (S phase kinase-associated protein 2), the substrate-specific receptor of the ubiquitin ligase responsible for the degradation of p27(KIP1) through the proteasome pathway, constitutes a direct transcriptional target for NOR1. Mitogen-induced Skp2 expression is silenced in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) isolated from Nor1-deficient mice or transfected with Nor1 siRNA. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of NOR1 induces Skp2 expression in VSMC and decreases protein abundance of its target p27. Transient transfection experiments establish that NOR1 transactivates the Skp2 promoter through a nerve growth factor-induced clone B response element (NBRE). Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that NOR1 is recruited to this NBRE site in the Skp2 promoter in response to mitogenic stimulation. In vivo Skp2 expression is increased during the proliferative response underlying neointima formation, and this transcriptional induction depends on the expression of NOR1. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of Skp2 rescues the proliferative arrest of Nor1-deficient VSMC. Collectively, these results characterize Skp2 as a novel NOR1-regulated target gene and detail a previously unrecognized transcriptional cascade regulating mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2075103940,"The mechanisms by which experience guides refinement of converging afferent pathways are poorly understood. We describe a vision-driven refinement of corticocollicular inputs that determines the consolidation of retinal and visual cortical (VC) synapses on individual neurons in the superficial superior colliculus (sSC). Highly refined corticocollicular terminals form 1-2 days after eye-opening (EO), accompanied by VC-dependent filopodia sprouting on proximal dendrites, and PSD-95 and VC-dependent quadrupling of functional synapses. Delayed EO eliminates synapses, corticocollicular terminals, and spines on VC-recipient dendrites. Awake recordings after EO show that VC and retina cooperate to activate sSC neurons, and VC light responses precede sSC responses within intervals promoting potentiation. Eyelid closure is associated with more protracted cortical visual responses, causing the majority of VC spikes to follow those of the colliculus. These data implicate spike-timing plasticity as a mechanism for cortical input survival, and support a cooperative strategy for retinal and cortical coinnervation of the sSC."

Despite the established function as a bona fide N-acetyltransferase, FrbF shows no sequence similarity to any member of the GCN5-like N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. Here, we present the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of FrbF in complex with acetyl-CoA, which demonstrates a unique architecture that is distinct from those of canonical GNAT-like acetyltransferases. We also utilized the co-crystal structure to guide structure-function studies that identified the roles of putative active site residues in the acetyltransferase mechanism. The combined biochemical and structural analyses of FrbF provide insights into this previously uncharacterized family of N-acetyltransferases and also provide a molecular framework toward the production of novel N-acyl derivatives of FR-900098."
https://openalex.org/W1997652898,"The sequence variation tolerated within the stem-loop-forming genomic consensus sequence for self-catalyzed site-specific depurination of G residues is explored. The variation in self-depurination kinetics with sequence changes in the loop residues and stem base pairs, as well as with pH, provides insights into the self-catalytic mechanism. The observations suggest that self-catalyzed depurination of the 5' G residue of the loop consensus sequence 5'-G(T/A)GG-3' probably involves formation of some intraloop hydrogen-bonded base pair with the 3'-terminal G residue; although the electronic structure of both these G residues is retained, their 2-amino substituents are not critical for that interaction. The strong dependence of the self-depurination kinetics on stem stability suggests that the lifetime of some strained form of the loop is controlled by the integrity of the stem. In addition to the effects of length and base pair sequence on stem stability, there is a base pair requirement at the base of the loop: self-depurination is suppressed by 5'-C·G-3', 5'-A·T-3', or a mismatch but is most favored by 5'T·A3' and less so by 5'-G·C-3'. The occurrence in T and G of a similarly located carbonyl capable of hydrogen-bonding to the water molecule required for glycosyl bond hydrolysis may explain this sequence requirement. In toto, the more complete definition of the consensus sequence provided by this investigation enables a more accurate estimation of their number in the human genome and their distribution among different genes."
https://openalex.org/W2020763711,"A major variety of ""spontaneous"" genomic damage is endogenous generation of apurinic sites. Depurination rates vary widely across genomes, occurring with higher frequency at ""depurination hot spots."" Recently, we discovered a site-specific self-catalyzed depurinating activity in short (14-18 nucleotides) DNA stem-loop-forming sequences with a 5'-G(T/A)GG-3' loop and T·A or G·C as the first base pair at the base of the loop; the 5'-G residue of the loop self-depurinates at least 10(5)-fold faster than random ""spontaneous"" depurination at pH 5. Formation of the catalytic intermediate for self-depurination in double-stranded DNA requires a stem-loop to extrude as part of a cruciform. In this study, evidence is presented for self-catalyzed depurination mediated by cruciform formation in plasmid DNA in vitro. Cruciform extrusion was confirmed, and its extent was quantitated by digestion of the plasmid with single strand-specific mung bean endonuclease, followed by restriction digestion and sequencing of resulting mung bean-generated fragments. Appearance of the apurinic site in the self-depurinating stem-loop was confirmed by digestion of plasmid DNA with apurinic endonuclease IV, followed by primer extension and/or PCR amplification to detect the endonuclease-generated strand break and identify its location. Self-catalyzed depurination was contingent on the plasmid being supercoiled and was not observed in linearized plasmids, consistent with the presence of the extruded cruciform in the supercoiled plasmid and not in the linear one. These results indicate that self-catalyzed depurination is not unique to single-stranded DNA; rather, it can occur in stem-loop structures extruding from double-stranded DNA and therefore could, in principle, occur in vivo."

To decipher the molecular function of Spr1479, we solved its crystal structures in the apo-form at 1.90 Å and complex forms with inorganic phosphate and AMP at 2.30 and 2.20 Å, respectively. The core structure and binuclear active site of Spr1479 resemble those of the MPP superfamily. In addition to phosphodiesterase activity for the generic substrate bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (bis-pNPP), Spr1479 has hydrolase activity for ApnA and ATP. Thus, Spr1479 might function not only as a phosphodiesterase but also as a housecleaning protein to keep the homeostasis of intracellular nucleotides. The coding regions of Spr1479/SapH (residues 1–262) and full-length SapH (SapH-FL; residues 1–282) were amplified from genomic DNA of S. pneumoniae R6 and individually cloned into a pET28a-derived vector and overexpressed in the Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3) strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) using 2×YT culture medium (5 g of NaCl, 16 g of Bacto-Tryptone, and 10 g of yeast extract per liter). A hexahistidine tag was added to the N terminus of each of the recombinant proteins. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.6. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for another 20 h at 16 °C before harvesting. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl). After 2.5 min of sonication and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 25 min, the supernatant containing the target protein was collected and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl). The target protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the target protein were combined and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization. Samples for enzymatic activity assays were collected at the highest peak fractions without concentration. The purity of protein was assessed by electrophoresis, and the protein sample was stored at −80 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the plasmid encoding wild-type SapH as the template. The mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and stored in the same manner as used for the wild-type protein. Crystals of SapH were grown at 16 °C using hanging drop vapor-diffusion techniques by mixing 2 μl of 10 mg/ml protein sample with an equal volume of reservoir solution (25% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), and 0.2 m NH4Ac). Crystals appeared in 1 week. Before data collection, crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol). The iodine derivative crystals were obtained by soaking SapH crystals in cryoprotectant solution containing 300 mm KI for ∼15 s. The crystals of SapH-PO4 and SapH-AMP were obtained by soaking the SapH crystals in 500 mm NaH2PO4 for ∼5 s and in 30 mm AMP for ∼2 min, respectively. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K in a liquid nitrogen stream using beamline 17U with an MX-225 CCD detector (Marresearch GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. All diffraction data were integrated and scaled with the program HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38549) Google Scholar). The structure of SapH was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing technique (23Brodersen D.E. de La Fortelle E. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with the iodine anomalous signal using the program phenix.solve implemented in PHENIX (24Adams P.D.

The initial model was built automatically with the program AutoBuild in PHENIX. The resultant model was subsequently used as a search model against the 1.90 Å data of SapH. Using the SapH structure as the search model, the structures of SapH-PO4 and SapH-AMP were determined by the molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A.

Open table in a new tab Atomic absorption spectroscopy (Atomscan Advantage, Thermo Ash Jarrell Corp.) was performed to determine the metal content. Prior to analysis, purified SapH-FL in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5) and 150 mm NaCl was concentrated to ∼8 mg/ml. All enzymatic assays were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm FeCl3, and 0.2 mm MnCl2. Using a DU800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter), phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities were measured with pNPP and bis-pNPP (Sigma) as substrates, respectively, by following the absorption increase at 405 nm. The kinetic parameters of wild-type SapH and its mutants were measured using bis-pNPP as the substrate to a standard curve of 4-nitrophenol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of SapH or its mutants. The hydrolysis of nucleotides/derivatives (Sigma) was measured by HPLC (Agilent 1200 series). SapH and its mutants were incubated with a range of substrate concentrations in a volume of 25 μl. The reaction was terminated after 15 min of incubation by the addition of 50 μl of 20 mm NH4H2PO4 (pH 6.2). As a control, an assay mixture without any protein added was used. NMP standards were quantified by HPLC analysis using a series of concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 mm. 20 mm NH4H2PO4 was used for equilibration of the column (Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm), Agilent) and separation of the components at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Samples were injected in a volume of 10 μl. The parameters Km and kcat were calculated by nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Origin 7.5. Three independent assays were performed to calculate the means ± S.D. for all Km and kcat values. We initially found crystals of full-length Spr1479 (SapH-FL) but could not optimize them to a high diffraction quality. Limited proteolysis combined with LC-MS enabled us to define a relatively stable region of residues 1–262 (termed SapH). We overexpressed this region and subjected it to crystallization, and the resulting crystals were diffracted to a resolution of 1.90 Å. An asymmetric unit contains a dimer of SapH with an interface area of ∼1700 Å2. Met-3–Leu-260 in subunit A and Met-3–His-252 in subunit B are well fitted in the final model. The two subunits are very similar, with an overall root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.15 Å over 210 Cα atoms (Fig. 1A). Size-exclusion chromatography also confirmed the existence of SapH-FL and SapH as a dimer in solution (data not shown). The two five-stranded β-sheets of subunit A are aligned antiparallel to their counterparts in subunit B, forming two continuous 10-stranded mixed β-sheets, which are perpendicular to the dimer-related non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 1A). Each subunit adopts a compact core structure with a four-layer αββα-sandwich fold: two five-stranded β-sheets sandwiched by helices α1 and α2 on one side and helix α6 on the opposite side (Fig. 1B). One β-sheet is composed of strands β4–β8, whereas the facing β-sheet consists of strands β1–β3, β9, and β10 (Fig. 1B). Beyond the core structure, SapH has a cap of five α-helices (α3–α5, α7, and α8) packing against the active site. Among these five α-helices, α3–α5 (Asn-66–His-109) form one side wall of the active site, whereas the other two α-helices α7 and α8 (Val-225–Asn-249) at the C terminus might function as a scaffold. A Dali search using the five-helix subdomain revealed no hit of a similar domain. Compared with the core domain, the secondary structural elements of this additional subdomain appear to be more variable in length and structure, which may be responsible for the versatile substrate specificities among the MPP superfamily members. The core structures of subunits A and B are packed against each other to form a dimer interface, which consists mainly of the backbones of strands β7 and β10 from both subunits. Specifically, the interface is composed of hydrogen bonds between Val-214 Oα and Arg-220′ Nα, Met-216 Nα and Phe-218′ Oα, Met-216 Oα and Phe-218′ Nα, Phe-218 Nα and Met-216′ Oα, Phe-218 Oα and Met-216′ Nα, and Arg-220 Nα and Val-214′ Oα from strand β10 and between Leu-170 Nα and Leu-170′ Oα and Leu-170 Oα and Leu-170′ Nα from strand β7 (the residues in subunit B are labeled with a prime) (Fig. 1C). In addition to these backbone hydrogen bonds, the carboxyl group of Asp-209 (Asp-209′) forms two hydrogen bonds with Nη1 and Nη2 of Arg-200′ (Arg-200), further stabilizing the dimer. During the model building and refinement process, two electron density peaks were outstanding in the Fo − Fc Fourier difference map (at the 30σ level), indicating the presence of metals. The brown color of concentrated protein in solution indicated the presence of iron. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that iron and manganese were present at molarity ratios to the protein of 0.7 and 0.8, respectively. X-ray diffraction experiments at various wavelengths were done to confirm the chemical identity of these metals. We collected data at a wavelength of 1.74 Å and found two strong anomalous peaks of 31.0 and 30.7 in the structure model-phased anomalous Fourier difference maps. This result excluded the presence of zinc, copper, nickel, and cobalt, which have a theoretical absorption K-edge below 1.61 Å. To further distinguish iron from manganese, we collected data at a wavelength of 1.80 Å and assigned peaks of 16.9 to iron and 25.0 to manganese. (The theoretical absorption K-edges for iron and manganese are 1.74 and 1.90 Å, respectively.) A significant anomalous signal of the iron site indicates that this site might be also mixed with manganese. Thus, the two sites should have mixed occupancies of Fe3+ and Mn2+, respectively (Fig. 2A). The following activity assays also confirmed that the binuclear metals are Fe3+ and Mn2+. The two metals are 3.4 and 3.3 Å away from each other in subunits A and B, respectively. Fe3+ and coordinating residues Asp-11, His-13, Asp-39, and His-166, together with Mn2+ and coordinating residues Asp-39, Asn-66, His-128, and His-164, constitute an octahedral structure of the active site (Fig. 2A). A planar water molecule (designated Wat1) forms coordination bonds with Fe3+ and Mn2+ and a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of His-164. This binuclear active site is located at the interface between the core structure and the cap of α-helices. Overall structure comparison of SapH with structures in the Protein Data Bank using the Dali server gave 188 hits for 41 unique proteins with a Z-score higher than 10.0; these proteins were all members of the MPP superfamily. The top hit was a hypothetical protein from Pyrococcus furiosus (Protein Data Bank code 1NNW; Z-score of 25.7, r.m.s.d. of 2.6 Å over 234 Cα atoms), followed by E. coli phosphodiesterase YfcE (code 1SU1) (32Miller D.J.

Bi R.C. Proteins. 2006; 65: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase Rv0805 from M. tuberculosis (code 2HY1) (37Shenoy A.R. Capuder M. Draskovic P. Lamba D. Visweswariah S.S. Podobnik M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins have similar molecular functions (phosphodiesterase, phosphatase, nuclease, or nucleotidase), although two are symmetric Ap4A hydrolases. Moreover, the binuclear active site of SapH can be closely superimposed onto that of M. tuberculosis cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase Rv0805 (Fig. 2B) (37Shenoy A.R. Capuder M. Draskovic P. Lamba D. Visweswariah S.S. Podobnik M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), despite the fact that SapH and Rv0805 have a sequence identity of only 17% and markedly different structures, with an r.m.s.d. of 3.3 Å over 149 Cα atoms. The highly conserved αββα-sandwich core structure and binuclear active site strongly implied that SapH might act as a phosphodiesterase, phosphatase, or Ap4A hydrolase. We first tested the enzymatic activity of SapH for generic phosphomonoesterase or phosphodiesterase substrates (pNPP or bis-pNPP) in the presence of 0.2 mm Fe3+ and 0.2 mm Mn2+. No activity for pNPP was detected (data not shown). By contrast, both SapH-FL and SapH showed considerable activity for bis-pNPP. The Km and kcat values were 1.76 ± 0.02 mm and 5.70 ± 0.12 s−1, respectively, for SapH-FL and 2.46 ± 0.15 mm and 5.51 ± 0.22 s−1, respectively, for SapH (supplemental Table S1). These results suggested that SapH is a phosphodiesterase. We further systematically screened all of the reported physiological substrates of metallophosphodiesterase. These substrates fall into three groups: cyclic nucleotides, nucleic acids, and phospholipids. We tested the following representative substrates of phospholipases: 2′,3′-cAMP (Sigma), 3′,5′-cAMP (Sigma), double- or single-stranded DNA and RNA, and the generic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (Sigma). However, SapH-FL showed no catalytic activity for any of the above substrates. This indicates that SapH-FL most likely performs a novel phosphodiesterase activity for a unique physiological substrate, or the activity of SapH-FL for the above-listed substrates needs the assistance of an unknown partner. Similar cases of phosphodiesterases with unknown physiological substrate have also been reported previously (32Miller D.J. Shuvalova L. Evdokimova E. Savchenko A. Yakunin A.F. Anderson W.F. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Chen S. Yakunin A.F. Kuznetsova E. Busso D. Pufan R. Proudfoot M. Kim R. Kim S.H. J. Biol.

Mutation of Asp-39, His-13, or His-128 to Ala completely abolished the phosphodiesterase activity. Activity was elevated by the addition of 0.2 mm Fe3+ and/or Mn2+ and somewhat inhibited by the addition of Mg2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Fe2+ individually (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the addition of 5 mm EDTA did not change the activity (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that the co-purified m"
