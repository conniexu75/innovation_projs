https://openalex.org/W4312114044,"Tissue regeneration requires coordination between resident stem cells and local niche cells1,2. Here we identify that senescent cells are integral components of the skeletal muscle regenerative niche that repress regeneration at all stages of life. The technical limitation of senescent-cell scarcity3 was overcome by combining single-cell transcriptomics and a senescent-cell enrichment sorting protocol. We identified and isolated different senescent cell types from damaged muscles of young and old mice. Deeper transcriptome, chromatin and pathway analyses revealed conservation of cell identity traits as well as two universal senescence hallmarks (inflammation and fibrosis) across cell type, regeneration time and ageing. Senescent cells create an aged-like inflamed niche that mirrors inflammation associated with ageing (inflammageing4) and arrests stem cell proliferation and regeneration. Reducing the burden of senescent cells, or reducing their inflammatory secretome through CD36 neutralization, accelerates regeneration in young and old mice. By contrast, transplantation of senescent cells delays regeneration. Our results provide a technique for isolating in vivo senescent cells, define a senescence blueprint for muscle, and uncover unproductive functional interactions between senescent cells and stem cells in regenerative niches that can be overcome. As senescent cells also accumulate in human muscles, our findings open potential paths for improving muscle repair throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W4312095753,"R-loops are RNA-DNA-hybrid-containing nucleic acids with important cellular roles. Deregulation of R-loop dynamics can lead to DNA damage and genome instability1, which has been linked to the action of endonucleases such as XPG2-4. However, the mechanisms and cellular consequences of such processing have remained unclear. Here we identify a new population of RNA-DNA hybrids in the cytoplasm that are R-loop-processing products. When nuclear R-loops were perturbed by depleting the RNA-DNA helicase senataxin (SETX) or the breast cancer gene BRCA1 (refs. 5-7), we observed XPG- and XPF-dependent cytoplasmic hybrid formation. We identify their source as a subset of stable, overlapping nuclear hybrids with a specific nucleotide signature. Cytoplasmic hybrids bind to the pattern recognition receptors cGAS and TLR3 (ref. 8), activating IRF3 and inducing apoptosis. Excised hybrids and an R-loop-induced innate immune response were also observed in SETX-mutated cells from patients with ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (ref. 9) and in BRCA1-mutated cancer cells10. These findings establish RNA-DNA hybrids as immunogenic species that aberrantly accumulate in the cytoplasm after R-loop processing, linking R-loop accumulation to cell death through the innate immune response. Aberrant R-loop processing and subsequent innate immune activation may contribute to many diseases, such as neurodegeneration and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4312095214,"The vertebrate body displays a segmental organization that is most conspicuous in the periodic organization of the vertebral column and peripheral nerves. This metameric organization is first implemented when somites, which contain the precursors of skeletal muscles and vertebrae, are rhythmically generated from the presomitic mesoderm. Somites then become subdivided into anterior and posterior compartments that are essential for vertebral formation and segmental patterning of the peripheral nervous system1-4. How this key somitic subdivision is established remains poorly understood. Here we introduce three-dimensional culture systems of human pluripotent stem cells called somitoids and segmentoids, which recapitulate the formation of somite-like structures with anteroposterior identity. We identify a key function of the segmentation clock in converting temporal rhythmicity into the spatial regularity of anterior and posterior somitic compartments. We show that an initial 'salt and pepper' expression of the segmentation gene MESP2 in the newly formed segment is transformed into compartments of anterior and posterior identity through an active cell-sorting mechanism. Our research demonstrates that the major patterning modules that are involved in somitogenesis, including the clock and wavefront, anteroposterior polarity patterning and somite epithelialization, can be dissociated and operate independently in our in vitro systems. Together, we define a framework for the symmetry-breaking process that initiates somite polarity patterning. Our work provides a platform for decoding general principles of somitogenesis and advancing knowledge of human development."
https://openalex.org/W4312093659,"Asgard archaea are considered to be the closest known relatives of eukaryotes. Their genomes contain hundreds of eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs), which inspired hypotheses on the evolution of the eukaryotic cell1-3. A role of ESPs in the formation of an elaborate cytoskeleton and complex cellular structures has been postulated4-6, but never visualized. Here we describe a highly enriched culture of 'Candidatus Lokiarchaeum ossiferum', a member of the Asgard phylum, which thrives anaerobically at 20 °C on organic carbon sources. It divides every 7-14 days, reaches cell densities of up to 5 × 107 cells per ml and has a significantly larger genome compared with the single previously cultivated Asgard strain7. ESPs represent 5% of its protein-coding genes, including four actin homologues. We imaged the enrichment culture using cryo-electron tomography, identifying 'Ca. L. ossiferum' cells on the basis of characteristic expansion segments of their ribosomes. Cells exhibited coccoid cell bodies and a network of branched protrusions with frequent constrictions. The cell envelope consists of a single membrane and complex surface structures. A long-range cytoskeleton extends throughout the cell bodies, protrusions and constrictions. The twisted double-stranded architecture of the filaments is consistent with F-actin. Immunostaining indicates that the filaments comprise Lokiactin-one of the most highly conserved ESPs in Asgard archaea. We propose that a complex actin-based cytoskeleton predated the emergence of the first eukaryotes and was a crucial feature in the evolution of the Asgard phylum by scaffolding elaborate cellular structures."
https://openalex.org/W4312095185,"The segmented body plan of vertebrates is established during somitogenesis, a well-studied process in model organisms; however, the details of this process in humans remain largely unknown owing to ethical and technical limitations. Despite recent advances with pluripotent stem cell-based approaches1-5, models that robustly recapitulate human somitogenesis in both space and time remain scarce. Here we introduce a pluripotent stem cell-derived mesoderm-based 3D model of human segmentation and somitogenesis-which we termed 'axioloid'-that captures accurately the oscillatory dynamics of the segmentation clock and the morphological and molecular characteristics of sequential somite formation in vitro. Axioloids show proper rostrocaudal patterning of forming segments and robust anterior-posterior FGF-WNT signalling gradients and retinoic acid signalling components. We identify an unexpected critical role of retinoic acid signalling in the stabilization of forming segments, indicating distinct, but also synergistic effects of retinoic acid and extracellular matrix on the formation and epithelialization of somites. Comparative analysis demonstrates marked similarities of axioloids to the human embryo, further validated by the presence of a Hox code in axioloids. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of axioloids for studying the pathogenesis of human congenital spine diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells with mutations in HES7 and MESP2. Our results indicate that axioloids represent a promising platform for the study of axial development and disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4312094540,"Abstract Single-cell transcriptomics has allowed unprecedented resolution of cell types/states in the human lung, but their spatial context is less well defined. To (re)define tissue architecture of lung and airways, we profiled five proximal-to-distal locations of healthy human lungs in depth using multi-omic single cell/nuclei and spatial transcriptomics (queryable at lungcellatlas.org ). Using computational data integration and analysis, we extend beyond the suspension cell paradigm and discover macro and micro-anatomical tissue compartments including previously unannotated cell types in the epithelial, vascular, stromal and nerve bundle micro-environments. We identify and implicate peribronchial fibroblasts in lung disease. Importantly, we discover and validate a survival niche for IgA plasma cells in the airway submucosal glands (SMG). We show that gland epithelial cells recruit B cells and IgA plasma cells, and promote longevity and antibody secretion locally through expression of CCL28, APRIL and IL-6. This new ‘gland-associated immune niche’ has implications for respiratory health."
https://openalex.org/W4312095729,"How paternal exposure to ionizing radiation affects genetic inheritance and disease risk in the offspring has been a long-standing question in radiation biology. In humans, nearly 80% of transmitted mutations arise in the paternal germline1, but the transgenerational effects of ionizing radiation exposure has remained controversial and the mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that in sex-separated Caenorhabditis elegans strains, paternal, but not maternal, exposure to ionizing radiation leads to transgenerational embryonic lethality. The offspring of irradiated males displayed various genome instability phenotypes, including DNA fragmentation, chromosomal rearrangement and aneuploidy. Paternal DNA double strand breaks were repaired by maternally provided error-prone polymerase theta-mediated end joining. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of an orthologue of human histone H1.0, HIS-24, or the heterochromatin protein HPL-1, could significantly reverse the transgenerational embryonic lethality. Removal of HIS-24 or HPL-1 reduced histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation and enabled error-free homologous recombination repair in the germline of the F1 generation from ionizing radiation-treated P0 males, consequently improving the viability of the F2 generation. This work establishes the mechanistic underpinnings of the heritable consequences of paternal radiation exposure on the health of offspring, which may lead to congenital disorders and cancer in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4312060075,"We estimate the prevalence and characteristics of violent hate crime victimization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the United States, and we compare them to non-LGBT hate crime victims and to LGBT victims of violent non-hate crime. We analyze pooled 2017-2019 data from the National Crime Victimization Survey ( n persons = 553, 925; n incidents = 32, 470), the first nationally representative and comprehensive survey on crime that allows identification of LGBT persons aged 16 or older. Descriptive and bivariate analysis show that LGBT people experienced 6.6 violent hate crime victimizations per 1,000 persons compared with non-LGBT people’s 0.6 per 1,000 persons (odds ratio = 8.30, 95% confidence interval = 1.94, 14.65). LGBT people were more likely to be hate crime victims of sexual orientation or gender bias crime and less likely to be victims of race or ethnicity bias crimes compared to non-LGBT hate crime victims. Compared to non-LGBT victims, LGBT victims of hate crime were more likely to be younger, have a relationship with their assailant, and have an assailant who is white. Compared to LGBT victims of non-hate violence, more LGBT hate crime victims reported experiencing problems in their social lives, negative emotional responses, and physical symptoms of distress. Our findings affirm claims that hate crimes have adverse physical and psychological effects on victims and highlight the need to ensure that LGBT persons who experience hate crime get necessary support and services in the aftermath of the crime."
https://openalex.org/W4312095531,"In response to different types and intensities of mechanical force, cells modulate their physical properties and adapt their plasma membrane (PM). Caveolae are PM nano-invaginations that contribute to mechanoadaptation, buffering tension changes. However, whether core caveolar proteins contribute to PM tension accommodation independently from the caveolar assembly is unknown. Here we provide experimental and computational evidence supporting that caveolin-1 confers deformability and mechanoprotection independently from caveolae, through modulation of PM curvature. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that caveolin-1 stabilizes non-caveolar invaginations-dolines-capable of responding to low-medium mechanical forces, impacting downstream mechanotransduction and conferring mechanoprotection to cells devoid of caveolae. Upon cavin-1/PTRF binding, doline size is restricted and membrane buffering is limited to relatively high forces, capable of flattening caveolae. Thus, caveolae and dolines constitute two distinct albeit complementary components of a buffering system that allows cells to adapt efficiently to a broad range of mechanical stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4312193040,"Pulsar wind nebulae are formed when outflows of relativistic electrons and positrons hit the surrounding supernova remnant or interstellar medium at a shock front. The Vela pulsar wind nebula is powered by a young pulsar (B0833-45, age 11 kyr) and located inside an extended structure called Vela X, itself inside the supernova remnant. Previous X-ray observations revealed two prominent arcs, bisected by a jet and counter jet. Radio maps have shown high linear polarization of 60 per cent in the outer regions of the nebula. Here we report X-ray observation of the inner part of the nebula, where polarization can exceed 60 per cent at the leading edge, which approaches the theoretical limit of what can be produced by synchrotron emission. We infer that, in contrast with the case of the supernova remnant, the electrons in the pulsar wind nebula are accelerated with little or no turbulence in a highly uniform magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W4312083442,"How social contact is perceived as rewarding and subsequently modifies interactions is unclear. Dopamine (DA) from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) regulates sociality, but the ongoing, unstructured nature of free behavior makes it difficult to ascertain how. Here, we tracked the emergence of a repetitive stereotyped parental retrieval behavior and conclude that VTA DA neurons incrementally refine it by reinforcement learning (RL). Trial-by-trial performance was correlated with the history of DA neuron activity, but DA signals were inconsistent with VTA directly influencing the current trial. We manipulated the subject’s expectation of imminent pup contact and show that DA signals convey reward prediction error, a fundamental component of RL. Finally, closed-loop optogenetic inactivation of DA neurons at the onset of pup contact dramatically slowed emergence of parental care. We conclude that this component of maternal behavior is shaped by an RL mechanism in which social contact itself is the primary reward."
https://openalex.org/W4312094701,"When faced with predatory threats, escape towards shelter is an adaptive action that offers long-term protection against the attacker. Animals rely on knowledge of safe locations in the environment to instinctively execute rapid shelter-directed escape actions1,2. Although previous work has identified neural mechanisms of escape initiation3,4, it is not known how the escape circuit incorporates spatial information to execute rapid flights along the most efficient route to shelter. Here we show that the mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSP) and superior colliculus (SC) form a circuit that encodes the shelter-direction vector and is specifically required for accurately orienting to shelter during escape. Shelter direction is encoded in RSP and SC neurons in egocentric coordinates and SC shelter-direction tuning depends on RSP activity. Inactivation of the RSP–SC pathway disrupts the orientation to shelter and causes escapes away from the optimal shelter-directed route, but does not lead to generic deficits in orientation or spatial navigation. We find that the RSP and SC are monosynaptically connected and form a feedforward lateral inhibition microcircuit that strongly drives the inhibitory collicular network because of higher RSP input convergence and synaptic integration efficiency in inhibitory SC neurons. This results in broad shelter-direction tuning in inhibitory SC neurons and sharply tuned excitatory SC neurons. These findings are recapitulated by a biologically constrained spiking network model in which RSP input to the local SC recurrent ring architecture generates a circular shelter-direction map. We propose that this RSP–SC circuit might be specialized for generating collicular representations of memorized spatial goals that are readily accessible to the motor system during escape, or more broadly, during navigation when the goal must be reached as fast as possible. The retrosplenial cortex and superior colliculus of mouse form a neural circuit that specifically encodes shelter location, facilitating rapid escape from predatory threats."
https://openalex.org/W4312093871,"Inhibition of the tumour suppressive function of p53 (encoded by TP53) is paramount for cancer development in humans. However, p53 remains unmutated in the majority of cases of glioblastoma (GBM)-the most common and deadly adult brain malignancy1,2. Thus, how p53-mediated tumour suppression is countered in TP53 wild-type (TP53WT) GBM is unknown. Here we describe a GBM-specific epigenetic mechanism in which the chromatin regulator bromodomain-containing protein 8 (BRD8) maintains H2AZ occupancy at p53 target loci through the EP400 histone acetyltransferase complex. This mechanism causes a repressive chromatin state that prevents transactivation by p53 and sustains proliferation. Notably, targeting the bromodomain of BRD8 displaces H2AZ, enhances chromatin accessibility and engages p53 transactivation. This in turn enforces cell cycle arrest and tumour suppression in TP53WT GBM. In line with these findings, BRD8 is highly expressed with H2AZ in proliferating single cells of patient-derived GBM, and is inversely correlated with CDKN1A, a canonical p53 target that encodes p21 (refs. 3,4). This work identifies BRD8 as a selective epigenetic vulnerability for a malignancy for which treatment has not improved for decades. Moreover, targeting the bromodomain of BRD8 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with TP53WT GBM."
https://openalex.org/W4312095286,"Abstract Impaired proinsulin-to-insulin processing in pancreatic β-cells is a key defective step in both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (refs. 1 , 2 ), but the mechanisms involved remain to be defined. Altered metabolism of sphingolipids (SLs) has been linked to development of obesity, type 1 diabetes and T2D (refs. 3–8 ); nonetheless, the role of specific SL species in β-cell function and demise is unclear. Here we define the lipid signature of T2D-associated β-cell failure, including an imbalance of specific very-long-chain SLs and long-chain SLs. β-cell-specific ablation of CerS2, the enzyme necessary for generation of very-long-chain SLs, selectively reduces insulin content, impairs insulin secretion and disturbs systemic glucose tolerance in multiple complementary models. In contrast, ablation of long-chain-SL-synthesizing enzymes has no effect on insulin content. By quantitatively defining the SL–protein interactome, we reveal that CerS2 ablation affects SL binding to several endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi transport proteins, including Tmed2, which we define as an endogenous regulator of the essential proinsulin processing enzyme Pcsk1. Our study uncovers roles for specific SL subtypes and SL-binding proteins in β-cell function and T2D-associated β-cell failure."
https://openalex.org/W4312095722,"Cochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices that can provide hearing to deaf people1. Despite the benefits offered by CIs, the time taken for hearing to be restored and perceptual accuracy after long-term CI use remain highly variable2,3. CI use is believed to require neuroplasticity in the central auditory system, and differential engagement of neuroplastic mechanisms might contribute to the variability in outcomes4-7. Despite extensive studies on how CIs activate the auditory system4,8-12, the understanding of CI-related neuroplasticity remains limited. One potent factor enabling plasticity is the neuromodulator noradrenaline from the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC). Here we examine behavioural responses and neural activity in LC and auditory cortex of deafened rats fitted with multi-channel CIs. The rats were trained on a reward-based auditory task, and showed considerable individual differences of learning rates and maximum performance. LC photometry predicted when CI subjects began responding to sounds and longer-term perceptual accuracy. Optogenetic LC stimulation produced faster learning and higher long-term accuracy. Auditory cortical responses to CI stimulation reflected behavioural performance, with enhanced responses to rewarded stimuli and decreased distinction between unrewarded stimuli. Adequate engagement of central neuromodulatory systems is thus a potential clinically relevant target for optimizing neuroprosthetic device use."
https://openalex.org/W4313312080,"Cavity optomechanics enables the control of mechanical motion through the radiation-pressure interaction1, and has contributed to the quantum control of engineered mechanical systems ranging from kilogramme-scale Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) mirrors to nanomechanical systems, enabling ground-state preparation2,3, entanglement4,5, squeezing of mechanical objects6, position measurements at the standard quantum limit7 and quantum transduction8. Yet nearly all previous schemes have used single- or few-mode optomechanical systems. By contrast, new dynamics and applications are expected when using optomechanical lattices9, which enable the synthesis of non-trivial band structures, and these lattices have been actively studied in the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics10. Superconducting microwave optomechanical circuits2 are a promising platform to implement such lattices, but have been compounded by strict scaling limitations. Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate topological microwave modes in one-dimensional circuit optomechanical chains realizing the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model11,12. Furthermore, we realize the strained graphene model13,14 in a two-dimensional optomechanical honeycomb lattice. Exploiting the embedded optomechanical interaction, we show that it is possible to directly measure the mode functions of the hybridized modes without using any local probe15,16. This enables us to reconstruct the full underlying lattice Hamiltonian and directly measure the existing residual disorder. Such optomechanical lattices, accompanied by the measurement techniques introduced, offer an avenue to explore collective17,18, quantum many-body19 and quench20 dynamics, topological properties9,21 and, more broadly, emergent nonlinear dynamics in complex optomechanical systems with a large number of degrees of freedom22–24. Optomechanical lattices in one and two dimensions with exceptionally low disorder are realized, showing how the optomechanical interaction can be exploited for direct measurements of the Hamiltonian, beyond the tight-binding approximation."
https://openalex.org/W4312069074,"Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 due to their immunosuppressed state and reduced immunogenicity from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. This investigation examined the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination status and mortality among SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19.A retrospective, registry-based chart review was conducted investigating COVID-19 mortality among immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. Electronic health record data was collected from consecutive SOT recipients who received a diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test between March 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021. The primary exposure was COVID-19 vaccination status at time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients were considered 'fully vaccinated' at fourteen days after completing their vaccine course. COVID-19 mortality within 60 days and intensive care unit admission within 30 days were primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Among 646 SOT recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Houston Methodist Hospital between March 2020, and October 2021, 70 (10.8%) expired from COVID-19 within 60 days. Transplanted organs included 63 (9.8%) heart, 355 (55.0%) kidney, 108 (16.7%) liver, 70 (10.8%) lung, and 50 (7.7%) multi-organ. Increasing age was a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, while vaccination within 180 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was protective in Cox proportional hazard models with hazard ratio 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06) and 0.31 (0.11-0.90), respectively). These findings were confirmed in the propensity score matched cohort between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.This investigation found COVID-19 mortality may be significantly reduced among immunosuppressed SOT recipients within 6 months following vaccination. These findings can inform vaccination policies targeting immunosuppressed populations worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4312091480,"Healthcare accounts for approximately 5% of emissions in developed nations, and the public healthcare provider in the United Kingdom (UK), the National Health Service (NHS), has set a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 without detriment to its quality of patient care. With Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs; a.k.a. drones, UAS, or RPAS) starting to be used in healthcare systems outside the UK, there is interest in how they could be integrated into NHS operations to transport diagnostic specimens. Reflecting on a business-as-usual analysis of current NHS diagnostic specimen logistics across the Solent region (southern UK), this paper critically evaluates the practical reality of integrating UAV deliveries of this commodity, identifying the benefits and challenges that must be addressed to realise commercial services, including dangerous goods legislation, cargo stability, routing, and weather. In the analysis, 14 out of 79 surgeries could be realistically served by a 5m wingspan vertical take-off/landing (VTOL) UAV: seven directly, and seven via ground-based transfers. The results suggested that an average of 1,628 samples could be served by UAV each week, resulting in 42 flights/week with 10 taxi services to cover periods where weather limited flying. This equated to an approximate total service cost of £2,964/week if regulations develop to relax UAV personnel constraints. The introduction of UAVs reduced the marginal external costs (greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, and air pollution) by £196 per week and cut travel times to UAV served sites by 72% (weather permitting). Tailpipe emissions (excl. taxis), vehicle-kilometres travelled, and van costs were reduced by 20%, 20%, and 23% (respectively), but the overall system cost increased by 56%. Whilst this increase is likely to make the introduction of UAV services financially challenging, the benefits in terms of emissions and journey time savings may offset some of the additional cost and warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4312094292,"Abstract Identification of the genes and processes mediating genetic association signals for complex diseases represents a major challenge. As many of the genetic signals for type 2 diabetes (T2D) exert their effects through pancreatic islet-cell dysfunction, we performed a genome-wide pooled CRISPR loss-of-function screen in a human pancreatic beta cell line. We assessed the regulation of insulin content as a disease-relevant readout of beta cell function and identified 580 genes influencing this phenotype. Integration with genetic and genomic data provided experimental support for 20 candidate T2D effector transcripts including the autophagy receptor CALCOCO2 . Loss of CALCOCO2 was associated with distorted mitochondria, less proinsulin-containing immature granules and accumulation of autophagosomes upon inhibition of late-stage autophagy. Carriers of T2D-associated variants at the CALCOCO2 locus further displayed altered insulin secretion. Our study highlights how cellular screens can augment existing multi-omic efforts to support mechanistic understanding and provide evidence for causal effects at genome-wide association studies loci."
https://openalex.org/W4312091472,"The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) makes the largest genetic contribution to multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility, with 32 independent effects across the region explaining 20% of the heritability in European populations. Variation is high across populations with allele frequency differences and population-specific risk alleles identified. We sought to identify MHC-specific MS susceptibility variants and assess the effect of ancestral risk modification within 2652 Latinx and Hispanic individuals as well as 2435 Black and African American individuals. We have identified several novel susceptibility alleles which are rare in European populations including HLA-B*53:01, and we have utilized the differing linkage disequilibrium patterns inherent to these populations to identify an independent role for HLA-DRB1*15:01 and HLA-DQB1*06:02 on MS risk. We found a decrease in Native American ancestry in MS cases vs controls across the MHC, peaking near the previously identified MICB locus with a decrease of ~5.5% in Hispanics and ~0.4% in African Americans. We have identified several susceptibility variants, including within the MICB gene region, which show global ancestry risk modification and indicate ancestral differences which may be due in part to correlated environmental factors. We have also identified several susceptibility variants for which MS risk is modified by local ancestry and indicate true ancestral genetic differences; including HLA-DQB1*06:02 for which MS risk for European allele carriers is almost two times the risk for African allele carriers. These results validate the importance of investigating MS susceptibility at an ancestral level and offer insight into the epidemiology of MS phenotypic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W4312060055,"Expert consensus on the potential benefits of early cancer detection does not exist for most cancer types. We convened 10 practicing oncologists using a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi panel to evaluate which of 20 solid tumors, representing >40 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)-identified cancer types and 80% of total cancer incidence, would receive potential clinical benefits from early detection. Pre-meeting, experts estimated how long cancers take to progress and rated the current curability and benefit (improvement in curability) of an annual hypothetical multi-cancer screening blood test. Post-meeting, experts rerated all questions. Cancers had varying estimates of the potential benefit of early cancer detection depending on estimates of their curability and progression by stage. Cancers rated as progressing quickly and being curable in earlier stages (stomach, esophagus, lung, urothelial tract, melanoma, ovary, sarcoma, bladder, cervix, breast, colon/rectum, kidney, uterus, anus, head and neck) were estimated to be most likely to benefit from a hypothetical screening blood test. Cancer types rated as progressing quickly but having comparatively lower cure rates in earlier stages (liver/intrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder, pancreas) were estimated to have medium likelihood of benefit from a hypothetical screening blood test. Cancer types rated as progressing more slowly and having higher curability regardless of stage (prostate, thyroid) were estimated to have limited likelihood of benefit from a hypothetical screening blood test. The panel concluded most solid tumors have a likelihood of benefit from early detection. Even among difficult-to-treat cancers (e.g., pancreas, liver/intrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder), early-stage detection was believed to be beneficial. Based on the panel consensus, broad coverage of cancers by screening blood tests would deliver the greatest potential benefits to patients."
https://openalex.org/W4312069092,"Introduction Birth asphyxia is one of the leading causes of early neonatal mortality, which causes an estimated 900,000 deaths annually. Therefore, assessing the survival status and predictors of mortality among asphyxiated neonates will be highly helpful to policymakers in designing, implementing, and evaluating programs to achieve the sustainable development goal of reducing neonatal mortality as low as 12/1,000 live births by 2030. Methods A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 378 asphyxiated neonates admitted to the NICU of Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from January, 2017 –December, 2019. The data were collected from eligible records by using a structured data extraction tool from March 30 –April 21, 2020. The data were cleaned manually and entered into Epi-data version 7.1.2.0, and STATA version 16 was used for the analysis. Bivariate and Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were performed, and significant predictors were identified using 95% confidence interval and p-value &lt;0.05. Result A total of 378 neonates were followed for 2298 neonatal days, ranging from 1 to 28 days. The mortality incidence rate was 5.3/100 person-days-of observation (95% CI: 4.41, 6.29), and 32% (95% CI: 27.6%, 36.8%) of the study subjects died. Admission weight (AHR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.72), seizure (AHR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.27), neonates who received resuscitation (AHR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.18, 3.80), and stage of asphyxia (moderate (AHR: 3.50; 95% CI: 1.55, 8.36), and severe (AHR: 11.55; 95% CI: 4.73, 28.25)) were significant predictors of neonatal mortality among asphyxiated neonates. Conclusion The magnitude of neonatal mortality among asphyxiated neonates in the study area was high. Admission weight, seizure, resuscitation, and stage of asphyxia were significant predictors of mortality among neonates with asphyxia. Therefore, special attention should be given to asphyxiated neonates with low admission weight and those who had seizure. Additionally, the timing, quality, and effectiveness of resuscitation might need further assessment and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4312070720,"The incidence of treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC) has been greatly increasing after the usage of secondgeneration androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is closely associated with ARPI treatment failure and poor prognosis in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of NED are not fully understood. Here we report that upregulation of TRIM59, a TRIM family protein, is strongly correlated with ARPI treatment mediated NED and shorter patient survival in PCas. AR binds to TRIM59 promoter and represses its transcription. ARPI treatment leads to a reversal of repressive epigenetic modifications on TRIM59 gene and the transcriptional restraint on TRIM59 by AR. Upregulated TRIM59 then drives the NED of PCa by enhancing the degradation of RB1 and P53 and upregulating downstream lineage plasticity-promoting transcription factor SOX2. Altogether, TRIM59 is negatively regulated by AR and acts as a key driver for NED in PCas. Our study provides a novel prognostic marker for PCas and shed new light on the molecular pathogenesis of t-NEPC, a deadly variant of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W4312091585,"Domestic violence's most frequently reported outcomes are preterm delivery and low birthweight, both of which are the strongest correlates of mortality and morbidity. Several studies have shown that pregnant women with domestic violence during pregnancy were more likely to deliver low-birthweight and preterm neonates. However, there has been no consensus on associations between domestic violence and low-birthweight and preterm delivery. To examine the impact of domestic violence on birthweight stratified by preterm or full-term delivery, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted that linked four national databases in Taiwan. A total of 1,322 subjects associated with a report of domestic violence during pregnancy were compared with 485,981 subjects without any record of reported domestic violence. The percentage of low birthweight in the group exposed to domestic violence was significantly higher than in the unexposed group with full-term delivery (4.9% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that pregnant women exposed to domestic violence had an OR of 1.37 (95% CI 1.05, 1.79) for low birthweight in full-term delivery. However, domestic violence was not significantly associated with low birthweight in preterm delivery. Screening for intimate partner violence in the perinatal health care system should be seen as especially important for women who have had full-term low-birthweight neonates."
https://openalex.org/W4312059985,"Background Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a known contributor to teratogen and causes a range of effects on pregnancy and birth outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variation and determinants of alcohol consumption among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data. A total of 1,135 pregnant women were included in the analysis. ArcGIS version 10.7 software was used to explore the spatial distribution of alcohol consumption, and SaTScan version 9.6 was employed to identify the significant spatial clusters of alcohol consumption. A mixed multi-level logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the determinant factors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results The result showed that the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy was 22.49% (with a 95% CI: 18.18 to 26.17). The spatial analysis showed that the spatial distribution of alcohol consumption significantly varied across the country [Global Moran’s I value = 0.30 (P&lt;0.001)]. The SaTScan analysis identified two most likely clusters with high rates of alcohol consumption such as northwest Ethiopia (Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) = 155.56, p &lt; 0.001) and central Ethiopia (LLR = 19.27, p&lt;0.01). Never in union, divorced and/ widowed [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.56; 95% CI: 1 . 07 , 10 . 14 ], attended primary school [AOR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0 . 27 , 0 . 95 ], having two or more lifetime sexual partners [AOR = 2.59; 95% CI: 1 . 11 , 6 . 18 ], living in rural [AOR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1 . 12 , 2 . 93 ] and higher community media exposure [AOR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0 . 28 , 0 . 97 ] were the factors associated with alcohol consumption. Conclusion Alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Ethiopia was high. The spatial distribution of alcohol consumption was significantly varied across the country. Therefore, public health interventions targeting areas with high alcohol consumption are needed for drinking cessation and to prevent poor pregnancy outcomes related to alcohol use."
https://openalex.org/W4312060059,"Background In sub-Saharan Africa, high HIV incidence rates in adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) persist despite extensive HIV prevention efforts. Methods A prospective cohort of 2,710 HIV-negative AGYW (15–24 years) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were interviewed at baseline and followed-up approximately 18 months later (2014–2017). Associations between HIV seroconversion and socio-demographic and behavioural variables measured at baseline and follow-up were examined using Cox regression and a proximate determinants framework. Inter-relationships between determinants were measured using logistic regression. Separate models were built for 15–19 and 20-24-year-olds. Results Weighted HIV incidence was 3.92 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval: 3.27–4.69; 163 seroconversions over 4,016 person-years). Among 15-19-year-olds, absence of family support (adjusted hazards ratio (aHR): 3.82 (1.89–7.72)), having a circumcised partner (aHR: 0.5 (0.27–0.94)) or one who was HIV-positive and not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (aHR: 6.21 (2.56–15.06)) were associated with HIV incidence. Those reporting an absence of family support were also more likely to report &gt;1 partner during follow-up (odds ratio (OR): 2.7(1.11–6.57)). Among 20-24-year-olds, failure to complete secondary school (aHR: 1.89 (1.11–3.21)), inconsistent condom use (aHR: 3.01 (1.14–7.96)) and reporting partner(s) who were HIV-positive and not on ART (aHR: 7.75 (3.06–19.66)) were associated with HIV incidence. Failure to complete secondary school among 20-24-year-olds was associated with inconsistent condom use (OR: 1.82 (1.20–2.77)) and reporting an HIV-positive partner not on ART (OR: 3.53(1.59–7.82)) or an uncircumcised partner (OR: 1.39 (1.08–1.82). Conclusion Absence of family support and incomplete schooling are associated with risky sexual behaviours and HIV acquisition in AGYW. In addition, partner-level prevention—condom use, medical circumcision, and viral suppression–continue to play an important role in reducing HIV risk in AGYW. These findings support the use of combination HIV prevention programs that consider structural as well as biological and behavioural HIV risk factors in their design."
https://openalex.org/W4312060070,"Early life environments afford infants a variety of learning opportunities, and caregivers play a fundamental role in shaping infant early life experience. Variation in maternal attitudes and parenting practices is likely to be greater between than within cultures. However, there is limited cross-cultural work characterising how early life environment differs across populations. We examined the early life environment of infants from two cultural contexts where attitudes towards parenting and infant development were expected to differ: in a group of 53 mother-infant dyads in the UK and 44 mother-infant dyads in Uganda. Participants were studied longitudinally from when infants were 3– to 15–months-old. Questionnaire data revealed the Ugandan mothers had more relational attitudes towards parenting than the mothers from the UK, who had more autonomous parenting attitudes. Using questionnaires and observational methods, we examined whether infant development and experience aligned with maternal attitudes. We found the Ugandan infants experienced a more relational upbringing than the UK infants, with Ugandan infants receiving more distributed caregiving, more body contact with their mothers, and more proximity to mothers at night. Ugandan infants also showed earlier physical development compared to UK infants. Contrary to our expectations, however, Ugandan infants were not in closer proximity to their mothers during the day, did not have more people in proximity or more partners for social interaction compared to UK infants. In addition, when we examined attitudes towards specific behaviours, mothers’ attitudes rarely predicted infant experience in related contexts. Taken together our findings highlight the importance of measuring behaviour, rather than extrapolating expected behaviour based on attitudes alone. We found infants’ early life environment varies cross-culturally in many important ways and future research should investigate the consequences of these differences for later development."
https://openalex.org/W4312091516,"Population-based cancer registration methods are subject to internationally-established rules. To ensure efficient and effective case recording, population-based cancer registries widely adopt digital processing (DP) methods. At the Veneto Tumor Registry (RTV), about 50% of all digitally-identified (putative) cases of cancer are further profiled by means of registrars' assessments (RAs). Taking these RAs for reference, the present study examines how well the registry's DP performs. A series of 1,801 (putative) incident and prevalent cancers identified using DP methods were randomly assigned to two experienced registrars (blinded to the DP output), who independently re-assessed every case. This study focuses on the concordance between the DP output and the RAs as concerns cancer status (incident versus prevalent), topography, and morphology. The RAs confirmed the cancer status emerging from DP for 1,266/1,317 incident cancers (positive predictive value [PPV] = 96.1%) and 460/472 prevalent cancers (PPV = 97.5%). This level of concordance ranks as ""optimal"", with a Cohen's K value of 0.91. The overall prevalence of false-positive cancer cases identified by DP was 2.9%, and was affected by the number of digital variables available. DP and the RAs were consistent in identifying cancer topography in 88.7% of cases; differences concerned different sites within the same anatomo-functional district (according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC]) in 9.6% of cases. In short, using DP for cancer case registration suffers from only trivial inconsistencies. The efficiency and reliability of digital cancer registration is influenced by the availability of good-quality clinical information, and the regular interdisciplinary monitoring of a registry's DP performance."

It is also known that annexin V 2D crystals show two types of symmetric patterns with six-fold symmetry ( p 6) and three-fold symmetry ( p 3). The p 6 lattice also contains additional trimers in the gaps between the p 6 axes, which are also referred to as non- p 6 trimers because they do not participate in the formation of the p 6 lattice. We here show that the annexin V N-terminal has significant influence on 2D crystal formation using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) observations. We also present a quick purification method to purify recombinant annexin V without any residual affinity tag after protein purification in ~3h."
https://openalex.org/W4312098068,"Background Open-access (OA) publishing is increasingly prevalent in dermatology, and many journals now offer hybrid options, including conventional (subscription-based access [SA]) publishing or OA (with an author publishing charge) in a subscription journal. OA publishing has been noted in many disciplines, but this has been rarely studied in dermatology. Methods Using the Clarivate Journal Citation Report, we compiled a list of English-language dermatology hybrid OA journals containing more than 5% OA articles. We sampled any OA review or original research article in 4 issues from 2018 to 2019 and matched an equal number of SA articles. Citation count, citation count excluding self-citations and view counts found using Scopus and Altmetrics score were recorded for each article. Statistical analyses were performed using logistic and negative binomial models using R software. Results Twenty-seven hybrid dermatology journals were found, and 538 articles were sampled (269 OA, 269 SA). For both original research and review articles, OA articles had significantly higher mean citation counts (mean 13.2, standard deviation [SD] 17.0) compared to SA articles (mean 7.9, SD 8.8) (odds ratio [OR] 1.04; 95% CI 1.02–1.05; P &lt; .001) including when adjusted for time from publication. Original research OA articles had significantly higher citation counts than original research SA articles (excluding self-citations; OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05; P = .003), and review articles also had OA citation advantage than review SA articles (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02–1.11; P = .008). There was, however, no significant difference in citation counts between review articles and original research articles (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.19–5.31; P = 1.000). There was no significant difference seen in view counts (OA: mean±SD 17.7±10.8; SA: mean±SD 17.1±12.4) and Altmetric score (OA: mean±SD 13.2±47.8; SA: mean±SD 6.3±25.0) between OA and SA articles. Potential confounders included the fact that more OA articles were published in Europe than in Asia, and pharmaceutical-funded articles were more likely to be published OA. Conclusions We noted a higher citation count for OA articles than SA articles in dermatology hybrid journals. However, dermatology researchers should take into account confounding factors when deciding whether to increase the impact of their work by selecting OA over SA publishing."
https://openalex.org/W4312098289,"This article presents a novel mathematical model to describe the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of social and health events: it uses 15 compartments, 7 convolution integrals and 4 types of infected individuals, asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe. A unique feature of this work is that the convolutions and the compartments have been selected to maximize the number of independent input parameters, leading to a 56-parameter model where only one had to evolve over time. The results show that 1) the proposed mathematical model is flexible and robust enough to describe the complex dynamic of the pandemic during the first three waves of the COVID-19 spread in the region of Madrid (Spain) and 2) the proposed model allows us to calculate the number of asymptomatic individuals and the number of persons who presented antibodies during the first waves. The study shows that the following results are compatible with the reported data: close to 28% of the infected individuals were asymptomatic during the three waves, close to 29% of asymptomatic individuals were detected during the subsequent waves and close to 26% of the Madrid population had antibodies at the end of the third wave. This calculated number of persons with antibodies is in great agreement with four direct measurements obtained from an independent sero-epidemiological research. In addition, six calculated curves (total number of confirmed cases, asymptomatic who are confirmed as positive, hospital admissions and discharges and intensive care units admissions) show good agreement with data from an epidemiological surveillance database."
https://openalex.org/W4312114092,"The gap in bowel cancer screening participation rates between the lowest socioeconomic position (SEP) groups and the highest in Australia is widening. This study estimates the long-term health impacts and healthcare costs at current colorectal cancer (CRC) screening participation rates by SEP in South Australia (SA).A Markov microsimulation model for each socioeconomic quintile in SA estimated health outcomes over the lifetime of a population aged 50-74 years (total n = 513,000). The model simulated the development of CRC, considering participation rates in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program and estimated numbers of cases of CRC, CRC deaths, adenomas detected, mean costs of screening and treatment, and quality adjusted life years. Screened status, stage of diagnosis and survival were obtained for patients diagnosed with CRC in 2006-2013 using data linked to the SA Cancer Registry.We predict 10915 cases of CRC (95%CI: 8017─13812) in the lowest quintile (Q1), 17% more than the highest quintile (Q5) and 3265 CRC deaths (95%CI: 2120─4410) in Q1, 24% more than Q5. Average costs per person, were 29% higher in Q1 at $11997 ($8754─$15240) compared to Q5 $9281 ($6555─$12007). When substituting Q1 screening and diagnostic testing rates with Q5's, 17% more colonoscopies occur and adenomas and cancers detected increase by 102% in Q1.Inequalities were evident in CRC cases and deaths, as well as adenomas and cancers that could be detected earlier. Implementing programs to increase screening uptake and follow-up tests for lower socioeconomic groups is critical to improve the health of these priority population groups."
https://openalex.org/W4312114384,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, recent studies have shown that chronic PPI use is associated with the progression of endothelial senescence and cerebrovascular diseases. We hypothesized that PPI users might be vulnerable to fast progression of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) with cumulative effects. Four hundred and eleven patients, who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, more than twice between January 2010 and December 2016 were screened. Patients aged &lt; 50 years, and those who had concomitant diseases that might affect the progression of cerebral SVD were excluded. Baseline characteristics were collected. We evaluated the severity of SVD using the Fazekas score, the number of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and assessed the progression of SVD or CMBs based on the cumulative dose of PPIs. Among the included patients (N = 137), 39 were PPI ever-users. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that PPI use was independently associated with the progression of Fazekas score only in the deep white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.891, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.210–6.906, P = 0.017). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, long-term PPI use was associated with a progression of Fazekas score in the deep WMH (HR 3.453, 95% CI 1.027–9.475, P = 0.045). However, PPI use was not associated with the progression of CMB. The present study results suggest that long-term use of PPIs is associated with the progression of deep cerebral WMH. Further research is needed using a large number of patients to validate this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3095942904,"We study how individuals' effort contribution to a team production task varies depending on whether the task is ego relevant or not. We conduct an experiment to test the effect of ego-relevance when the team production depends on the team's top- or bottom-performer. Ego-relevance is manipulated by calling the Raven IQ Test an ""IQ Task"" or a ""Pattern Task."" We find that the effort contributed to the task is affected by ego-relevance and the impact of the team production function on effort contribution is mediated by the teammate's expected effort contribution. Ego-relevance increases the responsiveness to the teammate's expected effort contributions. Similarly, more responsive behavior is noticeable when the team production depends on the bottom-performer. However, we do not observe interaction-effects between ego-relevance and the team production function that affect effort contributions."

Participants were randomly allocated to 20 BEATVIC group sessions (n = 53) or befriending group sessions (n = 52). Short term effects on risk factors for victimization (e.g. social cognitive deficits, inadequate interpersonal behavior, low self-esteem, internalized stigma, aggression regulation problems), physical fitness and secondary outcomes were expected. At six-month follow-up, the effect on victimization (either a 50% reduction or an absence of victimization incidents) was examined.Intervention-dropout was 28.30% for BEATVIC and 39.62% for befriending. In both conditions the majority of participants (60.5% BEATVIC vs 62.9% befriending) showed a reduction or absence of victimization incidents at six months follow-up, which was not significantly different according to condition. Multilevel analyses revealed no main effect of time and no significant time x group interaction on other outcome measures. Per protocol analyses (participants attending ≥ 75% of the sessions) did not change these results.Although a reduction or absence of victimization was found at short term follow-up for the majority of participants, BEATVIC was not more effective than the active control condition. No short-term additional effects on risk factors of victimization were found. Analysis of the data at 2-year follow-up is warranted to investigate possible effects in the long-term.Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN21423535."
https://openalex.org/W4312060016,"The goal in appendicitis is early diagnosis and early treatment. Complications develop as treatment is delayed. Therefore, there is a need for fast, low-cost markers that can be diagnosed earlier. The aim of this study is to show the effectiveness of immature granulocyte (IG) level in determining the complication of acute appendicitis.In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 99 patients with acute appendicitis and 41 control groups were included in the study. Acute appendicitis patients were divided into two groups as acute simple appendicitis(n = 65) and acute complicated appendicitis(n = 34). In all groups, demographic data, immature granulocyte (IG) count(x103/μL), IG ratio (IG%), white blood cell (WBC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PNL), lymphocyte, monocyte, platelet, mean platelet volume (MPV), ferritin levels were recorded. The blood analyses were performed the Mindray BC6800 automated hematology analyzer using standard laboratory protocols. All statistical testing was undertaken using IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac.Compared to the acute simple appendicitis, acute complicated appendicitis patients had significantly higher levels WBC, PNL, monocyte, IG count, and IG% (p = 0.009, p = 0047, p = 0.001, p = 0.018; respectively) while there was no significant difference in ferritin between groups (p = 0.49). In the ROC analysis, AUC value was found for IG count and IG% (0.893 and 0.725, cut-off 0.005 and 0.05; respectively) for acute appendicitis. The negative predictive value of IG for Acute Appendicitis was 85% and was the same as that of WBC. In acute complicated appendicitis, the AUC for IG and IG% was 0.796 (cut-off 0.02) and 0.693 (cut-off 0.2), respectively. Positive Likelihood Ratio (+LR; 2.1) value of IG was found higher than other complete blood count (CBC) tests.The IG count is test with fast, more predictive value than another CBC tests, and without cost in the early diagnosis of acute complicated appendicitis. It is strong negative predictive test for Acute Appendicitis disease."

The study assessed the availability, price, and affordability of medicines used in the management of Covid-19 in health facilities of Dessie town. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study design was employed in the health facilities of Dessie town from September 1 to September 20, 2021. Data was collected using a standard checklist adopted from the Logistics Indicator Assessment Tool and WHO/HAI. WHO/HAI methodology was applied to select the surveyed health facilities (30) and medicines (44). The daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker is used to estimate affordability. Results Fifteen and five medicines were not found at all public and private health facilities, respectively. The originator brand (OB) and lowest price generic (LPG) availability in private health facilities was 2.03% and 51.33%, respectively. In the public sector, the availability of OB and LPG was 0% and 34.44%, respectively. In public and private health facilities, the mean number of stock-outs was 2.25 and 2.91, and the mean number of stock-out days was 177.83 and 106.16 days, respectively. Eight and one LPG medicines were out of stock in public and private health facilities, respectively. Eight (33.33%) and 6 (28.57%) had higher prices than international prices in private and public health facilities, respectively. The median price ratio in public and private health facilities ranged from 0.02 and 3.05 and 0.04 to 2.70, respectively. Eighty percent of the products were unaffordable in both sectors. Conclusions The availability of medicines was low. One-third of the medicines had higher prices than international prices. Eighty percent of the products were unaffordable.

The sample size was 634, and students were randomly selected from public and private secondary schools. The 81 items were developed reviewing different literatures based on the constructs of HBM. The constructs were perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, perceived benefit, perceived barrier, self-efficacy, cues to action, perceived school support and self-protective practice. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The data were cleaned, entered into and analyzed using SPSS 23.0. A principal axis factoring with varimax rotation was carried out to extract items. Items with no loading factor or cross-loaded items were deleted. Items having factor loading coefficient of ≥0.4 were retained. An internal reliability was ensured at Cronbach's alpha >0.70. All items with corrected item-total correlation coefficient below 0.30 were deleted from reliability analysis.In this study, 576 respondents were participated making a response rate of 90.8%. A total of thirty items were extracted and loaded in to eleven factors with cumulative variance of 56.719%. Percieved social support, percieved benefit, percieved school responsibility, self-efficacy, and practice items were internally consistent. Percieved vurnerability was neither valid nor reliable construct. Similarly, from the extracted factors, attitude towards face mask use and percieved peer influence were not internally consistent. Lastly, percieved benefit, self-efficacy and percieved school responsibility significantly predicted student's adherence to COVID-19 self-protective practices.The study found that perceived benefit, perceived school support, social support, self-efficacy, perceived school environment cleanness, perceived school responsibility, perceived school health education, attitude to use face mask, perceived severity, cues to action and perceived peer influence were valid.

https://openalex.org/W4312090549,"Individuals that initiate alcohol use at younger ages and binge drink during adolescence are more susceptible to developing alcohol use disorder. Adolescents are relatively insensitive to the aversive effects of alcohol and tend to consume significantly more alcohol per occasion than adults, an effect that is conserved in rodent models. Adolescent typical insensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol may promote greater alcohol intake by attenuating internal cues that curb its consumption. Attenuated sensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol is also retained into adulthood following protracted abstinence from adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. Despite these effects, much remains unknown regarding the neural contributors. In the present study, we used a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm to investigate neuronal activation in late-developing forebrain structures of male adolescents and adult cFos-LacZ transgenic rats as well as in AIE adults following consumption of 0.9% sodium chloride previously paired with an intraperitoneal injection of 0, 1.5 or 2.5 g/kg of ethanol. Adults that were non-manipulated or received water exposure during adolescence showed CTA to both ethanol doses, whereas adolescents displayed CTA only to the 2.5 g/kg ethanol dose. Adults who experienced AIE did not show CTA. Adults displayed increased neuronal activation indexed via number of β-galactosidase positive (β-gal+) cells in the prefrontal and insular cortex that was absent in adolescents, whereas adolescents but not adults had a reduced number of β-gal+ cells in the central amygdala. Adults also displayed greater cortical-insular functional connectivity than adolescents as well as insular-amygdalar and prefrontal cortex-accumbens core functional connectivity. Like adolescents, adults previously exposed to AIE displayed reduced prefrontal-insular cortex and prefrontal-accumbal core functional connectivity. Taken together, these results suggest that attenuated sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol is related to a loss of an insular-prefrontal cortex-accumbens core circuit."
https://openalex.org/W4312091509,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systematic and active investigation of TB contacts. However, lower priority is given to contact investigation among other non-pulmonary bacteriologically confirmed (PBC) cases; it thus contributes to the scarce information on the yield of TB among contacts of index TB patients without microbiological confirmation (non-PBC patients). This study therefore aimed at establishing the yield of TB among contacts of PBC and non-PBC index TB patients in the urban setting of central Uganda. Methods We abstracted data from the Uganda national TB contact investigation registers present at 48 health facilities for the period January 2018 to August 2020. The screening yield for both PBC and non-PBC, timing of TB diagnosis among contacts were determined. Logistic regression was used to examine predictors for diagnosing contacts as non PBC TB patients. Results From January 2018 to August 2020, 234 persons were diagnosed with TB from a total of 14,275 contacts traced for both PBC and non-PBC TB index patients at 48 facilities. Of these, 100(42.7%) were contacts of non-PBC index patients. TB screening yield was higher among contacts of non PBC 100(2.0%) compared to 134(1.4%) among contacts of PBC index patients. For both groups, over 80% of their contacts were diagnosed with TB within 3 months from the day of TB treatment start of the index case. On multivariate logistic regression the only predictor for diagnosing contacts as non PBC TB patients was age under15 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.53, 95% CI [3.27–17.3] p = &lt;0.05). Conclusion The yield of TB among contacts of non-PBC index case is nearly the same for contacts of PBC index cases and most contacts were diagnosed with TB disease during the intensive TB treatment phase of the index case. There was no association between the type of TB (PBC, non-PBC) disease diagnosed in the contacts, and that of index TB patients. To improve TB case-finding, emphasis should be placed on contact investigation for household and close contacts of all other index cases with pulmonary tuberculosis regardless of whether PBC or non-PBC during the intensive phase of treatment."

Two hundred weaned piglets, 20 days old, 4.69 ± 0.56 kg, were submitted during the nursery phase (20 to 69 days of age) to four treatments: control (CTR)-without any additive supplementation; ENR (with 8 ppm of enramycin throughout), BUT (with 2000 ppm between 20 to 34 d, 1500 ppm between 34 to 48 d and 1000 ppm between 48 to 69 d), and PHYTO (150 ppm between 20 to 48 d). At 62 days old, forty piglets (10 replicates per treatment) were slaughtered to perform bacterial identification through 16S rRNA (V3-V4) sequencing of the caecal content. During the second phase of the trial (34 to 48 days), the BUT group showed higher DWG (P = 0.023) and BW (P = 0.039) than the CTR group, and all groups that received additives had better FCR than the CTR group (P = 0.001). In the last phase of the trial (48 to 69 days), the ENR group presented a better FCR (P = 0.054) than the CRT and other groups. In the total period (20 to 69 days), ENR and BUT showed better FCR (P = 0.006) than CRT. Diarrhoea incident data showed differences (P<0.05), favouring the BUT treatment compared to the CTR. Only the Megasphaeraceae and Streptococcaceae families showed differences (p<0.05) in relative abundance between CTR and PHYTO and between CTR and BUT, respectively. Differential abundances of the Megasphaera and Streptococcus genera were observed between CTR and PHYTO and CTR and BUT. Phytogenics and encapsulated sodium butyrate are able and effective for modulating the specific caecal microbiota, improving performance and controlling diarrhoea occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4312091535,"The restoration of the once abundant Cisco (Coregonus artedi) is a management interest across the Laurentian Great Lakes. To inform the restoration, we (1) described historical distributions of Cisco and (2) explored whether non-indigenous Rainbow Smelt (Osmerus mordax) and Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) played a role in the decline of Cisco populations across the upper Great Lakes (i.e., Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron). Our source data were collected from fishery-independent surveys conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's research vessel R/V Cisco in 1952-1962. By analyzing data collected by gill-net surveys, we confirmed the importance of embayment and shallow-water habitats to Cisco. We found that Cisco was abundant in Whitefish Bay and Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior, and in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, but we also found a sign of Cisco extirpation in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Our results also showed that Ciscoes generally stayed in waters <80 m in bottom depth throughout the year. However, a substantial number of Ciscoes stayed in very deep waters (>150 m in bottom depth) in summer and fall in Lake Michigan, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these Ciscoes had hybridized with the other Coregonus species. By comparing complementary data collected from bottom-trawl surveys, we concluded that the spatiotemporal overlap between Rainbow Smelt and Cisco likely occurred across the upper Great Lakes throughout 1952-1962. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that Rainbow Smelt played a role in the decline of Cisco populations across the upper Great Lakes in the period. We also found that the spatiotemporal overlap between Alewife and Cisco likely occurred only in Saginaw Bay in fall 1956 and in Lake Michigan after 1960. Thus, any potential recovery of Cisco after the 1950s could have been inhibited by Alewife in Lakes Michigan and Huron."
https://openalex.org/W4312091583,"Research priorities in Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) have rapidly evolved in the last decade. The need for a more efficient use of antimicrobials have fueled plenty of studies to define the optimal duration for antibiotic treatments, and yet, there still are large areas of uncertainty in common clinical scenarios. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been pointed as a priority for clinical research, but it has been unattended by most randomized trials tackling the effectiveness of short treatments. The study protocol of the SHORTEN-2 trial is presented as a practical example of new ways to approach common obstacles for clinical research in AMS.To determine whether a 7-day course of antibiotics is superior to 14-day schemes for treating bloodstream infections by P. aeruginosa (BSI-PA).A superiority, open-label, randomized controlled trial will be performed across 30 Spanish hospitals. Adult patients with uncomplicated BSI-PA will be randomized to receive a 7 versus 14-day course of any active antibiotic. The primary endpoint will be the probability for the 7-day group of achieving better outcomes than the control group, assessing altogether clinical effectiveness, severe adverse events, and antibiotic exposure through a DOOR/RADAR analysis. Main secondary endpoints include treatment failure, BSI-PA relapses, and mortality. A superiority design was set for the primary endpoint and non-inferiority for treatment failure, resulting in a sample size of 304 patients.SHORTEN-2 trial aligns with some of the priorities for clinical research in AMS. The implementation of several methodological innovations allowed overcoming common obstacles, like feasible sample sizes or measuring the clinical impact and unintended effects.EudraCt: 2021-003847-10; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05210439."
https://openalex.org/W4312098284,"Do medical facilities also help advance improvements in socio-economic outcomes? We focus on Veterans, a vulnerable group over the COVID-19 pandemic who have access to a comprehensive healthcare network, and the receipt of funds from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) between April and June as a source of variation. First, we find that Veterans received 3.5% more loans and 6.8% larger loans than their counterparts ( p &lt; 0.01), controlling for a wide array of zipcode characteristics. Second, we develop models to predict the number of PPP loans awarded to Veterans, finding that the inclusion of local VA medical center characteristics adds almost as much explanatory power as the industry and occupational composition in an area and even more than the education, race, and age distribution combined. Our results suggest that VA medical centers can play an important role in helping Veterans thrive even beyond addressing their direct medical needs."
https://openalex.org/W4312098315,"Introduction Intimate partner violence is increasingly gaining attention as the leading form of violence against women globally, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. Given that substance abuse, especially alcohol consumption has long been associated with aggressive behaviour, emotional abuse, and sexual misconduct, it is surprising that studies on the potential association between partner’s alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence are scarce. The current study seeks to fill this gap in the literature by examining the association between partner’s alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Cross-sectional survey data of 89,229 women aged 15 to 49 in sexual unions from 21 sub-Saharan African countries were pooled from the Demographic and Health Surveys. Percentages with their corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were used to present the results of the prevalence of partner’s alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between partner’s alcohol consumption and intimate partner violence. The regression analysis results were presented using adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% CI. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results The pooled prevalence of partner alcohol consumption was 36.3% [36.0–36.6]. The highest prevalence of partner alcohol consumption was found in Burundi (67.1%) with Mali (3.9%) recording the lowest prevalence. Similarly, the overall prevalence of physical violence, emotional violence, and sexual violence among the women were 19.7% [19.2–20.2], 25.0% [24.5–25.5], and 9.7% [9.3–10.1], respectively. In the pooled data, women whose partners consumed alcohol were more likely to experience physical violence [aOR = 2.37, 95% CI = 2.24–2.50], emotional violence [aOR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.86–2.07], and sexual violence [aOR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.89–2.18] compared to those whose partners did not consume alcohol. In all the 21 countries, women whose partners consumed alcohol had higher odds for physical and emotional violence. The odds of sexual violence was higher among women whose partners consumed alcohol compared to their counterparts whose partners did not in 20 countries, except Namibia. Conclusions We found that partner’s alcohol consumption increases women’s likelihood of experiencing physical, emotional, and sexual violence in sub-Saharan Africa. There is the need to implement behavioural change interventions targeted at male partners to reduce alcohol consumption. The findings call for the need to effectively create and organize support networks in addressing intimate partner violence among married and cohabiting women."
https://openalex.org/W4312115093,"This paper investigates gender differences in the treatment effects of business grants on firm performance following natural disasters, and seeks to identify the mechanisms underlying the unequal effects.A panel data-set from an experiment in Sri Lanka is used to measure the difference in the treatment effects of a business grant on the performance of female and male-owned firms following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The sample of 608 microenterprises includes 297 female-owned firms and 311 male-owned firms. There are 338 firms (Male = 176, Female = 162) in the treatment group that received the grant and 270 firms (Male = 135, Female = 135) in the control group that did not receive the grant. Data on firm performance, firm characteristics and owner characteristics were collected in 13 survey waves from April 2005 to December 2010. Firm performance, which is measured by firm profit, is assessed by employing linear regression with fixed effects in an intention-to-treat analysis.The results suggest that the business grant has a positive impact on the performance of male-owned firms, but zero effect on that of female-owned firms. Several potential mechanisms drive the results, including gender differences in business investment, household expenditure and initial business closures. The results also show a positive treatment effect of the business grant on the psychological recovery of recipients, but there is no evidence supporting gender differences in this dimension.This paper provides new evidence on gender differences in the treatment effects of business grants on firm performance in the context of post-disasters, and has implications for business recovery programs aimed at supporting female microentrepreneurs in the aftermath of large-scale catastrophes."
