https://openalex.org/W3086292481,"A key unsolved question in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the duration of acquired immunity. Insights from infections with the four seasonal human coronaviruses might reveal common characteristics applicable to all human coronaviruses. We monitored healthy individuals for more than 35 years and determined that reinfection with the same seasonal coronavirus occurred frequently at 12 months after infection. The durability of immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. Lessons from seasonal coronavirus infections in humans show that reinfections can occur within 12 months of initial infection, coupled with changes in levels of virus-specific antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3084494759,"Although pyroptosis is critical for macrophages against pathogen infection, its role and mechanism in cancer cells remains unclear. PD-L1 has been detected in the nucleus, with unknown function. Here we show that PD-L1 switches TNFα-induced apoptosis to pyroptosis in cancer cells, resulting in tumour necrosis. Under hypoxia, p-Stat3 physically interacts with PD-L1 and facilitates its nuclear translocation, enhancing the transcription of the gasdermin C (GSDMC) gene. GSDMC is specifically cleaved by caspase-8 with TNFα treatment, generating a GSDMC N-terminal domain that forms pores on the cell membrane and induces pyroptosis. Nuclear PD-L1, caspase-8 and GSDMC are required for macrophage-derived TNFα-induced tumour necrosis in vivo. Moreover, high expression of GSDMC correlates with poor survival. Antibiotic chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis in breast cancer. These findings identify a non-immune checkpoint function of PD-L1 and provide an unexpected concept that GSDMC/caspase-8 mediates a non-canonical pyroptosis pathway in cancer cells, causing tumour necrosis."

https://openalex.org/W3086070642,"The therapeutic potential of donor-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has been investigated in diverse diseases1, including steroid-resistant acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGvHD)2. However, conventional manufacturing approaches are hampered by challenges with scalability and interdonor variability, and clinical trials have shown inconsistent outcomes3,4. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential to overcome these challenges, due to their capacity for multilineage differentiation and indefinite proliferation5,6. Nonetheless, human clinical trials of iPSC-derived cells have not previously been completed. CYP-001 (iPSC-derived MSCs) is produced using an optimized, good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant manufacturing process. We conducted a phase 1, open-label clinical trial (no. NCT02923375) in subjects with SR-aGvHD. Sixteen subjects were screened and sequentially assigned to cohort A or cohort B (n = 8 per group). One subject in cohort B withdrew before receiving CYP-001 and was excluded from analysis. All other subjects received intravenous infusions of CYP-001 on days 0 and 7, at a dose level of either 1 × 106 cells per kg body weight, to a maximum of 1 × 108 cells per infusion (cohort A), or 2 × 106 cells per kg body weight, to a maximum dose of 2 × 108 cells per infusion (cohort B). The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of CYP-001, while the secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy based on the proportion of participants who showed a complete response (CR), overall response (OR) and overall survival (OS) by days 28/100. CYP-001 was safe and well tolerated. No serious adverse events were assessed as related to CYP-001. OR, CR and OS rates by day 100 were 86.7, 53.3 and 86.7%, respectively. The therapeutic application of iPSC-derived MSCs may now be explored in diverse inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3085471727,"Membraneless organelles or condensates form through liquid–liquid phase separation1–4, which is thought to underlie gene transcription through condensation of the large-scale nucleolus5–7 or in smaller assemblies known as transcriptional condensates8–11. Transcriptional condensates have been hypothesized to phase separate at particular genomic loci and locally promote the biomolecular interactions underlying gene expression. However, there have been few quantitative biophysical tests of this model in living cells, and phase separation has not yet been directly linked with dynamic transcriptional outputs12,13. Here, we apply an optogenetic approach to show that FET-family transcriptional regulators exhibit a strong tendency to phase separate within living cells, a process that can drive localized RNA transcription. We find that TAF15 has a unique charge distribution among the FET family members that enhances its interactions with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Nascent C-terminal domain clusters at primed genomic loci lower the energetic barrier for nucleation of TAF15 condensates, which in turn further recruit RNA polymerase II to drive transcriptional output. These results suggest that positive feedback between interacting transcriptional components drives localized phase separation to amplify gene expression. Wei et al. show that clusters of unphosphorylated RNA polymerase II seed the nucleation of phase-separated condensates of TAF15, which further recruit RNA polymerase II to amplify transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W3082310709,"This study quantifies the economic effect of a possible lockdown of Tokyo to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The negative effect of such a lockdown may propagate to other regions through supply chains because of supply and demand shortages. Applying an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly 1.6 million firms in Japan, we simulate what would happen to production activities outside Tokyo if production activities that are not essential to citizens’ survival in Tokyo were shut down for a certain period. We find that if Tokyo were locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of 27 trillion yen in Japan or 5.2% of the country’s annual GDP. Although the production that would be shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the lockdown would result in an 86% reduction of the daily production in Japan after one month."
https://openalex.org/W3086094719,"Imaging neuronal networks provides a foundation for understanding the nervous system, but resolving dense nanometer-scale structures over large volumes remains challenging for light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Here we show that X-ray holographic nano-tomography (XNH) can image millimeter-scale volumes with sub-100-nm resolution, enabling reconstruction of dense wiring in Drosophila melanogaster and mouse nervous tissue. We performed correlative XNH and EM to reconstruct hundreds of cortical pyramidal cells and show that more superficial cells receive stronger synaptic inhibition on their apical dendrites. By combining multiple XNH scans, we imaged an adult Drosophila leg with sufficient resolution to comprehensively catalog mechanosensory neurons and trace individual motor axons from muscles to the central nervous system. To accelerate neuronal reconstructions, we trained a convolutional neural network to automatically segment neurons from XNH volumes. Thus, XNH bridges a key gap between LM and EM, providing a new avenue for neural circuit discovery. Kuan, Phelps, et al. used synchrotron X-ray imaging and deep learning to map dense neuronal wiring in fly and mouse tissue, enabling examination of individual cells and connectivity in circuits governing motor control and perceptual decision-making."

https://openalex.org/W3085029011,"The MAPK/ERK kinase MEK is a shared effector of the frequent cancer drivers KRAS and BRAF that has long been pursued as a drug target in oncology1, and more recently in immunotherapy2,3 and ageing4. However, many MEK inhibitors are limited owing to on-target toxicities5-7 and drug resistance8-10. Accordingly, a molecular understanding of the structure and function of MEK within physiological complexes could provide a template for the design of safer and more effective therapies. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of MEK bound to the scaffold KSR (kinase suppressor of RAS) with various MEK inhibitors, including the clinical drug trametinib. The structures reveal an unexpected mode of binding in which trametinib directly engages KSR at the MEK interface. In the bound complex, KSR remodels the prototypical allosteric pocket of the MEK inhibitor, thereby affecting binding and kinetics, including the drug-residence time. Moreover, trametinib binds KSR-MEK but disrupts the related RAF-MEK complex through a mechanism that exploits evolutionarily conserved interface residues that distinguish these sub-complexes. On the basis of these insights, we created trametiglue, which limits adaptive resistance to MEK inhibition by enhancing interfacial binding. Our results reveal the plasticity of an interface pocket within MEK sub-complexes and have implications for the design of next-generation drugs that target the RAS pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3086890576,"The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is a critical hub in networks that process emotional information. While recent studies have indicated that ventral CA1 (vCA1) projection neurons are functionally dissociable, the basic principles of how the inputs and outputs of vCA1 are organized remain unclear. Here, we used viral and sequencing approaches to define the logic of the extended vCA1 circuit. Using high-throughput sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq) to map the axonal projections of thousands of vCA1 neurons, we identify a population of neurons that simultaneously broadcast information to multiple areas known to regulate the stress axis and approach-avoidance behavior. Through molecular profiling and viral input-output tracing of vCA1 projection neurons, we show how neurons with distinct projection targets may differ in their inputs and transcriptional signatures. These studies reveal new organizational principles of vCA1 that may underlie its functional heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W3086062326,"Cancers accumulate mutations that lead to neoantigens, novel peptides that elicit an immune response, and consequently undergo evolutionary selection. Here we establish how negative selection shapes the clonality of neoantigens in a growing cancer by constructing a mathematical model of neoantigen evolution. The model predicts that, without immune escape, tumor neoantigens are either clonal or at low frequency; hypermutated tumors can only establish after the evolution of immune escape. Moreover, the site frequency spectrum of somatic variants under negative selection appears more neutral as the strength of negative selection increases, which is consistent with classical neutral theory. These predictions are corroborated by the analysis of neoantigen frequencies and immune escape in exome and RNA sequencing data from 879 colon, stomach and endometrial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3086825014,"We report on the influence of ~22 million variants on 731 immune cell traits in a cohort of 3,757 Sardinians. We detected 122 significant (P < 1.28 × 10−11) independent association signals for 459 cell traits at 70 loci (53 of them novel) identifying several molecules and mechanisms involved in cell regulation. Furthermore, 53 signals at 36 loci overlapped with previously reported disease-associated signals, predominantly for autoimmune disorders, highlighting intermediate phenotypes in pathogenesis. Collectively, our findings illustrate complex genetic regulation of immune cells with highly selective effects on autoimmune disease risk at the cell-subtype level. These results identify drug-targetable pathways informing the design of more specific treatments for autoimmune diseases. An analysis of 3,757 Sardinian genomes identifies 122 association signals for 459 immune cell traits at 69 loci. Some variants are associated with autoimmune disorders."

https://openalex.org/W3085020181,"Smoothened (SMO), a class Frizzled G protein-coupled receptor (class F GPCR), transduces the Hedgehog signal across the cell membrane. Sterols can bind to its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and to several sites in the seven transmembrane helices (7-TMs) of SMO. However, the mechanism by which sterols regulate SMO via multiple sites is unknown. Here we determined the structures of SMO-Gi complexes bound to the synthetic SMO agonist (SAG) and to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24(S),25-EC). A novel sterol-binding site in the extracellular extension of TM6 was revealed to connect other sites in 7-TMs and CRD, forming an intramolecular sterol channel from the middle side of 7-TMs to CRD. Additional structures of two gain-of-function variants, SMOD384R and SMOG111C/I496C, showed that blocking the channel at its midpoints allows sterols to occupy the binding sites in 7-TMs, thereby activating SMO. These data indicate that sterol transport through the core of SMO is a major regulator of SMO-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3086332450,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive breast cancer are particularly aggressive and associated with unfavorable prognosis. TNBC lacks effective treatments. HER2-positive tumors have treatment options but often acquire resistance to HER2-targeted therapy after initial response. To address these challenges, we determined whether novel combinations of JAK2-STAT3 and SMO-GLI1/tGLI1 inhibitors synergistically target TNBC and HER2 breast cancer since these two pathways are concurrently activated in both tumor types and enriched in metastatic tumors. Herein, we show that novel combinations of JAK2 inhibitors (ruxolitinib and pacritinib) with SMO inhibitors (vismodegib and sonidegib) synergistically inhibited in vitro growth of TNBC and HER2-positive trastuzumab-resistant BT474-TtzmR cells. Synergy was also observed against breast cancer stem cells. To determine if the combination is efficacious in inhibiting metastasis, we treated mice with intracardially inoculated TNBC cells and found the combination to inhibit lung and liver metastases, and prolong host survival without toxicity. The combination inhibited orthotopic growth, VEGF-A expression, and tumor vasculature of both TNBC and HER2-positive trastuzumab-refractory breast cancer. Lung metastasis of orthotopic BT474-TtzmR xenografts was suppressed by the combination. Together, our results indicated that dual targeting of JAK2 and SMO resulted in synergistic suppression of breast cancer growth and metastasis, thereby supporting future clinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W3085860853,"The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global transcription factor that regulates intracellular iron homeostasis in bacteria. The current hypothesis states that when the intracellular “free” iron concentration is elevated, Fur binds ferrous iron, and the iron-bound Fur represses the genes encoding for iron uptake systems and stimulates the genes encoding for iron storage proteins. However, the “iron-bound” Fur has never been isolated from any bacteria. Here we report that the Escherichia coli Fur has a bright red color when expressed in E. coli mutant cells containing an elevated intracellular free iron content because of deletion of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly proteins IscA and SufA. The acid-labile iron and sulfide content analyses in conjunction with the EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements and the site-directed mutagenesis studies show that the red Fur protein binds a [2Fe-2S] cluster via conserved cysteine residues. The occupancy of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur protein is ∼31% in the E. coli iscA/sufA mutant cells and is decreased to ∼4% in WT E. coli cells. Depletion of the intracellular free iron content using the membrane-permeable iron chelator 2,2´-dipyridyl effectively removes the [2Fe-2S] cluster from Fur in E. coli cells, suggesting that Fur senses the intracellular free iron content via reversible binding of a [2Fe-2S] cluster. The binding of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur appears to be highly conserved, because the Fur homolog from Hemophilus influenzae expressed in E. coli cells also reversibly binds a [2Fe-2S] cluster to sense intracellular iron homeostasis.

Inspired by these observations, we reasoned that the global iron regulator Fur may become iron-bound in the E. coli mutant cells in which IscA and its paralog SufA are deleted. Here, we find that recombinant E. coli Fur protein indeed has a bright red color when expressed in the E. coli iscA/sufA mutant cells under aerobic growth conditions. The iron and sulfide content analyses and the EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements show that the red Fur protein binds a novel [2Fe-2S] cluster. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further indicate that the conserved cysteine residues (Cys-93, Cys-96, and Cys-133) in the E. coli Fur are required for the binding of the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The occupancy of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur protein is ∼31% when expressed in the E. coli iscA/sufA mutant cells and is decreased to ∼4% in WT E. coli cells. Moreover, when the intracellular free iron content is depleted using the membrane-permeable iron chelator 2,2´-dipyridyl (200 μm), the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur is effectively removed in both WT and iscA/sufA mutant E. coli cells. Because the addition of 2,2´-dipyridyl (200 μm) to E. coli cells switches on the expression of the Fur-repressed targeted genes in E. coli cells (27McHugh J.P. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Abdul-Tehrani H.

Importantly, binding of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur appears to be highly conserved as the Fur homolog from Hemophilus influenzae can also bind a [2Fe-2S] cluster via the conserved cysteine residues when expressed in E. coli cells.

Briefly, exponentially growing E. coli cells were treated with the membrane-permeable iron chelator desferrioxamine. The cells were then washed with the membrane-impermeable iron chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to remove the extracellular free iron. Because the desferrioxamine-ferric iron complex has an EPR signal at g = 4.3, the amplitude of the EPR signal represents the relative concentration of the intracellular “chelatable” iron (28Woodmansee A.N.

Nevertheless, the results in Fig. 1 clearly suggested that deletion of IscA and its homolog SufA in E. coli cells increases the intracellular chelatable iron content, consistent with the previous observations made in S. cerevisiae (26Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ISA1 and ISA2 in iron homeostasis.Mol.

Here, we took advantage of the E. coli iscA/sufA mutant, which has an elevated intracellular free iron content (Fig. 1), to explore the possible iron binding of the global iron regulator Fur in vivo. In the experiments, we introduced a plasmid (pBAD) expressing the E. coli Fur into E. coli WT and the iscA/sufA mutant cells grown in LB medium under aerobic conditions. Recombinant Fur protein was purified from both cells. As reported previously by other research groups (33Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V.

In contrast, the Fur protein purified from the E. coli iscA/sufA mutant cells has a bright red color (inset in Fig. 2A). The UV-visible absorption measurements showed that the red Fur protein has three major absorption peaks at 325, 410, and 450 nm, in addition to the protein peak at 280 nm (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the red Fur protein may bind a mononuclear iron or iron–sulfur cluster. Careful examination of the UV-visible spectra in Fig. 2A revealed that the Fur protein purified from WT E. coli cells also has the absorption peaks at 325, 410, and 450 nm, although their amplitudes are only approximately one-eighth of those of the red Fur protein purified from the E. coli iscA/sufA mutant cells (Fig. 2B). The small amplitudes of the absorption peaks at 325, 410, and 450 nm of the Fur protein purified from WT E. coli cells might have been overlooked previously, especially when the concentration of purified Fur protein was low. Thus, the red Fur protein is present not only in the iscA/sufA mutant cells but also in WT E. coli cells, and the relative concentration of the red Fur protein in the iscA/sufA mutant cells is approximately eight times that in WT cells. To determine whether the red Fur protein binds a mononuclear iron or iron–sulfur cluster, we first analyzed the acid-labile iron and sulfide contents of the protein. From three independent experiments, we found 0.6 ± 0.2 iron and 0.4 ± 0.2 sulfide atoms per each Fur monomer in the purified red Fur protein, suggesting that the red Fur protein likely contains an iron–sulfur cluster. Because the E. coli Fur has previously been characterized as a zinc-binding protein (33Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. The ferric uptake regulation (Fur) repressor is a zinc metalloprotein.Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (10350474): 6559-656910.1021/bi982788sCrossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we also analyzed the zinc content of purified Fur and found that the zinc content is decreased from 1.8 ± 0.3 atoms per Fur monomer when purified from WT E. coli cells to 1.4 ± 0.2 atoms per Fur monomer when purified from the iscA/sufA mutant cells (n = 3), indicating that binding of iron–sulfur cluster affects zinc binding in Fur. The iron–sulfur cluster in the red Fur protein was further investigated by the EPR spectroscopy. Although as-purified red Fur protein has no EPR signals, the dithionite-reduced red Fur protein has an EPR signal at gx = 1.91, gy = 1.94, and gz = 2.00 (Fig. 2D), which is similar to that of other iron–sulfur proteins (36Li H.

Interestingly, unlike other iron–sulfur proteins, the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur is not stable and quickly decomposes, thus preventing spin quantification of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Fur using the EPR spectroscopy. To explore the nature of the iron–sulfur cluster in the red Fur protein, we have utilized Mössbauer spectroscopy (38Pandelia M.E. Lanz N.D. Booker S.J. Krebs C.

Fermentation is a food processing technology that has many advantages, such as low energy cost, changes in product characteristics, and enhanced product quality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of solid-state fermentation (SSF) on the content, composition and antioxidant activity of dandelion flavonoids. Response surface methodology was used to optimize dandelion fermentation conditions. Under optimized conditions, the maximum flavone concentration was 66.05 ± 1.89 mg/g. The flavonoid content of the crude extract from fermented dandelion (FDF) was 183.72 ± 2.24 mg/g. The flavonoid compounds in the crude extracts were further identified by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A total of 229 flavonoid compounds were identified, and 57 differential flavonoids (including 27 upregulated and 30 downregulated flavonoids) between FDF and the crude extract of unfermented dandelion (DF) were observed, of which 25 were annotated to metabolic pathways. FDF displayed superior antioxidant activity to that of DF in in vitro DPPH radical-scavenging and reducing power assays. The favorable results of our investigation could provide a new way for the exploitation and utilization of dandelion, which could be promising for its application as an antioxidant and functional food additive with flavonoids as ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W3087344576,"Plant NLR immune receptors are multidomain proteins that can function as specialized sensor/helper pairs. Paired NLR immune receptors are generally thought to function via negative regulation, where one NLR represses the activity of the second and detection of pathogen effectors relieves this repression to initiate immunity. However, whether this mechanism is common to all NLR pairs is not known. Here, we show that the rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2, which confers resistance to strains of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) expressing the AVR-PikD effector, functions via receptor cooperation, with effector-triggered activation requiring both NLRs to trigger the immune response. To investigate the mechanism of Pikp-1/Pikp-2 activation, we expressed truncated variants of these proteins, and made mutations in previously identified NLR sequence motifs. We found that any domain truncation, in either Pikp-1 or Pikp-2, prevented cell death in the presence of AVR-PikD, revealing that all domains are required for activity. Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death. Mutations in the conserved P-loop and MHD sequence motifs in both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 prevented cell death activation, demonstrating that these motifs are required for the function of the two partner NLRs. Finally, we showed that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 associate to form homo- and hetero-complexes in planta in the absence of AVR-PikD; on co-expression the effector binds to Pikp-1 generating a tri-partite complex. Taken together, we provide evidence that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 form a fine-tuned system that is activated by AVR-PikD via receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation."

https://openalex.org/W3086218413,"Compared with green fluorescent protein-based biosensors, red fluorescent protein (RFP)-based biosensors are inherently advantageous because of reduced phototoxicity, decreased autofluorescence and enhanced tissue penetration. However, existing RFP-based biosensors often suffer from small dynamic ranges, mislocalization and undesired photoconversion. In addition, the choice of available RFP-based biosensors is limited, and development of each biosensor requires substantial effort. Herein, we describe a general and convenient method, which introduces a genetically encoded noncanonical amino acid, 3-aminotyrosine, to the chromophores of green fluorescent protein-like proteins and biosensors for spontaneous and efficient green-to-red conversion. We demonstrated that this method could be used to quickly expand the repertoire of RFP-based biosensors. With little optimization, the 3-aminotyrosine-modified biosensors preserved the molecular brightness, dynamic range and responsiveness of their green fluorescent predecessors. We further applied spectrally resolved biosensors for multiplexed imaging of metabolic dynamics in pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W3084589329,"Many intracellular proteins are modified by N-acetylglucosamine, a post-translational modification termed O-GlcNAc. This modification is found on serine and threonine side chains and has the potential to regulate signaling pathways through interplay with phosphorylation. Here, we discover and characterize one such example. We find that O-GlcNAc levels control the sensitivity of fibroblasts to actin contraction induced by the signaling lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), culminating in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and cellular contraction. Specifically, O-GlcNAc modification of the phosphatase subunit MYPT1 inhibits this pathway by blocking MYPT1 phosphorylation, maintaining its activity and causing the dephosphorylation of MLC. Finally, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAc levels alter the sensitivity of primary human dermal fibroblasts in a collagen-matrix model of wound healing. Our findings have important implications for the role of O-GlcNAc in fibroblast motility and differentiation, particularly in diabetic wound healing. Changes in O-GlcNAc levels controlled the actin contraction of fibroblasts in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Specifically, O-GlcNAc modification of the phosphatase MYPT1 maintains its activity to block S1P signaling."

It is expected therefore that understanding the cellular function of LRRK2 will provide insight on the pathological mechanism not only of inherited Parkinson's, but also of sporadic Parkinson's, the more common form. Here, we show that constitutive LRRK2 activity controls nascent protein synthesis in rodent neurons. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2, Lrrk2 knockdown or Lrrk2 knockout, all lead to increased translation. In the rotenone model for sporadic Parkinson's, LRRK2 activity increases, dopaminergic neuron translation decreases, and the neurites atrophy. All are prevented by LRRK2 inhibitors. Moreover, in striatum and substantia nigra of rotenone treated rats, phosphorylation changes are observed on eIF2α-S52(↑), eIF2s2-S2(↓), and eEF2-T57(↑) in directions that signify protein synthesis arrest. Significantly, translation is reduced by 40% in fibroblasts from Parkinson's patients (G2019S and sporadic cases alike) and this is reversed upon LRRK2 inhibitor treatment. In cells from multiple system atrophy patients, translation is unchanged suggesting that repression of translation is specific to Parkinson's disease. These findings indicate that repression of translation is a proximal function of LRRK2 in Parkinson's pathology."

Constitutive Lpar1 null mutant mice are protected from partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL)-induced neuropathic pain, however, the cell types that are functionally responsible for mediating this protective effect are unknown. Here, we report the generation of an Lpar1flox/flox conditional null mutant mouse that allows for cre-mediated conditional deletion, combined with a PSNL pain model. Lpar1flox/flox mice were crossed with cre transgenic lines driven by neural gene promoters for nestin (all neural cells), synapsin (neurons), or P0 (Schwann cells).

Using cell culture models of human OCCC, we find that shRNA silencing of SPINK1 sensitizes tumor cells to anoikis and inhibits proliferation. Knockdown of SPINK1 in OCCC cells also profoundly suppresses peritoneal metastasis in mouse implantation models of human OCCC. We next identify a novel autocrine signaling axis in OCCC cells whereby tumor-cell-produced interleukin-6 (IL-6) regulates SPINK1 expression to stimulate a common protumorigenic gene expression pattern leading to anoikis resistance and proliferation of OCCC cells. We further demonstrate that this signaling pathway can be successfully interrupted with the IL-6Rα inhibitor tocilizumab, sensitizing cells to anoikis in vitro and reducing metastasis in vivo. These results suggest that clinical trials of IL-6 pathway inhibitors in OCCC may be warranted, and that SPINK1 might offer a candidate predictive biomarker in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3084460068,"R-spondins (Rspos) are endogenous ligands of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4). Rspos-LGR4 signaling plays important roles in embryogenesis, gastrointestinal homeostasis, and food intake. Here, we investigated the impacts of Rspos-LGR4 on hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Rspo1/3 and Lgr4 knockdown mice were used to investigate the impacts of Rspo1/3-LGR4 on hepatic cholesterol synthesis. AMPKα agonist, antagonist, and shRNA were used to explore the downstream targets of Rspos-LGR4 signaling. In our study, we reported that LGR4, Rspo1, and Rspo3 were highly expressed in hepatocytes and their expressions were sensitive to energy states. Rspo1 and Rspo3 reversed OA-induced cholesterol synthesis, accompanying with increased the phosphorylation of AMPKα Thr172, reduced SREBP2 nuclear translocation, and Srebf2 mRNA expression. Conversely, hepatic LGR4 knockdown increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis and decreased the phosphorylation of AMPKα both in vitro and in vivo. Activation or inhibition of AMPKα significantly abolished the effects of LGR4 deficiency or Rspos, respectively, on cholesterol synthesis. Knockdown of AMPKα1 or/and AMPKα2 repressed Rspos-induced inhibition on cholesterol synthesis. Our study indicates that Rspo1/Rspo3-LGR4 signaling in hepatocytes suppresses cholesterol synthesis via the AMPKα-SREBP2 pathway."

At GABAergic neuromuscular junctions, the short isoform MADD-4B binds the ectodomain of neuroligin NLG-1, itself a postsynaptic organizer of inhibitory synapses. To identify the molecular bases of their partnership, we generated recombinant forms of the two proteins and carried out a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical study of their interaction, complemented by an in vivo localization study. We show that spontaneous proteolysis of MADD-4B first generates a shorter N-MADD-4B form, which comprises four thrombospondin (TSP) domains and one Ig-like domain and binds NLG-1. A second processing event eliminates the C-terminal Ig-like domain along with the ability of N-MADD-4B to bind NLG-1. These data identify the Ig-like domain as the primary determinant for N-MADD-4B interaction with NLG-1 in vitro. We further demonstrate in vivo that this Ig-like domain is essential, albeit not sufficient per se, for efficient recruitment of GABAA receptors at GABAergic synapses in C. elegans. The interaction of N-MADD-4B with NLG-1 is also disrupted by heparin, used as a surrogate for the extracellular matrix component, heparan sulfate. High-affinity binding of heparin/heparan sulfate to the Ig-like domain may proceed from surface charge complementarity, as suggested by homology three-dimensional modeling.

Synapse formation is fundamental for communication between neurons and their target cells. The life cycle of a synapse involves attraction, recognition and interaction between cells, differentiation of the cell membrane into pre- and postsynaptic terminals, and eventually maturation and elimination (1Biederer T. Massimiliano S. Signalling by synaptogenic molecules.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18 (18725297): 261-26910.1016/j.conb.2008.07.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in synaptic organization fall into two categories: cell adhesion molecules acting upon contact and secreted factors acting either locally in the extracellular matrix (ECM) as scaffolding proteins or at longer range distances by diffusion (2Yuzaki M. Two classes of secreted synaptic organizers in the central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Phys. 2018; 80: 243-26210.1146/annurev-physiol-021317-121322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A cardinal pair of cell-adhesion molecules essential for excitatory (glutamatergic and cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic and glycinergic) synapse function involves the membrane-tethered neuroligin (NLG) and α- or β-neurexin (NRXα/β) proteins (3Graf E.R.

For instance, mutations in the NLG and/or NRX genes have been consistently detected in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and mutations in the NRX genes have been associated with schizophrenia (14Südhof T.C.

Genetic screens for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with abnormal synaptic organization identified gene Punctin/madd-4, whose protein products specify cholinergic versus GABAergic identity of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) (reviewed in Ref. 18Zhou X.

In C. elegans, body wall muscles are innervated by both cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons that express and secrete distinct Punctin/MADD-4 isoforms (19Pinan-Lucarré B. Tu H. Pierron M.

The long MADD-4L (isoforms a and c, which differ by the presence/absence of two neighboring residues) is exclusively present at cholinergic synapses, where it recruits ionotropic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The short MADD-4B (isoform b), which lacks the N-terminal third of MADD-4L, is present at both cholinergic and GABAergic synapses. (19Pinan-Lucarré B. Tu H. Pierron M. Ibáñez Cruceyra P. Zhan H.

Surprisingly, in the MADD-4B knockout mutant, NLG-1 and GABAAR are distributed in both the cholinergic and GABAergic synapses, indicating that MADD-4B is essential for retaining NLG-1 at GABAergic synapses, while preventing its incorrect recruitment at cholinergic synapses (19Pinan-Lucarré B.

Altogether, these data imply that specific domains of MADD-4L and MADD-4B instruct the proper recruitment of receptors at cholinergic versus GABAergic synapses. In this light, it was proposed that MADD-4L and MADD-4B undergo intermolecular association and that this event inactivates the ability of MADD-4L to recruit NLG-1 and prevents incorrect GABAAR clustering at cholinergic NMJs (19Pinan-Lucarré B.

Punctin/MADD-4 belongs to the poorly understood ADAMTSL (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin repeats–like) family of secreted multidomain glycoproteins. Members in the family comprise, from the N to the C terminus, a Cys-rich domain, a “spacer” domain, a varying number of thrombospondin type I repeats (TSPs, elsewhere also referred to as “TSRs”), and unique combinations of several Ig-like domains with most often one example of protease and lacunin (PLAC) or netrin- or Kunitz-type domains (see Ref. 24Hubmacher D.

MADD-4 is the first member of the ADAMTSL family to be identified as a synaptic regulator (19Pinan-Lucarré B. Tu H. Pierron M. Ibáñez Cruceyra P. Zhan H. Stigloher C. Richmond J.E. Bessereau J.-L.

To better understand the function of MADD-4B at GABAergic synapses, we generated recombinant forms of MADD-4B and of the ectodomain of NLG-1 and carried out a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical analysis of their interaction, buttressed by a complementary in vivo analysis. We show that MADD-4B inevitable proteolysis at a well-defined site first generates a shorter entity encompassing the N-terminal four TSP domains and sole Ig-like domain (herein referred to as “N-MADD-4B”), while further processing eliminates the Ig-like domain to generate an even shorter entity comprising the TSP domains only. Quantitative characterization of the interaction of N-MADD-4B and of its maturation products with NLG-1 points to the Ig-like domain as the primary determinant responsible for NLG-1 binding in vitro and for efficient GABAAR recruitment at GABAergic synapses in vivo. Distinct relative affinities of these proteins for heparin, used as a surrogate for heparan sulfate, suggest a role of cell-surface proteoglycans as regulators of the N-MADD-4B interaction with NLG-1. We propose that N-MADD-4B maturation, resulting in elimination of the Ig-like domain, is a plausible regulation mechanism at C. elegans GABAergic synapses. The ADAMTSL protein MADD-4B comprises, from the N to the C terminus, four TSP domains, one Ig-like C2-type module, three additional TSP domains, and a PLAC domain (Fig. 1A). Initial analysis of a recombinant form of MADD-4B secreted from mammalian (HEK) cells revealed critical cleavage of most of the protein population in two pieces during the earliest steps of production. Western blotting tracking of the C-terminal Fc-tag coupled with N-terminal sequencing of the pieces led to location of the cleavage site upstream to sequence VQVSKED in the linker region that follows the Ig-like domain (data not shown). Because previous analysis of MADD-4B as a guidance cue in vivo demonstrated that the C-terminal TSP5-7 and PLAC domains were dispensable for protein functionality (37Seetharaman A. Selman G. Puckrin R. Barbier L. Wong E. D'Souza S.A. Roy P.J. MADD-4 is a secreted cue required for midline-oriented guidance in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev.

Structural models of the TSP1–4 and Ig-like domains point to an elongated, flexible TSP1–4 domain arrangement, connected to the globular Ig-like domain by an equally flexible hinge (Fig. 1B and C). The net positive charge of N-MADD-4B (theoretical pI: 8.8) is reflected in the even distribution of electropositive potentials at the surface of the molecule, apart from the presence of two pockets, respectively more electropositive than the overall surface and highly electronegative, on opposite faces of the Ig domain (Fig. 1C). N-MADD-4B was produced, purified, and analyzed using standard procedures (see “Experimental procedures”) (Fig. 2). Electrophoretic analysis of the affinity-purified protein revealed a major entity migrating slightly above the 45 kDa marker, along with two to three smaller entities migrating at ∼35, 25, and 15 kDa, respectively (Figs. 2A and 3A). Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis confirmed that all three entities belonged to N-MADD-4B, albeit with distinct levels of C-terminal coverage (Fig. S1). Intact N-MADD-4B and the 35-kDa entity (45.781 and 31.345 kDa, respectively, by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS; Fig. S2) could be separated from each other by cation-exchange (Fig. 2B) but not size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 2C). Consistently, analytical SEC coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) pointed to two overlapping peaks of 45.7 and 33.7 kDa, respectively (Fig. S3). The ∼2.9-kDa difference between the theoretical mass of the naked N-MADD-4B polypeptide (42.9 kDa) and the experimental values obtained by electrophoresis, MS, and SEC-MALS may reflect, for example, the presence of an N-glycan linked to Asn-362 and/or O-glycans at consensus motifs (see Fig. 1 and Fig. S1). Over time, the purified 35-kDa entity further led to a ∼25-kDa piece (Fig. 3A). Thorough analysis of the fragmentation process pointed to a time- and temperature-dependent process not prevented by protease inhibitors (Fig. S4).Figure 3C-terminal processing of N-MADD-4B eliminates the Ig-like domain.

https://openalex.org/W3087704923,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) regulates neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic active zone in the mammalian brain. The regulation of mGlu7 trafficking into and out of the plasma membrane by binding proteins within the C-terminal region of mGlu7 governs the bidirectional synaptic plasticity. However, the functional importance of the extracellular domain of mGlu7 has not yet been characterized. N-glycosylation is an abundant posttranslational modification that plays crucial roles in protein folding and forward trafficking, but the role of N-glycosylation in mGlu7 function remains unknown. In this study, we find that mGlu7 is N-glycosylated at four asparagine residues in heterologous cells and rat cultured neurons. We demonstrate that N-glycosylation is essential for forward transport and surface expression of mGlu7. Deglycosylated mGlu7 is retained in the ER, obstructing expression on the cell surface, and is degraded through the autophagolysosomal degradation pathway. In addition, we identify the binding domain of mGlu7 to Elfn1, a transsynaptic adhesion protein. We find that N-glycosylation of mGlu7 promotes its interaction with Elfn1, thereby enabling proper localization and stable surface expression of mGlu7 at the presynaptic active zone. These findings provide evidence that N-glycans act to modulate the surface expression, stability, and function of mGlu7."

The last major outbreaks of mumps in the Netherlands were in 2009–2012 and thereafter, only small clusters and single cases were reported. Molecular epidemiology can provide insights in the circulation of mumps viruses. The aims of the present study were to analyze the molecular epidemiology of mumps viruses in the Netherlands in 2017–2019 and to compare the phylogenetic trees built from sequence data of near complete mumps virus genomes or from the SH gene and non-coding regions (SH+NCRs). To this end, Sanger sequence data from SH+NCRs were analyzed from 82 mumps genotype G viruses. In addition, near complete genomes were obtained from 10 mumps virus isolates using next-generation sequencing. Analysis of SH+NCRs sequences of mumps genotype G viruses revealed the presence of two major genetic lineages in the Netherlands, which was confirmed by analysis of near complete genomes. Comparison of phylogenetic trees built with SH+NCRs or near complete genomes indicated that the topology was similar, while somewhat longer branches were present in the phylogenetic tree with near complete genomes. These results confirm that analysis of SH + NCRs sequence data is a useful approach for molecular surveillance. Furthermore, data from recent mumps genotype G viruses might indicate (intermittent) circulation of mumps genotype G viruses in the Netherlands in 2017–2019."
https://openalex.org/W3087124764,"The occurrence of pain has always been closely related to a break in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory systems, and the internal relationship between these two systems has not been studied in the pathogenesis of chronic migraine (CM). In this study, we explored how inhibitory interneurons specifically modulate the glutamate-induced hyperexcitability in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of CM rats. The CM model was established by repeated dural infusion of inflammatory soup (IS) in rats. Then, Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) agonist; CGP35348, a GABABR antagonist; H89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor; and 8-Bromo-cAMP, a PKA agonist, were applied by intraventricular injection to investigate the detailed CM mechanism. Our results showed that GABABR2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated (P < .01) in the PAG of CM rats. Similarly, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its synthetase glutamate decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67) seriously decreased (P < .01), implying a deficit in the function of inhibitory interneurons in the PAG of CM rats. Afterward, the application of Baclofen and H89 alleviated the IS-evoked hyperalgesia and extenuated vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and c-Fos expression by regulating the GABABR2/PKA/SynCAM1 pathway in the PAG of CM rats, while the application of CGP35348 and 8-Bromo-cAMP exactly exerted the opposite effect. Importantly, CGP35348 induced an elevation of CGRP, and VGLUT2 expression was relieved by H89. These data suggest that the loss in the function of inhibitory interneurons contributes to glutamate-associated central sensitization through the GABABR2/PKA/SynCAM1 pathway in the PAG of CM rats."

These findings suggest the important role of the proteasomal degradation of osteogenic regulators, while the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we report that the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and ixazomib markedly increased protein levels of the osteoblastic key transcription factor osterix/Sp7 (Osx). Furthermore, we revealed that Osx was targeted by p38 and Fbw7 for proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, p38-mediated Osx phosphorylation at S73/77 facilitated Fbw7 interaction to trigger subsequent Osx ubiquitination. Consistent with these findings, p38 knockdown or pharmacological p38 inhibition resulted in Osx protein stabilization. Treatment with p38 inhibitors following osteogenic stimulation efficiently induced osteoblast differentiation through Osx stabilization. Conversely, pretreatment of p38 inhibitor followed by osteogenic challenge impaired osteoblastogenesis via suppressing Osx expression, suggesting that p38 exerts dual but opposite effects in the regulation of Osx level to fine-tune its activity during osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, Fbw7-depleted human mesenchymal stem cells and primary mouse calvarial cells resulted in increased osteogenic capacity. Together, our findings unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the Osx protein stability control and suggest that targeting the Osx degradation pathway could help enhance efficient osteogenesis and bone matrix regeneration."

For better interventions, up-to-date information concerning LTFU among HIV-infected children on ART is vital. However, only a few studies have been conducted in Ethiopia to address this concern. Thus, this study aims to identify the predictors of LTFU among HIV-infected children receiving ART at Debre Markos Referral Hospital.An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was done among 408 HIV-infected children receiving ART at Debre Markos Referral Hospital between 2005 and March 15, 2019. Data were abstracted from the medical records of HIV-infected children using a standardized data abstracted checklist. We used Epi-Data Version 3.1 for data entry and Stata Version 14 for statistical analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to estimate the survival time. A generalized log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves of different categorical variables. Finally, both bi-variable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify the predictors of LTFU.Of 408 HIV-infected children included in the final analysis, 70 (17.1%) children were LTFU at the end of the study. The overall incidence rate of LTFU among HIV-infected children was found to be 4.5 (95%CI: 3.5-5.7) per 100-child years of observation. HIV-infected children living in rural areas (AHR: 3.2, 95%CI: 2.0-5.3), having fair or poor ART drug adherence (AHR: 2.3, 95%CI: 1.4-3.7), children started ART through test and treat approach (AHR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.4-5.5), and children started protease inhibiter (PI)-based ART regimens (AHR: 2.2, 95%CI: 1.1-4.4) were at higher risk of LTFU.This study found that one in every six HIV-infected children lost form ART follow-up. HIV-infected children living in rural areas, having fair or poor ART drug adherence, started ART based on test and treat approach, and taking PI-based ART regimens were at higher risk of LTFU."

https://openalex.org/W3084804633,"The placental membranes that surround the fetus during pregnancy were suggested to contain a low abundance microbiota. Specifically, abundance of Lactobacillus, a probiotic and dominant member of the microbiome of the lower reproductive tract, has been shown to correlate with healthy, term pregnancies. We therefore sought to assess the interactions between four different Lactobacillus strains with immortalized decidualized endometrial cells (dT-HESCs), which were used as a model to represent the outermost layer of the placental membranes. Notably, we demonstrated that all four Lactobacillus strains could associate with dT-HESCs in vitro. L. crispatus was significantly more successful (p < 0.00005), with 10.6% of bacteria attaching to the host cells compared to an average of 0.8% for the remaining three strains. The four strains also varied in their ability to form biofilms. Dependent on media type, L. reuteri 6475 formed the strongest biofilms in vitro. To examine the impact on immune responses, levels of total and phosphorylated protein p38, a member of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, were examined following Lactobacillus association with dT-HESCs. Total levels of p38 were reduced to an average of 44% that of the cells without Lactobacillus (p < 0.05). While a trend towards a reduction in phosphorylated p38 was observed, this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). In addition, association with Lactobacillus did not result in increased host cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that varying types of Lactobacillus can attach to the outermost cells of the placental membranes and that these interactions do not contribute to inflammatory responses or host cell death. To our knowledge this is the first in vitro study to support the ability of Lactobacillus to interact with placental cells, which is important when considering its use as a potential probiotic within the reproductive tract."
https://openalex.org/W3085719832,"Parkinson's disease is biochemically characterized by the deposition of aberrant aggregated α-synuclein in the affected neurons. The aggregation properties of α-synuclein greatly depend on its affinity to bind cellular membranes via a dynamic interaction with specific lipid moieties. In particular, α-synuclein can interact with arachidonic acid (AA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, in a manner that promotes the formation of α-helix enriched assemblies. In a cellular context, AA is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2 ). To investigate the impact of PLA2 activity on α-synuclein aggregation, we have applied selective PLA2 inhibitors to a SH-SY5Y cellular model where the expression of human wild-type α-synuclein is correlated with a gradual accumulation of soluble oligomers and subsequent cell death. We have found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 resulted in a dramatic decrease of intracellular oligomeric and monomeric α-synuclein significantly promoting cell survival. Our data suggest that alterations in the levels of free fatty acids, and especially AA and adrenic acid, promote the formation of α-synuclein conformers which are more susceptible to proteasomal degradation. This mechanism is active only in living cells and is generic since it does not depend on the absolute quantity of α-synuclein, the presence of disease-linked point mutations, the expression system or the type of cells. Our findings indicate that the α-synuclein-fatty acid interaction can be a critical determinant of the conformation and fate of α-synuclein in the cell interior and, as such, cPLA2 inhibitors could serve to alleviate the intracellular, potentially pathological, α-synuclein burden."
https://openalex.org/W3086922033,"Non-physician clinicians (NPCs) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) often have little physical proximity to the resources-equipment, supplies or skills-needed to deliver effective care, forcing them to refer patients to distant sites. Unlike equipment or supplies, which require dedicated supply chains, physician/specialist skills needed to support NPCs can be sourced and delivered through telecommunication technologies. In LMICs however, these skills are scarce and sparsely distributed, making it difficult to implement commonly used real-time (synchronous), hub-and-spoke telemedicine paradigms. An asynchronous teleconsultations service was implemented in Turkana County, Kenya, connecting NPCs with a volunteer network of remote physicians and specialists. In 2017-18, the service supported over 100 teleconsultations and referrals across 20 primary healthcare clinics and two hospitals. This qualitative study aimed to explore the impact of the telemedicine intervention on health system stakeholders, and perceived health-related benefits to patients. Data were collected using Appreciative Inquiry, a strengths-based, positive approach to assessing interventions and informing systems change. We highlight the impact of provider-to-provider asynchronous teleconsultations on multiple stakeholders and healthcare processes. Provider benefits include improved communication and team work, increased confidence and capacity to deliver services in remote sites, and professional satisfaction for both NPCs and remote physicians. Health system benefits include efficiency improvements through improved care coordination and avoiding unnecessary referrals, and increased equity and access to physician/specialist care by reducing geographical, financial and social barriers. Providers and health system managers recognised several non-health benefits to patients including increased trust and care seeking from NPCs, and social benefits of avoiding unnecessary referrals (reduced social disruption, displacement and costs). The findings reveal the wider impact that modern teleconsultation services enabled by mobile technologies and algorithms can have on LMIC communities and health systems. The study highlights the importance of viewing provider-to-provider teleconsultations as complex health service delivery interventions with multiple pathways and processes that can ultimately improve health outcomes."

With the anticipated increased incidence of total joint replacement in the next decade, implant failure will continue to burden patients. The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important factor in bone physiology, however, its role in implant loosening is currently unknown. We tested the hypothesis that implant loosening is associated with changes in the gut microbiota in a preclinical model. When the particle challenge caused local joint inflammation, decreased peri-implant bone volume, and decreased implant fixation, the gut microbiota was affected. When the particle challenge did not cause this triad of local effects, the gut microbiota was not affected. Our results suggest that cross-talk between these compartments is a previously unrecognized mechanism of failure following total joint replacement."

Incarceration status was determined by insurance status. Our primary outcome was incarceration status at time of initial cancer diagnosis. Overall, patients who were incarcerated presented at a later cancer stage for all cancer types compared to the non-incarcerated (+.14 T stage, p = .033; +.23 N stage, p < .001). Incarcerated patients were diagnosed at later stages for colorectal (+0.93 T stage, p < .001; +.48 N stage, p < .001), oropharyngeal (+0.37 N stage, p = .003), lung (+0.60 N stage, p = .018), skin (+0.59 N stage, p = 0.014), and screenable cancers (colorectal, prostate, lung) as a whole (+0.23 T stage, p = 0.002; +0.17 N stage, p = 0.008).

The lubrication properties of lubricin also suggest that the protein is associated with arthritic diseases, because it has been proposed that defective lubrication aggravates joint degradation (5Asakawa-Tanne Y.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthritic disease, with high prevalence in elderly people, and involves cartilage degradation in the articular joints, leading to pain and restricted motion (6GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence CollaboratorsGlobal, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.Lancet. 2016; 388 (27733282): 1545-160210.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4117) Google Scholar). Boundary lubrication of OA SF deficient in lubricin has been shown to be lowered in in vitro experiments (7Ludwig T.E. McAllister J.R. Lun V. Wiley J.P. Schmidt T.A.

Different isoforms of lubricin are found throughout the body. In addition to presence in SF and the boundary articular cartilage, lubricin has also been detected in low amounts in menisci, blood, urine, and tendons (8Swann D.A. Silver F.H. Slayter H.S.

A possible immunological role of lubricin has been suggested because it has been shown to be involved in sepsis in a mouse model (13Toledo A.G. Golden G. Campos A.R. Cuello H. Sorrentino J. Lewis N.

Lubricin is also associated with the plasma membrane of human neutrophils (14Jin C. Ekwall A.K. Bylund J. Björkman L. Estrella R.P. Whitelock J.M. Eisler T. Bokarewa M. Karlsson N.G. Human synovial lubricin expresses sialyl Lewis x determinant and has L-selectin ligand activity.J. Biol.

The full-length isoform found in SF consists of 1,404 amino acids (aa), equivalent to 150 kDa, but is ∼300 kDa when fully O-glycosylated. The protein contains a central mucin domain consisting of 59 imperfect repeats of the aa sequence EPAPTTPK, where the threonine residues are potential sites for diverse and dense O-glycosylation. Despite its gene name, it is not a typical proteoglycan and has merely a single proposed glycosaminoglycan site that may or may not be present/occupied (17Lord M.S. Estrella R.P. Chuang C.Y.

The mucin domain is flanked by two somatomedin B-like domains on the N-terminal side and a hemopexin domain on the C-terminal side, domains which have been proposed to interact with extracellular matrix proteins such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), collagen II, and fibronectin (18Flowers S.A.

The glycans on the lubricin mucin domain are the main contributors to its molecular weight and are responsible for the lubricating function of the molecule, attracting water to the superficial layer, and providing repulsive negative charges to the cartilage superficial layer (20Jay G.D. Waller K.A. The biology of lubricin: near frictionless joint motion.Matrix Biol. 2014; 39 (25172828): 17-2410.1016/j.matbio.2014.08.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recombinant human lubricin (rhPRG4) has been evaluated for a large number of potential clinical applications as a friction-reducing lubricant on biological surfaces (16Samsom M.L. Morrison S.

In a rodent model, addition of lubricin has been shown to delay the progression of OA (25Jay G.D. Fleming B.C. Watkins B.A. McHugh K.A. Anderson S.C. Zhang L.X. Teeple E. Waller K.A. Elsaid K.A.

Lubricin may therefore be a potential candidate for treatment of OA. Galectins are glycan-binding proteins with many proposed intra- and extracellular functions within cell regulation, the immune system, and cancer progression (27Johannes L. Jacob R. Leffler H.

They bind a large range of β-galactosides present on both N- and O-linked glycoproteins, with binding affinity highly dependent on branching and terminal residues (28Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T.

Galectin-3 has been shown to be associated with chondrocytes and has been proposed to be involved in OA pathogenesis (29Weinmann D. Kenn M. Schmidt S. Schmidt K. Walzer S.M. Kubista B. Windhager R.

It is unique among the galectins because it is the only galectin that comprises a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain linked to a nonlectin N-terminal collagen-like domain, making it possible for galectin-3 protein subunits to oligomerize (31Nieminen J.

In the joint, galectin-3 and lubricin have been proposed to generate a complex, stable lubricating network on the articular cartilage (33Reesink H.L. Bonnevie E.D. Liu S. Shurer C.R. Hollander M.J. Bonassar L.J. Nixon A.J. Galectin-3 binds to lubricin and reinforces the lubricating boundary layer of articular cartilage.Sci.

Galectin-3 displays only a weak binding affinity to the T-antigen (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-) on synthetic MUC1 glycopeptides (34Yu L.G. Andrews N. Zhao Q. McKean D. Williams J.F. Connor L.J. Gerasimenko O.V.

The T-antigen is also highly abundant on O-glycans on lubricin and has been proposed to be responsible for the interaction between galectin-3 and lubricin (33Reesink H.L. Bonnevie E.D. Liu S. Shurer C.R. Hollander M.J. Bonassar L.J. Nixon A.J. Galectin-3 binds to lubricin and reinforces the lubricating boundary layer of articular cartilage.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27157803): 2546310.1038/srep25463Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because carbohydrates play such a crucial role in the function of lubricin, we decided to use state-of-the-art glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis techniques to compare the different glycoforms of synovial lubricin from OA patients and control individuals and to compare these with rhPRG4 expressed in CHO cells. We confirmed the presence of galectin-3 in SF and explored differences in the binding of galectin-3 to the various O-glycoforms. Our results enable us to correlate pathological glycosylation changes in OA with a functionally defective superficial layer and provide a pathway for recombinant lubricin glyco-design for optimal galectin-3 binding. We wanted to determine whether changes in O-linked glycosylation of synovial lubricin were associated with OA pathology. Detailed quantitative analysis of the released O-glycans was performed. Lubricin isolated from SF of controls (n = 7) was compared with lubricin isolated from late-stage OA patients (n = 7). O-linked oligosaccharides from lubricin in age- and sex-matched OA patients' and controls' SF were released by reductive β-elimination and analyzed with quantitative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on a QTRAP 6500 triple quadrupole-linear ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer as has been described in detail (36Flowers S.A. Lane C.S. Karlsson N.G. Deciphering isomers with a multiple reaction monitoring method for the complete detectable O-glycan repertoire of the candidate therapeutic, lubricin.Anal. Chem. 2019; 91: 9331-1034210.1021/acs.analchem.9b01485Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The MRM method was developed to semi-quantify a range of 22 core 1, 2, and 3 glycans on native lubricin from both controls and OA patients (36Flowers S.A. Lane C.S. Karlsson N.G. Deciphering isomers with a multiple reaction monitoring method for the complete detectable O-glycan repertoire of the candidate therapeutic, lubricin.Anal. Chem. 2019; 91: 9331-1034210.1021/acs.analchem.9b01485Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We refer to semi-quantification here because without the appropriate standards, a technical difficulty of O-glycan research, absolute quantification is not attained. This is because of differences in ionization and stability between glycans, particularly between charged and neutral glycans. MRM is able to mitigate some of this because all glycan structures, even the sialic acid isomers, are optimized for the conditions that allow for their best quantification (36Flowers S.A. Lane C.S. Karlsson N.G. Deciphering isomers with a multiple reaction monitoring method for the complete detectable O-glycan repertoire of the candidate therapeutic, lubricin.Anal. Chem. 2019; 91: 9331-1034210.1021/acs.analchem.9b01485Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the most apt use of this approach is to compare the same glycan or type of glycans between samples. Although the abundances of these glycans were found to differ between the two sample types, the glycan repertoire was the same (Fig. 1, A and B and Table S1). A significant increase in the unmodified core 1 structure (T-antigen) on lubricin isolated from OA patients (40.41% ± 3.43% (mean ± S.E.) of all glycans, p = 0.0274) was detected compared with normal controls (29.90% ± 3.10%). This increase in glycan truncation was accompanied by a significant decrease in a range of lower abundant core 2 structures, predominantly sialylated and sulfated structures. There was an overall reduction in core 2 structures in OA samples (4.67% ± 0.98%, p = 0.0288) compared with control samples (9.11% ± 1.50%) and an increase in core 1 structures (OA, 94.85% ± 1.05% and control, 90.32% ± 1.47%; p = 0.0275). Altogether, this resulted in a trend toward a reduction in charged structures, primarily because of a reduction in core 2 structures, in the OA samples (57.16% ± 3.03%, p = 0.558) compared with the controls (66.51% ± 3.21%). This indicated that changes in O-glycosylation, specifically the loss of core 2 structures that are predominately charged, is associated with OA. Given the potential of rhPRG4 as a biopharmaceutical lubricant, where the function relies on the O-linked glycosylation, we analyzed the released glycans from CHO-expressed rhPRG4 to identify the presence of core 1 and core 2 glycans and sialylation and compare it to O-glycosylation of the native human SF lubricin. The composition of O-glycans released from rhPRG4 was analyzed using the same MRM lubricin method as for native human lubricin. These analyses were performed on two different batches of rhPRG4, which revealed a composition of solely core 1 structures (Fig. 1, C and D), the same core 1 structures observed on human synovial lubricin (Fig. 1, A and B). The most abundant oligosaccharide was the sialylated core 1 NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc structure, which made up 85% of all glycans. A low proportion of neutral O-glycans (12% of all glycans) and a higher amount of charged glycans (88% of all glycans) were found in this rhPRG4. The glycosylation pattern of rhPRG4 is similar to what has been reported for CHO cell O-glycosylation with an abundance of core 1 structures, particularly the linear monosialylated NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc structure (37Lalonde M.E. Durocher Y. Therapeutic glycoprotein production in mammalian cells.J. Biotechnol. 2017; 251 (28465209): 128-14010.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.04.028Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We next performed a glycoproteomics study of rhPRG4 (with and without partial deglycosylation) to identify glycosylated aa sites and compared the results with glycosites previously reported for native human lubricin from pooled SF from OA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (38Ali L. Flowers S.A. Jin C. Bennet E.P. Ekwall A.K. Karlsson N.G. The O-glycomap of lubricin, a novel mucin responsible for joint lubrication, identified by site-specific glycopeptide analysis.Mol. Cell.

In all, we detected 318 glycopeptides from rhPRG4 covering 172 glycosylated Ser/Thr sites, the monosaccharide compositions consistent with core 1 type O-glycans GalNAcα1- (Tn-antigen), Galβ1-3GalNAcα1- (T-antigen), NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1- (sialyl-T), and NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3(NeuAcα2-6)GalNAcα1- (disialylated T). The results are summarized in Fig. 2 and in Table S2. Glycopeptide coverage in rhPRG4 was found to be similar to native human lubricin, with the majority of the glycopeptides originating from the Ser/Thr-rich mucin domain (aa 232–1056, Fig. 2A). Site specificity overlapped well with native lubricin and within the mucin domain (Fig. 2, B and C and Fig. S1). 83 sites were detected in rhPRG4, which had not previously been identified in native lubricin (Fig. 2B). The majority of the glycopeptides contained 1–3 glycans, although up to five glycosylation sites were detected on one peptide (TTPETTTAAPK, aa sequence position 926–936). Glycopeptides generated after partial deglycosylation revealed additional site-specific information, enabling the detection of larger glycopeptides in the size range of 10–20 aa:s. In all, 31 additional glycosylated Ser/Thr were identified after partial deglycosylation (Table S2). Approximately 77% (132 of the 172) of the glycosylated Ser/Thr were found in peptides originating from the mucin-like repeat region (aa 348–855, Fig. 2A) of rhPRG4. The most abundant aa sequence in this region was the EPAPTTPK, repeated 17 times in the molecule. 13 EPAPTTPK-derived glycopeptides were detected and glycosylated on either or both Thr residues (Table S2). We found 19 glycosylation sites in the N-terminal region (aa 125–347) and 26 in the C-terminal region (aa 1057–1404). Most of these sites (16 and 25 sites from the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively) were found in the nonrepeat regions in the STP-rich domain flanking the mucin domain 348–1057 (Fig. S1). The most intense glycopeptides identified in rhPRG4 correspond well with those identified from pooled SF from patients with RA and OA. The main difference was that in regions with clustered Thr and to some extent also Ser, we usually found that more sites were positively identified in rhPRG4 compared with native lubricin. Because previous glycopeptide analysis was performed on pooled SF samples (38Ali L. Flowers S.A. Jin C. Bennet E.P. Ekwall A.K. Karlsson N.G. The O-glycomap of lubricin, a novel mucin responsible for joint lubrication, identified by site-specific glycopeptide analysis.Mol. Cell.

This approach revealed 171 and 158 lubricin-derived glycopeptides from the two patients, respectively, and the full glycopeptide list is found in Table S2. Glycopeptide coverage did largely match what was found in the samples derived from rhPRG4 and our previous study of pooled native lubricin from OA and RA patients (Fig. 2A and Table S2), suggesting that many glycosylation sites coincide. To compare SF lubricin and rhPRG4 glycopeptide analyses, the peptide backbone sequence VLAKPTPK (aa 327–334, Fig. 2D) will be used as an example. Seven VLAKPTPK glycopeptides were identified in each of the two sample types. This peptide backbone sequence contains only one potential O-glycosylation site (T). In addition to simple core 1 structures identified in rhPRG4 (Fig. 2, E and F), we also detected more exotic type O–linked glycans attached to native lubricin. Examples of two of these spectra are shown in Fig. 2, G and H. Both spectra were dominated by a major fragment ion corresponding to the peptide backbone without its glycosylation (m/z 853.55). The core 2 glycopeptide variant of this glycopeptide was identified containing two N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) and one hexose (Hex), consistent with a (Galβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1–6)GalNAcα1-) core 2 sequence.

Therefore, some studies regarding the artificial breeding and cultivation of H. leucospilota have been undertaken recently. However, the biological functions of the digestive system of this species have not been elucidated. In this study, a cDNA coding for α-amylase, an indicator of digestive maturity in animals, was identified from H. leucospilota and designated Hl-Amy. The full-length cDNA of the Hl-Amy gene, which is 1734 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1578 bp, encodes a 525 amino acid (a.a.) protein with a deduced molecular weight of 59.34 kDa. According to the CaZy database annotation, Hl-Amy belongs to the class of GH-H with the official nomenclature of α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) or 4-α-D-glucan glucanohydrolase. The Hl-Amy protein contains a signal peptide at the N-terminal followed by a functional amylase domain, which includes the catalytic activity site. The mRNA expression of Hl-Amy was abundantly exhibited in the intestine, followed by the transverse vessel with a low level, but was hardly detected in other selected tissues. During embryonic and larval development, Hl-Amy was constitutively expressed in all stages, and the highest expression level was observed in the blastula. By in situ hybridization (ISH), positive Hl-Amy signals were observed in different parts of the three different intestinal segments (foregut, midgut and hindgut). The Hl-Amy recombinant protein was generated in an E. coli system with codon optimization, which is necessary for Hl-Amy successfully expressed in this heterogenous system. The Hl-Amy recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), and its activity of starch hydrolysis was further detected. The optimal temperatures and pH for Hl-Amy recombinant protein were 55°C and 6.0, respectively, with an activity of 62.2 U/mg. In summary, this current study has filled a knowledge gap on the biological function and expression profiles of an essential digestive enzyme in sea cucumber, which may encourage future investigation toward rationalized diets for H. leucospilota in artificial cultivation, and optimized heterogenous prokaryotic systems for producing recombinant enzymes of marine origins."

Mice were studied on a clinical 3T scanner by using a prototype birdcage coil before and after intravenous injection of MnCl2. Assessment of receptor's status was carried out after the MR images acquisition by immunohistochemistry on excised tumours.Manganese contrast enhancement in breast or prostate cancer animal models well correlated with CaSR expression (p<0.01), whereas TRPV6 expression levels appeared not relevant to the Mn uptake.Our preliminary results suggest that MEMRI appears an efficient tool to characterize human breast and prostate cancer animal models in the presence of different expression level of calcium receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3087503172,"Background Short bowel syndrome (SBS) results from significant loss of small intestinal length. In response to this loss, adaptation occurs, with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) being a key driver. Besides enhanced enterocyte proliferation, we have revealed that adaptation is associated with angiogenesis. Further, we have found that small bowel resection (SBR) is associated with diminished oxygen delivery and elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α). Methods We ablated EGFR in the epithelium and endothelium as well as HIF1α in the epithelium, ostensibly the most hypoxic element. Using these mice, we determined the effects of these genetic manipulations on intestinal blood flow after SBR using photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), intestinal adaptation and angiogenic responses. Then, given that endothelial cells require a stromal support cell for efficient vascularization, we ablated EGFR expression in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) to determine its effects on angiogenesis in a microfluidic model of human small intestine. Results Despite immediate increased demand in oxygen extraction fraction measured by PAM in all mouse lines, were no differences in enterocyte and endothelial cell EGFR knockouts or enterocyte HIF1α knockouts by POD3. Submucosal capillary density was also unchanged by POD7 in all mouse lines. Additionally, EGFR silencing in ISEMFs did not impact vascular network development in a microfluidic device of human small intestine. Conclusions Overall, despite the importance of EGFR in facilitating intestinal adaptation after SBR, it had no impact on angiogenesis in three cell types–enterocytes, endothelial cells, and ISEMFs. Epithelial ablation of HIF1α also had no impact on angiogenesis in the setting of SBS."

We aimed to develop a brief screening method for determining sodium intake in order to raise public awareness regarding the Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (DRI-J) 2020.Using data from the 2015 National Health and Nutrition Survey, we compared dietary behaviours obtained from a self-administered questionnaire according to sodium intake, which was assessed from one-day dietary records by a semi-weighed method. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on the reference values of sodium (salt equivalent) shown in the DRI-J. We also randomly divided the participants into development and validation groups, and used logistic regression analysis to identify predictive factors for sex-specific DRI-J (<7.5 g/day in men and <6.5 g/day in women) and above-average intakes (≥10 g/day in men and women).Among the 6,172 Japanese individuals aged ≥20 years old, participants with lower sodium intake were found to use nutrition labels and had a lower frequency of eating out than those with higher intakes (P for difference < .001). Our final model for predicting sodium intake included adjusted sex, age, dietary behaviours, and consumption of mainly processed foods. In the development group, areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.747 and 0.741 for adherence to sex-specific DRI-J and above-average intake, respectively. The corresponding values in the validation group were 0.734 and 0.730, respectively.This method could easily identify sodium intake using dietary behaviours and specific food consumption, and is expected to be widely useful for health and nutrition education in Japan."

FHR5 normally contains nine short complement regulator (SCR) domains, but a FHR5 mutant has been identified with a duplicated N-terminal SCR-1/2 domain pair that causes CFHR5 nephropathy. To understand how this duplication causes disease, we characterized the solution structure of native FHR5 by analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering. Sedimentation velocity and X-ray scattering indicated that FHR5 was dimeric, with a radius of gyration (Rg) of 5.5 ± 0.2 nm and a maximum protein length of 20 nm for its 18 domains. This result indicated that FHR5 was even more compact than the main regulator Factor H, which showed an overall length of 26–29 nm for its 20 SCR domains. Atomistic modeling for FHR5 generated a library of 250,000 physically realistic trial arrangements of SCR domains for scattering curve fits. Only compact domain structures in this library fit well to the scattering data, and these structures readily accommodated the extra SCR-1/2 domain pair present in CFHR5 nephropathy. This model indicated that mutant FHR5 can form oligomers that possess additional binding sites for C3b in FHR5. We conclude that the deregulation of complement regulation by the FHR5 mutant can be rationalized by the enhanced binding of FHR5 oligomers to C3b deposited on host cell surfaces. Our FHR5 structures thus explained key features of the mechanism and pathology of CFHR5 nephropathy.

Our FHR5 structures thus explained key features of the mechanism and pathology of CFHR5 nephropathy. Complement activation and regulation is of major importance in enabling clearance of pathogens, while preventing complement-mediated host cell damage. Complement factor H–related 5 protein (FHR5) was first identified co-localized with C3 in glomerular immune deposits from patients with glomerulonephritis and is a member of a family of structurally related proteins comprising the major serum complement regulator Factor H and five complement Factor H–related proteins. Factor H, comprising 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains, has been well characterized, both in terms of its structure and function, binding to activated C3b and its fragment C3d and regulating excess C3 activation (1Murphy B. Georgiou T. Machet D. Hill P. McRae J. Factor H-related protein-5: a novel component of human glomerular immune deposits.Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2002; 39 (11774097): 24-2710.1053/ajkd.2002.29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the principal physiological function of FHR5 is poorly understood. FHR5 circulates in plasma in extremely low concentrations of 3–6 μg/ml (2McRae J.L. Duthy T.G. Griggs K.M. Ormsby R.J.

It is also the least abundant of the FHR proteins, yet its structure is the longest of these proteins, with a linear sequence of nine SCR domains (Fig. 1). The SCR domain (3Soares D. Barlow P.N. Complement control protein modules in the regulators of complement activators.in: Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Structural Biology of the Complement System. Taylor & Francis, Boca Raton, FL2005: 19-62Crossref Google Scholar) is the major domain type found in the complement regulators. An SCR domain is characterized by a consensus sequence of ∼61 amino acids, with four invariant cysteine residues that form two disulfide bridges (I–III and II–IV) and a conserved tryptophan residue. It folds compactly, with a hydrophobic core, in a β-sandwich arrangement of six hydrogen-bonded β-strands. The key C-terminal C3b/C3d recognition sites are conserved between SCR-19/20 of Factor H and SCR-8/9 of FHR5 (Fig. 1). FHR5 also interacts with heparin (2McRae J.L. Duthy T.G. Griggs K.M. Ormsby R.J. Cowan P.J. Cromer B.A. McKinstry W.J. Parker M.W. Murphy B.F. Gordon D.L.

FHR5 forms native homodimers via its two N-terminal domains SCR-1/2 that exhibit increased avidity for C3b/C3d compared with the monovalent Factor H, and, although early studies using supraphysiological concentrations of FHR5 showed evidence of weak (compared with Factor H) complement regulating activity (2McRae J.L.

CFHR5 nephropathy, a monogenic cause of kidney failure endemic in Cypriots (individuals residing in or with ancestry from the island of Cyprus), is characterized in almost all affected individuals by persistent microscopic hematuria and, in a proportion of patients, episodes of kidney damage and visible blood in the urine that occur at times of otherwise trivial mucosal infections, with repeated episodes typically resulting in progressive kidney damage and eventually end-stage kidney failure occurring in >80% of affected males and <20% of affected females by the age of 55 years. Kidney biopsy shows predominantly mesangial-based glomerular inflammation with deposition of C3 but not Igs in the mesangium and, under electron microscopic examination, the subendothelial part of the glomerular basement membrane—appearances termed C3 glomerulopathy that suggest defective regulation of the complement system. The disease is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by heterozygosity for an in-frame duplication of exons 2 and 3 of the CFHR5 gene that results in production of an elongated FHR5 protein with an extra two N-terminal SCR-1/2 domains in tandem. No extrarenal features of the disease have been reported, despite the review of clinical data from over 100 affected individuals of all ages (8Gale D.P. Goicoechea de Jorge E. Cook H.T.

The molecular mechanisms that make the kidney susceptible to complement-mediated damage in CFHR5 nephropathy and other common causes of glomerulonephritis (e.g. lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy, in which flares of disease triggered by mucosal infections also occur) are not well-understood. Protein structural studies of full-length FHR5 are complicated by its large size and its eight potentially flexible interdomain linkers of lengths between three and eight residues (Fig. 1), both of which make it difficult to crystallize to determine its three-dimensional appearance. To date, atomic-level structures have not been determined for any small FHR5 fragments. However, alternative methods can be used for structural studies. Previously for full-length factor H, EM, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and molecular modeling showed that full-length factor H has a partially folded-back structure that is relevant to its regulatory function (10DiScipio R.G.

Here, these solution structural and modeling approaches were applied to determine the solution conformation of full-length FHR5 to explain its role in healthy individuals and how CFHR5 nephropathy may arise through the SCR-1/2 duplication.

The theoretical scattering profiles of this library were compared with the experimental SAXS curves to determine best-fit FHR5 structures. We thus defined a small subset of compact folded-back solution structures. The extra SCR-1/2 domain pair in mutant FHR5 was readily added to these structures, their presence leading to the formation of multivalent oligomers of FHR5. Our work explains how FHR5 regulates complement activation in the kidney and how CFHR5 nephropathy arises. Human FHR5 SCR-1/9 purchased from Creative Biolabs was subjected to gel-filtration chromatography to ensure monodispersity and removal of aggregates prior to SAXS experiments. The protein eluted as a single symmetrical peak at ∼15-ml elution volume (Fig. 2A). This was preceded by a broader peak that was eluted between 10 and 14 ml, which was attributed to protein aggregates. Only the protein fractions between 14.3 and 16.3 ml (red in Fig. 2A) were retained. By SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B), a single band was seen at 60–66 kDa (nonreduced) that corresponds well to the expected monomer molecular mass of 62.4 kDa. Reducing conditions resulted in another single band but at a slightly lower mass, this difference being attributed to the presence of glycan chains on FHR5. SEC-MALLS was used to determine the mass and self-association of FHR5 in our Tris-150 purification buffer, as in previous work (4Goicoechea de Jorge E. Caesar J.J. Malik T.H. Patel M. Colledge M.

FHR5 from a size-exclusion column was detected by UV (blue, Fig. 3) and refractive index (green) measurements, in parallel with multi-angle light scattering (red) to analyze size distributions. Three peaks were observed in the elution profile. Peak 1 at 2.7–4.2 min was assigned as aggregated material, because this had a lower UV and refractive index, but high light scattering intensities that indicated very large sizes. Its molecular mass was calculated to be above 5,400 kDa. Peak 2 at 4.9–5.2 min was the FHR5 dimer that eluted with higher UV and refractive index values but with lower light scattering. Its molecular mass was estimated as 162 kDa, this being consistent with FHR5 dimer formation, given that the mass of the monomer was 62.4 kDa from its composition (20Perkins S.J. Protein volumes and hydration effects: the calculation of partial specific volumes, neutron scattering matchpoints and 280-nm coefficients for proteins and glycoproteins from amino acid sequences.Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157 (3709531): 169-18010.1111/j.1432-1033.1986.tb09653.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Despite a large inherent error associated with light scattering, no evidence of an FHR5 monomer peak was detectable. A small peak 3 at 7.6–7.9 min was assigned to fragments below 30 kDa. AUC sedimentation velocity experiments on FHR5 studied its oligomerization and shape using size distribution c(s) analyses to determine its molecular mass and sedimentation coefficient s20,w. Absorbance data for FHR5 at 0.16 mg/ml in PBS were collected for five different salt concentrations between 20 and 250 mm NaCl. SEDFIT analyses involved as many as 500 absorbance scans. The experimental sedimentation boundaries (left, Fig. 4) gave good fits to the Lamm equation to give the size-distribution c(s) profiles (right, Fig. 4), despite the low concentrations in use. These fits were obtained by floating the meniscus, the bottom of the cell, the baseline, and the frictional ratio f/f0 of around 1.5. Protein aggregation was visible in the earliest boundaries that sedimented rapidly at the start of the runs, to leave behind the FHR5 dimer that sedimented more slowly (Fig. 4). This agreed with SEC-MALLS. A major c(s) peak at 6.0 S was observed for FHR5 in PBS-137 that corresponded to an average molecular mass of 134 kDa. This mass confirmed the presence of dimer in solution. The aggregates made little contribution to the c(s) analyses between 3 and 12 S, even though they contributed as much as half of the protein present. The molecular masses for the five buffers were between 133 and 139 kDa (Table 1), showing that the FHR5 dimer was stable between 20 and 350 mm NaCl. The c(s) analyses did not reveal any FHR5 monomer at lower s values. The reproducibility of these data was tested at two different rotor speeds of 40,000 and 50,000 rpm, to show no difference.Table 1Sedimentation velocity data for FHR5 SCR-1/9SampleaAll samples were measured at 0.16 mg/ml.

Open table in a new tab The solution structure of FHR5 between 20 and 350 mm NaCl was monitored using the mean s20,w values (Table 1). A significant decrease of 0.9 S from 6.48 to 5.35 S was seen on going from 20 mm NaCl to 350 mm NaCl. This shift in the FHR5 dimer peak was visible in the c(s) distribution plots (vertical dashed lines, Fig. 4). This result indicated a conformational change in FHR5, where the smaller s20,w values at high NaCl concentration indicated a more elongated FHR5 domain structure that formed as the ionic strength was increased (Fig. 5). SAXS was used to study the solution structure of the FHR5 dimer in concentration series in three different buffers, two being physiological (PBS-137 and Tris-150) and one being low-salt (PBS-50). The FHR5 samples were purified by gel filtration (Fig. 2). In Tris-150, data were collected using 0.04–0.5 mg/ml FHR5. In PBS-137 and PBS-50, data were collected using 0.04–0.17 mg/ml FHR5. Guinier analyses of the solution structure gave high-quality linear plots in two distinct regions of the I(Q) curves that corresponded to the radius of gyration (Rg) and the cross-sectional radius of gyration (Rxs) from two distinct Q ranges (Fig. 6). These values are measures of the overall and the shorter dimensions of macromolecular elongation, respectively. Their values were deduced according to Equations 1 and 2, respectively, within satisfactory Q.Rg and Q.Rxs limits close to 1.0 as follows. (i) In the overall structural Guinier Rg analyses in a low Q range of 0.1–0.27 nm−1 (Fig. 7A), in Tris-150 and PBS-137 buffers with similar NaCl concentrations, the mean Rg values were 5.36 ± 0.14 and 5.48 ± 0.17 nm, respectively. However, in the PBS-50 buffer with lower NaCl, the mean Rg value increased slightly to 5.91 ± 0.13 nm. This increase was attributed to trace aggregation in FHR5 that affected the lowest Q values (Fig. 7A). No concentration dependence was observed for the Rg values between 0.04 and 0.17 mg/ml; however, a slightly increased Rg value of up to 0.2 nm was seen at 0.2–0.5 mg/ml FHR5. (ii) In the cross-sectional Guinier Rxs analyses, using a Q range of 0.32–0.55 nm−1 (Fig. 7B), the mean Rxs values in each buffer were 2.41 ± 0.06, 2.29 ± 0.09, and 2.46 ± 0.14 nm for Tris-150, PBS-137, and PBS-50, respectively (Table 2). No significant changes in the Rxs values were seen between the data sets for these NaCl and protein concentrations, indicating that the cross-sectional structure of FHR5 was unchanged in conformation.Table 2X-ray scattering data for FHR5 SCR-1/9SampleRgaThe first Rg value is from Guinier analyses, and the second one is from the P(r) analyses.RgaThe first Rg value is from Guinier analyses, and the second one is from the P(r) analyses.RxsLMnm150 mm NaCl (Tris) 0.5 mg/ml5.525.852.4521.04.68 0.4 mg/ml5.565.922.5121.04.68 0.3 mg/ml5.56 ± 0.075.902.49 ± 0.0521.04.52 0.2 mg/ml5.635.942.3820.04.92 0.17 mg/ml5.28 ± 0.135.722.38 ± 0.0220.04.75 0.13 mg/ml5.40 ± 0.145.722.27 ± 0.0819.04.98 0.09 mg/ml5.37 ± 0.175.622.43 ± 0.1119.54.99 0.04 mg/ml5.30 ± 0.215.462.35 ± 0.2019.55.60137 mm NaCl (PBS) 0.17 mg/ml5.55 ± 0.055.672.28 ± 0.0621.04.98 0.13 mg/ml5.355.802.43 ± 0.0521.05.00 0.09 mg/ml5.61 ± 0.115.852.21 ± 0.1121.04.87 0.04 mg/ml5.635.882.7421.04.7550 mm NaCl (PBS) 0.17 mg/ml5.96 ± 0.096.212.41 ± 0.0420.05.25 0.13 mg/ml5.82 ± 0.146.112.42 ± 0.1120.05.12 0.09 mg/ml5.84 ± 0.056.262.37 ± 0.0819.05.38 0.04 mg/ml6.01 ± 0.276.332.63 ± 0.3319.55.77a The first Rg value is from Guinier analyses, and the second one is from the P(r) analyses. Open table in a new tab The distance distribution function P(r) in real space represents all of the distances between pairs of atoms in FHR5. This was calculated from Fourier transformation of the full I(Q) scattering curve following the specification of the maximum dimension Dmax (Equation 3; Fig. 8). The P(r) curve provided an independent Rg value for FHR5 for comparison with the Guinier value (Table 2). The Rg values from the P(r) analyses were in good agreement with those from the Guinier analyses (Table 2). The P(r) curve also gave the maximum length L of FHR5 from the value of r when P(r) = 0. The mean L values were 19.5 ± 0.4 nm in Tris-150 (Fig. 8C), 19.6 ± 0.5 nm in PBS-137 (Fig. 8B), and 21.0 nm in PBS-50 (Fig. 8A). The L value for PBS-50 was slightly higher than those in Tris-150 and PBS-137, most likely due to trace aggregation that resulted from the lower ionic strength used (see above). A single maximum M was observed in all of the P(r) curves. This corresponded to the most frequent interatomic distance within the FHR5 structure (Table 2). The mean M values were 4.9 ± 0.3, 4.9 ± 0.1, and 5.4 ± 0.3 nm for Tris-150, PBS-137, and PBS-50, respectively. The M values were relatively stable, although slightly higher for PBS-50 as the result of trace aggregates. Currently, there is no atomic level structural information on FHR5. To determine an atomistic-level solution structure for the FHR5 dimer, a starting model for the monomer was required. This was created by comparative modeling based on four known SCR crystal structures as structural templates (Fig. 1, B and C). Two used related crystal structures of the N-terminal FHR1 SCR-1/2 domains and the C-terminal FHR2 SCR-3/4 domains with high sequence identities of 85.2 and 61.7%, respectively, with SCR-1/2 and SCR-8/9 of FHR5. The SCR-3/7 domains of FHR5 share significant sequence similarities with the SCR-10/14 domains of Factor H. Although templates for individual SCR3/7 domains in FHR5 were searched for in PDB-BLAST, the best choices were these domain structures from Factor H due to their direct sequence similarities (Fig. 1C). FHR5 SCR-3/4 was represented by Factor H SCR-10/11 with a high sequence identity of 57.4%. FHR5 SCR-5/6 was represented by Factor H SCR-12/13, also with a high sequence identity of 53.9%. Although FHR5 SCR-7 is similar to Factor H SCR-14, no structure existed for Factor H SCR-14. Searches showed that the best template structure for FHR5 SCR-7 was that of SCR-11 of Factor H with a sequence identity of 34.5%. The individual template-target sequence alignments (Fig. 1C) showed no significant indels in the structure, because the numbers of residues in these were well-aligned. Thus, the FHR5 SCR-7 and SCR-8/9 sequences had only one gap inserted in each. The individual modeled domains satisfied validation checks using PROCHECK, where the Ramachandran plots showed that 70% of the residues were in the most favored steric regions. The FHR5 dimer was generated from its monomer structure by aligning its SCR-1/2 domains with the crystal structure of the FHR1 SCR-1/2 dimer (see “Experimental procedures”), followed by energy minimization to relax this starting structure. Atomistic modeling of the FHR5 scattering data established the best-fit FHR5 dimer structures, hence providing a molecular explanation for its solution structure. The scattering curves for 0.17 and 0.5 mg/ml FHR5 in Tris-150 were used to assess good quality curves with no traces of aggregation and better signal/noise ratios at 0.5 mg/ml (Fig. 9). Data for 0.5 mg/ml were not available in PBS-137 or PBS-50, and traces of aggregates were present in PBS-50 buffer; thus, these data sets were not used. The starting structure for the FHR5 dimer represented an extended conformation of the 18 SCR domains (Fig. 9). Each SCR domain was held fixed in conformation. Because as many as 14 linkers between the 18 domains were potentially variable, three different Monte Carlo conformational searches were set up. As detailed in Table 3, these varied all 14 linkers (Search 1) or eight linkers in which the crystal structure–observed linkers were kept fixed (Search 2) or four linkers after every third SCR domain (Search 3) (Fig. 1B) (see “Experimental procedures”). Initial Monte Carlo conformational simulations in Searches 1–3 gave many models that were too elongated with too large Rg values and few models with low Rg values close to the experimental Rg value of ∼5.5 nm. Thus, in further simulations, models were selected with Rg values closer to the experimental Rg value to generate further conformers, but now using an Rg cut-off of 6.0 nm as a constraint to generate more compact FHR5 dimers. This resulted in more structures with lower Rg values; however, many of these models were rejected by the workflow because the more compact shapes gave rise to physically disallowed steric clashes between the SCR domains.Table 3Three modeling fit searches for FHR5 using X-ray scattering curve fits and sedimentation coefficientsSearchFilterModelsaTotal number of models accepted after Monte Carlo simulations and after model filtering.

Therefore, a genetic analysis of the C. siamensis population in Thailand was conducted, based mitochondrial 16S rRNA (402 bp) and COI (602 bp) gene fragment sequences. Cryptozona siamensis randomly collected from 17 locations in four populations across Thailand, between May 2017 and July 2018. Fifty-eight snails were used to examine the phylogeny, genetic diversity, and genetic structure. The maximum likelihood tree based on the 16S rRNA and COI fragment sequences revealed two main clades. A total of 14 haplotypes with 44 nucleotide variable sites were found in the 16S rRNA sequences, while 14 haplotypes with 57 nucleotide variable sites were found in the COI sequences. The genetic diversity of C. siamensis in term of the number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity, was found to be high but the nucleotide diversity showed low levels of genetic differentiation for the COI sequence as also noted with the 16S rRNA sequence. The population genetic structure of C. siamensis revealed genetic difference in most populations in Thailand. However, low genetic difference in some populations may be due to high gene flow. This study provides novel insights into the basic molecular genetics of C. siamensis."

Detection of Leishmania donovani antigens in urine has the potential to provide both a non-invasive diagnostic and a test of cure. We searched for L. donovani antigens in urine of VL patients from India and Sudan to contribute to the development of urine antigen capture immunoassays. VL urine samples were incubated with immobilised anti-L. donovani polyclonal antibodies and captured material was eluted. Sudanese eluted material and concentrated VL urine were analysed by western blot. Immunocaptured and immunoreactive material from Indian and Sudanese urine was submitted to mass spectrometry for protein identification. We identified six L. donovani proteins from VL urine. Named proteins were 40S ribosomal protein S9, kinases, and others were hypothetical. Thirty-three epitope regions were predicted with high specificity in the 6 proteins. Of these, 20 were highly specific to Leishmania spp. and are highly suitable for raising antibodies for the subsequent development of an antigen capture assay. We present all the identified proteins and analysed epitope regions in full so that they may contribute to the development of non-invasive immunoassays for this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W3084543531,"Podocytes are pivotal in establishing the selective permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier. Recently, we showed that an increase of the intracellular calcium ion concentration [Ca2+] causes a rapid and transient actin reset (CaAR) measurable through live imaging microscopy using lifeact-mCherry as an actin dye in different cell types including the podocyte. This and other studies show the critical role [Ca2+] and the actin cytoskeleton play in podocyte homeostasis. To further investigate the role of [Ca2+] and the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes, we used a double fluorescent reporter mouse model to establish a primary podocyte culture system. We treated these podocytes temporarily with a Calcium Ionophore and facultatively with Latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Unbiased genome wide transcriptional analysis identified a transcriptional response in podocytes to elevated [Ca2+] levels, affecting mRNA levels of PDGF-BB, RICTOR, and MIR17HG as mediators of Ca2+-signaling. Comparison of the ex vivo transcriptional response from the primary podocyte culture with glomerular transcripts across a wide spectrum of CKD disease confirmed co-regulation of transcript sets, establishing the disease relevance of the model system. Our findings demonstrate novel [Ca2+] regulated gene networks in podocytes deepening our understanding of podocyte biology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3085183218,"In tryptophan biosynthesis, the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) starts with a condensation step in which the substrate's carboxylated phenyl group makes a nucleophilic attack to form the pyrrole ring of the indole, followed by a decarboxylation that restores the aromaticity of the phenyl. IGPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the highest turnover number of all characterized IGPS enzymes, providing an excellent model system to test the necessity of the decarboxylation step. Since the 1960s, this step has been considered to be mechanistically essential based on studies of the IGPS–phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase fusion protein from Escherichia coli. Here, we present the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa IGPS in complex with reduced CdRP, a nonreactive substrate analog, and using a sensitive discontinuous assay, we demonstrate weak promiscuous activity on the decarboxylated substrate 1-(phenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate, with an ∼1000× lower rate of IGP formation than from the native substrate. We also show that E. coli IGPS, at an even lower rate, can produce IGP from decarboxylated substrate. Our structure of P. aeruginosa IGPS has eight molecules in the asymmetric unit, of which seven contain ligand and one displays a previously unobserved conformation closer to the reactive state. One of the few nonconserved active-site residues, Phe201 in P. aeruginosa IGPS, is by mutagenesis demonstrated to be important for the higher turnover of this enzyme on both substrates. Our results demonstrate that despite IGPS's classification as a carboxy-lyase (i.e. decarboxylase), decarboxylation is not a completely essential step in its catalysis.

Our results demonstrate that despite IGPS's classification as a carboxy-lyase (i.e. decarboxylase), decarboxylation is not a completely essential step in its catalysis. Microorganisms synthesize tryptophan using the products of the trp operon. The biosynthetic pathway from the metabolic intermediate, anthranilate, starts with its phosphoribosylation, catalyzed by anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase (AnPRT; the product of trpD). The product is isomerized by phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (PRAI; the product of trpF). The next step is the formation of the indole moiety, which is catalyzed by indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS; the product of trpC). This reaction comprises a ring closure of the substrate 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate (CdRP) into the product indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP). The reaction involves a decarboxylation that makes it irreversible. Therefore, IGPS belongs to the carboxy-lyase family (EC 4.1.1.48). In the last step of tryptophan biosynthesis, IGP is converted into tryptophan by tryptophan synthase (trpAB). In some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, IGPS is expressed and functions as a fusion protein with PRAI. The AnPRT-, PRAI-, and IGPS-catalyzed reactions are shown in Fig. 1A. PRAI and IGPS both adopt the (βα)8-barrel fold. In the past two decades, they have emerged as model systems for understanding the evolution of biosynthetic pathways and for the evolvability of the (βα)8-barrel (1List F. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Related (βα)8-barrel proteins in histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis: a paradigm to study enzyme evolution.ChemBioChem. 2011; 12 (21656890): 1487-149410.1002/cbic.201100082Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). IGPS has also been utilized as a starting scaffold for the de novo design of entirely new enzymes (2Jiang L. Althoff E.A. Clemente F.R. Doyle L. Röthlisberger D. Zanghellini A. Gallaher J.L. Betker J.L. Tanaka F. Barbas C.F. Hilvert D. Houk K.N. Stoddard B.L. Baker D.

Because it catalyzes the formation of the indole heterocycle, it is of additional interest for chemical synthesis, because indole derivatives are commonly used within the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and material science industries (3Barden T.C. Indoles: industrial, agricultural and over-the-counter uses.in: Gribble G.W. Heterocyclic Scaffolds II: Reactions and Applications of Indoles. Springer, Berlin2010: 31-46Crossref Google Scholar). IGPS has also been suggested as a potential drug target, particularly in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4Czekster C.M. Neto B.A.D. Lapis A.A.M. Dupont J. Santos D.S. Basso L.A. Steady-state kinetics of indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 486 (19364491): 19-2610.1016/j.abb.2009.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the structure, function, and mechanism of IGPS have been investigated. Several structures of the enzyme have been solved, beginning with the structure of the IGPS–PRAI fusion protein from E. coli (5Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. Three-dimensional structure of the bifunctional enzyme phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase: indoleglycerolphosphate synthase from Escherichia coli refined at 2.0 Å resolution.J. Mol.

The IGPS structure has a canonical (βα)8-barrel fold with an additional N-terminal helical extension comprising two α-helices, α0 and α00, of which α0 forms a lid over the active site (Fig. 2). Helix α0 is known to be important for substrate binding affinity, because removal of the residues corresponding to helix α0 by trypsin digest in the IGPS enzymes from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Thermotoga maritima resulted in dramatic increases of Km (6Schneider B. Knöchel T. Darimont B. Hennig M. Dietrich S. Babinger K. Kirschner K. Sterner R.

Structures of IGPS from the hyperthermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus (SsIGPS) in complex with the substrate CdRP, the substrate analog reduced CdRP (rCdRP), and the product IGP have provided important insights into the active-site features (7Hennig M.

Although the deoxyribulose 5-phosphate component of the substrate and product stays fixed during the reaction, the indole ring of IGP binds 5–6 Å away from the anthranilate moiety of CdRP, occupying an adjacent hydrophobic pocket. CdRP and the analog rCdRP adopt extended “unproductive” conformations in which the distance between the carbon atoms is too large (4.5 Å) to be joined in pyrrole formation. Hence, conformational rearrangements are required during the reaction and are supposedly guided by the flexible βα-loop 1, which has been demonstrated to be important for catalysis, as well as binding (8Schlee S. Dietrich S. Kurćon T. Delaney P. Goodey N.M. Sterner R.

Despite numerous kinetics studies, aspects of the IGPS reaction mechanism remain unsettled. For instance, there are discrepancies in the literature regarding the identities of the catalytic residues and the rate-determining step of the reaction. In 1972, Parry (9Parry R.J. Biosynthesis of compounds containing an indole nucleus.in: Houlihan W.J. The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds. Wiley-Interscience, Hoboken, NJ, USA1972: 1-64Google Scholar) proposed a reaction mechanism with three sequential steps of condensation, decarboxylation, and dehydration, involving the intermediates I1 and I2 (Fig. 1B), catalyzed by a general acid and a general base. This general mechanism was supported by tandem MS in which a molecular species with a fragmentation pattern agreeing with intermediate I1 was identified (10Czekster C.M. Lapis A.A.M. Souza G.H.M.F.

The conserved residues Lys53, Lys110, Glu159, and Asn180 (SsIGPS numbering) have been demonstrated to be essential for activity (corresponding to Lys63, Lys123, Glu172, and Asn194 in PaIGPS, Fig. 2) (11Darimont B.

They instead suggested Lys53 and Glu51 to constitute the catalytic acid and base, respectively, for the dehydration step. As support for their hypothesis, they demonstrated shifted pH-rate profiles when either of these residues were mutated. Aiming to address what is rate-limiting for the reaction, the individual steps have been analyzed by means of (pre-)steady-state kinetics, pH profiling, and solvent kinetic isotope effect (4Czekster C.M.

At moderate temperatures, the rate-limiting step of the thermophilic SsIGPS was shown to be product release (8Schlee S. Dietrich S. Kurćon T. Delaney P. Goodey N.M. Sterner R.

In contrast, for the mesophilic E. coli enzyme, a chemical step prior to CO2 release (i.e. condensation) was suggested to be rate-limiting (14Zaccardi M.J. Mannweiler O. Boehr D.D. Differences in the catalytic mechanisms of mesophilic and thermophilic indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase enzymes at their adaptive temperatures.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Yanofsky C. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan.Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 794-80610.1016/S0076-6879(62)05315-XCrossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) tested whether E. coli IGPS (EcIGPS) could turn over the decarboxylated substrate, 1-(phenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate (PAdRP), to yield the native product, IGP. No such activity was detected, leading to the conclusion that the carboxyl group is essential for IGPS activity. This conclusion has been cited (7Hennig M. Darimont B.D. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. The catalytic mechanism of indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase: crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus with substrate analogue, substrate, and product.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319 (12054868): 757-76610.1016/S0022-2836(02)00378-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but the mechanistic imperative for decarboxylation has not been addressed in any previous study. We previously reported the initial characterization of IGPS from the opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17Gerth M.L. Nigon L.V. Patrick W.M. Characterization of the indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.Protein J. 2012; 31 (22555873): 359-36510.1007/s10930-012-9412-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This enzyme, PaIGPS, has a higher kcat value than the other IGPSs that have been characterized (kcat = 11 s−1). This has made it useful in coupled activity assays of other Trp biosynthetic enzymes, such as evolved HisA mutants with PRAI activity (18Newton M.S. Guo X. Söderholm A. Näsvall J. Lundström P. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Patrick W.M. Structural and functional innovations in the real-time evolution of new (βα)8 barrel enzymes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We also showed that deleting trpC from P. aeruginosa incurred a fitness cost of ∼11% in synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (17Gerth M.L. Nigon L.V. Patrick W.M. Characterization of the indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.Protein J. 2012; 31 (22555873): 359-36510.1007/s10930-012-9412-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibition of IGPS may be a useful strategy for helping to clear P. aeruginosa infections from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, where tryptophan levels can be undetectably low (19Palmer K.L. Aye L.M. Whiteley M. Nutritional cues control Pseudomonas aeruginosa multicellular behavior in cystic fibrosis sputum.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 (17873029): 8079-808710.1128/JB.01138-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). With our unusually active IGPS in hand, we have sought to revisit the mechanism of the enzyme. During experiments to evaluate substrate specificity in our HisA mutants with PRAI activity (18Newton M.S. Guo X. Söderholm A. Näsvall J. Lundström P. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Patrick W.M. Structural and functional innovations in the real-time evolution of new (βα)8 barrel enzymes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

S., (2015) On the evolution of catalysis: the changing kinetics of core metabolic enzymes. Ph.D. thesis, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.Google Scholar). The product of this reaction is the decarboxylated analog of CdRP, PAdRP (Fig. 1), enabling tests for IGPS activity on decarboxylated substrate. By using a combination of kinetics, structure analysis, and mutagenesis, we here demonstrate that decarboxylation is not completely essential for the mechanism of PaIGPS, although the catalytic efficiency with PAdRP is 41,000-fold reduced compared with CdRP. The structure of PaIGPS also allows us to pinpoint structural differences between homologous IGPS enzymes that are important for substrate ambiguity. The PaIGPS–rCdRP complex crystallized in space group P21212 in a large unit cell containing eight enzyme molecules per asymmetric unit. The enzyme was purified as monomer, and its monomeric state in solution was further verified by small-angle X-ray scattering (data not shown). Similar to previous IGPS structures, the enzyme forms a (βα)8-barrel with additional N-terminal helices (Fig. 3A). Seven of the protein chains (A–F and H) are complete apart from one or two missing residues in the N terminus and ∼20 missing residues in the C terminus, including the vector-derived sequence TSGHHHHHH. In addition, the eighth chain (G) has a partly disordered N terminus and βα-loop 2. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of chains B, C, D, E, F, and H is ∼0.2 Å for 230–250 Cα, and the RMSD of chain G is 0.3 Å over 213 Cα atoms when superimposed on chain A. The substrate analog, rCdRP, is bound in the active site of the seven more ordered chains. rCdRP is enclosed in the active site by the helix α0 and βα-loops 1, 2, and 6. The suggested catalytic residues (Lys123, Glu172, Lys63, and Glu61) adopt similar conformations and identical interactions with the ligand rCdRP as in the SsIGPS structure (Fig. 3B). The C2' position of rCdRP is in the R configuration as it is in the SsIGPS complex (7Hennig M. Darimont B.D. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. The catalytic mechanism of indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase: crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus with substrate analogue, substrate, and product.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319 (12054868): 757-76610.1016/S0022-2836(02)00378-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the conformation of the ligand is identical in chains A, C, and E. The same conformation is modeled in chains D, F, and H, but there, the electron density is poor in the C1'–C2' region (Fig. S1), indicating flexibility around O2'. In chain B, the same conformation of rCdRP does not fit the electron density, and the ligand instead adopts a conformation where the C2' hydroxyl is shifted 2.2 Å toward the general acid Lys123 (Fig. S1 and Fig. 3C). The observed movements in the C1'–C2' region in some chains are possibly coupled to the position of the guanidinium group of Arg196 on loop 6, which adopts an “inward” conformation and interacts with both the ligand's carboxylate and phosphate group in chains B, F, G, and H (Fig. 3C). The catalytic acid Lys123 is responsible for protonation of O2' of CdRP (7Hennig M. Darimont B.D. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. The catalytic mechanism of indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase: crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus with substrate analogue, substrate, and product.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319 (12054868): 757-76610.1016/S0022-2836(02)00378-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1B and 3B). The distance between the H-bond donor and the acceptor in the corresponding hydrogen bond is very short in chain B, only 2.1 Å, compared with 2.5 Å in the other chains. Moreover, the unbiased omit electron density around C2' in chain B suggests that the ligand possibly adopts a more planar carbonyl-like conformation, mimicking the substrate CdRP (Fig. S1), but interpretation is limited by the resolution of the structure. The C1'–C2'–C3' angle refines to 117° in the B chain, compared with 113° in chains A, C, and E. Chain G lacks density for rCdRP in the active site. The N-terminal helix is located on a symmetry axis that distorts the density around the α0 hinge, and this part coincides with the corresponding hinge region of a symmetry-related molecule. Electron density for the α0 (lid domain) helix is, however, visible, and a 14-residue stretch of the helix (residues 11–24) has been modeled as poly-Ala because the register of this stretch is uncertain. The helix adopts an open conformation in chain G, where—through domain swapping—it covers the active site of a symmetry-related molecule (Fig. 3D). Residues Val99–Phe102 of βα-loop 2 are disordered, and the βα-loop 1 density is weak, especially for residues Pro67–Gly70 at the tip of the loop. The ability of PaIGPS to turn over the decarboxylated CdRP derivative PAdRP was measured spectrophotometrically by an increase in A278. The substrate PAdRP was produced enzymatically from aniline and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) (Fig. 1A). Activity with PAdRP was weak but detectable at high substrate concentrations. Product formation was clearly observable when an assay mixture containing 2.5 μm PaIGPS and 400 μm substrate was incubated for 24 h at 25 °C (Fig. 4A). The identity of the reaction product, IGP, was verified by high-resolution accurate mass determination using LC-coupled LTQ-Orbitrap MS (data not shown). At 5 μm PaIGPS, the change in A278 after 24 h corresponded to the production of 380 μm IGP, corresponding to almost complete turnover of the input 400 μm aniline precursor (data not shown). Despite the previous report to the contrary (16Smith B.O.H. Yanofsky C. Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan.Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 794-80610.1016/S0076-6879(62)05315-XCrossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we did also see some turnover of PAdRP by the engineered monomeric variant of E. coli IGPS (21Patrick W.M. Blackburn J.M. In vitro selection and characterization of a stable subdomain of phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase.FEBS J. 2005; 272 (16008567): 3684-369710.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04794.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in our highly sensitive assay (Fig. 4A). By sampling the reaction every 30–60 min, we were able to observe a linear increase in product formation over the first 4 h of the incubation. When substrate concentration was varied, the observed reaction rate increased over the range 0–400 μm and then appeared to be saturated at 800 μm. This suggested that the enzyme was obeying Michaelis–Menten kinetics, albeit with very low activity (Fig. 4B). Curve-fitting suggested that PaIGPS has a kcat of 15.9 ± 1.4 h−1 and a Km of 180 ± 50 μm for PAdRP and EcIGPS has a kcat of 1.4 ± 0.7 h−1 and a Km of 200 ± 330 μm for PAdRP. The structure of PaIGPS is highly similar to the IGPS domain of the E. coli IGPS–PRAI protein (PDB entry 1PII (5Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. Three-dimensional structure of the bifunctional enzyme phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase: indoleglycerolphosphate synthase from Escherichia coli refined at 2.0 Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223 (1738159): 477-50710.1016/0022-2836(92)90665-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) with an RMSD of 0.9 Å over 201 Cα atoms (Fig. 5). Comparison of the active sites shows that most of the residues are conserved. However, in PaIGPS, there is a phenylalanine on active-site βα-loop 6 (Phe201), 4 Å away from the anthranilate of rCdRP, whereas in EcIGPS the corresponding residue is a leucine (Fig. 5). We hypothesized that Phe201 might improve the ability of PaIGPS to bind the decarboxylated substrate through a π-stacking interaction with its benzyl ring. To test this hypothesis, a PaIGPS-F201L mutant was constructed and tested for activity (Fig. 4B). A Michaelis–Menten fit to the data suggested a kcat of ∼6.8 ± 0.8 h−1 (roughly 40% of WT) and a Km of 130 ± 60 μm for PAdRP. To determine how the activities of the IGPS variants with PAdRP compared with the native activity, a similar discontinuous assay was conducted with 400 μm CdRP as the substrate. The activity of PaIGPS under these conditions was determined to 3.0 ± 0.2 s−1, which was ∼1000-fold faster than what was measured with PAdRP under the same conditions (11.3 ± 0.7 h−1; Fig. 4B). On the other hand, the activity of PaIGPS-F201L at 400 μm substrate was 0.42 ± 0.06 s−1 with CdRP, which was only ∼300-fold faster than the rate with PAdRP (5.8 ± 0.7 h−1; Fig. 4B) and similar to the rate of CdRP turnover with EcIGPS (0.29 ± 0.03 s−1). The previously reported kcat for PaIGPS is 11 s−1 (17Gerth M.L. Nigon L.V. Patrick W.M. Characterization of the indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.Protein J. 2012; 31 (22555873): 359-36510.1007/s10930-012-9412-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and that for monofunctional EcIGPS 3.2 s−1 (22Eberhard M.

The tryptophan biosynthesis enzyme IGPS has been heavily studied because of its potential significance for medical and industrial applications. In this work, we have probed the structure and mechanism of IGPS from P. aeruginosa, because it has the highest reported turnover number of all IGPS enzymes characterized to date (17Gerth M.L. Nigon L.V. Patrick W.M. Characterization of the indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.Protein J. 2012; 31 (22555873): 359-36510.1007/s10930-012-9412-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our structure of PaIGPS has eight protein molecules in the asymmetric unit showing partly different conformational states of the protein and the ligand rCdRP. The structure of chains A–F and H are overall similar to previous IGPS structures. The active-site residues are generally conserved and form similar interactions with the ligand rCdRP as in the previous structure of SsIGPS with rCdRP (Fig. 3B). Lys123 is well-positioned to catalyze the proton transfer in the condensation step (Fig. 1B). The catalytic residues taking part in the dehydration step are harder to speculate on because of the substantial structural rearrangements taking place during the reaction (7Hennig M. Darimont B.D.

The product IGP is a closer mimic of the I2 intermediate than rCdRP. Comparing our structure to the SsIGPS in complex with IGP (PDB entry 1A53 (7Hennig M. Darimont B.D. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K.

The conserved active-site residue Arg196 adopts either an inward or outward conformation in the different chains (Fig. 3C), which appears to be coupled to the conformation in the C2' region of rCdRP (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the only previously published structure showing the arginine in the inward conformation is the SsIGPS structure in complex with substrate CdRP (Arg182 in PDB entry 1LBL (7Hennig M.

https://openalex.org/W3084817871,"The aim of this study was to determine the main characteristics of a ""good teacher"" through the use of questionnaires designed to assess teaching skills and competences, considering the point of view of teachers, principals, and students. In total, 82 teachers, 14 principals, and 625 middle-school students from 5 public schools in São Paulo state participated in this study. Two questionnaires were applied, one designed for teachers and principals and the other for students. First, teachers and principals completed their specific questionnaire, after which the other questionnaire was applied to the students. Both questionnaires contained multiple choice questions related to eight distinct subsections. The questions were answered through the use of a Likert scale, varying from 1 (""totally disagree"") to 5 (""totally agree""). The comparisons of the frequency of responses among all questionnaire subsections between teachers and principals were analyzed using a Chi-Square and the z-test, with P-values adjusted to the Bonferroni method. The statistical significance level was set as P < 0.05. The subsection ""class atmosphere"" presented the highest percentage of response ""totally agree"", closely followed by ""professional engagement"". Significant differences (P < 0.05) in responses were observed between teachers and principals for ""teaching planning and practice"", ""use of time and material resources to develop classes"", and ""professional engagement"" domains. In summary, it was demonstrated that some teaching characteristics might be more important than others, with some of these characteristics exhibiting significant differences between groups. Nevertheless, it is crucial to emphasize that all assessed educational domains may be recognized as critical teaching qualities, as all of them presented high levels of ""totally agree"" responses."
