https://openalex.org/W3209435229,"Quantifying the pathogenicity of protein variants in human disease-related genes would have a marked effect on clinical decisions, yet the overwhelming majority (over 98%) of these variants still have unknown consequences1–3. In principle, computational methods could support the large-scale interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art methods4–10 have relied on training machine learning models on known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of variable quality, the resulting models have been considered insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that leverages deep generative models to predict variant pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12–16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings. A new computational method, EVE, classifies human genetic variants in disease genes using deep generative models trained solely on evolutionary sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3181108784,"Access to safely managed drinking water (SMDW) remains a global challenge, and affects 2.2 billion people1,2. Solar-driven atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) devices with continuous cycling may accelerate progress by enabling decentralized extraction of water from air3-6, but low specific yields (SY) and low daytime relative humidity (RH) have raised questions about their performance (in litres of water output per day)7-11. However, to our knowledge, no analysis has mapped the global potential of AWH12 despite favourable conditions in tropical regions, where two-thirds of people without SMDW live2. Here we show that AWH could provide SMDW for a billion people. Our assessment-using Google Earth Engine13-introduces a hypothetical 1-metre-square device with a SY profile of 0.2 to 2.5 litres per kilowatt-hour (0.1 to 1.25 litres per kilowatt-hour for a 2-metre-square device) at 30% to 90% RH, respectively. Such a device could meet a target average daily drinking water requirement of 5 litres per day per person14. We plot the impact potential of existing devices and new sorbent classes, which suggests that these targets could be met with continued technological development, and well within thermodynamic limits. Indeed, these performance targets have been achieved experimentally in demonstrations of sorbent materials15-17. Our tools can inform design trade-offs for atmospheric water harvesting devices that maximize global impact, alongside ongoing efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with existing technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3208854778,"Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41 per cent per year since 20091. Energy system projections that mitigate climate change and aid universal energy access show a nearly ten-fold increase in PV solar energy generating capacity by 20402,3. Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs1-9. Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (-75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland. Our inventory could aid PV delivery aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals."
https://openalex.org/W3208166932,"Abstract The phytohormone auxin controls many processes in plants, at least in part through its regulation of cell expansion 1 . The acid growth hypothesis has been proposed to explain auxin-stimulated cell expansion for five decades, but the mechanism that underlies auxin-induced cell-wall acidification is poorly characterized. Auxin induces the phosphorylation and activation of the plasma membrane H + -ATPase that pumps protons into the apoplast 2 , yet how auxin activates its phosphorylation remains unclear. Here we show that the transmembrane kinase (TMK) auxin-signalling proteins interact with plasma membrane H + -ATPases, inducing their phosphorylation, and thereby promoting cell-wall acidification and hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis . Auxin induced interactions between TMKs and H + -ATPases in the plasma membrane within seconds, as well as TMK-dependent phosphorylation of the penultimate threonine residue on the H+-ATPases. Our genetic, biochemical and molecular evidence demonstrates that TMKs directly phosphorylate plasma membrane H + -ATPase and are required for auxin-induced H + -ATPase activation, apoplastic acidification and cell expansion. Thus, our findings reveal a crucial connection between auxin and plasma membrane H + -ATPase activation in regulating apoplastic pH changes and cell expansion through TMK-based cell surface auxin signalling."
https://openalex.org/W3208518221,"Immune cells identify and destroy damaged cells to prevent them from causing cancer or other pathologies by mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 places cells under immunosurveillance to establish a biological timer mechanism that controls cell fate. p21 activates retinoblastoma protein (Rb)–dependent transcription at select gene promoters to generate a complex bioactive secretome, termed p21-activated secretory phenotype (PASP). The PASP includes the chemokine CXCL14, which promptly attracts macrophages. These macrophages disengage if cells normalize p21 within 4 days, but if p21 induction persists, they polarize toward an M1 phenotype and lymphocytes mount a cytotoxic T cell response to eliminate target cells, including preneoplastic cells. Thus, p21 concurrently induces proliferative arrest and immunosurveillance of cells under duress."
https://openalex.org/W3197132660,"Growth regulation tailors development in plants to their environment. A prominent example of this is the response to gravity, in which shoots bend up and roots bend down1. This paradox is based on opposite effects of the phytohormone auxin, which promotes cell expansion in shoots while inhibiting it in roots via a yet unknown cellular mechanism2. Here, by combining microfluidics, live imaging, genetic engineering and phosphoproteomics in Arabidopsis thaliana, we advance understanding of how auxin inhibits root growth. We show that auxin activates two distinct, antagonistically acting signalling pathways that converge on rapid regulation of apoplastic pH, a causative determinant of growth. Cell surface-based TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE1 (TMK1) interacts with and mediates phosphorylation and activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPases for apoplast acidification, while intracellular canonical auxin signalling promotes net cellular H+ influx, causing apoplast alkalinization. Simultaneous activation of these two counteracting mechanisms poises roots for rapid, fine-tuned growth modulation in navigating complex soil environments."
https://openalex.org/W3210728577,"Understanding human organ formation is a scientific challenge with far-reaching medical implications1,2. Three-dimensional stem-cell cultures have provided insights into human cell differentiation3,4. However, current approaches use scaffold-free stem-cell aggregates, which develop non-reproducible tissue shapes and variable cell-fate patterns. This limits their capacity to recapitulate organ formation. Here we present a chip-based culture system that enables self-organization of micropatterned stem cells into precise three-dimensional cell-fate patterns and organ shapes. We use this system to recreate neural tube folding from human stem cells in a dish. Upon neural induction5,6, neural ectoderm folds into a millimetre-long neural tube covered with non-neural ectoderm. Folding occurs at 90% fidelity, and anatomically resembles the developing human neural tube. We find that neural and non-neural ectoderm are necessary and sufficient for folding morphogenesis. We identify two mechanisms drive folding: (1) apical contraction of neural ectoderm, and (2) basal adhesion mediated via extracellular matrix synthesis by non-neural ectoderm. Targeting these two mechanisms using drugs leads to morphological defects similar to neural tube defects. Finally, we show that neural tissue width determines neural tube shape, suggesting that morphology along the anterior-posterior axis depends on neural ectoderm geometry in addition to molecular gradients7. Our approach provides a new route to the study of human organ morphogenesis in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3208299838,"The physics and universality scaling of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has historically been a topic of great interest. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibiting intriguing long-range magnetic order have been in the spotlight. Although an out-of-plane anisotropy has been shown to stabilize 2D magnetic order, the demonstration of a 2D magnet with in-plane rotational symmetry has remained elusive. We constructed a nearly ideal easy-plane system, a single CrCl3 monolayer on graphene/6H-SiC(0001), and observed robust ferromagnetic ordering with critical scaling characteristic of a 2D-XY system. These observations indicate the realization of a finite-size Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in a large-area, quasi–free-standing van der Waals monolayer magnet with an XY universality class. This offers a material platform to host 2D superfluid spin transport and topological magnetic textures."
https://openalex.org/W3210538530,"Excitonic insulators (EIs) arise from the formation of bound electron–hole pairs (excitons)1,2 in semiconductors and provide a solid-state platform for quantum many-boson physics3–8. Strong exciton–exciton repulsion is expected to stabilize condensed superfluid and crystalline phases by suppressing both density and phase fluctuations8–11. Although spectroscopic signatures of EIs have been reported6,12–14, conclusive evidence for strongly correlated EI states has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) EI ground state formed in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor double layers. A quasi-equilibrium spatially indirect exciton fluid is created when the bias voltage applied between the two electrically isolated TMD layers is tuned to a range that populates bound electron–hole pairs, but not free electrons or holes15–17. Capacitance measurements show that the fluid is exciton-compressible but charge-incompressible—direct thermodynamic evidence of the EI. The fluid is also strongly correlated with a dimensionless exciton coupling constant exceeding 10. We construct an exciton phase diagram that reveals both the Mott transition and interaction-stabilized quasi-condensation. Our experiment paves the path for realizing exotic quantum phases of excitons8, as well as multi-terminal exciton circuitry for applications18–20. So far only signatures of excitonic insulators have been reported, but here direct thermodynamic evidence is provided for a strongly correlated excitonic insulating state in transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor double layers."
https://openalex.org/W3208116526,"The dearth of new medicines effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a growing global public health concern1. For more than five decades, the search for new antibiotics has relied heavily on the chemical modification of natural products (semisynthesis), a method ill-equipped to combat rapidly evolving resistance threats. Semisynthetic modifications are typically of limited scope within polyfunctional antibiotics, usually increase molecular weight, and seldom permit modifications of the underlying scaffold. When properly designed, fully synthetic routes can easily address these shortcomings2. Here we report the structure-guided design and component-based synthesis of a rigid oxepanoproline scaffold which, when linked to the aminooctose residue of clindamycin, produces an antibiotic of exceptional potency and spectrum of activity, which we name iboxamycin. Iboxamycin is effective against ESKAPE pathogens including strains expressing Erm and Cfr ribosomal RNA methyltransferase enzymes, products of genes that confer resistance to all clinically relevant antibiotics targeting the large ribosomal subunit, namely macrolides, lincosamides, phenicols, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins and streptogramins. X-ray crystallographic studies of iboxamycin in complex with the native bacterial ribosome, as well as with the Erm-methylated ribosome, uncover the structural basis for this enhanced activity, including a displacement of the $${\text{m}}_{2}^{6}\text{A}2058$$ nucleotide upon antibiotic binding. Iboxamycin is orally bioavailable, safe and effective in treating both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections in mice, attesting to the capacity for chemical synthesis to provide new antibiotics in an era of increasing resistance. Structure-guided design and component-based synthesis are used to produce iboxamycin, a novel ribosome-binding antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3210911353,"Measurements of the atmospheric carbon (C) and oxygen (O) relative to hydrogen (H) in hot Jupiters (relative to their host stars) provide insight into their formation location and subsequent orbital migration1,2. Hot Jupiters that form beyond the major volatile (H2O/CO/CO2) ice lines and subsequently migrate post disk-dissipation are predicted have atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) near 1 and subsolar metallicities2, whereas planets that migrate through the disk before dissipation are predicted to be heavily polluted by infalling O-rich icy planetesimals, resulting in C/O < 0.5 and super-solar metallicities1,2. Previous observations of hot Jupiters have been able to provide bounded constraints on either H2O (refs. 3-5) or CO (refs. 6,7), but not both for the same planet, leaving uncertain4 the true elemental C and O inventory and subsequent C/O and metallicity determinations. Here we report spectroscopic observations of a typical transiting hot Jupiter, WASP-77Ab. From these, we determine the atmospheric gas volume mixing ratio constraints on both H2O and CO (9.5 × 10-5-1.5 × 10-4 and 1.2 × 10-4-2.6 × 10-4, respectively). From these bounded constraints, we are able to derive the atmospheric C/H ([Formula: see text] × solar) and O/H ([Formula: see text] × solar) abundances and the corresponding atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.59 ± 0.08; the solar value is 0.55). The sub-solar (C+O)/H ([Formula: see text] × solar) is suggestive of a metal-depleted atmosphere relative to what is expected for Jovian-like planets1 while the near solar value of C/O rules out the disk-free migration/C-rich2 atmosphere scenario."
https://openalex.org/W3209079142,"Glutathione (GSH) is a small-molecule thiol that is abundant in all eukaryotes and has key roles in oxidative metabolism1. Mitochondria, as the major site of oxidative reactions, must maintain sufficient levels of GSH to perform protective and biosynthetic functions2. GSH is synthesized exclusively in the cytosol, yet the molecular machinery involved in mitochondrial GSH import remains unknown. Here, using organellar proteomics and metabolomics approaches, we identify SLC25A39, a mitochondrial membrane carrier of unknown function, as a regulator of GSH transport into mitochondria. Loss of SLC25A39 reduces mitochondrial GSH import and abundance without affecting cellular GSH levels. Cells lacking both SLC25A39 and its paralogue SLC25A40 exhibit defects in the activity and stability of proteins containing iron–sulfur clusters. We find that mitochondrial GSH import is necessary for cell proliferation in vitro and red blood cell development in mice. Heterologous expression of an engineered bifunctional bacterial GSH biosynthetic enzyme (GshF) in mitochondria enables mitochondrial GSH production and ameliorates the metabolic and proliferative defects caused by its depletion. Finally, GSH availability negatively regulates SLC25A39 protein abundance, coupling redox homeostasis to mitochondrial GSH import in mammalian cells. Our work identifies SLC25A39 as an essential and regulated component of the mitochondrial GSH-import machinery. SLC25A39 and its paralogue SLC25A40 have redundant roles in the import of glutathione into mitochondria of mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W3210899709,"Leghemoglobins enable the endosymbiotic fixation of molecular nitrogen (N2) in legume nodules by channeling O2 for bacterial respiration while maintaining a micro-oxic environment to protect O2-sensitive nitrogenase. We found that the NIN-like protein (NLP) transcription factors NLP2 and NIN directly activate the expression of leghemoglobins through a promoter motif, resembling a “double” version of the nitrate-responsive elements (NREs) targeted by other NLPs, that has conserved orientation and position across legumes. CRISPR knockout of the NRE-like element resulted in strongly decreased expression of the associated leghemoglobin. Our findings indicate that the origins of the NLP-leghemoglobin module for O2 buffering in nodules can be traced to an ancient pairing of NLPs with nonsymbiotic hemoglobins that function in hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W3210420974,"Abstract Among tool kits to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, school closures are one of the most frequent non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, school closures bring about substantial costs, such as learning loss. To date, studies have not reached a consensus about the effectiveness of these policies at mitigating community transmission, partly because they lack rigorous causal inference. Here we assess the causal effect of school closures in Japan on reducing the spread of COVID-19 in spring 2020. By matching each municipality with open schools to a municipality with closed schools that is the most similar in terms of potential confounders, we can estimate how many cases the municipality with open schools would have had if it had closed its schools. We do not find any evidence that school closures in Japan reduced the spread of COVID-19. Our null results suggest that policies on school closures should be reexamined given the potential negative consequences for children and parents."
https://openalex.org/W3208630390,"Bryozoans (also known as ectoprocts or moss animals) are aquatic, dominantly sessile, filter-feeding lophophorates that construct an organic or calcareous modular colonial (clonal) exoskeleton1-3. The presence of six major orders of bryozoans with advanced polymorphisms in lower Ordovician rocks strongly suggests a Cambrian origin for the largest and most diverse lophophorate phylum2,4-8. However, a lack of convincing bryozoan fossils from the Cambrian period has hampered resolution of the true origins and character assembly of the earliest members of the group. Here we interpret the millimetric, erect, bilaminate, secondarily phosphatized fossil Protomelission gatehousei9 from the early Cambrian of Australia and South China as a potential stem-group bryozoan. The monomorphic zooid capsules, modular construction, organic composition and simple linear budding growth geometry represent a mixture of organic Gymnolaemata and biomineralized Stenolaemata character traits, with phylogenetic analyses identifying P. gatehousei as a stem-group bryozoan. This aligns the origin of phylum Bryozoa with all other skeletonized phyla in Cambrian Age 3, pushing back its first occurrence by approximately 35 million years. It also reconciles the fossil record with molecular clock estimations of an early Cambrian origination and subsequent Ordovician radiation of Bryozoa following the acquisition of a carbonate skeleton10-13."
https://openalex.org/W3208126985,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on complex regulatory networks to preserve stemness. Due to the scarcity of HSCs, technical challenges have limited our insights into the interplay between metabolites, transcription, and the epigenome. In this study, we generated low-input metabolomics, transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, revealing distinct metabolic hubs that are enriched in HSCs and their downstream multipotent progenitors. Mechanistically, we uncover a non-classical retinoic acid (RA) signaling axis that regulates HSC function. We show that HSCs rely on Cyp26b1, an enzyme conventionally considered to limit RA effects in the cell. In contrast to the traditional view, we demonstrate that Cyp26b1 is indispensable for production of the active metabolite 4-oxo-RA. Further, RA receptor beta (Rarb) is required for complete transmission of 4-oxo-RA-mediated signaling to maintain stem cells. Our findings emphasize that a single metabolite controls stem cell fate by instructing epigenetic and transcriptional attributes."
https://openalex.org/W3210775554,"The cognitive abilities that characterize humans are thought to emerge from unique features of the cortical circuit architecture of the human brain, which include increased cortico-cortical connectivity. However, the evolutionary origin of these changes in connectivity and how they affected cortical circuit function and behaviour are currently unknown. The human-specific gene duplication SRGAP2C emerged in the ancestral genome of the Homo lineage before the major phase of increase in brain size1,2. SRGAP2C expression in mice increases the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses received by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs)3-5. Here we show that the increased number of excitatory synapses received by layer 2/3 PNs induced by SRGAP2C expression originates from a specific increase in local and long-range cortico-cortical connections. Mice humanized for SRGAP2C expression in all cortical PNs displayed a shift in the fraction of layer 2/3 PNs activated by sensory stimulation and an enhanced ability to learn a cortex-dependent sensory-discrimination task. Computational modelling revealed that the increased layer 4 to layer 2/3 connectivity induced by SRGAP2C expression explains some of the key changes in sensory coding properties. These results suggest that the emergence of SRGAP2C at the birth of the Homo lineage contributed to the evolution of specific structural and functional features of cortical circuits in the human cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3209140125,"Inflammation early in life can prime the local immune milieu of peripheral tissues, which can cause lasting changes in immunological tone that confer disease protection or susceptibility1. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that prompt changes in immune tone in many nonlymphoid tissues remain largely unknown. Here we find that time-limited neonatal inflammation induced by a transient reduction in neonatal regulatory T cells causes a dysregulation of subcutaneous tissue in mouse skin. This is accompanied by the selective accumulation of type 2 helper T (TH2) cells within a distinct microanatomical niche. TH2 cells are maintained into adulthood through interactions with a fibroblast population in skin fascia that we refer to as TH2-interacting fascial fibroblasts (TIFFs), which expand in response to TH2 cytokines to form subcutaneous fibrous bands. Activation of the TH2–TIFF niche due to neonatal inflammation primes the skin for altered reparative responses to wounding. Furthermore, we identify fibroblasts in healthy human skin that express the TIFF transcriptional signature and detect these cells at high levels in eosinophilic fasciitis, an orphan disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the skin fascia. Taken together, these data define a previously unidentified TH2 cell niche in skin and functionally characterize a disease-associated fibroblast population. The results also suggest a mechanism of immunological priming whereby inflammation early in life creates networks between adaptive immune cells and stromal cells to establish an immunological set-point in tissues that is maintained throughout life. Time-limited skin inflammation in neonatal mice promotes a reciprocal interaction between type 2 helper T cells and fascial fibroblasts that regulates wound repair in later life."
https://openalex.org/W3209329966,"Adipocytes increase energy expenditure in response to prolonged sympathetic activation via persistent expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)1,2. Here we report that the regulation of glycogen metabolism by catecholamines is critical for UCP1 expression. Chronic β-adrenergic activation leads to increased glycogen accumulation in adipocytes expressing UCP1. Adipocyte-specific deletion of a scaffolding protein, protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), reduces glycogen levels in beige adipocytes, attenuating UCP1 expression and responsiveness to cold or β-adrenergic receptor-stimulated weight loss in obese mice. Unexpectedly, we observed that glycogen synthesis and degradation are increased in response to catecholamines, and that glycogen turnover is required to produce reactive oxygen species leading to the activation of p38 MAPK, which drives UCP1 expression. Thus, glycogen has a key regulatory role in adipocytes, linking glucose metabolism to thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3209631663,"Axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate after spinal cord injury. Neurons lose their capacity to regenerate during development, but the intracellular processes underlying this loss are unclear. We found that critical components of the presynaptic active zone prevent axon regeneration in adult mice. Transcriptomic analysis combined with live-cell imaging revealed that adult primary sensory neurons downregulate molecular constituents of the synapse as they acquire the ability to rapidly grow their axons. Pharmacogenetic reduction of neuronal excitability stimulated axon regeneration after adult spinal cord injury. Genetic gain- and loss-of-function experiments uncovered that essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins of the presynaptic active zone, but not clostridial-toxin-sensitive VAMP-family SNARE proteins, inhibit axon regeneration. Systemic administration of Baclofen reduced voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx in primary sensory neurons and promoted their regeneration after spinal cord injury. These findings indicate that functional presynaptic active zones constitute a major barrier to axon regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3209448772,"During ongoing presynaptic action potential (AP) firing, transmitter release is limited by the availability of release-ready synaptic vesicles (SVs). The rate of SV recruitment (SVR) to release sites is strongly upregulated at high AP frequencies to balance SV consumption. We show that Munc13-1-an essential SV priming protein-regulates SVR via a Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent mechanism. Using knockin mouse lines with point mutations in the Ca2+-phospholipid-binding C2B domain of Munc13-1, we demonstrate that abolishing Ca2+-phospholipid binding increases synaptic depression, slows recovery of synaptic strength after SV pool depletion, and reduces temporal fidelity of synaptic transmission, while increased Ca2+-phospholipid binding has the opposite effects. Thus, Ca2+-phospholipid binding to the Munc13-1-C2B domain accelerates SVR, reduces short-term synaptic depression, and increases the endurance and temporal fidelity of neurotransmission, demonstrating that Munc13-1 is a core vesicle priming hub that adjusts SV re-supply to demand."
https://openalex.org/W3208362322,"Social interaction deficits seen in psychiatric disorders emerge in early-life and are most closely linked to aberrant neural circuit function. Due to technical limitations, we have limited understanding of how typical versus pathological social behavior circuits develop. Using a suite of invasive procedures in awake, behaving infant rats, including optogenetics, microdialysis, and microinfusions, we dissected the circuits controlling the gradual increase in social behavior deficits following two complementary procedures-naturalistic harsh maternal care and repeated shock alone or with an anesthetized mother. Whether the mother was the source of the adversity (naturalistic Scarcity-Adversity) or merely present during the adversity (repeated shock with mom), both conditions elevated basolateral amygdala (BLA) dopamine, which was necessary and sufficient in initiating social behavior pathology. This did not occur when pups experienced adversity alone. These data highlight the unique impact of social adversity as causal in producing mesolimbic dopamine circuit dysfunction and aberrant social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3210152214,"Abstract Accurate navigation to a desired goal requires consecutive estimates of spatial relationships between the current position and future destination throughout the journey. Although neurons in the hippocampal formation can represent the position of an animal as well as its nearby trajectories 1–7 , their role in determining the destination of the animal has been questioned 8,9 . It is, thus, unclear whether the brain can possess a precise estimate of target location during active environmental exploration. Here we describe neurons in the rat orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that form spatial representations persistently pointing to the subsequent goal destination of an animal throughout navigation. This destination coding emerges before the onset of navigation, without direct sensory access to a distal goal, and even predicts the incorrect destination of an animal at the beginning of an error trial. Goal representations in the OFC are maintained by destination-specific neural ensemble dynamics, and their brief perturbation at the onset of a journey led to a navigational error. These findings suggest that the OFC is part of the internal goal map of the brain, enabling animals to navigate precisely to a chosen destination that is beyond the range of sensory perception."
https://openalex.org/W3210818934,"Legume nodules create an environment for intracellular bacterial symbionts to fix atmospheric nitrogen. The master regulator NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) controls many aspects of nodule initiation, and we demonstrate that it also regulates the transition to nitrogen fixation via proteolytic processing by a signal peptidase complex. Processing of NIN results in a carboxyl-terminal NIN fragment containing the DNA binding motifs, which activates a suite of genes associated with symbiosome development and nitrogen fixation. Similar NIN processing is observed in Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, implying a conserved mechanism of cell state transition. These findings explain how legume nodules transition to a nitrogen-fixing state and a mechanism by which a single transcription factor can regulate many different developmental processes necessary in the activation and regulation of nitrogen fixation."
https://openalex.org/W3209538487,"The idea that preformed Cooper pairs could exist in a superconductor at temperatures higher than its zero-resistance critical temperature (Tc) has been explored for unconventional, interfacial, and disordered superconductors, but direct experimental evidence is lacking. We used scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy to show that preformed Cooper pairs exist up to temperatures much higher than Tc in the disordered superconductor titanium nitride by observing an enhancement in the shot noise that is equivalent to a change of the effective charge from one to two electron charges. We further show that the spectroscopic gap fills up rather than closes with increasing temperature. Our results demonstrate the existence of a state above Tc that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap but carries charge through paired electrons."
https://openalex.org/W3210375384,"The autosomal dominant monogenetic disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) affects approximately one in 3,000 individuals and is caused by mutations in the NF1 tumour suppressor gene, leading to dysfunction in the protein neurofibromin (Nf1)1,2. As a GTPase-activating protein, a key function of Nf1 is repression of the Ras oncogene signalling cascade. We determined the human Nf1 dimer structure at an overall resolution of 3.3 Å. The cryo-electron microscopy structure reveals domain organization and structural details of the Nf1 exon 23a splicing3 isoform 2 in a closed, self-inhibited, Zn-stabilized state and an open state. In the closed conformation, HEAT/ARM core domains shield the GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD) so that Ras binding is sterically inhibited. In a distinctly different, open conformation of one protomer, a large-scale movement of the GRD occurs, which is necessary to access Ras, whereas Sec14-PH reorients to allow interaction with the cellular membrane4. Zn incubation of Nf1 leads to reduced Ras-GAP activity with both protomers in the self-inhibited, closed conformation stabilized by a Zn binding site between the N-HEAT/ARM domain and the GRD-Sec14-PH linker. The transition between closed, self-inhibited states of Nf1 and open states provides guidance for targeted studies deciphering the complex molecular mechanism behind the widespread neurofibromatosis syndrome and Nf1 dysfunction in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3208262996,"The Dispatched protein, which is related to the NPC1 and PTCH1 cholesterol transporters1,2 and to H+-driven transporters of the RND family3,4, enables tissue-patterning activity of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein by releasing it from tightly -localized sites of embryonic expression5–10. Here we determine a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mouse protein Dispatched homologue 1 (DISP1), revealing three Na+ ions coordinated within a channel that traverses its transmembrane domain. We find that the rate of Hedgehog export is dependent on the Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane. The transmembrane channel and Na+ binding are disrupted in DISP1-NNN, a variant with asparagine substitutions for three intramembrane aspartate residues that each coordinate and neutralize the charge of one of the three Na+ ions. DISP1-NNN and variants that disrupt single Na+ sites retain binding to, but are impaired in export of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein to the SCUBE2 acceptor. Interaction of the amino-terminal signalling domain of the Sonic hedgehog protein (ShhN) with DISP1 occurs via an extensive buried surface area and contacts with an extended furin-cleaved DISP1 arm. Variability analysis reveals that ShhN binding is restricted to one extreme of a continuous series of DISP1 conformations. The bound and unbound DISP1 conformations display distinct Na+-site occupancies, which suggests a mechanism by which transmembrane Na+ flux may power extraction of the lipid-linked Hedgehog signal from the membrane. Na+-coordinating residues in DISP1 are conserved in PTCH1 and other metazoan RND family members, suggesting that Na+ flux powers their conformationally driven activities. Cryo-electron microscopy studies show that dynamic coordination of Na+ in the ion channel of Dispatched homologue 1 and the transmembrane Na+ gradient have key roles in exporting lipid-modified Hedgehog protein signal."

A growing body of evidence indicates that this circulation shaped hydroclimatic conditions in the Indian Ocean region also on much longer, glacial-interglacial timescales3-5, following the development of Pacific Walker circulation around 2.2-2.0 million years ago (Ma)6,7. However, continuous long-term records to determine the timing and mechanisms of Pacific-influenced climate transitions in the Indian Ocean have been unavailable. Here we present a seven-million-year-long record of wind-driven circulation of the tropical Indian Ocean, as recorded in Mozambique Channel Throughflow (MCT) flow-speed variations. We show that the MCT flow speed was relatively weak and steady until 2.1 ± 0.1 Ma, when it began to increase, coincident with the intensification of the Pacific Walker circulation6,7. Strong increases during glacial periods, which reached maxima after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (0.9-0.64 Ma; ref. 8), were punctuated by weak flow speeds during interglacial periods. We provide a mechanism explaining that increasing MCT flow speeds reflect synchronous development of the Indo-Pacific Walker cells that promote aridification in Africa. Our results suggest that after about 2.1 Ma, the increasing aridification is punctuated by pronounced humid interglacial periods. This record will facilitate testing of hypotheses of climate-environmental drivers for hominin evolution and dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W3208979405,"Repeated seizure activity can lead to long-term changes in seizure dynamics and behavior. However, resulting changes in brain-wide dynamics remain poorly understood. This is due partly to technical challenges in precise seizure control and in vivo whole-brain mapping of circuit dynamics. Here, we developed an optogenetic kindling model through repeated stimulation of ventral hippocampal CaMKII neurons in adult rats. We then combined fMRI with electrophysiology to track brain-wide circuit dynamics resulting from non-afterdischarge (AD)-generating stimulations and individual convulsive seizures. Kindling induced widespread increases in non-AD-generating stimulation response and ipsilateral functional connectivity and elevated anxiety. Individual seizures in kindled animals showed more significant increases in brain-wide activity and bilateral functional connectivity. Onset time quantification provided evidence for kindled seizure propagation from the ipsilateral to the contralateral hemisphere. Furthermore, a core of slow-migrating hippocampal activity was identified in both non-kindled and kindled seizures, revealing a novel mechanism of seizure sustainment and propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3208719246,"Autophagy is a catabolic process responsible for the removal of waste and damaged cellular components by lysosomal degradation. It plays a key role in fundamental cell processes, including ER stress mitigation, control of cell metabolism, and cell differentiation and proliferation, all of which are essential for cartilage cell (chondrocyte) development and survival, and for the formation of cartilage. Correspondingly, autophagy dysregulation has been implicated in several skeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. To test the requirement for autophagy during skeletal development in zebrafish, we generated an atg13 CRISPR knockout zebrafish line. This line showed a complete loss of atg13 expression, and restricted autophagic activity in vivo. In the absence of autophagy, chondrocyte maturation was accelerated, with chondrocytes exhibiting signs of premature hypertrophy. Focussing on the jaw element, autophagy disruption affected joint articulation causing restricted mouth opening. This gross behavioural phenotype corresponded with a failure to thrive, and death in homozygote atg13 nulls within 17 days. Taken together, our results are consistent with autophagy contributing to the timely regulation of chondrocyte maturation and for extracellular matrix formation."
https://openalex.org/W3209546470,"Diarrheal disease (DD)-associated mortality has declined since 1990; however, the incidence of DD has experienced a less-pronounced decrease. Thus, it is important to track progress in managing DD by following loss of healthy years. A disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), which combines data on years-of-life lost (YLL) and years-lived with-disability (YLD), is a metric that can track such a burden.Using all 28 years of data in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we compared DD DALYs among different demographic subsets including sex, age, country, and World Bank (WB) income level. We also evaluated DD DALYs as a function of the socio-demographic index (SDI), a measure of a region's socio-demographic development. On a global level, DD DALYs have decreased by approximately 85.43% from 1990 to 2017. Incidence and prevalence have decreased by 1.53% and 4.45%, respectively. A dramatic decrease in DD DALYs were observed for WB low-income countries, but not for WB high-income constituents. The temporal decrease in DD DALY rates in WB low-income countries was likely driven by a decrease in YLL. Alternatively, temporal increases in both YLL and YLD may have contributed to the apparent lack of progress in WB high-income countries. Regardless of WB income classification, children under the age of five and the elderly were the most vulnerable to DD. In nearly every year from 1990 to 2017, DD DALYs for females were higher than those for males in WB high-income regions, but lower than those for males in WB low-income constituents. The reason for these differences is not known. We also observed that the rate of DD DALYs was highly correlated to SDI regardless of WB income classification.To the best of our knowledge, this is the only temporal study of DD DALYs that encompasses all 28 years of data available from the GBD. Overall, our analyses show that temporal reductions in DD DALYs are not equivalent across regions, sexes and age groups. Therefore, careful attention to local and demography-specific risk factors will be necessary to tailor solutions in region- and demography-specific manners."

https://openalex.org/W3210931022,"Gruta do Caldeirão features a c. 6 m-thick archaeological stratification capped by Holocene layers ABC-D and Ea, which overlie layer Eb, a deposit of Magdalenian age that underwent significant disturbance, intrusion, and component mixing caused by funerary use of the cave during the Early Neolithic. Here, we provide an updated overview of the stratigraphy and archaeological content of the underlying Pleistocene succession, whose chronology we refine using radiocarbon and single-grain optically stimulated luminescence dating. We find a high degree of stratigraphic integrity. Dating anomalies exist in association with the succession's two major discontinuities: between layer Eb and Upper Solutrean layer Fa, and between Early Upper Palaeolithic layer K and Middle Palaeolithic layer L. Mostly, the anomalies consist of older-than-expected radiocarbon ages and can be explained by bioturbation and palimpsest-forming sedimentation hiatuses. Combined with palaeoenvironmental inferences derived from magnetic susceptibility analyses, the dating shows that sedimentation rates varied in tandem with the oscillations in global climate revealed by the Greenland oxygen isotope record. A steep increase in sedimentation rate is observed through the Last Glacial Maximum, resulting in a c. 1.5 m-thick accumulation containing conspicuous remains of occupation by people of the Solutrean technocomplex, whose traditional subdivision is corroborated: the index fossils appear in the expected stratigraphic order; the diagnostics of the Protosolutrean and the Lower Solutrean predate 24,000 years ago; and the constraints on the Upper Solutrean place it after Greenland Interstadial 2.2. (23,220-23,340 years ago). Human usage of the site during the Early Upper and the Middle Palaeolithic is episodic and low-intensity: stone tools are few, and the faunal remains relate to carnivore activity. The Middle Palaeolithic is found to persist beyond 39,000 years ago, at least three millennia longer than in the Franco-Cantabrian region. This conclusion is upheld by Bayesian modelling and stands even if the radiocarbon ages for the Middle Palaeolithic levels are removed from consideration (on account of observed inversions and the method's potential for underestimation when used close to its limit of applicability). A number of localities in Spain and Portugal reveal a similar persistence pattern. The key evidence comes from high-resolution fluviatile contexts spared by the site formation issues that our study of Caldeirão brings to light-palimpsest formation, post-depositional disturbance, and erosion. These processes. are ubiquitous in the cave and rock-shelter sites of Iberia, reflecting the impact on karst archives of the variation in climate and environments that occurred through the Upper Pleistocene, and especially at two key points in time: between 37,000 and 42,000 years ago, and after the Last Glacial Maximum. Such empirical difficulties go a long way towards explaining the controversies surrounding the associated cultural transitions: from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic, and from the Solutrean to the Magdalenian. Alongside potential dating error caused by incomplete decontamination, proper consideration of sample association issues is required if we are ever to fully understand what happened with the human settlement of Iberia during these critical intervals, and especially so with regards to the fate of Iberia's last Neandertal populations."
https://openalex.org/W3208955247,"Pseudocercospora fijiensis is the causal agent of the highly destructive black Sigatoka disease of banana. Previous research has focused on polyketide synthase gene clusters in the fungus, given the importance of polyketide pathways in related plant pathogenic fungi. A time course study of expression of the previously identified PKS7-1, PKS8-2, and PKS10-2 gene clusters showed high expression of all three PKS genes and the associated clustered genes in infected banana plants from 2 weeks post-inoculation through 9 weeks. Engineered transformants silenced for PKS8-2 and PKS10-2 were developed and tested for pathogenicity. Inoculation of banana plants with silencing transformants for PKS10-2 showed significant reduction in disease symptoms and severity that correlated with the degree of silencing in the conidia used for inoculation, supporting a critical role for PKS10-2 in disease development. Unlike PKS10-2, a clear role for PKS8-2 could not be determined. Two of four PKS8-2 silencing transformants showed reduced disease development, but disease did not correlate with the degree of PKS8-2 silencing in the transformants. Overall, the degree of silencing obtained for the PKS8-2 transformants was less than that obtained for the PKS10-2 transformants, which may have limited the utility of the silencing strategy to identify a role for PKS8-2 in disease. Orthologous PKS10-2 clusters had previously been identified in the related banana pathogens Pseudocercospora musae and Pseudocercospora eumusae. Genome analysis identified orthologous gene clusters to that of PKS10-2 in the newly sequenced genomes of Pseudocercospora fuligena and Pseudocercospora cruenta, pathogens of tomato and cowpea, respectively. Our results support an important role for the PKS10-2 polyketide pathway in pathogenicity of Pseudocercospora fijiensis, and suggest a possible role for this pathway in disease development by other Pseudocercospora species."
https://openalex.org/W3209670642,"The use of copper (Cu 2+ ) and cobalt (Co 2+ ) has been described to stimulate blood vessel formation, a key process for the success of tissue regeneration. However, understanding how different concentrations of these ions affect cellular response is important to design scaffolds for their delivery to better fine tune the angiogenic response. On the one hand, gene expression analysis and the assessment of tubular formation structures with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) revealed that high concentrations (10μM) of Cu 2+ in early times and lower concentrations (0.1 and 1μM) at later times (day 7) enhanced angiogenic response. On the other hand, higher concentrations (25μM) of Co 2+ during all time course increased the angiogenic gene expression and 0.5, 5 and 25μM enhanced the ability to form tubular structures. To further explore synergistic effects combining both ions, the non-toxic concentrations were used simultaneously, although results showed an increased cell toxicity and no improvement of angiogenic response. These results provide useful information for the design of Cu 2+ or Co 2+ delivery scaffolds in order to release the appropriate concentration during time course for blood vessel stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3210260070,"The cAMP-CRP regulon coordinates transcription regulation of several energy-related genes, the lac operon among them. Lactose, or IPTG, induces the lac operon expression by binding to the LacI repressor, and releasing it from the promoter sequence. At the same time, the expression of the lac operon requires the presence of the CRP-cAMP complex, which promotes the binding of the RNA polymerase to the promoter region. The modified nucleotide cAMP accumulates in the absence of glucose and binds to the CRP protein, but its ability to bind to DNA can be impaired by lysine-acetylation of CRP. Here we add another layer of control, as acetylation of CRP seems to be modified by ppGpp. In cells grown in glycerol minimal media, ppGpp seems to repress the expression of lacZ, where ΔrelA mutants show higher expression of lacZ than in WT. These differences between the WT and ΔrelA strains seem to depend on the levels of acetylated CRP. During the growth in minimal media supplemented with glycerol, ppGpp promotes the acetylation of CRP by the Nε-lysine acetyltransferases YfiQ. Moreover, the expression of the different genes involved in the production and degradation of Acetyl-phosphate (ackA-pta) and the enzymatic acetylation of proteins (yfiQ) are stimulated by the presence of ppGpp, depending on the growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3210867789,"We proposed an experimental methodology for producing films on substrates with an ion beam induced chemical vapor deposition (IBICVD) method using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) as a source material. In this study, both HMDS and ion beam were simultaneously injected onto a Si substrate. We selected Ar+ and N+ as the ion beam. The energy of the ion beam was 101 eV. Temperature of the Si substrate was set at 540 °C. After the experiments, films were found to be deposited on the substrates. The films were then analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, stylus profilometer, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FTIR and XPS results showed that silicon carbide films containing small amount of nitrogen were formed when Ar+ ions were injected in conjunction with HMDS. On the other hand, in the cases of N+ ion beam irradiation, silicon nitride films involving small amount of carbon were formed. It was noted that no film deposition was observed when HMDS alone was supplied to the substrates without any ion beam injections."
https://openalex.org/W3210437182,"Mice lacking B cells are more susceptible to S. typhimurium infection. How B cells contribute to protective immunity against Salmonella and what signals drive their activation are still unclear. Neutrophils (Nphs), monocytes (MOs), and dendritic cells (DCs) are involved in early immune responses to control the initial replication of S. typhimurium. These cells can produce B cell activating factor (BAFF) required for mature B cell survival and may help regulate B cell responses during Salmonella infection. Using BAFF reporter mice (BAFF-RFP+/-), we discovered that an i.p. infection with a virulent strain of S. typhimurium increased BAFF expression in splenic conventional DCs (cDC) and inflammatory Ly6Chi MOs/DCs four days post-infection. S. typhimurium infection induced the release of BAFF from Nphs, a decrease of BAFF-RFP expression and expansion of BAFF-RFP+ Nphs in the spleen and peritoneal cavity. After S. typhimurium infection, serum BAFF levels and immature and mature B cell subsets and plasma cells increased substantially. Conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking BAFF in either Nphs or cDCs compared to control Bafffl/fl mice had reduced up-regulation of systemic BAFF levels and reduced expansion of mature and germinal center B cell subsets after infection. Importantly, the cKO mice lacking BAFF from either Nphs or cDCs had impaired induction of Salmonella-specific IgM Abs, and were more susceptible to S. typhimurium infection. Thus, Nphs and cDCs are major cellular sources of BAFF driving B cell responses, required for mounting optimal protective immunity against lethal Salmonella infection."

However, they are rarely applied for prognosis of cervical cancer in Tanzania, where visual inspection assay with acetic acid or Lugol's iodine and Pap test are being used as the standard screening/ diagnostic methods.This was a retrospective hospital-based cross-sectional study that was conducted to assess cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p16) and topoisomerase II-alpha (TOP2A) proteins expression among women seeking cervical cancer care at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Tanzania between May 1, 2017 and May 10, 2018. Immunohistochemistry technique was used to detect the expressions of p16 and TOP2A proteins from the retrieved formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cervical biopsies.A total of 145 patients, with a mean age of 52.1 ± 12.9 years, were included in this study. Upon immunohistochemistry staining, 103 (71.0%) and 90 (62.1%) were p16 and TOP2A positive respectively. There was a strong association between histopathological class and p16/TOP2A expression levels (Fisher's exact test, p<0.001). Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between p16/TOP2A and cancerous cervical lesions (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients = 0.833 and 0.687, p = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). The age-adjusted odds ratio for predicting cervical cancer lesions were independently significant for p16/TOP2A biomarkers in FFPE cervical tissues [p16: OR = 1.142 (95% CI: 1.059-1.232, p<0.001) and TOP2A: OR = 1.046 (95% CI: 1.008-1.085, p = 0.015)]. Importantly, the diagnostic performance of p16 was higher than that of TOP2A in the diagnosis of cancerous lesions from non-cancerous cervical lesions (sensitivity: 97.2% versus 77.6%, accuracy: 92.8% versus 87.8%, respectively).Our study has highlighted that over-expression of TOP2A is related to the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia but does not predict prognosis in cervical cancer. Similarly, expression of p16 is related to degree of histological dysplasia and malignancy, suggesting its prognostic and predictive value in the management of cervical cancers. Further bigger studies are needed to validate their applications in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer."

However, the benefits of a closed unit model have not been extensively compared to those of a mandatory critical care consultation model.This retrospective before-after study included patients admitted to the medical ICU. Anthropometric data, admission reason, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, survival status, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU, duration of mechanical ventilator care, and occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were recorded. The staffing model of the medical ICU was changed from a mandatory critical care consultation model to a closed unit model in September 2017, and indices before and after the conversion were compared.A total of 1,526 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 64.5 years, and 954 (62.5%) patients were men. The mean LOS in the ICU among survivors was shorter in the closed unit model than in the mandatory critical care consultation model by multiple regression analysis (5.5 vs. 6.7 days; p = 0.005). Central venous catheter insertion (38.5% vs. 51.9%; p < 0.001) and VAP (3.5% vs. 8.6%; p < 0.001) were less frequent in the closed unit model group than in the mandatory critical care consultation model group. After adjusting for confounders, the closed unit model group had decreased ICU mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.65; p < 0.001) and shortened LOS in the ICU compared to the mandatory critical care consultation model group.The closed unit model was superior to the mandatory critical care consultation model in terms of ICU mortality and LOS among ICU survivors."
https://openalex.org/W3208944538,"Phenolic compounds are chemical precursor building blocks of soil organic matter. Their occurrence can be inhibitory to certain enzymes present in soil, thereby influencing the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter. Microbe-derived phenoloxidases (laccases) are extracellular enzymes capable of degrading recalcitrant polyphenolic compounds. In this study, our aim was to investigate the relationships between phenoloxidase enzyme activity, organic carbon content and microbial abundance in the context of long-term anthropogenically amended soils. To achieve this, we used a series of complementary biochemical analytical methods including gas chromatography, enzyme assays and solid-state Carbon-13 Cross Polarisation Magic-Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (13C CPMAS NMR). Using several anthrosols found in St Andrews (Scotland, UK) that had been subjected to intense anthropogenic modification since the medieval period (11th century AD) to present-day, we were able to scope the impact of past waste disposal on soils. The long-term anthropogenic impact led to organic matter-rich soils. Overall, phenoloxidase activity increased by up to 2-fold with soil depth (up to 100 cm) and was inversely correlated with microbial biomass. Solid-state 13C NMR characterisation of carbon species revealed that the observed decline in soil organic matter with depth corresponded to decreases in the labile organic carbon fractions as evidenced by changes in the O/N-alkyl C region of the spectra. The increase in phenoloxidase activity with depth would appear to be a compensatory mechanism for the reduced quantities of organic carbon and lower overall nutrient environment in subsoils. By enzymatically targeting phenolic compounds, microbes can better utilise recalcitrant carbon when other labile soil carbon sources become limited, thereby maintaining metabolic processes."
https://openalex.org/W3209561056,"The Eastern Pamir (eastern Tajikistan) is a high-mountain plateau with elevations up to 7000 m, currently characterized by extremely severe environmental conditions and harboring a specialized montane fauna, which in part is shared with that of the Tibetan Plateau. The modern bird fauna of High Asia comprises a diversity of both ancient and recently diverged endemics, and thus is of general importance for historical biogeography and understanding the origin of modern high mountain ecosystems. However, the past history of the Central Asian highland avian communities remains practically unknown, as no fossil bird assemblages from high elevation areas were previously reported. In particular, it remains completely unexplored how birds responded to late Quaternary climatic fluctuations. Here we report the first fossil bird fauna from the High Asia and the first fossil birds from Tajikistan. An assemblage from the late Pleistocene through middle Holocene of Istykskaya cave (4060 m) in Eastern Pamir surprisingly comprises a remarkable diversity of waterbirds, including a few species that are completely absent from High Asia today and that were not reported globally from such high altitudes. The diversity of waterbirds incudes taxa of various ecological preferences (shorebirds, underwater and surface feeders, both zoophagous and phytophagous), strongly indicating the presence of a productive waterbody at the vicinity of the site in the past. These observations correspond to recent palaeoclimatic data, implying increased water availability in this region, currently occupied by high mountain semi-deserts. Our findings for the first time show that milder environmental conditions of late Quaternary attracted lowland species to the Central Asian highland wetlands. The reported assemblage yet contains several characteristic highland taxa, indicating a long-time persistence of some Central Asian montane faunistic elements. In particular, it includes the Tibetan Sandgrouse (Syrrhaptes tibetanus), a highly-specialized montane dweller, which is for the first time found in the fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W3210246826,"Maternal overnutrition during pregnancy and lactation is an important risk factor for the later development of metabolic disease, especially diabetes, among mothers and their offspring. As a fructan-type plant polysaccharide, inulin has prebiotic functions and is widely used as a natural antidiabetic supplement. However, to date, the mechanism of maternal inulin treatment in the livers of offspring has not been addressed, especially with respect to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, female C57BL6/J mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without inulin supplementation or a standard rodent diet (SD) during gestation and lactation. After the offspring were weaned, they were fed a SD for 5 weeks. At 8 weeks of age, the glucose metabolism indexes of the offspring were assessed, and their livers were collected to assay lncRNA and mRNA profiles to investigate the effects of early maternal inulin intervention on offspring. Our results indicate that male offspring from HFD-fed dams displayed glucose intolerance and an insulin resistance phenotype at 8 weeks of age. Early maternal inulin intervention improved glucose metabolism in male offspring of mothers fed a HFD during gestation and lactation. The lncRNA and mRNA profile data revealed that compared with the offspring from HFD dams, offspring from the early inulin intervention dams had 99 differentially expressed hepatic lncRNAs and 529 differentially expressed mRNAs. The differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA coexpression analysis demonstrated that early maternal inulin intervention may change hepatic lncRNA expression in offspring; there lncRNAs are involved in metabolic pathways and the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Importantly, the early maternal inulin intervention alleviated glucose metabolism by inhibiting the lncRNA Serpina4-ps1/let-7b-5p/Ppargc1a as a competing endogenous RNA in male offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3209071575,"Background The aim of this study was to explore potential associations between compliance with the traditional male role norms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Methods The study was conducted on 135 male Polish firefighters. The study used the Impact Event Scale-Revised, the Relations/Social Support Scale and the Male Role Norms Scale. Results The study revealed that the firefighters that suffered from probable PTSD (over 34% of all the respondents) seemed to comply with the male role norms more strictly than those without PTSD. The reverse was found to be true for the perceived social support. Social status norms and toughness norms understood as expectations that men should achieve high status by means of successful career, etc., and be tough and resilient at all costs to be perceived as “manly” were found to be positively associated with the development of PTSD, while in the case of perceived social support, a negative association was confirmed. The results might yield important clinical implications—traditional male role norms pertaining to toughness and social status might be associated with the increase in chances of developing PTSD after the exposure to potentially traumatic events. Conclusions Firefighting as a stereotypically masculine occupation may be associated with the reinforcement of stereotypically masculine behaviors, which in turn is associated with a decreased ability to cope with potentially traumatic stimuli and favoring maladaptive behaviors. The results might suggest that addressing the beliefs about masculinity during psychological intervention in the case of PTSD might be beneficial especially among such masculinized groups as firefighters. The main limitations of the study are: participation of those more eager to participate and reveal personal information; the recall and report bias; the relatively small sample size; sociodemographic data omissions; the study group almost exclusively consisting of firefighters from large urban centers."
