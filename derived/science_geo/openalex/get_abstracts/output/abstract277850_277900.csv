https://openalex.org/W2007642868,"The concentration of airborne soil dust at Enewetak Atoll (11°N, 162°E) in April 1979 was 2.3 micrograms per cubic meter but decreased steadily to 0.02 microgram per cubic meter over the next 5 months. The spring dust is probably derived from China; its deposition rate (∼0.3 millimeter per 1000 years) suggests that it may be a significant contributor to the deep-sea sediments of the North Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W1973001824,"Many planktonic foraminiferal species deposit their shells at the chlorophyll maximum zone, and it is the temperature range here that is relevant to oceanographic models which use ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in fossil foraminifera and foraminiferal fossil assemblages to ascertain past climates. During periods of stratification of the upper water column, the temperature at the chlorophyll maximum may differ from the sea surface temperature by 10 degrees C in the western North Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2071875610,"The hydrogen isotopic content of an animal's food, not water, determines that animal's hydrogen isotopic content. Liver and muscle tissue from mice reared on a diet such that the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen (DIH) of their food and water was kept constant, have the same average D/H ratio as the food source. In a simple, natural population of snails and their possible algal diets, Littorina obtusata (northern Atlantic intertidal snails that feed almost exclusively on the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus) has the same D/H ratio as Fucus vesiculosis and not that of the other algae available to the snails."
https://openalex.org/W2020612328,"Experiments with this scanning microscope have produced extremely encouraging results so that we feel Confident in predicting high resolution and high contrast after some obvious modifications are made in the system, such as providing a good objective lens. Experience with conventional lenses indicates that the instrument behaves in a predictable manner and there is no reason to doubt that the resolution can be as good as that of a conventional microscope. The use of quadrupole lenses will depend on calculations now being performed. There is cause for optimism; high resolution may also be possible with this kind of lens. Experience with field emission shows that the technology is not difficult and that there is more than enough current available for any conceivable use. Energy-loss measurements have been made on a variety of materials. It is attractive to consider the possibility of chemical analysis of selected areas of a specimen. We believe that a very crude form of analysis may indeed be possible. The principal advantage of the use of energy-loss techniques, however, may be in the availability of another contrast mechanism. The ability to ""see"" small details may be considerably enhanced. Finally, we are experimenting with the possibility of using transmitted electrons of different energy losses to produce different colors on a color television display. This should add an extra element to the picture contrast which may be of some value."
https://openalex.org/W2052903324,"Carbon from the Allende meteorite is not graphite but carbyne (triply bonded elemental carbon), inasmuch as on heating to 250 degrees to 330 degrees C it releases mainly triply bonded fragments: -(C identical withC)(n),- with n = 1 to 5, and -(C identical withC)(n)-CN, with n = 1 to 3. Although carbynes have been known to form only by condensation of carbon vapor above 2600 K or by explosive shock of > 600 kilobars, it is found that they also form metastably by the reaction 2CO --> CO(2) + C (solid) at 300 degrees to 400 degrees C in the presence of a chromite catalyst. Such low-temperature formation by surface catalysis may be the dominant source of carbynes on the earth and in meteorites, and a major source of interstellar carbynes and cyanopolyacetylenes."
https://openalex.org/W2019964347,"Five carbynes (triply bonded allotropes of carbon) have been found by electron diffraction in the Allende and Murchison carbonaceous chondrites: carbon VI, VIII, X, XI, and (tentatively) XII. From the isotopic composition of the associated noble-gas components, it appears that the carbynes in Allende (C3V chondrite) are local condensates from the solar nebula, whereas at least two carbynes in Murchison (C2 chondrite) are of exotic, presolar origin. They may be dust grains that condensed in stellar envelopes and trapped isotopically anomalous matter from stellar nucleosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1979037553,Measurements in the interstitial waters of pelagic red clay and carbonate ooze sediments in the central equatorial Pacific show that the dissolved oxygen content decreases with depth and levels off at nonzero values. The supply of reactive organic carbon introduced by bioturbation limits oxygen consumption at depth in the sediment. These gradients should produce diffusive fluxes across the sediment-water interface that average about 8.8 x 10(-14) mole per square centimeter per second or 0.08 milliliter per square meter per hour.
https://openalex.org/W1970187422,"Ion implantation experiments suggest that the accumulation of alpha-recoil damage in radioactive waste storage materials, which behave like solid-state track detectors, plays a drastic role in their long-term degradation. The understanding of alpha-recoil ""aging,"" overlooked in earlier studies, offers new guidelines for improving waste storage conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2083881344,"Abstract. Major glaciation in the Sierra Nevada of California resulted in the deposition of till which underlies latite 2.7 x 10(6) years old and overlies andesite 3.1 x 10(6) years old. This till, herein called the Deadman Pass till, is the oldest Pleistocene glacial deposit that has been found in temperate latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1987688695,Juvenile hormone deprivation caused by surgical removal of corpora allata shortly after adult emergence blocked the initiation of biting behavior in Culex. pipiens and Culex quinquefasciatus. Reimplantation of corpora allata or injection of a synthetic juvenile hormone (JH-I) corrected the juvenile hormone deficiency and restored biting behavior. Ovariectomy experiments demonstrated that this behavioral effect of juvenile hormone was independent of ovarian involvement.
https://openalex.org/W2025955490,"The fossil Pteridinium, a distinctive component of a worldwide early metazoan (Ediacaran) assemblage, is provisionally recorded from probable early Cambrian strata in eastern California. In context with other evidence, this finding implies a Cambrian age for the Ediacaran fauna and approximate coincidence of limits between Phanerozoic-Cryptozoic, Paleozoic-Precambrian, and Cambrian-Precambrian."
https://openalex.org/W2093138569,"Attempts to obtain the metallic phase of InSb by the use of a Teflon cell and a 40-centistroke silicone oil as the pressure cell and transmitting medium respectively, in a piston-cylinder apparatus failed. Work done at the University of California, Los Angeles, indicated that the metallic form of InSb could be recovered at liquid-nitrogen temperatures. Therefore, an opposed-anvil apparatus was made from hardened tool steel. The cell had a retaining ring of isomica 0.016-in. thick with an outside diameter of 1/2 in. and an inside diameter of 3/16 in. The sample cell had a silver chloride disk 0.012-in. thick. The InSb sample itself was 0.012 in. thick by 3/32 or 3/16 in. in diameter. As the transition temperature is sluggish under quasi-hydrostatic conditions, the samples were kept above the transition pressure for 3 to 4 days. Then liquid nitrogen was added to the beaker and the pressure released. This sample was superconducting at 2.1 ction in DDT-C/ 0.2 nif- K. (M.C.0.)"
https://openalex.org/W1968987106,"The recent burst of effort in the area of high-field superconductors has led to the construction of 70,000-oersted coils and the expectation that 100,000-oersted fields will be attained in the near future. The general theory suggests that fields above 300,000 oersteds are conceivable and that current densities of millions of amperes per square centimeter may be attained. Theory and experiment suggest that the upper critical field of materials such as Nb(3)Sn and Nb(.75)Zr(.25) is determined by their tendency to form a mixed state, and that a crucial question concerning their other properties is that of the interaction of this mixed state with imperfections. Lastly, it is possible to make a synthetic high-field superconductor by mechanically subdividing an ideal superconductor."
https://openalex.org/W2045753305,Aspect ratio and electrophoretic mobility data for amphibole particles reveal that short fibers and blocky cleavage fragments have a smaller net charge than highly elongated particles. Asbestos fibers and cleavage fragments of the same dimensions exhibit the same net negative surface charge but positively charged ends and negatively charged lateral surfaces.
https://openalex.org/W2021970277,"Nickel-iron spherules, ranging from less than 0.2 to 50 microns in diameter and containing 1.7 to 9.0 percent Ni by weight, occur in glass associated with the Aouelloul crater. They occur in discrete bands of siliceous glass enriched in dissolved iron. Their discovery is significant tangible evidence that both crater and glass originated from terrestrial impact."
https://openalex.org/W1977088793,It has been suggested that cosmological models should embody an initial nucleon-antinucleon symmetry and that the present ratio of nucleons to antinucleons is the result of a statistical fluctuation. Simple arguments are presented for evolutionary models which appear to rule out this possibility in the development of the universe.
https://openalex.org/W2085942256,"Pollen analysis of a coastal marsh sediment at Guilford, Connecticut, indicates that there was a period of warmth and dryness preceding 3000 years ago. The subsequent increase of conifers at the expense of oak indicates a reversal that could account for decreasing rates of ice melt and rise of sea level. The record of herbaceous vegetation (grasses vs. sedges) suggests that the rise in the water table has been pulsating in character."
https://openalex.org/W1982427289,The mitotic index in the apical region of the stem of Xanthium seedlings doubled within the 24 hours immediately following a single inductive dark period and an increase occurred within 16 hours in one case. The significance of this finding in relation to the onset of reproductive development is discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2035724191,Several Early Pleistocene stadial tills and related soils in Kansas and Nebraska indicate a complex history of ice-sheet fluctuations. It is impossible to assign ages to individual till sheets solely on the basis of position in a stratigraphic column; all Early Pleistocene correlations must be reevaluated.

https://openalex.org/W2058269544,"Ring doves pecked one of two keys for food. Pecks at the chosen key then stopped being reinforced, and the signals that normally preceded food were either present or absent. In the presence of signals for food, the dove switched to the second key more quickly. When only one key was used, the same signals acted, as expected, to keep the bird pecking the extinguished key."
https://openalex.org/W2065211621,"Before and during the first week of the March-April 1980 eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington, infrared thermal surveys were conducted to monitor the thermal activity of the volcano. The purpose was to determine if an increase in thermal activity had taken place since an earlier airborne survey in 1966. Nine months before the eruption there was no evidence of an increase in thermal activity. The survey during the first week of the 1980 eruptions indicated that little or no change in thermal activity had taken place up to 4 April. Temperatures of ejected ash and steam were low and never exceeded 15°C directly above the vent."
