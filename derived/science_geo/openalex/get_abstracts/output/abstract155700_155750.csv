https://openalex.org/W2105280572,"Metal regulation of the mouse zinc transporter (ZnT)-1 gene was examined in cultured cells and in the developing conceptus. Zinc or cadmium treatment of cell lines rapidly (3 h) and dramatically (about 12-fold) induced ZnT1 mRNA levels. In cells incubated in medium supplemented with Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum, to remove metal ions, levels of ZnT1 mRNA were reduced, and induction of this message in response to zinc or cadmium was accentuated (up to 31-fold induction). Changes in ZnT1 gene expression in these experiments paralleled those of metallothionein I (MT-I). Inhibition of RNA synthesis blocked metal induction of ZnT1 and MT-I mRNAs, whereas inhibition of protein synthesis did not. Metal response element-binding transcription factor (MTF)-1 mediates metal regulation of the metallothionein I gene. In vitroDNA-binding assays demonstrated that mouse MTF-1 can bind avidly to the two metal-response element sequences found in the ZnT1 promoter. Using mouse embryo fibroblasts with homozygous deletions of the MTF-1 gene, it was shown that this transcription factor is essential for basal as well as metal (zinc and cadmium) regulation of the ZnT1 gene in these cells. In vivo, ZnT1 mRNA was abundant in the midgestation visceral yolk sac and placenta. Dietary zinc deficiency during pregnancy down-regulated ZnT1 and MT-I mRNA levels (4–5-fold and >20-fold, respectively) in the visceral yolk sac, but had little effect on these mRNAs in the placenta. Homozygous knockout of the MTF-1 gene in transgenic mice also led to a 4–6-fold reduction in ZnT1 mRNA levels and a loss of MT-I mRNA in the visceral yolk sac. These results suggest that MTF-1 mediates the response to metal ions of both the ZnT1 and the MT-I genes the visceral yolk sac. Overall, these studies suggest that MTF-1 directly coordinates the regulation of genes involved in zinc homeostasis and protection against metal toxicity.

Zinc absorption occurs in the intestinal mucosa (1Oestreicher P. Cousins R.J. J.

Four mammalian genes involved in zinc transport have been identified (4McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Zinc transporters (ZnT)1 1–4 are proteins with six membrane-spanning domains; these four proteins function in the efflux or vesicular storage of zinc (5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and is most similar in structure to ZnT3, which is responsible for the accumulation of zinc in synaptic vesicles in the brain (7Wenzel H.J.

ZnT4 was identified during a search for the Lethal Milk locus in the mouse (9Huang L.P. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This zinc effluxer is highly expressed in the mammary gland, but may be involved in more general zinc homeostasis in the adult (9Huang L.P. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). ZnT1 functions to efflux zinc from cells, is localized to the plasma membrane, and is expressed ubiquitously (5Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). ZnT1 is an essential gene, and homozygous knockout of the ZnT1 gene is lethal to the embryo. 2R. D. Palmiter, personal communication.2R. D. Palmiter, personal communication. Zinc induction of ZnT1 mRNA had been documented in cultured neurons (11Tsuda M. Imaizumi K. Katayama T. Kitagawa K. Wanaka A. Tohyama M. Takagi T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6678-6684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the rat intestine after oral gavage with zinc (12McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, ZnT1 expression in enterocytes can be regulated by dietary zinc (12McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4841-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These preliminary studies suggested that zinc may regulate ZnT1 gene expression.In higher eukaryotes, the best understood metal-regulated genes are the metallothioneins (MT) (for review, see Ref. 14Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Transcription of the mouse MT-I gene, for example, is regulated by zinc and cadmium, and this regulation is mediated by metal response element-binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) (15Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is a six zinc-finger (Cys2His2) transcription factor, which functions as a sensor of intracellular zinc (for review, see Ref. 14Andrews G.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is activated by zinc to bind to metal response elements (MREs) in the MT-I promoter, resulting in an increased rate of transcription of this gene (15Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 16Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L.C. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cadmium activation of MT-I gene expression also requires MTF-1. In the present study, the hypothesis that zinc and cadmium regulate ZnT1 gene expression was tested and the potential role of MTF-1 in this response was examined. The ZnT1 gene was found to be responsive to zinc excess and deficiency, as well as to cadmium. These metals rapidly induced the coordinated synthesis of ZnT1 and MT-I mRNAs in cultured cells. In vitro DNA-binding assays demonstrated that recombinant mouse MTF-1 can bind to the MRE sequences present in the mouse ZnT1 promoter and studies of MTF-1 knockout mice and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells revealed an essential role for MTF-1 in metal responsiveness of these genes.DISCUSSIONThese studies demonstrate that expression of the mouse ZnT1 gene is regulated, in part, by the heavy metals zinc and cadmium, and suggest that MTF-1 is the transcription factor that mediates this response. Thus, MTF-1 coordinates the expression of genes that play roles in zinc homeostasis, as well as in protection from metal toxicity. Exposure of cells to excess zinc results in the increased expression of MT genes, which encode the major intracellular zinc storage proteins (40Kagi J.H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and the expression of ZnT1, which effluxes the metal from the cell (10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, under conditions of zinc deprivation, MTs are degraded to provide a biologically active labile pool of zinc (19Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Andrews G.K. Geiser J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the efflux of zinc via ZnT1 is attenuated (4McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) leading to conservation of this metal in the cell. However, unlike MT-I and -II (41Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), MTF-1 (18Günes Ç. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Müller K.H. Lichtlen P. Blüthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and ZnT12 are essential for embryonic development of the mouse. This suggests that metal efflux plays a more important role during development of the embryo than does metal storage. Remarkably, cadmium also coordinately regulates the expression of MT-I and ZnT1 genes, suggesting that ZnT1 may also play a role in protecting from cadmium toxicity, as does MT (41Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 42Liu Y. Liu J. Iszard M.B. Andrews G.K. Palmiter R.D. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. App. Pharmacol. 1995; 135: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept are the findings that overexpression of ZnT1 protects cells from zinc toxicity (10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and that zinc-resistant Hepa cells overexpress MT as well as ZnT1. 4R. Ravindra, unpublished results. Whether these cells also display increased efflux of cadmium and increased resistance to cadmium toxicity remains to be determined. A recent study of the ZnTA gene in Escherichia coli, which is a cadmium/zinc-exporting P1-type ATPase, is also regulated by zinc and cadmium (43Noll M. Lutsenko S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 2000; 49: 297-302Google Scholar).Whether MTF-1 directly or indirectly regulates ZnT1 gene expression remains to be determined, and the data presented herein cannot formally exclude either possibility. However, several lines of evidence are consistent with the concept that MTF-1 directly regulates ZnT1 gene expression in response to metals. First, both zinc and cadmium induce the rapid and coordinated synthesis of ZnT1 and MT-I mRNAs in cultured cells that contain MTF-1, but not in those lacking MTF-1. Second, both ZnT1 and MT-I mRNAs are specifically elevated in the visceral endoderm during early development of the embryo, both genes respond to dietary zinc deficiency, and both are reduced in mice lacking MTF-1. Third, MTF-1 can bind with avidity to two MREs found in the ZnT1 promoter, as it can with MRE sequences from the mouse MT-I promoter. Despite these findings, previous transfection studies using the ZnT1 promoter did not demonstrate metal regulation (10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy warrants further investigation. Clearly, there are similarities and also distinct differences in the mechanisms of regulation of the ZnT1 and MT-I genes. Unlike the mouse MT-I promoter, which contains five functional MREs in the proximal 200-bp promoter, the ZnT1 proximal promoter contains only two MRE sequences. MTF-1 plays an important, but nonessential, role in regulating the ZnT1 gene in visceral endoderm cells in vivo. Thus, the basal level of expression of the ZnT1 gene is clearly dependent on transcription factors other than MTF-1. One potential binding site for the zinc-finger transcription factor Sp1 is present upstream of the MREs in the proximal MT-I promoter, whereas at least four such sites are found in the ZnT1 promoter. Further studies of the structure and function of the ZnT1 promoter are required.The finding that the visceral yolk sac actively expresses both the ZnT1 gene and the MT-I/II genes suggests that this organ plays an important role in zinc homeostasis, and protection from excess zinc during pregnancy. Preliminary immunolocalization studies using rat ZnT1 antisera (provided by R. J. Cousins, University of Florida, Gainsville, FL) detected immunoreactivity specifically in the visceral endoderm layer of the yolk sac.4 These cells are also the site of synthesis of MT (36Andrews G.K. McMaster M.T. De S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III: Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 351-362Google Scholar). Visceral endoderm cells are the second cell type to differentiate from the primitive endoderm of the inner cell mass and they form the secretory layer of the visceral yolk sac, which surrounds the embryo until late in pregnancy (d19). These cells are responsible for the synthesis of serum proteins, and the visceral yolk sac is the first site of hematopoiesis. The visceral endoderm plays a nutritive and supportive role for embryonic development of the mouse. Previous studies demonstrated that the mouse MT genes become responsive to metal ions first at the morula/blastocyst stage of development. Given the role of MTF-1 in metal regulation of MT as well as ZnT1 genes, these studies suggest that ZnT1 gene expression may also be activated and responsive to metals first at this stage of preimplantation development. Further studies are required to address this possibility.In summary, these studies demonstrate that the mouse ZnT1 gene can be regulated by zinc as well as cadmium, and that this regulation is dependent on the transcription factor MTF-1. It was further demonstrated that expression of the ZnT1 gene is highly active in the visceral yolk sac of the developing embryo, and this expression is partially dependent on MTF-1 and dietary zinc. MTF-1 was known to regulate expression of the MT-I/II genes in mice, but the MT genes are nonessential. In contrast, the MTF-1 gene is essential for development, which suggested that this transcription factor also regulates the expression of an essential gene(s). One such gene is the ZnT1 gene. Zinc metabolism is controlled by uptake and efflux, as well as by storage in peripheral tissues, but the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of this metal are poorly defined. Zinc absorption occurs in the intestinal mucosa (1Oestreicher P. Cousins R.J. J.

Int. 2000; 49: 297-302Google Scholar).Whether MTF-1 directly or indirectly regulates ZnT1 gene expression remains to be determined, and the data presented herein cannot formally exclude either possibility. However, several lines of evidence are consistent with the concept that MTF-1 directly regulates ZnT1 gene expression in response to metals. First, both zinc and cadmium induce the rapid and coordinated synthesis of ZnT1 and MT-I mRNAs in cultured cells that contain MTF-1, but not in those lacking MTF-1. Second, both ZnT1 and MT-I mRNAs are specifically elevated in the visceral endoderm during early development of the embryo, both genes respond to dietary zinc deficiency, and both are reduced in mice lacking MTF-1. Third, MTF-1 can bind with avidity to two MREs found in the ZnT1 promoter, as it can with MRE sequences from the mouse MT-I promoter. Despite these findings, previous transfection studies using the ZnT1 promoter did not demonstrate metal regulation (10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy warrants further investigation. Clearly, there are similarities and also distinct differences in the mechanisms of regulation of the ZnT1 and MT-I genes. Unlike the mouse MT-I promoter, which contains five functional MREs in the proximal 200-bp promoter, the ZnT1 proximal promoter contains only two MRE sequences. MTF-1 plays an important, but nonessential, role in regulating the ZnT1 gene in visceral endoderm cells in vivo. Thus, the basal level of expression of the ZnT1 gene is clearly dependent on transcription factors other than MTF-1. One potential binding site for the zinc-finger transcription factor Sp1 is present upstream of the MREs in the proximal MT-I promoter, whereas at least four such sites are found in the ZnT1 promoter. Further studies of the structure and function of the ZnT1 promoter are required.The finding that the visceral yolk sac actively expresses both the ZnT1 gene and the MT-I/II genes suggests that this organ plays an important role in zinc homeostasis, and protection from excess zinc during pregnancy. Preliminary immunolocalization studies using rat ZnT1 antisera (provided by R. J. Cousins, University of Florida, Gainsville, FL) detected immunoreactivity specifically in the visceral endoderm layer of the yolk sac.4 These cells are also the site of synthesis of MT (36Andrews G.K. McMaster M.T. De S.K. Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Suzuki K.T. Imura N. Kimura M. Metallothionein III: Biological Roles and Medical Implications. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993: 351-362Google Scholar). Visceral endoderm cells are the second cell type to differentiate from the primitive endoderm of the inner cell mass and they form the secretory layer of the visceral yolk sac, which surrounds the embryo until late in pregnancy (d19). These cells are responsible for the synthesis of serum proteins, and the visceral yolk sac is the first site of hematopoiesis. The visceral endoderm plays a nutritive and supportive role for embryonic development of the mouse. Previous studies demonstrated that the mouse MT genes become responsive to metal ions first at the morula/blastocyst stage of development. Given the role of MTF-1 in metal regulation of MT as well as ZnT1 genes, these studies suggest that ZnT1 gene expression may also be activated and responsive to metals first at this stage of preimplantation development. Further studies are required to address this possibility.In summary, these studies demonstrate that the mouse ZnT1 gene can be regulated by zinc as well as cadmium, and that this regulation is dependent on the transcription factor MTF-1. It was further demonstrated that expression of the ZnT1 gene is highly active in the visceral yolk sac of the developing embryo, and this expression is partially dependent on MTF-1 and dietary zinc. MTF-1 was known to regulate expression of the MT-I/II genes in mice, but the MT genes are nonessential. In contrast, the MTF-1 gene is essential for development, which suggested that this transcription factor also regulates the expression of an essential gene(s). One such gene is the ZnT1 gene. These studies demonstrate that expression of the mouse ZnT1 gene is regulated, in part, by the heavy metals zinc and cadmium, and suggest that MTF-1 is the transcription factor that mediates this response. Thus, MTF-1 coordinates the expression of genes that play roles in zinc homeostasis, as well as in protection from metal toxicity. Exposure of cells to excess zinc results in the increased expression of MT genes, which encode the major intracellular zinc storage proteins (40Kagi J.H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and the expression of ZnT1, which effluxes the metal from the cell (10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, under conditions of zinc deprivation, MTs are degraded to provide a biologically active labile pool of zinc (19Dalton T.P. Fu K. Palmiter R.D. Andrews G.K. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Andrews G.K. Geiser J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the efflux of zinc via ZnT1 is attenuated (4McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) leading to conservation of this metal in the cell. However, unlike MT-I and -II (41Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), MTF-1 (18Günes Ç. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Müller K.H. Lichtlen P. Blüthmann H. Marino S. Aguzzi A. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2846-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and ZnT12 are essential for embryonic development of the mouse. This suggests that metal efflux plays a more important role during development of the embryo than does metal storage. Remarkably, cadmium also coordinately regulates the expression of MT-I and ZnT1 genes, suggesting that ZnT1 may also play a role in protecting from cadmium toxicity, as does MT (41Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 42Liu Y. Liu J. Iszard M.B. Andrews G.K. Palmiter R.D. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. App. Pharmacol. 1995; 135: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept are the findings that overexpression of ZnT1 protects cells from zinc toxicity (10Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and that zinc-resistant Hepa cells overexpress MT as well as ZnT1. 4R. Ravindra, unpublished results. Whether these cells also display increased efflux of cadmium and increased resistance to cadmium toxicity remains to be determined. A recent study of the ZnTA gene in Escherichia coli, which is a cadmium/zinc-exporting P1-type ATPase, is also regulated by zinc and cadmium (43Noll M. Lutsenko S. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

Immulectin-2 has specificity for xylose, glucose, lipopolysaccharide, and mannan. A cDNA clone encoding immulectin-2 was isolated from an Escherichia coli-inducedM. sexta larval fat body cDNA library. The cDNA is 1253 base pairs long, with an open reading frame of 981 base pairs, encoding a 327-residue polypeptide. Immulectin-2 is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. It consists of two carbohydrate recognition domains, which is similar to the organization of M. sextaimmulectin-1. Immulectin-2 was present at a constitutively low level in plasma of control larvae and increased 3–4-fold after injection of Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharide. Immulectin-2 mRNA was detected in fat body of control larvae, and its level increased dramatically after injection of E. coli. The concentration of immulectin-2 in plasma did not change significantly after injection of Gram-positive bacteria or yeast, even though its mRNA level was increased by these treatments. Compared with immulectin-1, immulectin-2 has a more restricted specificity for binding to Gram-negative bacteria. Immulectin-2 at low physiological concentrations agglutinatedE. coli in a calcium-dependent manner. It also bound to immobilized lipopolysaccharide from E. coli. Binding of immulectin-2 to lipopolysaccharide stimulated phenol oxidase activation in plasma.

Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Proteins that specifically bind to microbial components play an important role in nonself-recognition and clearance of invading microbes. Such proteins are known as pattern recognition receptors, because they bind to certain molecular patterns present in the array of carbohydrate components on the surface of microorganisms (4Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These microbial patterns include lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 and peptidoglycan from bacterial cell walls, and β-1,3-glucan from fungal cell walls. Because of their ability to bind to terminal sugars on glycoproteins and glycolipids, lectins are primary candidates for pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity. Animal C-type lectins (calcium-dependent lectins) have been reported to be important in pathogen recognition and cellular interactions (5Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Collectins, a subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily, play a key role in the first line of defense against infection (6Epstein J. Eichbaum Q. Sheriff S. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Collectins contain a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) connected to a collagen-like domain (8Thiel S. Reid K.B.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied collectin is the serum mannose-binding protein (MBP). MBP can activate the complement system through a recently discovered pathway, the lectin pathway (9Matsushita M. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 40: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Activation of the complement system by MBP is associated with C1r/C1s-like proteases (10Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 11Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Stover C.M. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U. Reid K.B.M. Jensenius J.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). MBP also functions directly as an opsonin to increase the efficiency of phagocytosis of bacteria (12Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,13Kuhlman M. Joiner K. Ezekowitz A.B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1733-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, C-type lectins have been isolated from a few insect species. These C-type lectins function in insect innate immune system by participating in hemocyte nodule formation (14Koizumi N. Morozumi A. Imamura M. Tanaka E. Iwahana H. Sato R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 15: 217-224Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Koizumi N. Imamura M. Kadotani T. Yaoi K. Iwahana H. Sato R FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), activating prophenol oxidase in hemolymph (16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol.

Among these insect lectins is a group of C-type lectins that contain two tandem CRDs. Lectins of this new type include immulectin-1 from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 584-597Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and LPS-binding lectins from the silkworm, Bombyx mori (15Koizumi N. Imamura M. Kadotani T. Yaoi K. Iwahana H. Sato R FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the fall webworm,Hyphantria cunea (18Shin S.W. Park S.-S. Park D.-S. Kim M.G. Kim S.C. Brey P.T.

We report here an LPS-specific C-type lectin, immulectin-2 from M. sexta, which contains two CRDs and binds to Gram-negative bacteria and to LPS and stimulates phenol oxidase activation in hemolymph. The synthesis of M. sexta immulectin-2 (IML-2) is induced in fat body after injection of Gram-negative bacteria or LPS. M. sexta eggs were initially obtained from Carolina Biological Supply, and larvae were reared using artificial diet as described by Dunn and Drake (20Dunn P.E. Drake D. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1983; 41: 77-85Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Larvae in the second or third day of the fifth instar were injected with Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Sigma) (150 μg/larva), LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma) (20 μg/larva), formalin-killed E. coli strain XL1-blue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, Serratia marcescens strain (obtained from James Urban, Division of Biology, Kansas State University) (all bacteria at 108 cells/larva), orSaccharomyces cerevisiae (107 cells/larva) suspended in 50 μl of water or with 50 μl of saline (0.85% NaCl) as a control. Hemolymph was collected using a 27-gauge needle at several time intervals post-injection. Hemocytes were removed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and plasma samples were stored at −20 °C. Plasma (200 ml) collected 24 h post-injection of E. coli was dialyzed against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 for 24 h at 4 °C. After removal of a precipitate by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, dialyzed plasma was loaded onto an equilibrated mannan-agarose column (Sigma) (1.6 × 5.0 cm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with the starting Tris buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 untilA 280 of the eluant was less then 0.01. The bound protein was then eluted with 5 mm EDTA in the starting Tris buffer lacking CaCl2. Protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified IML-2 (600 μg) was used as antigen for the production of polyclonal rabbit antiserum (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.). Purified IML-2 (2.0 μg) was denatured in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The denatured protein was then incubated with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F or 1 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for 24 h at 37 °C. Treated and untreated protein samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The mass of IML-2 purified from plasma was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry at Keck facility, Yale University. IML-2 was also subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm; Bio-Rad). The protein bands were visualized by staining with Amido Black. IML-2 bands were cut out, and amino-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 473A Protein Sequencing System at the Biotechnology Core Facility of Kansas State University. 25 μg of purified IML-2 was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC (Bio-Sil SEC 250, 300 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl at 1.0 ml/min. Protein peaks detected by A 280 were collected and dried (SpeedVac, Savant). Samples of proteins from the peaks were analyzed by immunoblotting, using rabbit anti-IML-2 antiserum. A molecular mass standard curve was generated by plotting log of the mass of a set of standards (thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; IgG, 158 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa; myoglobin, 17 kDa; and vitamin B12, 1.35 kDa; Bio-Rad) against retention time. An M. sexta larval fat body cDNA library (24 h after injection of E. coli) in λ ZAPII (Stratagene) was screened using antiserum to IML-2 by the method of Ausubel et al. (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified to homogeneity and subcloned by in vivo excision of pBluescript phagemids. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones were determined from double-stranded plasmid DNA templates by the dideoxynucleotide method using an automated DNA Sequencer (Iowa State University DNA sequencing facility). The cDNAs were sequenced using subcloned restriction fragments and oligonucleotide primers derived from previously determined sequences. Because the longest cDNA clone (pM13) was incomplete at the 5′ end, rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to obtain the 5′ end sequence of IML-2. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions were performed as described by Frohman (22Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.G. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 28-38Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA fromE. coli-induced larval fat body was reverse transcribed to cDNAs by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) as primer. The cDNAs were then tailed with dCTP using terminal transferase. For nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), the reaction was set up as follows: 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer A (Fisher), 3 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 3 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 25 pmol of each primer, 1 μl of cDNA pools or first round PCR product, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher), and water to bring the total volume to 50 μl. For the first round PCR, the tailed cDNA pools were used as template, and a sequence-specific primer PMR5 (5′-GAT GGA TCC CAT TTG TGA GGT-3′) and Anchor primer (5′-CUA CUA CUA CUA GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACG GGI IGG GII GGG IIG-3′) (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used. For the second round PCR, the first round PCR product was used as template, and a sequence-specific primer PMR7 (5′-AAC GGA TCC CTC AAG ATG GCA-3′) and universal amplification primer (5′-CUA CUA CUA CUA GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′) (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as primers. PCR reactions were performed as follows: denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 40 s at 50 °C (first round) or 58 °C (second round), and extension for 40 s at 72 °C for a total of 40 cycles. A PCR product of 280 bp was obtained from nested PCR reactions and purified by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified PCR product was cloned into plasmid vector pGEMR-T (Promega). Plasmid DNA containing the insert was prepared, and the insert was sequenced as described above. Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, version 7.3.1 (23Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the GCG Package , Version 7. Madison, WI1991Google Scholar), and IBI Pustell programs. Plasma samples collected from the fifth instar larvae injected with bacteria, yeast, or saline as described above, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE by the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and IML-2 was identified by immunoblotting. 4-μl cell-free plasma from each larva at different time intervals of post-injection was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry skim milk and then incubated with rabbit antiserum to IML-2 (1:2000 dilution). Antibody binding was visualized by a color reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). The IML-2 band intensities were measured using Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional gel analysis software, and the amount of IML-2 in plasma was estimated using known concentrations of purified IML-2 as standards. For each group, plasma from four individual larvae was analyzed. Total RNA from fat body or hemocytes collected 24 h after injection of saline (0.85% NaCl), M. lysodeikticus, S. cerevisiae, or E. coli(strain XL1 blue) was prepared by the method described previously (16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 584-597Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg) were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed.

Trypsinized and glutaraldehyde treated erythrocytes from human bloods group B or O were purchased from Sigma. All other erythrocytes were glutaraldehyde treated and were also from Sigma. These erythrocytes were trypsinized as described by Haqet al. (27Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (25 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl and 3 mmKCl, pH 7.0) as a 10% suspension. For hemagglutination assay, erythrocytes were prepared as a 2% suspension in TBS. IML-2 was serially diluted 2-fold with 25 μl of TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 in wells of a microtiter V-shape plate. Then 25 μl of 2% erythrocytes were added and mixed well. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Agglutinated erythrocytes formed a diffuse mat, whereas unagglutinated erythrocytes formed a clear red dot at the bottom of the well. To test carbohydrate specificity for IML-2, the hemagglutination assay was conducted by mixing IML-2 (1.0 μg/ml in TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2) with serial dilutions of various carbohydrates at room temperature for 30 min. Horse erythrocytes (2%) were then added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before scoring for agglutination. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and S. cerevisiae (Molecular Probes) were suspended in TBS and used for the agglutination assay. IML-2 purified from plasma of E. coli-injected larvae was used in the assay performed as described previously (16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 584-597Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To test whether the agglutination of E. coli requires calcium, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled E. coli was incubated with IML-2 (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) in TBS containing 1 mmEDTA, and the assay was performed as described by Yu et al.(16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 584-597Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Wells of a flat bottom 96-well assay plate (Costar, Fisher) were coated with LPS from E. coli 0111:B4 (Sigma) by a method modified from Tobias et al. (28Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Koizumi et al. (14Koizumi N. Morozumi A. Imamura M. Tanaka E. Iwahana H. Sato R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 15: 217-224Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS was suspended at 40 μg/ml in water and sonicated for 3 × 15 s, and 50 μl (2 μg) of LPS suspension was added to each well. The plate was then incubated at room temperature until the water evaporated completely. The plates were heated at 60 °C for 30 min and then blocked with 200 μl/well of 1 mg/ml BSA in Tris buffer (TB) (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were then rinsed four times with 200 μl/well of TB. IML-2 diluted with TB containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml BSA was added at 50 μl/well, and binding was allowed to occur for 3 h at room temperature. The plates were then rinsed four times with 200 μl/well of TB, and rabbit anti-IML-2 antiserum (diluted 1000-fold with TB containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA) was added at 100 μl/well. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the wells were rinsed four times with 200 μl/well of TB. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 3000-fold with TB containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA was added at 100 μl/well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed again as described above, and 50 μl/well of 1 mg/ml p-nitro-phenyl phosphate (prepared in 10 mm diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2) was added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Absorbance at 405 nm of each well was determined using a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek Instrument, Inc.). LPS from E. coli 0111:B4 (Sigma), mannan (Sigma), or IML-2 purified from plasma of E. coli-injected larvae, all in TBS, were added separately or in combination to 40 μl of cell free hemolymph collected from naive fifth instar day 2 larvae. Total volume was adjusted to 50 μl with TBS, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature. At various times after mixing, 5-μl aliquots were removed and added to 0.7 ml of 2 mm dopamine in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, for measurement of phenol oxidase activity (16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 584-597Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Absorbance at 470 nm was measured over 6 min. When plasma collected from M. sexta larvae 24 h after injection ofE. coli was passed through a mannan-agarose column, a protein that bound to mannan could be eluted with EDTA. This protein, designated IML-2, was more than 90% pure after this one-step affinity purification. Approximately 1.5 mg of purified IML-2 was recovered from 100 ml of plasma. IML-2 also bound to immobilized glucose (data not shown). Purified IML-2 appeared as two closely spaced bands at approximately 37 kDa (IML-2a) and 38.5 kDa (IML-2b) in analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane 2). The masses of IML-2a and IML-2b determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were 35,381 and 36,240 Da, respectively, indicating that SDS-PAGE analysis slightly overestimates the mass of the IML-2 isoforms. The amino-terminal sequences of the proteins recovered from these two bands were determined by Edman degradation. 24 residues were determined from IML-2a, whereas 10 residues were obtained from IML-2b. Both amino-terminal sequences were identical and perfectly matched the deduced amino acid sequence from an IML-2 cDNA clone described below (Fig. 2).Figure 2Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of IML-2. The deduced amino acid sequence is shownbelow the cDNA sequence. Amino acid residues in the mature protein are assigned positive numbers, and those in the signal peptide are assigned negative numbers. A potential N-linked glycosylation site is marked with ♦. Cys residues that define C-type lectin short-form CRDs are marked with a ▴, whereas two extra cysteine residues in the long-form CRD2 are marked with ●. The amino-terminal sequence of the mature IML-2 was determined by Edman degradation. The sequence obtained from IML-2b (higher mass isoform) isdouble-underlined, and the sequence from IML-2a (lower mass isoform) begins at the same position but extends further (underlined). In the cDNA sequence, the polyadenylation sequence AATAAA is double-underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When purified IML-2 was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC, a major peak eluted at 10.87 min, which was just after the ovalbumin standard (10.24 min) (Fig. 3). A small peak eluting at 9.78 min and a peak eluting at the void volume of the column (6.50 min) were also observed. Fractions from all three peaks were identified as IML-2 by immunoblotting (data not shown). Using a standard curve generated by plotting log molecular mass of a set of standard proteinsversus retention times, the calculated masses of the three IML-2 peaks are: 39.5 kDa (10.87 min), 90 kDa (9.78 min), and >670 kDa (6.50 min). These results suggest that IML-2 is present mainly in monomeric form in solution, with lower amounts of dimers and oligomers. Fractions in a broad trough between the dimer and oligomer peaks also contained IML-2, indicating that IML-2 oligomers with different numbers of subunits may exist in solution. Purified IML-2 from plasma was used as an antigen for producing a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. We used this antiserum as a probe to screen an E. coli-induced M. sexta larval fat body cDNA library. From 1.2 × 105 λ phage screened, we obtained two positive clones, pM13 and pM18, which encoded IML-2. These two clones were identical in sequence. Clone pM13 had an insert of 1183 bp, which contained the complete 3′ end with a poly(A) tail, but it was not complete at the 5′ end. To obtain the full-length sequence, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed, and a fragment extending 70 bp farther at the 5′ end was cloned. The full-length sequence of IML-2 cDNA was 1253 bp long, with an open reading frame of 981 bp, encoding a 327-residue polypeptide (Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence of IML-2 contains a 19-residue secretion signal peptide, confirmed by Edman degradation of the mature protein (Fig. 2). The calculated mass of the mature protein is 35,203 Da, which is less than the masses of IML-2a and IML-2b determined by mass spectrometry (35,381 and 36,240 Da). A potentialN-linked glycosylation site is present in the IML-2 sequence at Asn-253. Treatment of IML-2 with N-glycosidase F, which cleaves at N-linked glycosylation sites, resulted in two slightly more separated protein bands, with apparent molecular masses of 36 and 34 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 3). This result suggests that both IML-2 isoforms are N-glycosylated. Treatment of IML-2 with O-glycosidase did not change the mobility of the two protein bands (data not shown), indicating that IML-2 has no O-linked glycosylation. Analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA indicated that IML-2 is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. It contains two C-type CRDs, an amino-terminal domain, CRD1 (residues 1–136), and a carboxyl-terminal domain, CRD2 (residues 137–288). This feature of IML-2 is similar to another M. sexta lectin, immulectin (now designated IML-1) (16Yu X.-Q. Gan H. Kanost M.R. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 584-597Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and to lectins from other two insect species: LPS-binding proteins from the silkworm, B. mori (15Koizumi N. Imamura M. Kadotani T. Yaoi K. Iwahana H. Sato R FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the fall webworm, H. cunea (18Shin S.W. Park S.-S. Park D.-S. Kim M.G. Kim S.C. Brey P.T. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows an alignment of these four insect C-type lectins with tandem CRD structure. IML-2 shows 55% identity toB. mori LPS-binding protein (BmLBP) and 47% to Hdd15 but only 27% to M. sexta IML-1. In comparison with vertebrate C-type lectins, CRD1 of IML-2 was most similar (26% identity) to rat macrophage asialoglycoprotein-binding protein (GenBankTM accession number P49301), whereas CRD2 was most similar (25% identity) to rat CD23 (GenBankTMaccession number S34198), an IgE receptor. IML-2 was present constitutively at a low level in plasma of naive larvae, with an average of 18.5 ± 8.5 μg/ml (measured from 36 larvae, with a range of 3.8 μg/ml to 36.5 μg/ml). After injection of E. coli, the concentration of both IML-2a and IML-2b in plasma consistently dropped within 2 h post-injection but then increased to the original level at 6 h and continued to increase up to 48 h post-injection (Fig.5). The level of IML-2a in hemolymph of naive larvae was significantly lower than that of IML-2b. The concentration of both IML-2a and IML-2b increased after injection ofE. coli, but the ratio of their concentrations changed, with a greater relative increase in IML-2a (Fig. 5 B). Northern analysis also showed that IML-2 mRNA was present at a low level in fat body of control larvae (injected with saline) and was induced to much higher level after injection of E. coli (Fig.6). IML-2 mRNA level was also increased after injection of Gram-positive bacteria (M. lysodeikticus) or yeast (S. cerevisiae). IML-2 mRNA was not detected in hemocytes of either control larvae or larvae injected with yeast or bacteria (Fig. 6). Injection of saline, M. lysodeikticus (Gram-positive), or S. cerevisiae (yeast) did not significantly change the concentration of IML-2 in plasma 24 h post-injection (Fig. 7). However, after injection of three different Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) or LPS from E. coli, IML-2 concentration increased 3–4-fold in plasma 24 h post-injection.Figure 6Northern hybridization of IML-2 mRNA. Samples of total RNA (20 μg) from hemocytes or fat body of larvae injected with saline (C), yeast (S. cerevisiae) (Y), M. lysodeikticus(M), or E. coli (E) were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 2.2 mformaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane and probed with 32P-labeled IML-2 cDNA (A) or ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) cDNA (B).

https://openalex.org/W1987452659,"The novel transmembrane aspartic protease BACE (for Beta-site APP CleavingEnzyme) is the β-secretase that cleaves amyloid precursor protein to initiate β-amyloid formation. As such, BACE is a prime therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. BACE, like other aspartic proteases, has a propeptide domain that is removed to form the mature enzyme. BACE propeptide cleavage occurs at the sequence RLPR↓E, a potential furin recognition motif. Here, we explore the role of furin in BACE propeptide domain processing. BACE propeptide cleavage in cells does not appear to be autocatalytic, since an inactive D93A mutant of BACE is still cleaved appropriately. BACE and furin co-localize within the Golgi apparatus, and propeptide cleavage is inhibited by brefeldin A and monensin, drugs that disrupt trafficking through the Golgi. Treatment of cells with the calcium ionophore A23187, leading to inhibition of calcium-dependent proteases including furin, or transfection with the α1-antitrypsin variant α1-PDX, a potent furin inhibitor, dramatically reduces cleavage of the BACE propeptide. Moreover, the BACE propeptide is not processed in the furin-deficient LoVo cell line; however, processing is restored upon furin transfection. Finally, in vitrodigestion of recombinant soluble BACE with recombinant furin results in complete cleavage only at the established E46 site. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that furin, or a furin-like proprotein convertase, is responsible for cleaving the BACE propeptide domain to form the mature enzyme.

Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Amyloid plaques are composed of Aβ, a 40–42-amino acid peptide that varies in length at the C terminus (2Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 120: 885-890Google Scholar). Many studies have suggested that Aβ, especially the more fibrillogenic Aβ42, is central to the pathogenesis of AD (3Younkin S.G. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1998; 92: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Aβ is formed by the endoproteolysis of APP, a large type I transmembrane protein (4Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Two proteolytic cleavages of APP are required to make Aβ. First, a protease termed β-secretase cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Aβ domain to generate the soluble ectodomain APPsβ and the membrane-bound fragment C99 (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). A second protease, γ-secretase, then cuts C99 within the transmembrane region to form Aβ, which is secreted from the cell. Inhibition of the β- and γ-secretases would limit the production of Aβ, widely considered to be a beneficial therapeutic goal for the treatment of AD. The identities of the secretases have been elusive. Presenilins are required for γ-secretase activity (6De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Figura K.V.

Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). However, it has not been directly shown that purified presenilins have γ-secretase activity. Recently, we (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S.

Like other aspartic proteases, BACE is synthesized as a precursor protein containing an N-terminal propeptide domain that is removed during maturation of the enzyme (see Fig. 1 A). Typically, removal of the propeptide domain is necessary for the activation of an aspartic protease (reviewed in Ref. 13Tang J. Wong R.N.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mature BACE starts at residue Glu-46 as the result of propeptide domain processing (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S.

Glu-46 is immediately preceded by the sequence RLPR, which appears to be a proprotein convertase (PC) recognition motif of the general sequence (R/K)X n n(R/K), where n = 0, 2, 4, or 6. The PCs are a family of calcium-dependent serine proteases consisting of seven members as follows: furin, PC1/PC3, PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5/PC6, and PC7 (reviewed in Ref. 15Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of BACE propeptide cleavage and identifying the putative BACE propeptide cleaving enzyme may have important therapeutic implications. Furin is a major PC in the constitutive secretory pathway and is involved in the processing of a wide variety of precursor proteins including serum proteins, growth factors, receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, bacterial toxins, and viral coat proteins (reviewed in Ref. 16Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Like BACE, furin is ubiquitously expressed and has an intracellular localization within the Golgi, TGN, and endosomes. The sequence RLPR↓E at the propeptide cleavage site of BACE is a potential furin recognition motif; therefore; we have investigated whether furin may be the protease that cleaves the BACE propeptide domain. Here, we present evidence that furin, or a furin-like PC, mediates BACE propeptide cleavage. 293T cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM, high glucose media (Life Technologies, Inc.). LoVo cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM/F-12 1:1 media (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293T cells were co-transfected with either pCMVi-Sol.BACE-HA or pCMVi-BACE-HA and pRSV-Puro by the calcium phosphate method (17Gorman C.M.

After selection in 5 μg/ml puromycin, clones for each cell line were selected and named Sol.BACE-HA/293 and BACE-HA/293, respectively. Transient transfections of 293T cells were performed using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for LoVo cells. All cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pCMVi (Cellular & Molecular Technologies Inc.). The BACE-HA construct has been previously described (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S.

A soluble form of BACE was made by truncating full-length BACE at Tyr-460 and fusing the 11-residue HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYASG) in frame at the C terminus of the molecule to create Sol.BACE-HA. α1-Antitrypsin was cloned by PCR from human liver cDNA using the primers CCATCGATGGACAGTGAATCGACAATG and GAAGATCTGGTTGAGGAGCGAGAGGCAG.

The D93A BACE-HA mutant was generated by a single nucleotide change of A to G at position 278 of the cDNA creating an aspartic acid to alanine substitution at position 93 of the peptide sequence by two-step PCR using the following primers: GTGCCGATGTAGCGGGCTCCGGA, CTGCTGCCTGTAGCCACCAGGATG, CATCCTGGTGGCTACAGGCAGCAG, and CACCCGCACAATGATCACCTCATAA. The mutated fragment was then re-cloned into BACE-HA as a BamHI-BsrGI fragment to create D93A BACE-HA. 293T cells were transiently transfected with D93A BACE-HA. Two days' post-transfection, cells were labeled with 5 mCi of [3H]phenylalanine or [3H]threonine for 2 h and then chased for 3 h. Cell extracts were prepared as described (19Haass C.

The samples were separated on a NuPAGE 7% Tris acetate gel (NOVEX), transferred to PVDF membrane, and exposed to film. The film was then used to locate the bands on the membrane, which were excised and radiosequenced as described previously (19Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A.

Immunocytochemistry of paraformaldehyde-fixed, Triton X-100-permeabilized cells was performed as described previously (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B.

Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows: anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance) 1:100, anti-furin affinity purified polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) 1:400. Alexa 488 (green) and Alexa 594 (red) secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at 1:200 dilution. Conditioned medium from the stable cell line Sol.BACE-HA/293 was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 200 mm MES, pH 6.2, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5m NaCl (Buffer C). The sample was mixed with anti-HA affinity matrix beads (Covance) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with Buffer C, and Sol.BACE-HA was released from the matrix with HA peptide (Covance) at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in Buffer C at 30 °C for 30 min. The purified sample was then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100. The digestion was performed in the same buffer in the presence or absence of 10 or 50 units of recombinant furin (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) for 24 h at room temperature. For Western blot analysis the reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× sample buffer, directly loaded onto a NuPAGE 7% Tris acetate gel (Novex), transferred to nitrocellulose for 90 min, and incubated with either anti-propeptide antiserum (1:1000 dilution) or anti-BACE antiserum (1:1000 dilution) raised against the lumenal domain of soluble BACE, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For N-terminal sequence analysis reactions were diluted with 1 ml of IP buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 2% CHAPS), and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA affinity matrix beads (Covance). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris glycine gel, transferred to Problot PVDF membrane (Applied Biosystems), and stained with Coomassie Blue, and bands were excised and sequenced as described (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21099-21106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is well established that the activation of pepsin, as well as other aspartic proteases, requires proteolytic processing of the inactive proprotein to a mature enzyme (13Tang J. Wong R.N.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This process involves the autocatalytic removal of the propeptide domain. To determine whether BACE propeptide cleavage may be autocatalytic, we generated an inactive form of BACE by mutating the aspartic acid at position 93 to alanine in the N-terminal active site motif (see Fig.1 A). To facilitate immunological detection, the HA epitope tag was fused to the C terminus of D93A BACE (D93A BACE-HA). When transfected into 293 cells that stably express APP with the Swedish familial AD mutation (APPsw (20Mullan M. Crawford F. Houlden H. Axelman K. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar)), D93A BACE-HA did not significantly increase the production of the β-secretase-cleaved APPsβ ectodomain (APPsβsw) in conditioned media as compared with cells transfected with vector alone (not shown). In contrast, cells transfected with wild-type BACE-HA generate approximately 2–5-fold more APPsβsw in conditioned media, verifying that the D93A mutant is inactive (data not shown). To determine whether this inactive mutant was processed to the mature form, we radiolabeled D93A BACE-HA transfected 293 cells with [3H]threonine or [3H]phenylalanine (Fig.1 B) and performed radiosequencing of D93A BACE-HA immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-HA antibody. Radiosequencing established that the propeptide domain of D93A BACE-HA is still cleaved appropriately at the known Glu-46 site. Thus, BACE propeptide cleavage does not appear to be autocatalytic, but instead may occur through intermolecular cleavage by the action of another protease. BACE undergoesN-linked glycosylation and is converted from immature (∼60 kDa) to mature (∼70 kDa) glycosylated forms during transit through the ER and Golgi apparatus (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21099-21106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Moreover, the BACE propeptide domain is processed following a time course that parallels the maturation of BACE glycosylation in the Golgi (Fig. 5 B (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21099-21106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)). The glycosylation of BACE obscures the reduction in molecular weight due to propeptide cleavage. Thus, in order to follow BACE propeptide processing, we used an antiserum raised against the propeptide domain (designated anti-pro (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O.

We were interested in determining the subcellular compartment in which BACE propeptide cleavage occurs, and for these studies we used a stable 293 cell line expressing BACE-HA (BACE-HA/293 (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar)). We performed pulse-labeling experiments on BACE-HA/293 cells treated with either brefeldin A (BFA; an agent that fuses Golgi with ER (21Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)), monensin (a Golgi-disturbing agent (21Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)), or A23187 (a calcium ionophore (22Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2). Cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-pro and analyzed by SDS-PAGE show that the ∼60-kDa BACE-HA unprocessed form accumulates upon BFA and monensin treatment (lanes 2 and 4, respectively, Fig. 2). In contrast, the ∼60-kDa species is undetectable in lysates from untreated cells (lanes 1 and 3, Fig. 2). The accumulation of the ∼60-kDa species is also observed upon BFA and monensin treatment in cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, which recognizes all forms of BACE-HA (lanes 8 and10, Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that treatment with BFA or monensin decreases BACE propeptide processing by inhibiting intracellular trafficking through the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Since monensin disrupts traffic within the Golgi (21Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), it is likely that BACE propeptide cleavage occurs in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast to treatment with BFA and monensin, A23187 treatment causes an accumulation of the ∼70-kDa form of BACE-HA containing the propeptide region (lane 6, Fig. 2), indicating that A23187inhibits propeptide processing without substantially affecting intracellular trafficking. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA confirms that the BACE-HA species accumulating upon A23187 treatment has a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (lane 12, Fig. 2), suggesting a mature glycosylation pattern consistent with localization in the trans-Golgi. Taken together, our inhibitor data suggest that the BACE propeptide may be cleaved by a calcium-dependent protease in the Golgi apparatus. Furin is a ubiquitous calcium-dependent protease of the constitutive secretory pathway (16Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibody staining patterns for BACE-HA and furin largely overlap within shared intracellular compartments (Fig.3), including the Golgi apparatus, TGN, and endosomes (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.-C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular localization of endogenous BACE has yet to be determined, the BACE-HA subcellular localization together with our inhibitor results are consistent with a role for furin in BACE propeptide processing. The Portland variant of α1-antitrypsin (α1-PDX) is a potent and selective inhibitor of furin (18Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate initially whether furin may mediate BACE propeptide cleavage, we transfected BACE-HA/293 cells with α1-PDX, wild-type α1-antitrypsin (α1-WT), which does not inhibit furin, or vector alone, then pulse-labeled cells, and finally immunoprecipitated cell lysates with either anti-pro or anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE of BACE-HA immunoprecipitated with anti-pro reveals that α1-PDX inhibits propeptide cleavage as compared with transfection with either α1-WT or vector alone (compare lane 1 withlanes 2 and 3, Fig. 4). Interestingly, the propeptide-containing BACE-HA species (proBACE-HA) has a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa, indicating that it has a mature glycosylation pattern consistent with localization in the trans-Golgi. As a control, immunoprecipitation with anti-HA shows that the levels of BACE-HA remain unchanged in all transfections (lanes 4–6, Fig.4). The human colon carcinoma cell line LoVo has mutations in both furin gene alleles and therefore does not express functional furin (23Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Google Scholar). We used the LoVo cell line to determine if furin was required for BACE propeptide cleavage (Fig. 5). LoVo cells transfected with BACE-HA were subjected to pulse-chase labeling, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-pro or anti-HA antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-pro shows that BACE-HA transfection alone in LoVo cells results in the accumulation of unprocessed ∼70-kDa proBACE-HA exhibiting mature glycosylation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–4). In contrast, co-transfection with furin results in complete processing of the ∼70-kDa species (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8), indicating that BACE propeptide cleavage is rescued by furin transfection in LoVo cells. As a control, immunoprecipitation of lysates from the furin-transfected cells with anti-HA shows the appearance of the processed ∼70-kDa BACE-HA species (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9–12), demonstrating that BACE-HA is not degraded upon furin transfection. For comparison, when expressed in 293 cells, proBACE-HA is predominant at 1 h and is then completely processed to the mature form by ∼3 h (Fig. 5 B). Qualitatively, the conversion of proBACE-HA from ∼60 to ∼70 kDa appears similar in both 293 cells and furin-transfected LoVo cells. However, processing of the propeptide domain appears much more rapid in furin-transfected LoVo cells, presumably due to overexpression of furin. Taken together, our results in furin-deficient LoVo cells and in α1-PDX-transfected BACE-HA/293 cells demonstrate that furin is required for BACE propeptide cleavage, at least in the cells studied. Previously, we have shown that secreted BACE derivatives are only partially processed to the mature form (14Haniu M. Denis P. Young Y. Mendiaz E.A. Fuller J. Hui J.O. Bennett B.D. Kahn S. Ross S. Burgess T. Katta V. Rogers G. Vassar R. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21099-21106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To demonstrate directly that furin cleaves the BACE propeptide domain in vitro, we generated a soluble, truncated form of BACE-HA lacking the transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail (Sol.BACE-HA). A stable 293 cell line expressing Sol.BACE-HA was made (Sol.BACE-HA/293), and Sol.BACE-HA was purified to homogeneity from conditioned media using anti-HA affinity chromatography. We then digested varying amounts of Sol.BACE-HA with recombinant furin in vitro, and we performed Western blot analysis with anti-pro and an antiserum raised against the BACE lumenal domain (anti-BACE; Fig.6). Western analysis with anti-pro shows that furin cleaves the BACE propeptide in vitro, as indicated by the dramatically reduced intensity of anti-pro-labeled Sol.BACE-HA that has been digested with furin as compared with mock digestion (lanes 4–6 versus lanes 1–3, Fig. 6). As a control, the blot was stripped and re-incubated with anti-BACE to show that equivalent amounts of Sol.BACE-HA were present in the respective reactions with or without furin (Fig. 6, lanes 7–12). Next we determined the N-terminal sequence of Sol.BACE-HA generated upon furin cleavage in vitro. Purified Sol.BACE-HA following digestion with or without furin was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto PVDF membrane. Sol.BACE-HA bands were excised, and the N-terminal sequences were determined. Mock-digested Sol.BACE-HA exhibits two N-terminal sequences, TQHGIRLPLR (0.78 pmol; 45%) and ETDEEPEEPG (0.83 pmol; 55%). These two sequences derive from BACE cleaved at the signal peptide (Thr-22) and the propeptide domain (Glu-46), respectively. The propeptide domain is removed from approximately 50–70% of Sol.BACE-HA secreted from the Sol.BACE-HA/293 stable cell line due to endogenous processing within the cell (not shown). When Sol.BACE-HA was incubated with furinin vitro, only one sequence was observed, ETDEEPEEPG (1.89 pmol; 100%), directly demonstrating that furin cleaves the propeptide domain only at the known start site of mature BACE. Eukaryotic aspartic proteases are synthesized as inactive precursor proteins containing an N-terminal signal peptide and a propeptide domain. Subsequent to signal peptide removal in the ER and glycosylation in the ER and Golgi, the propeptide domain is cleaved to form the mature enzyme. In general, activation of the aspartic protease requires the removal of the propeptide domain. For many aspartic proteases in the pepsin family, such as pepsin, cathepsin D, and cathepsin E, cleavage of the propeptide domain is autocatalytic and is induced by acidic conditions (13Tang J. Wong R.N.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 33: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 24Khan A.R. James M.N.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 25Takeda-Ezaki M. Yamamoto K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, in the case of renin, propeptide cleavage may not be autocatalytic but appears to require endoproteolysis by another protease, possibly cathepsin B, PC1, or PC5 (26Wang P.H. Do Y.S.

Hypertension. 1996; 28: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that BACE propeptide cleavage also may not be autocatalytic, since the enzymatically inactive D93A BACE mutant is still cleaved at the known Glu-46 site (Fig. 1 B). This indicates that another protease may mediate intermolecular cleavage of the BACE propeptide domain. Recently, it has been reported that enriched preparations of soluble BACE generated by bacterial expression exhibit cleavage at two sites within the BACE propeptide domain upon extended incubation under acidic conditions (12Lin X. Koelsch G. Wu S. Downs D. Dashti A. Tang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). However, neither of the cleavages corresponds to the known Glu-46 start of mature BACE observed in cultured cells or in human brain. Therefore, it is unlikely that these propeptide cleavages of BACE in vitrohave physiological relevance in vivo. We have determined that BACE propeptide cleavage is inhibited by BFA, monensin, and A23187 (Fig. 2). BFA causes fusion of the Golgi apparatus with the ER, and and monensin disrupts intra-Golgi traffic, especially in trans-Golgi and acidic post-Golgi compartments (21Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The calcium ionophore A23187 depletes intracellular stores of calcium and therefore is an indirect inhibitor of calcium-dependent proteases (22Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Thus, based on our inhibitor results, we conclude that the propeptide domain of BACE is likely to be cleaved by a calcium-dependent protease in the Golgi apparatus. The known BACE propeptide cleavage site RLPR↓E is a PC recognition motif of the general sequence (R/K)X n(R/K)↓, wheren = 0, 2, 4, or 6 (15Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and therefore suggests that a member of this family of calcium-dependent serine proteases may cleave the BACE propeptide. Since BACE is expressed ubiquitously, the putative PC that cleaves the BACE propeptide would also be expected to have a wide tissue distribution. In addition, BACE is localized within compartments of the constitutive secretory pathway including Golgi, TGN, and endosomes, and thus PCs localized within these same compartments should be considered prime candidates for BACE propeptide cleaving enzymes. The PCs furin and PC7 have ubiquitous tissue distributions, whereas PACE4 and PC5B (an alternatively spliced isoform of PC5 containing a C-terminal transmembrane domain (29Nakagawa T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) have more restricted expression patterns (15Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). All four of these PCs localize within the constitutive secretory pathway, and therefore any one of them could potentially cleave the BACE propeptide. We currently favor furin as the most likely PC to cleave the BACE propeptide for the following reasons. The known cleavage site RLPR↓E is a potential furin recognition motif, and furin and BACE-HA largely co-localize within shared intracellular compartments (Fig. 3). In addition, transfection of α1-PDX into BACE-HA/293 cells inhibits BACE propeptide cleavage (Fig. 4). α1-PDX is a potent inhibitor of furin, and also inhibits PC5B to a lesser extent, but has little effect on PACE4 and PC7 (31Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the BACE propeptide domain is blocked in furin-deficient LoVo cells, and furin transfection rescues cleavage (Fig. 5). Finally, in vitro, recombinant furin cleaves purified, soluble BACE-HA exactly and only at Glu-46 (Fig. 6), the known start of mature BACE (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A.

LoVo cells express PACE4 and PC7 but not PC5B (30Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 32Seidah N.G. Hamelin J.

A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), leaving open the possibility that PC5B may also process the BACE propeptide domain. However, PC5B is predominantly expressed in intestine, adrenal gland, and lung but does not appear to be expressed significantly in brain or other tissues (29Nakagawa T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Given the more restricted tissue distribution of PC5B relative to furin, it appears that furin may be the most likely candidate enzyme to mediate BACE propeptide cleavage. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that PC5B or another PC may participate with furin to cleave the BACE propeptide in specific tissues. Understanding BACE propeptide processing may provide insight into the regulation of BACE enzyme activity and therefore may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AD. The motivation for this study was to identify the enzyme responsible for BACE propeptide processing and to evaluate it as a potential therapeutic target. Here we have shown that furin, or a furin-like proprotein convertase, mediates BACE propeptide cleavage. Given the large number and diversity of furin substrates with important biological functions in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 16Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), long term inhibition of furin, as would be required for the treatment of AD, may have untoward side effects, and therefore furin is not a viable therapeutic target.

https://openalex.org/W2019664188,"Genetic evidence indicating that TOLL-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor in mice was reported. However, biochemical evidence that murine Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness has not been convincingly demonstrated. Inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) is selectively expressed in LPS-stimulated macrophages in part mediated through the activation of NFκB. Thus, we determined whether murine Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness as evaluated by the activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression. Transfection of a murine macrophage-like cell line (RAW264.7) with the constitutively active form (ΔTlr4) of Tlr4 is sufficient to activate NFκB and COX-2 expression. However, the truncated form (ΔTlr4(P712H)) of the missense mutant Tlr4(P712H) found in LPS-hyporesponsive mouse strain (C3H/HeJ) inhibits LPS-induced NFκB activation and COX-2 expression. The inability of ΔTlr4(P712H) to activate NFκB and induce COX-2 expression is rescued by a constitutively active adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of Tlr proteins. Furthermore, MyD88 is co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type ΔTlr4 but not with the ΔTlr4(P712H) mutant. Together, these results indicate that Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness in RAW264.7 cells and suggest that hyporesponsiveness of C3H/HeJ mice to LPS is attributed to the disruption of Tlr4-mediated signaling pathways that results from the inability of the mutant Tlr4(P712H) to interact with MyD88.

Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such stimulation leads to the expression and release of a plethora of pro-inflammatory marker gene products and lipid mediators, which in turn can initiate a chain of events leading to systemic toxicity (4Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tracey K.J. Lowry S.F. Adv. Surg. 1990; 23: 21-56PubMed Google Scholar). However, the initial recognition of LPS by cells of the innate immune system is required to defend the host from a Gram-negative infection before it becomes widely disseminated (6O'Brien A.D. Rosenstreich D.L. Scher I. Campbell G.H. MacDermott R.P. Formal S.B. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 20-24PubMed Google Scholar,7Rosenstreich D.L. Weinblatt A.C. O'Brien A.D. Crit. Rev.

Identifying the downstream signaling pathways derived from LPS stimulation is of fundamental importance to understanding the cellular mechanism of Gram-negative septic shock. CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein that is widely expressed in mononuclear cells, is considered a high affinity receptor for LPS (8Ingalls R.R. Heine H. Lien E. Yoshimura A.

Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). However, CD14 lacks a cytoplasmic domain, and there has been a puzzling question as to how CD14 transmits extracellular signals into downstream cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Recently, it was demonstrated that human TOLL-like receptor-2 (Tlr2) mediates the LPS-induced cellular signaling pathway (10Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill A.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 11Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J.

Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, results from studies using Tlr2- or Tlr4-deficient mice and from in vitrotransfection studies suggest that Tlr4 recognizes LPS, but Tlr2 recognizes Gran-positive bacterial cell wall components (41Takeuchi O.

Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human TOLL protein is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to that of the IL-1 receptor (12Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence indicating that murine Tlr4 is the LPS receptor was demonstrated using two mouse strains (C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr), which are hyporesponsive to LPS (13Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). The former strain has Tlr4 with a missense mutation to replace proline with histidine at position 712, whereas the latter strain is homozygous for a null mutation of Tlr4. This genetic evidence is confirmed by another independent investigation (14Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). It is also demonstrated that the activation of NFκB and the expression of certain NFκB-induced gene products in LPS-stimulated macrophages derived from the C3H/HeJ mouse strain are impaired (15Vogel S.N. Johnson D. Perera P.Y. Medvedev A. Lariviere L. Qureshi S.T. Malo D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5666-5670PubMed Google Scholar,16Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). In addition, the overexpression of mutant Tlr4 derived from C3H/HeJ mice into human dermal endothelial cells results in the inhibition of LPS-induced NFκB activation (17Faure E. Equils O.

However, the role of NFκB in LPS-induced COX-2 expression in macrophages is not clearly established; there were contradicting reports regarding the role of NFκB in LPS-induced COX-2 expression in macrophages (27Hwang D.

Elucidating the signaling pathways is the key to understanding why COX-2 is overexpressed in such pathological states and can provide crucial information for identifying the potential targets for pharmacological and dietary modulation. In this study, we have addressed three important issues in elucidating LPS-stimulated signaling pathways in murine macrophages. First, we determined whether the activation of NFκB is sufficient and required for LPS-induced COX-2 expression. Second, we determined whether the activation of Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness as evaluated by the activation of NFκB and the expression of COX-2. Third, we determined why the Tlr4 mutant with a missense mutation at position 712 fails to transmit the LPS-induced signal to downstream signaling pathways. RAW264.7 cells (murine macrophage-like cell line, ATCC TIB-71) were cultured in LPS-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Intergen) and 10 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 air environment. Human embryonic kidney cells (293T cells) were provided by Sam Lee (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA) and cultured in the same medium used for the RAW264.7 cells. Flag epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys)-tagged murine Tlr4 cDNA constructs (both wild-type and mutant pFlag-CMV1-Tlr4(wt) and pFlag-CMV1-Tlr4(P712H), respectively) were kindly provided by Bruce Beutler (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). These constructs lack DNA sequences for the first 20 amino acids representing the signal peptide. The mutant Tlr4 found in LPS-hyporesponsive mouse strain (C3H/HeJ) has a missense mutation at position 712 to replace proline with histidine. The Flag-Tlr4 constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo(−) vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the Flag epitope tag was replaced with the HA tag sequence (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning. The first PCR reaction was performed with the primers named Xho-SS-FOR and SS-HA-REV. The second PCR reaction was performed with the primers named Xho-SS-FOR and Not-HA-REV using the first PCR product as a template. The final PCR product was inserted in the XhoI and NotI sites of pcDNA3.1/zeo(−)-Flag-Tlr4 (wt) and pcDNA3.1/zeo(−)-Flag-Tlr4(P712H) plasmids resulting in pcDNA3.1/zeo(−)-HA-Tlr4(wt) and pcDNA3.1/zeo(−)-HA-Tlr4(P712H) constructs, respectively. The primers used are as follows: Xho-SS-FOR, 5′-GTTAAACTCGAGCCACCATGTCTGCACTTCTGATCC-3′; SS-HA-REV, 5′-AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAGCAACTGCAGCTCCAACAAG-3′; Not-HA-REV, 5′-GGGATTCGCGGCCGCAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGG-3′. For truncated Tlr4 constructs (Flag/HA epitope-tagged ΔTlr4(wt) and ΔTlr4(P712H)) lacking the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, DNA sequences spanning the epitope tag plus N-terminal 21–78 amino acids and transmembranes plus the cytoplasmic region (amino acids 629–835) were amplified by PCR using Flag/HA-Tlr4(wt) and Flag/HA-Tlr4(P712H) plasmids, respectively, as templates. The primers used for the PCR cloning are as follows: Xho-Tlr-F208, 5′-GTTAAACTCGAGCCAGGATGATGCCTCCCTGGCTCC-3′; TlrR441Bam, 5′-ACACCGGATCCTTCTGAAAAATTGGAGAAGCTATAGC-3′ for amplifying the N-terminal region; BmTlrF2092, 5′-GAAGGGGATCCAAGACAATCATCAGTGTGTCAGTG3′; and Tlr-REV, 5′-CTCAGAGGATCCCTCCTCAGGTCCAAGTTGCCG-3′ for the region spanning amino acids 629–835, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites in pcDNA3.1/zeo(−) expression vector for Flag/HA-ΔTlr4(wt) and Flag/HA-ΔTlr4(P712H). The integrity of the sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A schematic illustration of different Tlr4 cDNA constructs that were used in these studies is shown in Fig.1. The expression of each construct was verified after transfection into 293T cells by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal Flag antibody (M2) (Sigma), monoclonal HA antibody (12CA5) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and polyclonal anti-Tlr4 immune serum. Polyclonal anti-Tlr4 antibodies were prepared at the Core Laboratory, Louisiana State University Medical Center (New Orleans, LA) using a polypeptide containing 16 amino acids (NH2-Cys-Trp-Arg-Arg-Leu-Lys-Asn-Ala-Leu-Leu-Asp-Gly-Lys-Ala-Ser-Asn-COOH) located near the C terminus of human Tlr4. Expression plasmids for the wild-type NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), pRK-NIK(wt), and a dominant-negative mutant NIK (pRK-NIK(KA)) were gifts from Mike Rothe (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). Wild-type murine MyD88 (Flag-MyD88(wt)), dominant-negative mutant (Flag-MyD88(ΔDD)), and the constitutively active mutant (Flag-MyD88(ΔTOLL)) were kindly provided by Jurg Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Switzerland) (34Burns K.

The Flag-MyD88 variant constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Expression plasmids for wild-type inhibitor κB (pCMV4-IκBα(wt)) and a dominant-negative mutant (pCMV4-IκBα(ΔN)) were provided by Dean Ballard (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). 2xNFκB-luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Frank Mercurio (Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). HSP70-β-galactosidase reporter construct was from Robert Modlin (University of California, Los Angeles, CA) (35Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R.

Mouse COX-2 promoter (−3,200 base pairs) luciferase reporter construct was from David DeWitt (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). All DNA constructs were prepared in a large scale using EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for transfection. RAW264.7 cells were plated in six-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with total 5 μg of DNA plasmids including HSP-70-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control using SuperFect transfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Relative luciferase activity was determined by normalization with β-galactosidase activity as described in our previous study (36Paik J.H. Ju J.H. Lee J.Y. Boudreau M.D. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28173-28179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 293T cells (1.2 × 106 cells/well) were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes and incubated for 24 h. Cells were co-transfected with a total of 5 μg of HA-ΔTlr4(wt) or HA-ΔTlr4(P712H) plasmid and Flag-MyD88(wt) expression plasmids. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and lysed for 30 min on ice in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 12,000 × g. Cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of HA antibody (12CA5) for 4 h, and 70 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-agarose (Pierce) was added for overnight incubation at 4 °C with rocking. Immune complexes were solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) after three washings with lysis buffer. The samples were fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk and were blotted with the indicated antibodies. The reactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biotech Pharmacia) as described in our previous studies (22Lee S.H. Soyoola E. Chanmugam P. Hart S. Sun W.

To determine whether LPS-induced expression of COX-2 is mediated through the activation of NFκB, we investigated whether or not the inhibition of LPS-induced activation of NFκB leads to the suppression of COX-2 expression. Cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid for NFκB or COX-2 promoter and with an expression plasmid containing a dominant-negative mutant of NIK or IκBα cDNA. The results show that LPS-induced COX-2 expression is significantly inhibited by the co-transfection of cells with a dominant-negative mutant of NIK or IκBα (Fig.2). These results indicate that the activation of NFκB is required for the full expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. If direct activation of NFκB without involvement of LPS leads to the expression of COX-2, this result would further support that NFκB is required for the full expression of COX-2 induced by LPS. The results show that direct activation of NFκB by transfection of cells with the wild-type NIK plasmid leads to the expression of COX-2. Furthermore, the co-transfection of cells with NIK and a dominant-negative mutant of IκBα plasmid significantly suppressed the NIK-induced COX-2 expression (Fig.3). Together, these results indicate that the activation of NFκB is required for the full expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. There were two conflicting reports regarding the role of NFκB in LPS-induced COX-2 expression in RAW264.7 cells. The requirement for NFκB was demonstrated in our previous study using the pharmacological inhibitors of IκBα degradation or nuclear translocation of NFκB (27Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the results from another study using the luciferase-reporter gene assay showed that NFκB may not be required for the full expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (28Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It is not clear what causes the discrepancy between these two studies (27Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) in requirements of NFκB for the full expression of COX-2. We used the murine COX-2 luciferase construct containing 3.2-kilobase upstream promoter sequences, whereas the COX-2 construct used in another study showing the results that were different from our study contains only 700-base pair upstream promoter sequences (28Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although the κB binding site in the murine COX-2 promoter is located within −400 kilobases, it is possible that other enhancer elements located further upstream of the 5′-flanking region of COX-2 gene are required for the full expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. To determine whether or not the activation of Tlr4 is sufficient to activate NFκB and induce the expression of COX-2, cells were co-transfected with the truncated mouse Tlr4 construct (ΔTlr4) lacking the leucine-rich repeat extracellular domain and the NFκB- or COX-2-luciferase reporter gene construct. The gain of function by the truncated TOLL proteins lacking the extracellular domain was demonstrated both in Drosophila and in human cells (21Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 39Winans K.A. Hashimoto C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results show that transfection of cells with the constitutively active ΔTlr4 leads to the activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression (Fig. 4). The same truncated ΔTlr4(P712H) with the missense mutation at position 712 is unable to activate NFκB and COX-2 expression. Thus, these results indicate that the activation of Tlr4 is sufficient to activate NFκB and induce COX-2 expression in RAW264.7 cells. Kirschning et al. (10Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill A.T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) showed that human Tlr2, when co-transfected with CD14 into 293T cells, conferred LPS inducibility of NFκB. However, the overexpression of human Tlr4 constitutively activated the NFκB reporter gene, and the treatment of these cells with LPS did not enhance the reporter gene activity. Based on these results, they concluded that human Tlr2 but not Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness. Our results show that transfection of RAW264.7 cells with the truncated ΔTlr4 but not the full-length wild-type murine Tlr4 elicits a constitutive activation of the NFκB reporter gene (Fig. 4). To determine whether the ΔTlr4-induced expression of COX-2 is mediated through activation of NFκB, we investigated whether the inhibition of NFκB by a dominant-negative mutant of NIK or IκBα results in the suppression of ΔTlr4-induced COX-2 expression. The results show that inhibition of ΔTlr4-induced NFκB activation by the dominant-negative mutant of NIK or IκBα leads to significant suppression of COX-2 expression (Fig.5), indicating that ΔTlr4-induced COX-2 expression is at least in part mediated through NFκB. To establish whether activation of Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness, we next determined whether the expression of the mutant Tlr4(P712H) found in C3H/HeJ mouse strain inhibits LPS-induced activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression. The results show that the truncated mutant ΔTlr4(P712H) inhibits whereas the truncated wild-type ΔTlr4 enhances LPS-induced activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression (Fig.6). LPS responsiveness is slightly enhanced in cells transfected with the full-length Tlr4 as compared with the vector-transfected cells. These results suggest that ΔTlr4 (P712H) acts as a dominant-negative mutant. Together, these results indicate that the activation of Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness in RAW264.7 cells. However, our results do not permit ruling out the possibility that other TOLL-like receptors also mediate LPS responsiveness in RAW264.7 cells. Next, we investigated why the missense mutation to replace histidine with proline at position 712 of Tlr4 resulted in loss of function. It was demonstrated that MyD88 is an adapter protein directly interacting with the cytoplasmic TOLL/IL-1R homology (TIR) domain of human Tlr4 (40Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) and considered as one of the most upstream components of the human Tlr4-mediated signaling cascade. This TIR domain is also present near the N-terminal death domain of MyD88. Such a sequence homology is also present among murine counterparts. Proline at position 712 lies within this TIR domain of murine Tlr4, which is critical for binding the MyD88 adapter protein. Thus, we determined whether the mutation at position 712 interferes with the binding of MyD88 to Tlr4, thereby resulting in failure of the signal transmission. Human embryonic kidney cells (293T cells) were co-transfected with an epitope Flag-tagged MyD88 and HA-tagged wild-type ΔTlr4 or the mutant ΔTlr4(P712H) cDNA. When cell lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted using anti-Flag or Tlr4 antibodies, MyD88 was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type HA-ΔTlr4 (Fig. 7, lane 1) but not with the mutant HA-ΔTlr4(P712H) (Fig. 7, lane 2). These results suggest that the mutant Tlr4(P712H) is unable to interact with MyD88 and thus fails to activate downstream signaling pathways. The adapter molecule MyD88 is known to be an immediate downstream signaling molecule interacting directly with the TIR domain of Tlr4 (18Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 19Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 20O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Proline at position 712 is located in this TIR domain. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether the substitution of proline with histidine resulting from the missense mutation interferes with the binding of MyD88 to the TIR domain of Tlr4. If the failure of the mutant Tlr4 to activate downstream signaling pathways is because of its inability to recruit the adapter molecule MyD88, then transfecting cells with a constitutively active form of MyD88 should restore signal transmission. Indeed, the co-transfection of RAW264.7 cells with the dominant-negative mutant (ΔTlr4(P712H)) and a constitutively active form of MyD88 lacking TOLL/IL-1R domain (MyD88(ΔTOLL)) results in the restoration of NFκB activation and COX-2 expression (Fig.8). Taken together these results suggest that hyporesponsiveness of the mouse strain (C3H/HeJ) to LPS is because of the disruption of Tlr4-mediated signaling pathways resulting from the inability of the mutant (Tlr4(P712H)) to recruit the downstream signaling molecule MyD88. In summary, the results presented here indicate that activation of Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness and that disruption of Tlr4-mediated signaling pathways leads to hyporesponsiveness to LPS in murine macrophage-like cell line (RAW264.7) as determined by the activation of NFκB and the expression of COX-2. Transcription factor NFκB regulates the expression of a diverse array of genes including inflammation marker gene products that are involved in innate immune responses and pathogenesis of Gram-negative septic shock. Therefore, our results underscore the importance of Tlr-mediated signaling pathways in these processes. We thank Drs. Walter A. Deutsch and Leslie Kozak for reading this manuscript."

We previously identified a novel TGF-β control element (TCE) in the promoters of SMC differentiation marker genes, including α-smooth muscle actin and SM22α. In this study, the importance of the TCE in regulation of SM22α gene expressionin vivo was investigated by mutating it within the context of a mouse SM22α promoter-lacZ transgenic construct. Mutation of the TCE completely abolished SM22α promoter activity in arterial SMCs as well as in developing heart and skeletal muscle. To identify the transcription factor(s) binding to the TCE, we performed yeast one-hybrid cloning analysis and identified gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF). However, cotransfection studies in cultured cells showed that GKLF repressed the TGF-β-dependent increases in SM22α and α-smooth muscle actin promoter activities. Furthermore, GKLF was not highly expressed in differentiated SMCs in vivo, and TGF-β down-regulated GKLF expression in dedifferentiated cultured SMCs. In contrast, overexpression of a related factor (BTEB2) transactivated SM22α promoter activity. Thus, our findings suggest a reciprocal role for related Krüppel-like transcription factors in the regulation of SMC differentiation through a TCE-dependent mechanism.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). In a healthy blood vessel, the majority of SMCs are located within the media, where they express a contractile (or differentiated) phenotype and function to regulate vascular tone. However, during the development of vascular diseases such as restenosis, SMCs can down-regulate SM contractile proteins and revert to a non-contractile (or partially dedifferentiated) phenotype reminiscent of that seen during early fetal development (2Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1998; 18: 333-338Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As such, there is considerable interest in identifying the various extracellular ligands that regulate the ability of SMCs to modulate their phenotype and their molecular mechanism of action. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is thought to regulate a number of the cellular events underlying the development of vascular lesions, including SMC differentiation (3Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). Not only is TGF-β released by platelets (4Assoian R.K. Sporn M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and macrophages (5Assoian R.K. Fleurdelys B.E. Stevenson H.C. Miller P.J. Madtes D.K. Raines E.W. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) at the sites of vascular injury, its mRNA and protein are also elevated in neointimal SMCs of injured rat carotid arteries and in human restenotic tissue (6Majesky M.W.

Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although its role in complex vascular disorders is poorly understood, much more is known about the role of TGF-β during vascular development. For example, 50% of mice deficient in both alleles of TGF-β1 die in utero between 9.5 and 10.5 dpc from abnormalities in yolk sac vessel development caused, in part, by a failure of mesenchymal precursor cells to differentiate into vascular SMCs (8Dickson M.C. Martin J.S. Cousins F.M. Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Akhurst R.J. Development. 1995; 121: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, disruption of SMAD5 and SMAD6, intracellular mediators of signaling by TGF-β superfamily ligands, has resulted in defects in vascular development (9Yang X. Castilla L.H. Xu X. Li C. Gotay J. Weinstein M. Liu P.P. Deng C.-X. Development. 1999; 126: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Galvin K.M. Donovan M.J. Lynch C.A. Meyer R.I. Paul R.J. Lorenz J.N. Fairchild-Huntress V.

Consistent with these in vivo studies, TGF-β has been shown to stimulate expression of α-SM actin, SM myosin heavy chain, and SM22α in SMCs that have undergone partial dedifferentiation (or modulation) in culture (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β has also been shown to induce expression of these SMC differentiation marker genes in a variety of non-SM precursor cell types in culture, including multipotent embryonic 10T1/2 cells and neural crest cells (12Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 13Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J.

Although these observations indicate an important role for TGF-β in promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward a contractile smooth muscle fate and in regulating changes in vascular SMC phenotype, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown. To understand the molecular control of SMC differentiation, our laboratory and others have studied expression of SMC differentiation marker genes such as α-SM actin (16Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S.

Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and SM22α (19Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ.

SM22α is a calponin-related protein that interacts with other contraction-associated proteins such as tropomyosin and F-actin (22Duband J.L. Gimona M. Scatena M. Sartore S. Small V.J. Differentiation. 1993; 55: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). SM22α was shown to be expressed in all muscle lineages during early embryogenesis, but becomes restricted to all SMC types in late fetal development, and it is highly expressed in these cells in adult animals (20Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 23Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The first 445 base pairs of the mouse SM22α promoter have been shown to be sufficient to drive expression of a linked reporter gene in all three muscle lineages in transgenic mice (19Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Moessler H. Mericskay M. Li Z. Nagl S. Paulin D. Small V. Development. 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike the endogenous SM22α gene that is expressed in virtually all SMC subtypes (20Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), this region of the promoter is active only in a subset of arterial SMCs throughout development (19Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Moessler H. Mericskay M. Li Z. Nagl S. Paulin D. Small V. Development. 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we investigated the molecular mechanisms whereby TGF-β drives expression of SMC differentiation marker genes (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Studies identified a novel positive-acting TGF-β control element (TCE) that is required for TGF-β-induced activation of the α-SM actin promoter (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the promoters of multiple other SMC differentiation marker genes, including SM22α and SM myosin heavy chain, were also found to contain similar TCE regions (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the TCE is essential for TGF-β-induced α-SM actin expression in non-SMCs (24Hautmann M.B. Adam P.J. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1999; 19: 2049-2058Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), consistent with the observations that TGF-β can induce SMC differentiation marker genes in a variety of mesenchyme-derived cells. A major goal of our previous study (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) was to identify thetrans-acting factor(s) that bind to the TCE. Although the TCE resembles a cis-element that binds members of the Sp1 family, we demonstrated that neither Sp1 nor Sp3 is present in the TGF-β-dependent shift complex formed with cultured SMC nuclear extracts (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, high molar -fold excesses of an unlabeled consensus Sp1-binding oligonucleotide did compete with the TCE for factor binding, suggesting that Krüppel-like zinc-finger transcription factors other than Sp1 and Sp3 might bind to the TCE (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This observation is of interest since previous studies have demonstrated the importance of zinc-finger proteins in tissue differentiation (25Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.M. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. LeBeau M.M. Adamson E.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). In summary, there is clear evidence of the involvement of TGF-β in the regulation of SMC differentiation in vivo and that TGF-β can stimulate expression of the SMC differentiation marker gene α-SM actin in a variety of mesenchymal cells in culture through a TCE-dependent mechanism (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Hautmann M.B. Adam P.J. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1999; 19: 2049-2058Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, as yet, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating a role for the TCE in the regulation of SMC differentiation marker gene expression in vivo, and the trans-acting factors that regulate TCE activity have not been identified. Thus, this study has addressed the following questions. 1) Does a TCE regulate SM22α promoter activity in vivo? 2) What trans-acting factor(s) bind to the TCE? The results demonstrated that the TCE was required for SM22α promoter activity in transgenic mice. Moreover, yeast one-hybrid cloning identified gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF; KLF4) as a TCE-binding protein that can negatively regulate TGF-β-dependent SMC differentiation marker gene promoter activity in cultured cells. In contrast, a GKLF-related factor (BTEB2) enhanced rather than repressed TGF-β-dependent promoter activity. These results suggest that related Krüppel-like factors reciprocally regulate expression of multiple SMC differentiation marker genes through binding to the TCE. SMCs from rat thoracic aortas were isolated and cultured as described previously (26Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 103/cm2, grown to confluency in serum-containing medium, and then growth-arrested for 4 days in serum-free medium (27Turla M.B. Thompson M.M. Corjay M.H. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) prior to stimulation with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β (TGF-β1, R&D Systems) diluted with vehicle (4 mmHCl and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from SMC cultures stimulated with TGF-β or vehicle control for 4 h according to the method of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with the addition of protease inhibitors (16Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for EMSAs were synthesized and purified commercially by high pressure liquid chromatography (Operon Technologies, Inc.). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides (with only the sense strands shown) were used either as a probe or unlabeled competitor: SM22TCE, 5′-ggagtgagtggggcggcccg-3′; SM22mut, 5′-ggagttattgttgcggcccg-3′; αSMATCE, 5′-gaagcgagtgggaggggatc-3′; αSMAmut, 5′-gaagctattgttaggggatc-3′; CArG B, 5′-gaggtccctatatggttgtg-3′; and core CACCC site derived from the sequence of the β-globin promoter, 5′-agctagccacaccctgaagct-3′. EMSA probes were generated by end labeling 20 μmsingle-stranded oligonucleotides with 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and purified from unincorporated nucleotides using NucTrap Push columns (Stratagene). EMSAs were performed with 20 μl of binding reaction containing ∼30 pg (20,000 cpm) of labeled probe, 5 μg of nuclear extract (or 100 ng of recombinant GKLF/bovine serum albumin where indicated), and 0.25 μg of poly(dA-dT) in 1× binding buffer (12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide; Bio-Rad) at 170 V in 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. Antibody supershift reactions were set up as described above; however, 2 μl of antibody was incubated with the sample at room temperature for 15 min after addition of the labeled probe. The monoclonal anti-BTEB2 antibody was a generous gift from Yamasa Corp. (Diagnostics Division, Chiba, Japan) and was raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide antigen described previously (29Watanabe N. Kurabayashi M. Shimomura Y. Kawai-Kowase K. Hoshino Y. Manabe I. Watanabe M. Aikawa M. Kuro-o M. Suzuki T. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-GKLF antibody was purchased commercially (M-19X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The recombinant mouse GKLF protein was a generous gift from Dr. Vincent W. Yang (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) and was produced as described previously (30Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The region of the mouse SM22α promoter from positions −445 to +65, previously shown to direct lacZ expression in the arterial vasculature of transgenic mice (19Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Moessler H. Mericskay M. Li Z. Nagl S. Paulin D. Small V. Development. 1996; 122: 2415-2425PubMed Google Scholar), was generated by PCR and sequenced (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) in its entirety to verify accuracy. This promoter region was coupled to alacZ reporter gene within the context of the pUC19 vector (see Fig. 2) (32Li L. Liu Z.-C. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the TCE within this pUC19SM22-lacZ construct (see Fig. 2) was performed using the Ex-site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity and accuracy of the mutant construct were determined by sequencing (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Both the wild-type SM22α-lacZ and mutant SM22TCEmut-lacZ transgenes were prepared for injection after purification of each plasmid DNA construct by alkaline lysis (33Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar), followed by banding on two successive ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradients. Removal of the pUC19 vector DNA was achieved bySacII/EcoRI digestion, followed by agarose gel purification and multiple ethanol precipitations of each transgene. Transgenic mice were generated by conventional methods (19Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 34Gordon J.W. Ruddle F.H. Science. 1981; 214: 1244-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) at the Transgenic Core Facility of the University of Virginia. Transgenic mice were used to establish stable breeding founder lines, with the presence of the transgene being assayed by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA purified from adult mouse tail clips (35Vernet M. Bonnerot C. Briand P. Nicolas J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 434-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transgene expression and histological analyses were performed as described previously (19Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 36Cheng T.C. Wallace M.C. Merlie J.P. Olson E.N. Science. 1993; 261: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Yeast one-hybrid analysis was carried out according to the MATCHMAKER one-hybrid protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, three tandem copies of the 10-bp TCE (5′-gagtgggcgg-3′) were inserted upstream of the pHISi and pHISi-1 reporter plasmids (CLONTECH) by designing two antiparallel 3×TCE oligonucleotides with anEcoRI and XbaI overhang (Operon Technologies, Inc.). Both oligonucleotides were annealed and subcloned into theEcoRI/XbaI-digested reporter plasmids, which were sequenced (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) to confirm the presence and integrity of the target TCEs. Each TCE-reporter construct was linearized and integrated into the genome of competent YM4271 to generate yeast TCE-reporter stains whose background HIS3 expression was ablated using 15 mm 3-aminotriazole. TCE-binding protein genes were identified by screening competent TCE-reporter strains with a mouse 17 dpc whole embryo cDNA/GAL4 activation domain fusion library (MATCHMAKER pACT2 vector, CLONTECH). Library plasmid clones were isolated from yeast capable of growing in the absence of leucine and histidine (Zymoprep, Zymo Research) and then transformed into competent DH5α bacteria. Each cDNA insert was sequenced (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) and compared with known sequences in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. 10T1/2 cells (CCL 226, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown and maintained in Eagle's basal medium with 10% fetal calf serum according to the supplier's instructions. Prior to transfection, 10T1/2 cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated in Eagle's basal medium and 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected (in duplicate) with ∼2 μg of reporter plasmid and effector expression plasmid (normalized for equal copy numbers) using Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.). After a 2.5-h incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh Eagle's basal medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, and TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml) or vehicle was added. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h later by a detergent lysis method (Promega), and β-galactosidase reporter enzyme activity was measured using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activities were normalized for total protein content (BCA protein assay reagent, Pierce). Each transfection experiment was repeated three times, and the relative β-galactosidase activity data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. The GKLF and BTEB2 expression plasmids each contained the entire coding region of rat GKLF and BTEB2, respectively. These were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and were a gift from Dr. Ryozo Nagai (Gunma University School of Medicine, Gunma, Japan). A full-length mouse LKLF cDNA was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Jerry Lingrel (Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH) and was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Empty pcDNA3 vector was used as a control in cotransfection experiments. The α-SM actin promoter-lacZ construct (p2600Int-lacZ) has been shown to direct lacZexpression in transgenic mice and has been described previously (37Mack C.P. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) using 2 μg/lane of poly(A)+ RNA from rat and mouse tissues (CLONTECH). RNA was prepared from vehicle- or TGF-β-stimulated cultured SMCs harvested using a 1× trypsin/EDTA solution (3 min at 37 °C). Cells were washed twice in cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 900 rpm. Total RNA was isolated by lysis in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Isolation of RNA from mouse small intestine with or without the epithelium required homogenization of the tissue on ice in lysis buffer containing 0.6 m Tris (pH 7.4), 0.3m NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was made 1.5% with SDS before being extracted twice with citrate-buffered phenol (pH 4.5) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. RNA was precipitated overnight and resuspended in an appropriate volume of RNase-free water. 50 μg of total RNA/lane was Northern-blotted as described previously (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized at 65 °C with a radiolabeled GKLF probe and then stringently washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The 1.3-kb mouse GKLF probe (∼4 ng) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using random hexamer priming and Klenow extension (Prime-It, Stratagene). Autoradiography was carried out at −80 °C using X-Omat LS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Standardization of RNA loading and transfer was achieved by reprobing Northern blots with a probe for 18 S rRNA. RNA was isolated from mouse small intestine with or without the epithelial layer as indicated above. cDNA was generated from 10 μg of total RNA by random priming with the ProStar First Strand RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). PCR amplification of a 495-bp N-terminal coding region of mouse GKLF (positions +28 to +523) (38Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) was achieved using 22-mer sense (5′-GAGAAGACACTGCGTCCAGCAG-3′, positions 28–49) and antisense (5′-CAGATTCTCGGCTGTAGAGGAG-3′, positions 502–523) oligonucleotide primers in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. The composition of the PCR mixture was as follows: 2 μl of cDNA sample, 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, 0.5 μm each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. Reactions were overlaid with mineral oil and subjected to 30 PCR cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNA products were resolved on 1% agarose gels and then transferred onto nylon membrane by Southern blotting. Blots were hybridized at 65 °C for 6 h with a radiolabeled mouse GKLF probe (prepared as described above) and then stringently washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to film for 1–2 h. Standardization of GKLF PCR amplification was achieved by co-amplification of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. 50 μg of nuclear extract from vehicle control- or TGF-β (2.5 ng/ml)-stimulated SMCs was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide Mini-Protean gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to electrophoresis at 200 V. Proteins were transferred from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 70 V for 2 h. Blocking of the membrane and probing with appropriate antibodies were carried out according to a protocol provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Affinity-purified goat polyclonal anti-GKLF antibodies (M-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution (1 μg/ml). Membranes were also immunoblotted with control goat serum to indicate any nonspecific reactivity. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibodies (Pierce) were used as secondary antibodies at a 1:20,000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with Immuno-Star substrate (Bio-Rad). Fig.1 A compares the 10-bp consensus TCE and flanking regions of rat and mouse α-SM actin and SM22α promoters and illustrates the strong degree of homology of the TCE, particularly in the first 7 base pairs, within the promoters of these genes. Also shown is the close proximity of each TCE with respect to a CArG element contained in each promoter (Fig. 1 A) that has been shown to be required for expression in vivo (32Li L. Liu Z.-C.

Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the α-SM actin TCE forms a TGF-β-dependent shift complex (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J.

EMSAs using nuclear extracts from vehicle- and TGF-β-stimulated aortic SMCs demonstrated that the SM22α TCE formed a TGF-β-dependent shift complex identical in mobility to that of the α-SM actin TCE (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). Introduction of four G-to-T mutations into the SM22α TCE completely abolished the formation of this complex in a manner identical to that previously shown for the α-SM actin TCE (lanes 5 and 6), which we previously demonstrated was required for promoter activity in cultured SMCs (11Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of the TCE in the regulation of SM22α"

Expression of TACI in HEK293T cells confers on the cells the ability to bind BLyS with subnanomolar affinity. Furthermore, a TACI-Fc fusion protein recognizes both the cleaved, soluble form of BLyS as well as the membrane BLyS present on the cell surface of a recombinant cell line. TACI mRNA is found predominantly in B-cells and correlates with BLyS binding in a panel of B-cell lines. We also demonstrate that TACI interacts with nanomolar affinity with the BLyS-related tumor necrosis factor homologue APRIL for which no clear in vivo role has been described. BLyS and APRIL are capable of signaling through TACI to mediate NF-κB responses in HEK293 cells.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 51-84Google Scholar). We and others have previously identified a novel TNF1-related ligand, BLyS (also known as BAFF, TALL-1, THANK, TNFSF20, and zTNF4) which is expressed on monocytes and induces B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion in vitro and in vivo(2Moore P.A.

Like many members of the TNF family, BLyS has activity in vitro as a 152-amino acid soluble molecule and as a 258-amino acid transmembrane form (3Schneider P. MacKay F. Steiner V. Hofmann K.

More recently, transgenic mice that ectopically overexpress BLyS were shown to develop autoimmune-like phenotypes reminiscent of those observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (7Khare S.D. Sarosi I.

These findings suggest that BLyS plays an important role in the regulation of B-cell growth and humoral immunity.In order to understand the precise mechanism by which BLyS activates B-cells, the range of cell types BLyS may affect, and the potential role of BLyS as a therapeutic agent or target, we have used expression cloning to identify the receptor for BLyS. We have identified the orphan receptor TACI (10von Bulow G.-U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), previously characterized as being present on B-cells and a subset of T-cells, as the receptor for BLyS and show that this receptor is capable of mediating NF-κB signaling in response to ligand binding. We also show that TACI interacts with another TNF family member, APRIL, which is closely related to BLyS. Parallel work by others has recently shown that TACI and a second TNFR family member, BCMA, are BLyS receptors (9Gross J.A. Johnston J. Mudri S. Enselman R. Dillon S.R. Madden K. Xu W.

The labeled BLyS was used to screen an expression library that was generated from human tonsillar B cells previously demonstrated to bind BLyS and proliferate in response to costimulation with BLyS and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan preparation. Library pools of approximately 1200 cDNAs were screened. One pool from 96 screened resulted in reproducible binding of radiolabeled BLyS above background levels. This pool was partitioned into subpools of 150 clones and a positive subpool identified. Clones from a positive subpool of 150 clones were subject to end-sequencing using the HGS high-capacity sequencing facility, and sequences screened for homology to known TNFRs using a Hidden Markow model based on the cysteine-rich motif present in this family (18Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). This approach identified one clone that contained such a motif. DNA from this single clone was transfected into HEK293T cells and resulted in specific binding of BLyS to the cells that was competed with excess cold ligand (not shown). The insert of the positive clone was sequenced in full to reveal the presence of a 263-amino acid open reading frame which, when compared with known TNFRs, identified this clone as an amino-terminal truncation of the previously characterized TNFR superfamily member TACI (10von Bulow G.-U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Translation of the TACI protein from the isolated clone must initiate at a downstream ATG (Met-31 in the previously published sequence) to encode a protein which was still capable of being transported to the cell surface and binding ligand. The clone contains both of the cysteine-rich domains which are important for TNF-ligand binding (19Ware C.F. Santee S. Glass A. Thomson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, London1998: 549-592Google Scholar). We created a full-length TACI clone by PCR and used this for further analysis.BLyS Binds TACI with High AffinityIn order to show that the BLyS-TACI interaction is physiologically relevant we determined the specificity and affinity of BLyS binding to TACI. Saturation binding analysis was performed using various concentrations of125I-labeled BLyS on HEK293T cells that had been transfected with full-length TACI. Analysis of binding data revealed that BLyS binds to TACI with high affinity with a K dof 0.1–0.3 nm (Fig.1 A). This is similar to the affinity of BLyS for its receptor on tonsillar B-cells and other B-cell lines (20Kanakaraj, P., Migone, T.-S., Nardelli, B., Ullrich, S., Li, Y., Olsen, H. S., Salcedo, T. W., Kaufman, T., Cochrane, E., Gan, Y., Hilbert, D. M., and Giri, J. (2000) Cytokine, in press.Google Scholar). The affinity of the truncated TACI was 5–10 lower when compared with the full-length protein as determined by competitive binding assays using various concentrations of unlabeled BLyS (Fig.1 B).TACI Mediates Binding to Soluble and Membrane BLySWe confirmed binding of BLyS to HEK293T transfected with TACI by FACS™ analysis using biotinylated BLyS; transient transfection of TACI results in a population of cells which bind BLyS in contrast to vector-transfected HEK293T cells. (Fig.2 A). The TNF-related ligand LIGHT/HVEM-L (21Mauri D.N. Ebner R. Montgomery R.I. Kochel K.D. Cheung T.C., Yu, G.-L. Ruben S. Murphy M. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Spear P.G. Ware C.F.

To further explore the TACI-BLyS interaction we created a TACI-Fc fusion protein in which the extracellular domain of TACI is fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1. This fusion protein was used to effectively compete for soluble biotinylated BLyS binding to the B-cell-derived line IM-9 (Fig.3). Because TACI-transfected cells bind soluble biotinylated and radiolabeled BLyS and TACI-Fc competes with IM-9 cells for binding of soluble BLyS, we conclude that TACI is able to interact with the soluble form of BLyS.Figure 2TACI interacts with soluble BLyS. Cells were transfected with TACI (A, C, and E) or empty vector (B, D, and F) and 24 h post-transfection were stained with biotinylated BLyS (A andB) or biotinylated LIGHT (B and D).

HEK293F cells were stably transfected with BLyS and demonstrated to express cell surface BLyS by FACS analysis using a monoclonal antibody derived against BLyS (Fig. 4,A-D). These cells were then tested for their ability to bind TACI-Fc protein using FACS analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, TACI-Fc specifically binds the HEK293-BLyS stable cell line, but not a HEK293-vector cell line. Furthermore, the binding to the HEK293-BLyS cells is inhibited by the addition of soluble BLyS into the binding reaction (not shown). We conclude that TACI is able to bind membrane-bound BLyS.Figure 4TACI interacts with membrane BLyS. A recombinant cell line HEK293-BLyS that stains with monoclonal antibody I006D08 raised against BLyS were generated (A andC). No staining was observed with the control cell line HEK293-vector (B and D). No staining was observed in the absence of primary antibody (A and B). The cell lines were subsequently tested for the ability to bind TACI-Fc (H and E) or an irrelevant TNFR-Fc protein (Lymphotoxin-β-Fc; LT-βR-Fc; I and F). Staining was dependent on the presence of TAC-Fc fusion; no staining was observed in the absence of fusion protein (J andG).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding SpecificityTACI-Fc fusion protein was employed to assess the specificity of the interaction between TACI, BLyS, and other members of the TNF ligand family.

To evaluate the level of Flag-tagged protein present in the conditioned media, we used anti-Flag antibodies to immunoprecipitate the tagged proteins (Fig.5 A). An equivalent aliquot of the conditioned media was also subject to immunoprecipitation with TACI-Fc (Fig. 5 B) or with beads alone (not shown). Immunoprecipitates were detected by Western analysis using anti-Flag antibody. We find that TACI-Fc effectively immunoprecipitates all of the Flag-BLyS present in the conditioned medium (Fig. 5, Aand B, lane 3) but does not precipitate either LIGHT or FasL. We also find that TACI-Fc immunoprecipitates approximately 20% of the APRIL present in the conditioned medium, suggesting that TACI-Fc interacts with APRIL (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). Interaction between APRIL and TACI-Fc has also been observed with BIAcore analysis (next section).Figure 5TACI interacts with BLyS and APRIL.Conditioned medium from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged versions of APRIL, LIGHT, BLyS, or FasL were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG epitope antibodies (A) or with TACI-Fc fusion protein (B). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis with anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody.

There was significant binding to the flow cell of ∼1000 and 600 relative units at 5 and 2.5 μg/ml BLyS, respectively. This binding was specific because BLyS binding to TACI-Fc was competed with increasing concentrations of soluble TACI-Fc (data not shown). Based on the immunoprecipitation data, we also tested the TNF-related ligand, APRIL, for binding to TACI-Fc in BIAcore. APRIL was also found to bind to the TACI-Fc chip and this interaction was also shown to be specific (data not shown). The K d for binding to BLyS and APRIL were determined by analysis of the binding of different concentrations of ligand using the BIAcore biosensor instrument (Fig.6). The interaction between TACI and APRIL was weaker than that observed for TACI and BLyS; representative sensorgrams for the binding of BLyS and APRIL to TACI-Fc are shown in Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. The association constant, k a, for binding was 6.45 × 107 and 9.22 × 105, for BLyS and APRIL, respectively. The dissociation rate, k d, for TACI binding was 1.04 × 10−2 and 5.89 × 10−3 for BLyS and APRIL, respectively. Thus, the on-rate is faster for BLyS compared with APRIL, whereas, the off-rate for BLyS is faster than that of APRIL. The calculated K dvalues for the binding of APRIL and BLyS to TACI-Fc were 6.4 and 0.16 nm, respectively. Overall BLyS has a ∼25-fold higher binding constant than APRIL.Figure 6TACI interaction by BIAcore analysis. A, sensorgram of binding of BLyS to TACI-Fc. The sensorgram shows the on- and off-rate region of the BIAcore sensorgram of a series of different concentrations (range = 1.5–100 nm) of BLyS. K d value was calculated using the BIAevaluation kinetic software program. B, sensorgram of binding of APRIL to TACI-Fc.

We find that TACI-transfected cells are capable of binding Flag-tagged-APRIL or BLyS but not Flag-tagged Fas ligand (Fig. 7,A-F). We also find that APRIL competes for radiolabeled BLyS binding to TACI-transfected cells (Fig. 7 G). In agreement with the BIAcore analysis, the relative affinity of TACI for APRIL was again found to be some 10–20-fold lower than for BLyS. We also observe interaction of TACI-Fc with membrane-bound APRIL on cells transiently transfected with a full-length APRIL construct (not shown).Figure 7Interaction of APRIL with membrane-bound TACI. A, FACS analysis. Cells were transiently co-transfected with vector (A, C, and E) or TACI (B, D, and F), and either Flag-Fas ligand (A and B), Flag-APRIL (C andD), or Flag-BLyS (E and F) expression constructs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were analyzed by FACS for binding of the M2 anti-Flag antibody. H, APRIL competes with BLyS for binding to membrane-bound TACI. Cells were transiently transfected with TACI and 0.3 nm radiolabeled BLyS bound in the presence of unlabeled BLyS (filled squares) or APRIL (open circles). The calculated EC50 values for cold BLyS and APRIL are 0.33 and 11.8 nm,respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TACI Expression Correlates with BLyS Binding CapacityTACI was previously characterized as being present on B-cells and a subset of activated T-cells (10von Bulow G.-U. Bram R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We extended this analysis initially by Northern analysis on a series of tissues. In agreement with previous observations, we find that TACI is expressed primarily in immune tissues with weaker signals present in gastrointestinal tissues. Notably, the highest message is present in the B-cell lymphoma cell line RAJI (not shown). We have also refined this analysis by studying TACI mRNA expression using quantitative, real-time PCR (Taqman). In agreement with the above findings, we show that TACI is predominantly expressed on B-cells and B-cell lines; there is a much weaker signal present in cells of the monocytic and T-cell lineage. Furthermore, the weak expression of TACI in T-cells and dendritic cells is unaltered by known modulators of the immune system (Fig.8 A). We and others (2Moore P.A. Belvedere O. Orr A. Pieri K.

We, therefore, measured TACI expression among different B-cell lines using Taqman analysis and asked if TACI expression correlates with BLyS binding. We find that among B-cell lines Daudi has little or no TACI mRNA expression, while other B-cell lines have good TACI expression (Fig. 8 B). Thus TACI expression among B-cell lines correlates with BLyS binding capacity.Figure 8Determination of TACI messenger RNA levels by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR.

As we show here that TACI functions as a BLyS receptor we analyzed the capacity of T-cells activated by ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to bind biotinylated BLyS. We find that activated T-cells only weakly bind biotinylated BLyS (not shown).TACI Mediates Signal Transduction in HEK293 CellsIt has previously been demonstrated that several TNF receptor family members mediate NF-κB signaling, and that when overexpressed the receptors activate the NF-κB pathway independent of ligand binding (25Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). To determine if TACI is capable of activating the NF-κB pathway in HEK293 cells, TACI was transiently overexpressed in this cell type together with an NF-κB-SEAP reporter plasmid. As demonstrated in Fig.9, TACI alone is capable of activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. The NF-κB response is dependent upon the amount of TACI transfected into the cells. We also show that addition of BLyS or APRIL into this system by co-transfection of a ligand expression plasmid results in significantly increased stimulation of the NF-κB reporter (Fig. 9). This demonstrates that both BLyS and APRIL can associate with, and direct TACI mediated signaling.Figure 9TACI mediates signal transduction in HEK293 cells. HEK293 (1 × 105) were transiently transfected with an NF-κB-SEAP reporter plasmid together with the indicated concentration of TACI expression vector. Expression plasmids directing expression of soluble BLyS or soluble APRIL were also co-transfected where indicated at 20 ng/ml. 18 h post-transfection, supernatants were collected and alkaline phosphatase levels determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONUsing an expression cloning protocol we have identified the previously described TNFR family member TACI as a BLyS-binding protein that is present predominantly on B-cells. We present several lines of evidence to suggest that TACI is the BLyS receptor; however, the high affinity of the interaction between BLyS and TACI (K d of 0.1 nm), which is typical of physiological receptor-ligand interactions, is probably the most compelling. Additionally, there is good concordance between the TACI expression profile and the BLyS-binding potential of cells. Notably, among different B-cell lines, Daudi cells (which do not bind BLyS) do not express TACI. Significantly, we show that TACI is able to interact with both soluble BLyS and the membrane-bound form of BLyS present on a recombinant cell line, an observation that suggests that TACI is able to mediate signal transduction of both forms of BLyS to B-cells. Previous work has shown that BLyS present on the surface of cells is competent to act as a co-stimulator of B-cells (3Schneider P. MacKay F. Steiner V. Hofmann K. Bodmer J.L. Holler N. Ambrose C.

Med. 1999; 189: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar); we show here that this activity is probably mediated, at least in part, by TACI.In parallel work, others have recently shown that TACI as well as another TNFR family member, BCMA (26Madry C.

Strain hardening is thought to mediate the transduction of mechanical signals across the plasma membrane through the cytoskeleton. Here, we describe the strain dependence of a model system consisting of actin filaments (F-actin), a major component of the cytoskeleton, and the F-actin cross-linking protein α-actinin, which localizes along contractile stress fibers and at focal adhesions. We show that the amplitude and rate of shear deformations regulate the resilience of F-actin networks. At low temperatures, for which the lifetime of binding of α-actinin to F-actin is long, F-actin/α-actinin networks exhibit strong strain hardening at short time scales and soften at long time scales. For F-actin networks in the absence of α-actinin or for F-actin/α-actinin networks at high temperatures, strain hardening appears only at very short time scales. We propose a model of strain hardening for F-actin networks, based on both the intrinsic rigidity of F-actin and dynamic topological constraints formed by the cross-linkers located at filaments entanglements.

This model offers an explanation for the origin of strain hardening observed when shear stresses are applied against the cellular membrane. filamentous actin monomeric actin in buffer G fibronectin Cells are continuously subject to mechanical stresses generated by internal and external forces (1Cramer L.P. Mitchison T.T. Theriot J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 62-86Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To spread, migrate, maintain tissue shape (4Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), or to resist the shear forces of blood flow (5Konstantopoulos K. McIntire L.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2661-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), these forces are applied against adhesive contacts formed by the cell with the extracellular matrix (2Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) or with neighboring cells. Filamentous actin (F-actin),1 which is one of the major components of cortical cytoplasm and focal adhesions, is believed to play a key role in the mechanical response of cells (6Lum B. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L223-L241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly/disassembly or the severing/annealing/capping of actin filaments, which are regulated by actin-binding proteins (7Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Almo S. Pollard T.D. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), constitute mechanisms of fast “sol-gel” transitions of cytoplasm to potentiate the cell's response to mechanical stresses. However, as shown below, dynamic F-actin cross-linkers such as the protein α-actinin may provide the cell with an alternative and/or complementary mode of sorting out mechanical perturbations, based on their rate and magnitude, and instantaneously either resisting stresses or helping locally liquefy the F-actin network. The local response of a cell subject to mechanical stresses has been studied using biophysical techniques, including magnetic twisting cytometry (9Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar) and magnetic tweezers (10Bausch A.R. Môller W. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 573-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (9Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar) used beads coated with multivalent fibronectin (FN) or RGD peptide to locally form an actin-rich focal contact (11Grinnell F. Geiger B. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 162: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Twisting the beads induced strain hardening of the cytoskeleton, i.e. the cytoskeleton's elasticity increased when it was deformed (9Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). The origin of this strain-hardening behavior was attributed to the tensegrity of the cell (9Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 13Ingber D.E. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The inter-connected, geodesic-like organization of the cytoskeleton would induce enhanced mechanical resilience when the cell is deformed, which, in turn, is thought to promote the transduction of mechanical signals across the plasma membrane through the cytoskeleton, to the nucleus (9Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 13Ingber D.E. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). However, Bausch et al. (10Bausch A.R. Môller W. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 573-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), who applied applying shear forces using FN-coated magnetic beads, did not observe any strain hardening. They found instead that shear forces applied to the plasma membrane induced softening of the cytoskeleton, i.e. applied deformations decreased the cytoskeleton's local modulus. We used reconstituted F-actin networks to help resolve these apparently contradictory results and to model the mechanical response of the actin network under deformation. Rheological measurements have shown that actin filaments form relatively weak gels even at high (physiological) concentrations (shear modulus G ≈ 50 dynes/cm2 for a 5–10 mg/ml F-actin solution) (14Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence, auxiliary F-actin-binding proteins are required to cross-link and/or bundle actin filaments into stiff arrays to help maintain cell morphology against mechanical stresses. However, little is known about the effect of shear deformations on the behavior of F-actin networksin vitro. The effect of applied stresses on the viscoelastic response of reconstituted F-actin networks has been studied in the presence of the F-actin bundling protein, ABP-280 (15Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and calponin/α-actinin (16Leinweber B. Tang J.X. Stafford W.F. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3208-3217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In both cases, G′ andG"", the storage and loss moduli, were computed as a function of the strain amplitude γ0 by subjecting the network to sinusoidal deformations, γ(t) = γ0 sin ωt, of a single frequency ω. For small amplitude oscillatory deformations, G′ and G"" increased for increasing γ0, i.e. the F-actin network exhibited strain hardening and the network's resilience was enhanced when deformed. Instead, for large amplitudes, G′ andG"" decreased for increasing γ0,i.e. the F-actin network softened, which was attributed to the breakage of the filaments by shear (15Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Leinweber B. Tang J.X. Stafford W.F. Chalovich J.M. Biophys.

To assess the effect of strain on the mechanical response of cross-linked and uncross-linked F-actin networks, we employed step deformations, which provided insight into the dynamics of actin filaments under shear. We investigated the mechanical response of a model system consisting of actin filaments and the F-actin cross-linking protein α-actinin, a protein that transiently binds F-actin and that localizes along contractile stress fibers and at focal adhesions (19Critchley D.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). α-Actinin molecules consist of two identical polypeptides of 103 kDa with a 30-kDa N-terminal actin-binding domain, a tail with triple helical repeats, and two C-terminal EF-hands (19Critchley D.R. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 22-23Google Scholar). The rod-shaped tails associate to form an anti-parallel dimer with an actin filament binding site on each end. Sato et al. (21Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Wachsstock et al. (22Wachsstock D. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have already showed that bothAcanthamoeba and chicken α-actinin enhance the elasticity of F-actin networks in the linear regime, for which moduli are strain-independent. Here, we extended these studies to the non-linear regime, tested in vivo by Wang et al. (9Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar) and Bausch et al. (10Bausch A.R. Môller W. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 573-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), for which moduli become functions of the imposed deformation. Unless specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Sephacryl S-300 for gel filtration (24MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Purified actin was stored as Ca2+-actin in continuous dialysis at 4 °C against buffer G (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium azide, and 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Mg2+-actin filaments were generated by adding 0.1 volume of 10-X KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) polymerizing salt buffer solution to 0.9 volume of G-actin in buffer G. Actin filament networks were not supplemented with the stabilizing agent phalloidin, which can substantially change the bending rigidity of the filaments (25Isambert H. Venier P. Maggs A.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11437-11444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). α-Actinin was purified from chicken smooth muscle (26Craig S.W. Lancashire C.L. Cooper J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and stored by dialysis against buffer G, which was changed daily with fresh buffer. Proteins were used within 5 days of purification (27Xu J. Schwarz W.H. Kas J. Janmey P.J. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2731-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The strain-dependent properties of cross-linked and uncross-linked F-actin networks at steady state were measured with a cone-and-plate, strain-controlled, fluid rheometer (ARES 100, Rheometrics Inc., Piscataway, NJ), described previously (14Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Ma L. Xu J. Coulombe P.A. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19145-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Monomeric actin in buffer G (G-actin) was mixed with one-tenth volume of 10-X KMEI to a final concentration of 24 μm (≈1 mg/ml) and immediately placed between the temperature-controlled cone and plate of the rheometer. The extent of gelation of actin in the presence or absence of α-actinin was monitored by measuring the storage and loss moduli, G′ andG"", every 30 s for 6 h. After steady state was reached (i.e. after G′ and G"" reached a steady-state plateau), we conducted stress-relaxation experiments where the time-dependent stress, ς(t) (force per unit area), was measured after a step strain (i.e. a suddenly applied shear deformation) of controlled amplitude γ0 was applied and maintained for 1000 s (illustrated below in Fig. 2 a). The time after application of the step deformation represents a time scale that describes the motion of the filaments in the network (see “Discussion”) and is equivalent to the inverse of the frequency in an oscillatory assay,t = 2π/ω. The relaxation modulusG(t, γ0) reported here is the ratio ς(t)/γ0. Because large deformations may break actin filaments, a new stress-relaxation experiment was not conducted until the overall viscoelastic modulus, ‖G*‖ =G′2+ G""2(evaluated at 2π rad/s and γ0 = 1%), measured during recovery after a stress-relaxation measurement, was less than 10% away from the modulus G (evaluated at 1 s) measured during the 1% amplitude step-relaxation experiment. From these stress-relaxation measurements, we extracted the modulusG(t, γ0) as a function of strain amplitude γ0 (see Figs. 1 d, 2 b,4 a, and 4 b), time scale (see Figs. 2 aand 3), and temperature (see Figs. 2 and 3). The behavior of F-actin solutions during oscillatory deformations was probed (with a different aliquot) by applying a sinusoidal deformation, γ(t) = γ0 sin ωt, of fixed frequency ω = 1 rad/s and increasing strain amplitude γ0, and measuring the induced time-dependent stress, ς(t) (illustrated in Fig. 1, a and e). To compare strain-dependent moduli obtained with the just-described step deformation assay and moduli obtained with the more traditional “strain-sweep” assay (15Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J.

Viscoelastic moduli are calculated from either the maximum amplitudes or the time-averaged amplitudes of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the (presumably) sinusoidal stress over a few (typically two to three) cycles of shear. For small γ0, the moduli are independent of γ0, which defines the linear regime. However, for large γ0, the network may soften during the assay itself. To show this effect, we monitored the evolution of the viscoelastic response of F-actin during an oscillatory deformation and measured the corresponding time-dependent shear stress, ς(t) (Fig. 1 a). We observed that, although the input deformation was perfectly sinusoidal, the output stress was not; the amplitudes of stress oscillations became smaller over time (Fig. 1 a). To better analyze the behavior of F-actin subject to oscillatory deformations, we replotted ς(t) as a function of γ(t) to generate Lissajoux figures (see Ref. 28Ma L. Xu J. Coulombe P.A. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19145-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar for more details), where time runs along the curve clockwise (Fig. 1,b and c). At short times during the first cycle of shear, the stress increased linearly with the applied deformation,i.e. the corresponding modulus,G(t) = ς(t)/γ(t), was independent of shear (Fig. 1 b). During the same first cycle of shear, however, the stress started increasing more slowly than the applied strain, i.e. F-actin “yielded.” For subsequent cycles of oscillatory shear, the Lissajoux figure slightly rotated clockwise, because the F-actin solution softened over time (Fig. 1 b), which was also reflected by the decrease of the amplitudes reached during the oscillations of ς(t) (Fig.1 a). This trend was enhanced for oscillatory deformations of larger amplitudes (Fig. 1 c). F-actin networks cross-linked with α-actinin were also sensitive to oscillatory shear deformations: a sinusoidal deformation did not produce a sinusoidal stress either (Fig. 1 e). Here, during the first cycle of shear, the effective modulusG(t) was initially constant, because the stress increased linearly with the applied deformation but increased steeply at later times (Fig. 1 f); therefore, F-actin became strain-hardened. Although the overall axis of the Lissajoux figure rotated clockwise, which indicated progressive softening, an α-actinin cross-linked F-actin network continued to exhibit strain hardening at the end of each cycle of shear (Fig. 1, f andg). Hence, with or without α-actinin, a couple of shear oscillations is sufficient to change the stiffness of F-actin. Due to the non-periodicity of ς(t), storage and loss moduli, G′ and G"", are ill-defined, because the probing shear itself changed the amplitudes of the stress during the assay (Fig. 1, a, e, and h). For large amplitudes, non-periodicity became pronounced (Fig. 1, c andg). Therefore, repeated oscillatory deformations are typically inappropriate to analyze the strain dependence ofG′ and G"" and quantitatively assess the effect of strain amplitude on the mechanical behavior of F-actin solutions. In addition, it would be extremely time-consuming to sequentially subject F-actin to deformations of different frequencies and strain amplitudes. For a fixed strain amplitude, a stress relaxation experiment probed over a 0.01- to 100-s time scale range lasts 100 s; instead, a frequency-based experiment with frequencies between 0.01 and 100 s−1 (equivalent to the 0.01- to 100-s time scale range) lasts ≈1 h, conservatively probing three frequencies per decade with two oscillations per frequency. Hence, if for instance 10 strain amplitudes were to be probed, stress-relaxation experiments would last just 1000 s ≈ 17 min, while frequency-based experiments would last ≈10 h. We therefore used a step deformation assay to probe both the strain dependence and the time scale dependence of the viscoelastic moduli of F-actin networks. F-actin rheology in the linear regime, for which deformations are small enough so that moduli remain independent of the applied strain, has been extensively studied (see Ref. 27Xu J. Schwarz W.H. Kas J. Janmey P.J. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2731-2740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and references therein). Here, to focus on the dependence of F-actin mechanical behavior on deformation, we employed step deformations (see “Materials and Methods”) and monitored the relaxation of the induced stress (Fig.2 a). Step deformations have the advantage, over oscillatory deformations, to subject F-actin networks to smaller overall deformations, to measure stresses in real time, and to probe the time scale dependence of the mechanical response (31Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley and Sons, New York1980Google Scholar). Moreover, oscillatory deformations of increasing deformation amplitudes exhibit increasing rates of deformation, because the rate is proportional to γ0, dγ/dt = γ0 ω cos(t). The modulus of an F-actin network displayed the same overall relaxation profile at all tested deformations: the modulus of an F-actin network first relaxed rapidly, up to time scales of about 10 s, then reached a quasi-plateau, which extended from about 10 to 1000 s (Fig. 2 a) and finally underwent a terminal relaxation for t > 1000 s (not shown here). Strain-dependent moduli at a given time scale were directly obtained from relaxation moduli (Fig.2 b) by extracting the corresponding value of Gfrom Fig. 2 a at different strain amplitudes. The modulus of F-actin remained independent of strain amplitude for strains up to γ0 ≈ 1%, which defined the extent of the linear regime (Fig. 2 b). However, the modulus increased 8–31% (depending on the time scale) with strain amplitudes between 1 and 1.5% and decayed slowly for strain higher than γc ≈ 1.5% (Fig.2 b). Note that values of the yield strain varied ≈50% from experiment to experiment (data not shown). We suggest that the bending rigidity of F-actin is responsible for this strain hardening phenomenon (see “Discussion”). The characteristic “yield” strain γc is defined here as the strain at which the modulus started decreasing (onset of shear softening). When F-actin was tested using a frequency-based assay, we observed no strain hardening, because oscillatory deformations liquefied the network during the assay itself (Fig. 1 d). In summary, an F-actin network behaved like a “linear” material for small strain amplitudes (i.e. modulus was independent of strain), exhibited strain hardening for intermediate strains, and softened slowly for large strains. α-Actinin enhanced dramatically the strain-dependent behavior of F-actin networks. First of all, in the linear regime, the elastic modulus increased in the presence of α-actinin in agreement with the results of Xu et al. (20Xu J. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Figs. 2 a and 3 a). This enhancement of the modulus is not due to the applied strain (because it is the linear regime) but is due to the restricted motion of the filaments mediated by α-actinin (see “Discussion”). More importantly for the present paper, α-actinin-cross-linked F-actin networks stiffened greatly when the amplitude of the deformation was increased up to a yield strain amplitude, γc, which depended on time scale (Fig. 3, a and b). At short time scales (t < 1 s), i.e.at high rates of shear ω > 1 s−1, strain hardening was pronounced and G increased up to 250% compared with its value at low strains (Fig. 3, a and b). Strain hardening vanished entirely at an intermediate time scale,t ≈ 1 s, for which all stress-relaxation curves met (Fig. 3 a). At long time scales (t > 1 s), i.e. at low rates of shear, G was γ0-independent up to γc ≈ 2% and decreased monotonically and precipitously thereafter (Figs.3 b and 4 a). Of note, the rate at which the modulus declined beyond γc was much higher in the presence of α-actinin (Fig.4 a) than for F-actin alone (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, α-actinin not only enhanced the strain hardening of F-actin, particularly at high rates of shear, but also allowed F-actin to withstand larger deformations. Here, we show that the temperature-dependent binding lifetime of α-actinin to F-actin regulates strain hardening. In the absence of α-actinin, the mechanical properties of F-actin solutions vary by less than 10% with temperature over the range of 8–40 °C (20Xu J. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To probe the effect of temperature, and therefore the influence of α-actinin's lifetime of binding, on the strain-dependent behavior of α-actinin cross-linked F-actin solutions, we conducted stress-relaxation experiments at 15 and 25 °C. The extent of the plateau modulus, loosely defined as the time span over which G was approximately constant (32Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was slightly reduced in the presence of α-actinin at 25 °C compared with 15 °C (Fig. 3, aand c). Moreover, the plateau modulus was decreased"

In this study, we demonstrate that annexin II, V, or VI mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into phosphatidylserine (PS)-enriched liposomes, liposomes containing lipids extracted from authentic MV, and intact authentic MV. The annexin Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, K-201, not only inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into fura-2-loaded PS-enriched liposomes mediated by annexin II, V, or VI, but also inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by authentic MV.

Binding of these collagens to annexin V stimulated its Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activities, leading to an increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the liposomes. These findings indicate that the formation of annexin II, V, and VI Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in MV together with stimulation of annexin V channel activity by collagen (types II and X) binding can explain how MV are able to rapidly take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> and initiate the formation of the first crystal phase."

However, closer examination reveals a complex mixture of components. Although simple carbohydrates (i.e. sucrose, glucose, and fructose) make up the most significant solutes in nectar, other substances such as amino acids, organic acids, terpenes, flavonoids, glycosides, vitamins, phenolics, oils, and metal ions have also been found in various nectars (1Baker H.G.

However, these reports have primarily been undetailed investigations, failing to identify the proteins responsible for the respective activities. Only a few investigations have clearly identified the activities of defined nectar proteins (2Carter C. Graham R. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol.

All other materials were of the highest purity available and were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher. Nectar was collected as described previously (2Carter C. Graham R. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The nectarin I protein was obtained in pure form as follows; 12 ml of fresh nectar collected from approximately 500 flowers from 12–15 plants was divided into 600-μl aliquots in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The 600-μl aliquots were placed in a 90 °C water bath for 45 min, followed by a 30-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g. To avoid contamination from the pellet, the top 500 μl of nectar was removed, and 10 ml of 100% (NH4)2SO4 was added to each 1.5 ml of nectar (87% final concentration of (NH4)2SO4) and incubated for 1 h in 15-ml Corex tubes. Following incubation, the tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in a minimal volume (150 μl each) of distilled water or 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and dialyzed against 2 L of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, two times. In early studies, partially purified nectar proteins were produced by ammonium sulfate precipitation of raw nectar. Metal ion analysis was performed by flame ionization atomic absorption spectroscopy at the Metal Analysis Laboratory on the Iowa State University campus. All preparations were performed with nitric acid-washed glassware. The procedure described by Sugiura et al. (23Sugiura M. Yamamura H. Haramo K. Sasaki M. Morikava M. Tsuboi M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1979; 27: 2003-2007Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used for the assay of oxalate oxidase activity in solution, using a commercial preparation of barley oxalate oxidase as a positive control. A colorimetric assay (24Flohé L. Ötting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) using cytochrome c as the detector and xanthine-xanthine oxidase as a superoxide generator was utilized in the characterization of purified nectarin I and in the thermostability studies. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the methods of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Western blotting was conducted according to methods of Timmons and Dunbar (26Timmons E.D. Dunbar B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Anti-nectarin I antibodies were described previously (2Carter C. Graham R. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide in nectar was evaluated as follows. Fifty microliters of nectar was added to 1.95 ml of distilled water, and then 1 ml of developing solution was added. The developing solution contained 80 μg of 4-aminopyrine, 13 units of horseradish peroxidase and 0.2 μl ofN,N-dimethylanaline in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance was read at 550 nm. Negative staining of in-gel SOD activity was performed with nitro blue tetrazolium according to methods outlined by Flohé and Ötting (24Flohé L. Ötting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, SDS-containing gels were washed in 100 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 (with or without 50 μm MnSO4), three times for 30 min each prior to SOD activity staining. Positive staining of in-gel SOD activity was performed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Following SDS-PAGE, gels were washed (three 20-min washes) in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 (with or without 50 μm MnSO4). Staining for H2O2 production was performed by incubating the washed gels in a staining solution containing: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 28 μm riboflavin, 5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), 500 ng/ml 4-chloro-1-naphthol, 10 mmTEMED, and 60% ethanol. Gels were incubated in staining solution in transparent trays on a light box with gentle shaking. Staining was performed for 16–24 h. PAS staining following SDS-PAGE (28Zacharius R.M. Zell T.E. Morrison J.M. Woodlock J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 30: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar) was used to examine nectarin I glycosylation. MALDI mass spectrometry was used for determining the molecular mass of the purified nectarin I protein. Protein samples of 1–2 μl containing approximately 2–4 ng of protein were loaded with 1–2 μl of freshly prepared sinapinic acid matrix onto a time-of-flight mass analyzer (Lasermat 2000 MALDI; Finnigan, Madison, WI). The collected data were analyzed using data processing software (Lasermat 2000). Bovine serum albumin was used as an internal calibration standard. To evaluate whether nectarin I might be a superoxide dismutase, we initially examined whether raw nectar contained any superoxide dismutase activity. However, the high concentrations of ascorbate present raw nectar interferes with the SOD assay (24Flohé L. Ötting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), so nectar proteins were precipitated from raw nectar by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the SOD assay was performed on the partially purified nectarins. Fig. 1 demonstrates that increasing amounts of partially purified nectar proteins result in decreased superoxide-dependent reduction of cytochromec, confirming that the partially purified nectar proteins do indeed contain superoxide dismutase activity. Because superoxide dismutase activity was identified with the nectar proteins, we next attempted to determine whether this superoxide dismutase activity was associated with nectarin I. We ran aliquots of ammonium sulfate-precipitated nectar proteins on native gels and demonstrated that the major nectar protein was stained for superoxide dismutase activity with nitro blue tetrazolium (data not shown). We have demonstrated previously that even in the presence of SDS the nectarin I protein migrates as an oligomer if the protein samples were not boiled prior to SDS-PAGE (2Carter C. Graham R. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the nonboiled nectarin I protein maintains its oligomeric quaternary structure, perhaps it might also maintain its enzymatic activity. Therefore, we also examined SDS-PAGE gels for superoxide dismutase activity. Fig.2 (lane 2) shows the protein profile of ammonium sulfate precipitated nectar proteins. When the protein samples are prepared in Laemmli buffer without boiling and run on SDS-PAGE gels, the nectarin I migrates as a 165-kDa oligomer. As shown in lane 3, Western blotting using antiserum raised against nectarin I identifies the 165-kDa nectarin I oligomer. When a duplicate gel was stained for superoxide dismutase activity (lane 4), a band of enzyme activity was observed that corresponded with the 165-kDa nectarin I protein. Thus, nectarin I has superoxide dismutase activity. We next decided to purify nectarin I and evaluate superoxide dismutase activity on the purified protein. Because GLPs are known for their thermostability (29Lane B.G. Cuming A.C. Frégeau J. Carpita N.C. Hurkman W.J. Bernier F. Dratewka-Kos E. Kennedy T.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and heat precipitation steps are extremely good first steps in the purification of many proteins (30Bryant J. Green T.R. Gurusaddaiah T. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3418-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Sommert U. Traving C. Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32McManaman J. Shellman V. Wright R. Repine J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we explored thermostability for the purification of nectarin I from crude nectar proteins. Ammonium sulfate-precipitated nectar proteins were resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and dialyzed against this same buffer. Aliquots of these nectar proteins containing 17 μg of total protein were incubated at various temperatures for 5 min and evaluated for superoxide dismutase activity. As observed in Fig. 3 (panel A), the superoxide dismutase activity of nectarin I is remarkably stable over all temperatures up to 90 °C. Above 90 °C, superoxide dismutase activity rapidly declines. We also examined the kinetics of this stability. Aliquots of nectarin I were incubated at temperatures between 80 °C and 95 °C for varying periods of time and immediately placed on ice. The remaining activity of superoxide dismutase was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3 (panel B), nectarin I shows remarkably stable superoxide dismutase activity at temperatures of 90 °C and below. Even for periods as long as 1 h at 90 °C, 85% of superoxide dismutase activity is retained. When we evaluated the protein profile of the heat-treated, ammonium sulfate precipitated nectar proteins, we were surprised to find that this single thermal denaturation step resulted in the precipitation of all nectar proteins except for nectarin I. This resulted in a two-step, near quantitative purification of nectarin I. We moved the thermal denaturation step prior to the ammonium sulfate precipitation to reduce manipulations. As can be seen in Table I, the recovery of enzyme activity was nearly quantitative. A final specific activity of 2,543 units of superoxide dismutase activity/mg of protein was found for the purified protein. This level of specific activity is similar to that observed with the E. colimanganese superoxide dismutase (20Keele Jr., B. McCord J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6176-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the thermostable nectarin I preparation was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4 shows the protein profile of crude nectar in lanes 1 (nonboiled) and 2 (boiled) and of the purified nectarin I preparation inlanes 3 (nonboiled) and 4 (boiled). As can be observed, in nonboiled nectar, the nectarin I oligomer migrates at 165 kDa, whereas the monomer migrates at 29 kDa (comparelanes 1 and 2). The purified nectarin I preparation also gives a single 165-kDa band on the gel when nonboiled (lane 3) and a single 29-kDa band following boiling (lane 4). Based upon these observations, we concluded that nectarin I was pure. This figure also demonstrates that the oligomeric form of nectarin I binds Coomassie Blue much less effectively than the monomeric form. Each pair of these lanes, 2 and 3, or4 and 5, contains the same amount of protein, but clearly the monomeric form gives greater interaction with the Coomassie Blue stain. The SDS-PAGE analysis of nectarin I shows a molecular mass of 29 kDa. However, the MALDI-TOF analysis of purified nectarin I showed a M+ peak of 22,533 ± 58 (n = 5). The M2+ peak was also readily detected with a mass of 45,184 ± 131 (n = 5). Larger complexes are not observed. This discrepancy in molecular masses between the SDS-PAGE and MALDI likely results from the extreme stability of the nectarin I protein during electrophoresis. If the protein is not completely unfolded and coated with SDS, then the protein would be expected to run slower than expected, producing an artificially high molecular mass on the SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of the mature nectarin I protein predicted from the amino acid sequence is 21,062 Da (2Carter C. Graham R. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The difference between the predicted molecular mass and that found by mass spectrometry, 1,471 Da, is unaccounted for. However, it is known that GLPs are glycosylated (33Jaikaran A.S.I. Kennedy T.D. Dratewka-Kos E. Lane B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12503-12512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All GLPs, including nectarin I, contain a conserved site ofN-glycosylation (2Carter C. Graham R. Thornburg R.W. Plant Mol.

Biochem. 1969; 30: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of carbohydrate on the purified nectarin I protein (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). Jaikaran et al. (33Jaikaran A.S.I. Kennedy T.D. Dratewka-Kos E. Lane B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12503-12512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the structure of theN-linked glycan from wheat germin. That structure is a biantennary nonasaccharide with the composition (GlcNAc)4:Man3:Xyl:Fuc. This nonasaccharide has a molecular mass of 1,576 Da, which corresponds well with the mass differences observed between the MALDI-TOF analysis and the cDNA-predicted molecular mass (1,471 Da). Therefore, we expect that the nectarin I glycan is highly similar to the N-linked glycan present on wheat germin. To determine whether the purified nectarin I had superoxide dismutase activity, we next evaluated the ability of the purified nectarin I to remove superoxide generated by xanthine-xanthine oxidase. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the purified protein was indeed able to dismute superoxide in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we conclude that the superoxide dismutase activity associated with tobacco nectar is due to the presence of nectarin I. Based upon the type of metals that they contain, there are three known families of superoxide dismutases: FeSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, and MnSOD. To determine the type of superoxide dismutase family to which nectarin I belongs, we analyzed the purified nectarin I protein for metal ions. This analysis demonstrated the presence of 0.5 mol of manganese/mol of nectarin I monomer. Iron and copper were present in trace amounts at or near the limits of detection. To confirm that nectarin I was a manganese superoxide dismutase, hydrogen peroxide inhibition studies of enzyme activity were performed. Manganese superoxide dismutases are stable in the presence of 5 mm H2O2, whereas copper/zinc and iron superoxide dismutases lose activity following this treatment (34Koster J.F. Slee R.G. Van Berkel T.J.C. Bannister W.H. Bannister J.V. Biological and Clinical Aspects of Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase. Elsevier, New York1980Google Scholar,35Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because nectarin I retains superoxide dismutase activity following SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2, lane 3), we examined this inhibition following gel electrophoresis. Lanes 1and 3 of Fig. 6 contain a mixture of commercially available superoxide dismutases, including the manganese superoxide dismutase from E. coli (20Keele Jr., B. McCord J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6176-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the iron superoxide dismutase from E. coli (21Yost F.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4905-4908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes (22Steinman H. Naik V. Abernethy J. Hill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7326-7338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lanes 2 and 4 contain purified nectarin I. The nonboiled proteins were all separated on SDS-PAGE gels and stained for superoxide dismutase activity with nitroblue tetrazolium (24Flohé L. Ötting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). As can be observed in lanes 1 and 2, each of the nonboiled proteins retains superoxide dismutase activity following SDS-PAGE. Treatment of these proteins for 1 h with 5 mm H2O2, however, results in the loss of activity of the iron and copper/zinc superoxide dismutases. In contrast, both the manganese superoxide dismutase from E. coli and the nectarin I superoxide dismutase remain active following this treatment. Similarly, NaCN is capable of inactivating Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (34Koster J.F. Slee R.G. Van Berkel T.J.C. Bannister W.H. Bannister J.V. Biological and Clinical Aspects of Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase. Elsevier, New York1980Google Scholar, 35Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Incubation with NaCN did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of nectarin I (data not shown). Although nonboiled nectarin I retains its quaternary structure and its superoxide dismutase activity during SDS-PAGE, it decomposes to its monomeric form following boiling. This monomeric form does not retain the superoxide dismutase activity after boiling (comparelanes 1 and 2 of Fig.7). We therefore decided to test whether we could reactivate the superoxide dismutase activity following metal ion replacement. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of 50 mmFeSO4, CuSO4, ZnCl2, or CuSO4/ZnCl2 to the gel wash solutions failed to reactivate the superoxide dismutase activity (lanes 3, 4, 5, or 6). In contrast, addition of 50 mm MnSO4 produced active enzyme (lane 7). Thus, only manganese was able to reconstitute enzyme activity, confirming that the nectarin I is a manganese superoxide dismutase. The studies illustrated in Fig. 7 do not provide information about the quaternary structure of the active form of nectarin I following metal ion replacement. To examine this in more detail, we first inactivated the superoxide dismutase activity by boiling. After separating the monomeric form on an SDS-PAGE gel, we renatured the enzyme as inlane 7 of Fig. 7. The renaturation was verified by staining the gel for superoxide dismutase activity (data not shown). Subsequent"
https://openalex.org/W2085001027,"Numerous studies reveal that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt protein kinase are important mediators of cell survival. However, the survival-promoting mechanisms downstream of these enzymes remain uncharacterized. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which is inhibited upon phosphorylation by Akt, was recently shown to function during cell death induced by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In this study, we tested whether GSK-3β is critical for the death of sympathetic neurons caused by the withdrawal of their physiological survival factor, the nerve growth factor (NGF). Stimulation with NGF resulted in PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3β and inhibition of its protein kinase activity, indicating that GSK-3β is targeted by PI 3-kinase/Akt in these neurons. Expression of the GSK-3β inhibitor Frat1, but not a mutant Frat1 protein that does not bind GSK-3β, rescued neurons from death caused by inhibiting PI 3-kinase. Similarly, expression of Frat1 or kinase-deficient GSK-3β reduced death caused by inhibiting Akt. In NGF-maintained neurons, overexpression of GSK-3β caused a small but significant decrease in survival. However, expression of neither Frat1, kinase-deficient GSK-3β, nor GSK-3-binding protein inhibited NGF withdrawal-induced death. Thus, although GSK-3β function is required for death caused by inactivation of PI 3-kinase and Akt, neuronal death caused by NGF withdrawal can proceed through GSK-3β-independent pathways.

In the nervous system such cues are provided in part by neurotrophic factors, such as the nerve growth factor (NGF),1 that bind to tyrosine protein kinase receptors and activate intracellular signaling pathways (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). One such pathway initiated by NGF involves the generation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides via the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (2Carter A.N. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14563-14567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Raffioni S. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This pathway has recently emerged as an important mechanism by which NGF and other neurotrophins promote cell survival (1Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The primary effector of PI 3-kinase for cell survival is the Akt serine/threonine protein kinase, which is activated in cells stimulated with NGF in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (5Andjelkovich M.

Importantly, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and Akt block the survival-promoting effects of NGF and other neurotrophic factors, and activated forms of PI 3-kinase and Akt promote neuronal survival in the absence of external survival factors (6Crowder R.J.

Despite the significance of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway for neuronal survival, the mechanisms that lie downstream of Akt and mediate survival remain obscure. Recent findings in neurons and nonneuronal cells suggest that Akt may function by inhibiting death-promoting proteins (14Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). For example, Akt can phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, BAD, as well as members of the Forkhead family of transcriptional regulators. Phosphorylation of BAD or the Forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 by Akt suppresses the death-promoting activity of these and other proteins (15Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) was the first Akt substrate shown to be inhibited upon phosphorylation by Akt (18Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). By expressing a catalytically inactive form of GSK-3β in Rat-1 fibroblasts and in undifferentiated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, Pap and Cooper (19Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol.

Stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF caused a PI 3-kinase-dependent reduction in GSK-3β activity, raising the possibility that inhibition of GSK-3β may be a critical component of NGF-dependent survival in PC12 cells. More recently, inhibitors of GSK-3β were shown to reduce cell death in rat cortical neurons when death was initiated by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, serum deprivation, or serum deprivation combined with exposure to an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist (20Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest a role for GSK-3β in neuronal death, the importance of regulating GSK-3β activity for the survival of neurons by their physiological neurotrophic factor has not been examined. In this study, we have used NGF-dependent rat sympathetic neurons to compare the role of GSK-3β in NGF withdrawal-induced death with its role in death caused by inhibiting PI 3-kinase or Akt. Our results indicate that GSK-3β is a target of PI 3-kinase and Akt in sympathetic neurons but that inhibition of GSK-3β activity is not sufficient to block apoptosis caused by NGF withdrawal. Primary cultures of sympathetic neurons were prepared from superior cervical ganglia of embryonic day 21 rats and maintained in vitro for 5–7 days in medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF (Harlan Bioproducts, Madison, WI) as described previously (6Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For depriving neurons of NGF, the cultures were rinsed with NGF-free medium and then switched into NGF-free medium containing neutralizing anti-NGF antiserum (Harlan Bioproducts). Plasmids for expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ), Myr-Akt, Frat1, FratN, XenopusGSK-3-binding protein (GBP), and Bax under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter are described elsewhere (6Crowder R.J.

Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) were expressed using the plasmid PCS2(+). The AH-Akt expression vector was constructed by subcloning the AH-Akt cDNA from pcDNA3-AH-Akt·FLAG (6Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the multiple cloning site of pNF-κB-d2EGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Procedures for the microinjection of neurons and the assessment of neuronal viability are described in detail elsewhere (6Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs (each at 50 μg/ml) were injected in Pi buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) containing 4 mg/ml rhodamine-dextran to permit identification of injected neurons. Approximately 125–150 neurons/dish were injected directly into their nuclei. The number of successfully injected (rhodamine-positive) neurons was determined 12–15 h after injection, an interval sufficient for expression of the proteins of interest and for any neurons damaged by the procedure to die. At the end of the experiment, the cells were stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33,342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then evaluated for survival. To assess viability, the number of rhodamine-labeled cells that were phase-bright with a discernible nuclear membrane and diffuse Hoechst-stained chromatin was determined. Percent neuronal survival was calculated by dividing the number of viable cells at the end of the experiment by the number of rhodamine-positive cells counted 12–15 h after the microinjection procedure. For each plasmid, the results reported were derived from 2–7 independent experiments. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described elsewhere to confirm the expression of injected cDNAs (6Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used at the indicated concentrations: anti-GSK-3β monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-T7·Tag monoclonal antibody for detecting Myr-Akt (5 μg/ml, Novagen, Madison, WI); anti-β-galactosidase monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml, Promega, Madison, WI); anti-Akt1/PKBα PH-domain polyclonal antibody for detecting AH-Akt (1:50 dilution, Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY); anti-FLAG M2 antibody for detecting Bax, Frat1, and GBP (10 μg/ml, Sigma); and anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody for detecting FratN (10 μg/ml, Sigma). In each experiment, greater than 80% of microinjected neurons expressed the appropriate protein(s). After the indicated treatments, neurons were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The lysates were centrifuged (5 min at 14,000 ×g), and the supernatants were preabsorbed with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A premixed solution containing 1 μg of anti-GSK-3β monoclonal antibody, 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added to each cleared lysate. After 3 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μmNa3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR), and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 μm ATP). The immune complexes were incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of phosphoglycogen synthase-2 peptide (Upstate Biotechnologies) and 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by pelleting the immune complexes and freezing the supernatants. Samples were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose filter paper. The filters were washed 6–8 times with 180 mm H3PO4, dried, and analyzed by scintillation counting. Total cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 45 min at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk and then overnight at 4 °C with a phosphoserine-specific GSK-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in TBST/1% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed in TBST (6 × 5 min) and were incubated 45 min in TBST/1% nonfat dry milk containing a 1:100,000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). This procedure was followed by six washes in TBST and three washes in TBST without detergent. Blots were developed using SuperSignal (Pierce) and exposed to CL-XPosure film (Pierce). To control for variability in sample loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-GSK-3β antibody. NGF stimulation activates Akt via PI 3-kinase in PC12 cells and rat sympathetic neurons (5Andjelkovich M. Suidan H.S. Meier R. Frech M. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J.

Brain Res. 1999; 837: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because Akt can inhibit GSK-3β (18Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), we tested whether NGF stimulation would inhibit GSK-3β kinase activity in sympathetic neurons. NGF stimulation of sympathetic neurons caused a 26% decrease in in vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated GSK-3β (Fig. 1), similar to results obtained in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (19Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Treatment with NGF in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin restored GSK-3β activity to that of unstimulated neurons, indicating that NGF-induced inhibition of GSK-3β was largely due to activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β on serine 9 by Akt inhibits GSK-3β kinase activity (18Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of GSK-3β activity by NGF might involve Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3β, we prepared immunoblots of GSK-3β from sympathetic neurons using an antibody that recognizes serine 9-phosphorylated GSK-3β. In these experiments, NGF stimulation led to an increase in phosphorylation on serine 9 (Fig. 2). Treatment with LY294002 or wortmannin reduced the NGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3β on serine 9, indicating that NGF negatively regulates GSK-3β activity in sympathetic neurons via a PI 3-kinase-dependent mechanism that probably involves Akt. To determine whether GSK-3β contributes to the death of sympathetic neurons that occurs after PI 3-kinase inhibition, we microinjected neurons with expression plasmids encoding proteins that inhibit GSK-3β function. The various expression vectors were injected in a solution containing rhodamine-labeled dextran to facilitate visualization of the injected cells. The injected neurons were treated for 48 h with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 in the presence of NGF and then scored for the existence of condensed or degraded chromatin, a characteristic of apoptotic cell death, using the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33,342 (Fig.3 A). As expected, most neurons that were microinjected with a plasmid-expressing LacZ and were maintained in NGF died after treatment with LY294002 (Fig.3 B). In contrast, expression of constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) (28Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) prevented the death of approximately half of the LY294002-treated neurons, consistent with a role for Akt as an effector of PI 3-kinase in promoting survival. Expression of Frat1 (29Jonkers J. Korswagen H.C. Acton D. Breuer M. Berns A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a protein that binds to GSK-3β and inhibits its kinase activity toward select substrates (22Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), rescued a similar fraction of neurons as Myr-Akt from LY294002-induced death. To test whether the protective effect of Frat1 was dependent on its ability to bind GSK-3β, we microinjected neurons with a Frat1 C-terminal deletion mutant (FratN) that lacks the GSK-3 binding domain and thus fails to inhibit GSK-3β (22Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 23Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Expression of FratN did not rescue LY294002-treated neurons (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the ability of Frat1 to protect from cell death is dependent on its ability to bind GSK-3β. We next examined whether inhibition of GSK-3β could prevent neuronal death caused by Akt inhibition. Frat1, FratN, a kinase-deficient GSK-3β mutant (GSK-3βKM) (25He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), or LacZ was co-expressed in neurons with a dominant inhibitory form of Akt (AH-Akt) (6Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar), and survival was evaluated 72 h later. In each microinjection experiment, greater than 80% of the injected neurons expressed both target proteins as determined by dual immunofluorescence experiments (data not shown). Approximately half of the neurons co-injected with AH-Akt and LacZ underwent cell death (Fig.4). Expression of either Frat1 or GSK-3βKM partially rescued neurons from AH-Akt-induced death. In contrast, expression of FratN did not protect against death caused by Akt inhibition. GSK-3β function therefore appears to be important for cell death caused by either dominant-negative Akt or a PI 3-kinase inhibitor. Taken together, these results suggest that NGF-induced inhibition of GSK-3β kinase activity by a PI 3-kinase and Akt-dependent mechanism may contribute to the survival-promoting effects of NGF on sympathetic neurons. Overexpression of GSK-3β has been shown to reduce the survival of undifferentiated PC12 cells and cortical neurons maintained in serum-containing medium (19Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 20Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether microinjection of neurons with a GSK-3β expression vector was sufficient to override NGF-promoted survival signals in sympathetic neurons. Ectopic expression of GSK-3β produced a small but significant decrease in the survival of NGF-maintained neurons compared with the survival of neurons expressing LacZ (Fig.5 A). Expression of GSK-3βKM did not decrease survival compared with neurons expressing LacZ, indicating that the death caused by GSK-3β required a functional protein kinase domain. In comparison with GSK-3β, expression of the Bcl-2-related protein Bax, an inducer of cell death in these neurons (24Easton R.M. Deckwerth T.L. Parsadanian A.S. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9656-9666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in the death of greater than 60% of the injected neurons. Thus, overexpression of GSK-3β can partially override the survival-promoting effects of NGF on sympathetic neurons. Because the results described above suggest the possibility that inhibition of GSK-3β may be important for NGF-promoted survival, we tested whether GSK-3β has an essential role in the death of NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons. Neurons were microinjected with vectors encoding inhibitors of GSK-3β and then deprived of NGF for 48 h. In contrast to their protective effects on AH-Akt-induced death, neither Frat1 nor GSK-3βKM inhibited the death of NGF-deprived neurons (Fig. 5 B). Expression of the Frat1-related GSK-3-binding protein (23Yost C. Farr G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) also failed to inhibit the death of neurons deprived of NGF. The GSK-3β inhibitors had no effect on cell death at earlier times after NGF withdrawal (24 and 36 h), and overexpression of wild-type GSK-3β did not enhance the rate of NGF withdrawal-induced cell death (data not shown). Consistent with the microinjection results, treatment of neurons with 1–10 mmLiCl, a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3β (32Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar, 33Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not significantly inhibit the death of NGF-deprived neurons (data not shown). These data indicate that inhibition of GSK-3β activity is not sufficient to protect neurons from death induced by NGF withdrawal. Inhibitors of GSK-3β activity have recently been shown to reduce cell death caused by PI 3-kinase inhibition or serum withdrawal in PC12 cells and cortical neurons (19Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 20Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the importance of GSK-3β for cell death in neurons deprived of their physiological survival factor has not been tested previously. Sympathetic neurons from neonatal rat superior cervical ganglia, which require NGF for survival in vivo and in vitro, provide a powerful model for studying neurotrophic factor dependence (34Deshmukh M. Johnson E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We used these cells to compare the role of GSK-3β in neuronal death caused by inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway with its role in death caused by NGF withdrawal. Our results corroborate previous findings that GSK-3β is a target of the PI 3-kinase pathway in primary neurons and that inhibition of GSK-3β can protect neurons from death induced by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In addition, we demonstrate that inhibition of GSK-3β reduces neuronal death caused by the inhibition of Akt, suggesting that endogenous Akt acts to inhibit GSK-3β in neurons. Finally, our results provide evidence that inhibiting GSK-3β is not sufficient to block cell death after NGF withdrawal. Stimulation of sympathetic neurons with NGF caused a PI 3-kinase-dependent increase in GSK-3β phosphorylation on serine 9 and a parallel decrease in GSK-3β kinase activity. Because Akt can phosphorylate serine 9 and inactivate GSK-3β after insulin stimulation (18Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), it is probable that the NGF-induced inhibition of GSK-3β activity seen here is mediated by a similar Akt-dependent mechanism. Nonetheless, it remains possible that regulation of GSK-3β by NGF may involve other PI 3-kinase effectors (35Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Our observation that both Frat1 and kinase-defective GSK-3β provide protection against AH-Akt-induced death suggests that GSK-3β is at least partly regulated by Akt in response to NGF treatment. A role for GSK-3β activity in neuronal death has recently been demonstrated in cortical neurons. Withdrawal of serum from cortical neurons caused an increase in GSK-3β activity that preceded the onset of cell death and that was reversed by the addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (20Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cortical neurons were transiently transfected with expression vectors for GBP or kinase-deficient GSK-3β, apoptosis caused by serum deprivation or by PI 3-kinase inhibition was significantly reduced. Overexpression of wild-type GSK-3β in cortical neurons caused a modest increase in neuronal death. These data are consistent with a role for GSK-3β in the death of neurons deprived of survival factors. In agreement with such a role, we found that overexpression of GSK-3β in sympathetic neurons could partially override the survival signals initiated by NGF, resulting in a 20–30% increase in cell death. However, none of the GSK-3β inhibitors that we tested (Frat1, GBP, or GSK-3βKM) was sufficient to prevent the death of NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons. This lack of protection was not simply a consequence of inadequate expression of these proteins as both Frat1 and GSK-3βKM were expressed sufficiently in neurons to inhibit death caused by blocking Akt function. Why do GSK-3β inhibitors prevent death of serum-deprived cortical neurons but not NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons? GSK-3β activity is regulated not only by phosphorylation on serine residues but also through its association with proteins, such as Frat1, Axin, and Dishevelled (22Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). GSK-3β-binding proteins appear to inhibit GSK-3β kinase activity toward certain substrates but not other substrates (31Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and recent reports suggest that kinase-deficient GSK-3β mutants might not block all downstream pathways regulated by GSK-3 (30Yuan H. Mao J. Li L. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Consequently, the precise effects of overexpressing GSK-3-binding proteins and kinase-deficient GSK-3β mutants are difficult to ascertain and may vary in different cell types. In addition, different cells may vary in their dependence on the function of various GSK-3β substrates, such as glycogen synthase, eIF2B, Tau, and β-catenin (37Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 274-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For example, destabilization of β-catenin, which occurs as a consequence of its phosphorylation by GSK-3β (38Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), has been reported to enhance cell death in hippocampal neurons (39Zhang Z.H. Hartmann H. Do V.M. Abramowski D. Sturchlerpierrat C. Staufenbiel M. Sommer B. Vandewetering M. Clevers H. Saftig P. Destrooper B. He X. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that stabilization of β-catenin through down-regulation of GSK-3β activity could be one mechanism by which neurotrophins promote survival in neurons. However, expression of a stabilized form of β-catenin failed to protect cortical neurons from death caused by serum withdrawal or inhibition of PI 3-kinase, indicating that at least in some cases GSK-3β-mediated destabilization of β-catenin is not necessary for neuronal death (20Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) has been shown to inhibit insulin signaling in nonneuronal cells (40Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and by analogy it could play a similar role in negatively regulating neurotrophin-derived survival signals in neurons. A report that IRS-1 can mediate the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase in cortical neurons is consistent with this possibility (41Yamada M. Ohnishi H. Sano S. Nakatani A. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30334-30339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, a role for IRS-1 in NGF signaling has not been reported. Whereas IRS-1 may be regulated by GSK-3β in brain-derived neurotrophic factor-responsive cortical neurons, it seems unlikely to be an important GSK-3β target in NGF-dependent neurons. Although inhibitors of GSK-3β failed to prevent death caused by NGF withdrawal, they did protect neurons from death caused by the inhibition of PI 3-kinase and Akt. One explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be that NGF withdrawal leads to higher levels of GSK-3β activity than does PI 3-kinase or Akt inhibition. In this case, the GSK-3β inhibitors might not be expressed sufficiently to inhibit the potentially higher level of GSK-3β activity in NGF-deprived neurons. This scenario seems unlikely because the level of GSK-3β kinase activity detected in PI 3-kinase inhibitor-treated neurons was not different from that of NGF-deprived neurons (Fig. 1). Moreover, treatment with LiCl at concentrations at and above those known to inhibit GSK-3β kinase activity (32Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, other pro-apoptotic mechanisms are up-regulated after NGF withdrawal including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation, translocation of Bax to mitochondria, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (45Xia Z.

Activation of one or more of these pathways after NGF withdrawal could result in cell death that is independent of GSK-3β activity. Finally, an alternative explanation for these results is that NGF withdrawal, but not PI 3-kinase/Akt inhibition, could conceivably activate GSK-3β functions that are not targeted by the inhibitors used in this study. NGF activates proteins in addition to PI 3-kinase and Akt that can function to promote cell survival. For example, the transcription factors NF-κB (51Wood J.N. Neurosci.

The adaptations that enhance assembly of these microtubules are intrinsic to the tubulin dimer and reduce its critical concentration for polymerization at 0 °C to ∼0.9 mg/ml (Williams, R. C., Jr., Correia, J. J., and DeVries, A. L. (1985)Biochemistry 24, 2790–2798). Here we demonstrate that microtubules formed by pure brain tubulins of Antarctic fishes exhibit slow dynamics at both low (5 °C) and high (25 °C) temperatures; the rates of polymer growth and shortening and the frequencies of interconversion between these states are small relative to those observed for mammalian microtubules (37 °C). To investigate the contribution of tubulin primary sequence variation to the functional properties of the microtubules of Antarctic fishes, we have sequenced brain cDNAs that encode 9 α-tubulins and 4 β-tubulins from the yellowbelly rockcod Notothenia coriiceps and 4 α-tubulins and 2 β-tubulins from the ocellated icefish Chionodraco rastrospinosus. The tubulins of these fishes were found to contain small sets of unique or rare residue substitutions that mapped to the lateral, interprotofilament surfaces or to the interiors of the α- and β-polypeptides; longitudinal interaction surfaces are not altered in the fish tubulins. Four changes (A278T and S287T in α; S280G and A285S in β) were present in the S7-H9 interprotofilament “M” loops of some monomers and would be expected to increase the flexibility of these regions.

The critical concentration for polymerization at 0 °C of purified, MAP1-free brain tubulin is ∼0.9 mg/ml (1Williams Jr., R.C. Correia J.J. DeVries A.L.

Unlike mammalian microtubules, however, the cytoplasmic microtubules of Antarctic fishes are very stable and exhibit slow dynamics at cold temperatures (5Himes R.H. Detrich III, H.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5089-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Billger M. Wallin M. Williams Jr., R.C. Detrich III, H.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Evidently, both the capacity to polymerize at low critical concentration and the slow exchange of tubulin dimers into and out of microtubule polymers are properties intrinsic to the tubulin subunits of these fishes. These unusual functional characteristics must be explicable by structural alterations to the primary sequences and/or by changes in the posttranslational modifications of the tubulin chains that, alone or in concert, modify the quaternary interactions between dimers in a microtubule. Both the longitudinal,intraprotofilament and the lateral,interprotofilament contacts may be subject to structural remodeling, and adaptation might require coordinated changes located in the complementary contact domains of the tubulin chains.Disentangling the contributions of isotype sequence variation and differential posttranslational modification to cold adaptation of microtubule assembly ideally requires comprehensive functional and structural analyses of tubulins that derive from comparable tissues of related cold- and warm-living taxa. Among vertebrates, the notothenioid fishes of the Southern Ocean and mammals experience body temperatures (−1.8 and +37 °C, respectively) that differ by almost 40 °C, and their brains provide abundant quantities of tubulins composed of multiple α and β isotypes (7Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using representative species from these taxonomic groups as models, we compare in this report the dynamics of their microtubules at cold and warm temperatures and determine via cDNA cloning the primary sequence variations that distinguish their tubulin isotypes. By mapping the residue substitutions found commonly in the Antarctic fish isotypes, but rarely in other vertebrates, onto the three-dimensional structures of the tubulin dimer and the microtubule (8Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 9Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), we deduce potential structural interactions that predispose the fish tubulins to form stable, relatively non-dynamic polymers at cold temperatures. Our analysis of the role of posttranslational modification in cold adaptation of microtubule assembly will be presented elsewhere. 2V. Redeker, A. Frankfurter, J. Rossier, S. Parker, and H. W. Detrich, III, manuscript in preparation. 2V. Redeker, A. Frankfurter, J. Rossier, S. Parker, and H. W. Detrich, III, manuscript in preparation.DISCUSSIONMicrotubules assembled from pure brain tubulins of cold-living fishes, unlike those of homeotherms, are stable at temperatures between 0 and 25 °C and exhibit limited dynamic instability (see Refs. 5Himes R.H. Detrich III, H.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5089-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and6Billger M. Wallin M. Williams Jr., R.C. Detrich III, H.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and this report). Slow dynamics must therefore result from structural changes intrinsic to the tubulins of these organisms that modify the quaternary interactions between dimers in a microtubule. To investigate the contribution of tubulin primary sequence variation to the unique functional properties of the microtubules of Antarctic fishes, we have sequenced a total of 11 α- and 5 β-tubulin cDNAs from two representative species of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. We find that these tubulins contain small sets of unusual residue substitutions that map to the lateral, interprotofilament surfaces or to the interiors of the α- and β polypeptides. By contrast, the longitudinal, intraprotofilament interaction surfaces appear not to be altered.Evolution of Tubulin Isotypes to Enable Microtubule Assembly at Low Temperature: All Together Now?The Southern Ocean began to cool approximately 25–40 million years ago and reached its current freezing temperature during the mid-late Miocene (5–14 million years ago (34Kennett J.P. J. Geophys. Res. 1977; 82: 3843-3860Crossref Google Scholar,35Eastman J.T. Antarctic Fish Biology: Evolution in a Unique Environment. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 322Google Scholar)). Subjected to the selective pressure of an increasingly cold thermal environment, the coastal fishes of the Antarctic diverged from temperate fishes (36DeWitt H.H. Bushnell V.C. Antarctic Map Folio Series , Folio 15. American Geographical Society, New York1971: 1-10Google Scholar) and evolved molecular, cellular, and physiological adaptations that maintain metabolic efficiency and preserve macromolecular function in their now chronically cold marine habitat (−1.8 to +1 °C). One may ask whether the primary sequences of each of the many brain α- and/or β-tubulin isotypes of Antarctic fishes need be altered equivalently to ensure that microtubules polymerize efficiently at cold temperatures. Probably not. Wallin and Billger (37Wallin M. Billger M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have shown that brain tubulin or microtubule proteins from the cold-living Atlantic cod can recruit bovine brain tubulin dimers into hybrid microtubules in vitro at concentrations and temperatures that are non-permissive for assembly of the mammalian tubulin alone. Furthermore, two of three Atlantic cod β-tubulins (β1 with the M loop substitution A285S and β2 with the Y202F substitution), when expressed in human HepG2 cells, confer partial cold tolerance on hybrid fish/human microtubules in vivo (38Modig C. Wallin M. Olsson P.-E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fields and Somero (39Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) have shown that cold adaptation of lactate dehydrogenase A4 orthologs from Antarctic notothenioids can occur via different, but non-random, substitutions that increase the flexibility of regions adjacent to the active site. Our work suggests that evolutionary adaptation of brain tubulin ensembles for polymerization at psychrophilic temperatures results both from residue substitutions that are common to most α- or β-chains and from other changes that are restricted to one or a few isotypes.Qualitative or quantitative changes in the isotypic compositions of brain tubulins may also contribute to functional adaptation of microtubule assembly. We have shown here (Fig. 4) and elsewhere (3Detrich III, H.W. Fitzgerald T.J. Dinsmore J.H. Marchese-Ragona S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18766-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Billger M. Wallin M. Williams Jr., R.C. Detrich III, H.W. Cell Motil.

Chem. 1987; 262: 8360-8366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that mRNAs and proteins corresponding to the βIIIisotype are minor species in Antarctic fish brain. Bovine brain tubulin depleted of the βIII isotype by immunoaffinity chromatography polymerizes more readily than does unfractionated tubulin (41Banerjee A. Roach M.C. Trcka P. Ludueña R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1794-1799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with an inhibitory effect of αβIII dimers on assembly of the brain tubulin ensemble. Furthermore, microtubules composed of αβIII dimers are considerably more dynamic than microtubules containing other specific β isotypes (42Panda D. Miller H.P. Banerjee A. Ludueña R.F. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11358-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Hence, the paucity of the βIII isotype in the brain tubulins of Antarctic fishes may contribute to the cold-assembling and slowly dynamic phenotype of their microtubule polymers.Cold Adaptation of Microtubule Assembly Via Small Numbers of Primary Sequence Changes to the α- and β-Tubulins: Potential MechanismsWe envision that the residue substitutions present in the α- and β-tubulin subunits of Antarctic fishes predispose the dimer to form microtubules by three potentially synergistic mechanisms. First, the lateral interactions between adjacent protofilaments may be strengthened by the flexibility introduced into the α- and β-tubulin M loops. Nogales et al. (9Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) have proposed that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal parts of the M loops function as hinges that can accommodate variation in microtubule protofilament number. Although not universally present in the α and β monomers of the Antarctic fishes, four of the five substitutions that we have detected at the lateral interfaces of the tubulin dimer (two in α and two in β) occur at or near the potential M loop hinge points. Relaxation of the M loop conformation, particularly in the β-subunit, may enable the β/β lateral interaction to accommodate to the probable hydrolysis-dependent conformational change in H3, thus mitigating its destabilizing effect. It is interesting that many cold-sensitive, charged-to-alanine mutants of yeast α- and β-tubulins map to their respective M loops, H3 helices, and H1-S2 loops, the major contributors to lateral, interprotofilament contact (43Reijo R.A. Cooper E.M. Beagle G.J. Huffaker T.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 44Richards K.L. Anders K.R. Nogales E. Schwartz K. Downing K.H. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1887-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Second, provision of additional hydrophobic interactions at the lateral surface of the α-chain would strengthen interprotofilament interaction at low temperature and explain the greater entropic control of the polymerization of the fish tubulins. The near universal substitution of Leu or Phe for Met at position 302 of the Antarctic fish α-chains may create a pocket of greater hydrophobicity that constrains additional water molecules whose release on subunit association would increase the entropy of polymerization. Similarly, α-tubulins from two psychrophilic algae of the genus Chloromonas contain lateral hydrophobic substitutions (M268V and A295V relative to the α-tubulins of the temperate alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) that are likely to increase the hydrophobicity of their lateral contact surfaces (45Willem S. Srahna M. Devos N. Gerday C. Loppes R. Matagne R.F. Extremophiles. 1999; 3: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Third, the β:Y202F substitution may stabilize the assembly-competent conformation of tubulin. Assuming that structural rearrangement between the amino-terminal and central domains of the β monomer converts the straight, protofilament-forming conformation of the dimer to the curved, depolymerizing state, then the Phe202 substitution at the interface between the two domains may act to resist the conformational change normally induced by nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release. Thus, β:Y202F may function like taxol to stabilize a GTP-like structure that forms strong lateral interactions. Indeed, yeast tubulin, which also contains Phe202, has been observed to polymerize in vitro at temperatures as low as 4 °C. 6A. S. Davis, personal communication. Definitive evaluation of our hypotheses will require the exploitation of a genetically tractable organism in which Antarctic fish tubulins, and site-directed mutants thereof, can be expressed abundantly for in vitro or in vivo analysis of the temperature dependence of microtubule assembly.Convergent Evolution of Tubulin Sequence Alterations in Distantly Related, Cold-living FishThe southern notothenioids and northern gadoids diverged well before the establishment of glacial conditions in their respective polar oceans (25Greenwood P.H. Rosen D.E. Weitzman S.H. Myers G.S. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. 1966; 131: 339-456Google Scholar, 26Eastman J.T. Grande L. Crame J.A. Origins and Evolution of the Antarctic Biota. Geological Society Special Publication 47, London1989: 241-252Google Scholar), and their cold-adapted phenotypes evolved independently during different geologic epochs (46Shackleton N.J. Kennett J.P. Init. Rep. Deep Sea Drilling Project. 1975; 29: 743-755Google Scholar, 47Kennett J.P. Shackleton N.J. Nature. 1976; 260: 513-515Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 48Shackleton N.J. Backman J.

Westberg-Smith J. Nature. 1984; 307: 620-623Crossref Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 49Clarke A. Crame J.A. Crame J.A. Origins and Evolution of the Antarctic Biota. Geographical Society Special Publication 47, London1989: 253-268Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the Antarctic rockcod N. coriicepsand the temperate/cold-living Atlantic cod G. morhua have evolved β-tubulins that share some M loop and internal residue substitutions (Table III), and their microtubules demonstrate similar dynamic properties (6Billger M. Wallin M. Williams Jr., R.C. Detrich III, H.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We propose that the two taxa have converged independently on a comparable evolutionary strategy to preserve microtubule assembly and function at cold temperatures. However, the eurythermal Atlantic cod, unlike the stenothermal notothenioids of the Southern Ocean, must acclimatize to seasonal variations in habitat temperature. One likely adjustment to maintain seasonal homeostasis of microtubule function would be the differential synthesis of β-chain isotypes containing Ser285 and Ala285 (e.g. cod β1 versus β3) and/or Phe202 and Tyr202 (e.g. cod β2 versus β3) under winter and summer conditions, respectively.β-Tubulin Isotypes and Microtubule DynamicsMicrotubules polymerized from the tubulins of chicken erythrocytes or of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like those formed by Antarctic fish brain tubulins, demonstrate slow dynamics in vitro (50Trinczek B. Marx A. Mandelkow E.-M. Murphy D.B. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 51Davis A. Sage C.R. Dougherty C.A. Farrell K.W.

Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Yeast microtubules, for example, display rates of growth and shortening that are approximately a tenth those shown by bovine tubulin (51Davis A. Sage C.R. Dougherty C.A. Farrell K.W. Science. 1994; 264: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 52Sage C.R. Davis A.S. Dougherty C.A. Sullivan K. Farrell K.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Dynamics can be further suppressed in yeast tubulins by a mutation (T107K) introduced into the β-tubulin chain (52Sage C.R. Davis A.S. Dougherty C.A. Sullivan K. Farrell K.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the β-tubulins from Antarctic fish brain, chicken erythrocytes, and yeast cells are quite divergent, their primary sequences share a phenylalanine residue at position 202 in an otherwise conserved context (DET F CIDN). Thus, we propose that the repressed dynamics of the microtubules formed by these tubulins may be caused by a shared β-chain substitution whose effect is to strengthen lateral interactions by resisting conversion of the tubulin dimer to the curved, depolymerizing conformation. The potential importance of lateral interactions in governing dynamic instability has been emphasized in the “lateral cap” scheme (53Martin S.R. Schlistra M.J. Bayley P.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 578-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In that model, which successfully mimics many of the aspects of microtubule dynamics, it is changes in lateral affinity, more than changes in longitudinal interactions, which cause the microtubule to switch between growing and shortening phases.Multifunctionality of Antarctic Fish β-TubulinsThe similarity of most Antarctic fish β-tubulins (excluding NcTbβ4) to the vertebrate class IVb β-chain (Table II) suggests that βIVb may represent an ancestral, multifunctional isotype. This hypothesis is supported further by the presence of the “axonemal” signal sequence EGEFXXX (X = acidic residue (7Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) in each of the non-class III β-chains. Perhaps β-tubulin isotypes, with the exception of class III, had not evolved specialized functions prior to separation of the chordates from other metazoans. Fishes may subsequently have retained multifunctionality of their β-tubulins, whereas more advanced vertebrates and advanced invertebrate taxa evolved β isotypes with distinct cellular functions (reviewed by Ludueña (7Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The capacity of the cytoplasmic tubulins of Antarctic fishes to form microtubules at temperatures as low as −1.8 °C, the freezing point of the seawater habitat of these fish, is remarkable. The critical concentration for polymerization at 0 °C of purified, MAP1-free brain tubulin is ∼0.9 mg/ml (1Williams Jr., R.C. Correia J.J. DeVries A.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2790-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2Detrich III, H.W. Johnson K.A. Marchese-Ragona S.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18766-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which approximates the values observed for mammalian brain tubulins at 37 °C (1Williams Jr., R.C. Correia J.J. DeVries A.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2790-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Herzog W. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1860-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian microtubules, however, the cytoplasmic microtubules of Antarctic fishes are very stable and exhibit slow dynamics at cold temperatures (5Himes R.H. Detrich III, H.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5089-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Billger M. Wallin M. Williams Jr., R.C. Detrich III, H.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Evidently, both the capacity to polymerize at low critical concentration and the slow exchange of tubulin dimers into and out of microtubule polymers are properties intrinsic to the tubulin subunits of these fishes. These unusual functional characteristics must be explicable by structural alterations to the primary sequences and/or by changes in the posttranslational modifications of the tubulin chains that, alone or in concert, modify the quaternary interactions between dimers in a microtubule. Both the longitudinal,intraprotofilament and the lateral,interprotofilament contacts may be subject to structural remodeling, and adaptation might require coordinated changes located in the complementary contact domains of the tubulin chains. Disentangling the contributions of isotype sequence variation and differential posttranslational modification to cold adaptation of microtubule assembly ideally requires comprehensive functional and structural analyses of tubulins that derive from comparable tissues of related cold- and warm-living taxa. Among vertebrates, the notothenioid fishes of the Southern Ocean and mammals experience body temperatures (−1.8 and +37 °C, respectively) that differ by almost 40 °C, and their brains provide abundant quantities of tubulins composed of multiple α and β isotypes (7Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using representative species from these taxonomic groups as models, we compare in this report the dynamics of their microtubules at cold and warm temperatures and determine via cDNA cloning the primary sequence variations that distinguish their tubulin isotypes. By mapping the residue substitutions found commonly in the Antarctic fish isotypes, but rarely in other vertebrates, onto the three-dimensional structures of the tubulin dimer and the microtubule (8Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 9Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), we deduce potential structural interactions that predispose the fish tubulins to form stable, relatively non-dynamic polymers at cold temperatures. Our analysis of the role of posttranslational modification in cold adaptation of microtubule assembly will be presented elsewhere. 2V. Redeker, A. Frankfurter, J. Rossier, S. Parker, and H. W. Detrich, III, manuscript in preparation. 2V. Redeker, A. Frankfurter, J. Rossier, S. Parker, and H. W. Detrich, III, manuscript in preparation. DISCUSSIONMicrotubules assembled from pure brain tubulins of cold-living fishes, unlike those of homeotherms, are stable at temperatures between 0 and 25 °C and exhibit limited dynamic instability (see Refs. 5Himes R.H. Detrich III, H.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5089-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and6Billger M. Wallin M. Williams Jr., R.C. Detrich III, H.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and this report). Slow dynamics must therefore result from structural changes intrinsic to the tubulins of these organisms that modify the quaternary interactions between dimers in a microtubule. To investigate the contribution of tubulin primary sequence variation to the unique functional properties of the microtubules of Antarctic fishes, we have sequenced a total of 11 α- and 5 β-tubulin cDNAs from two representative species of Antarctic notothenioid fishes. We find that these tubulins contain small sets of unusual residue substitutions that map to the lateral, interprotofilament surfaces or to the interiors of the α- and β polypeptides. By contrast, the longitudinal, intraprotofilament interaction surfaces appear not to be altered.Evolution of Tubulin Isotypes to Enable Microtubule Assembly at Low Temperature: All Together Now?The Southern Ocean began to cool approximately 25–40 million years ago and reached its current freezing temperature during the mid-late Miocene (5–14 million years ago (34Kennett J.P. J. Geophys. Res. 1977; 82: 3843-3860Crossref Google Scholar,35Eastman J.T. Antarctic Fish Biology: Evolution in a Unique Environment. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 322Google Scholar)). Subjected to the selective pressure of an increasingly cold thermal environment, the coastal fishes of the Antarctic diverged from temperate fishes (36DeWitt H.H. Bushnell V.C. Antarctic Map Folio Series , Folio 15. American Geographical Society, New York1971: 1-10Google Scholar) and evolved molecular, cellular, and physiological adaptations that maintain metabolic efficiency and preserve macromolecular function in their now chronically cold marine habitat (−1.8 to +1 °C). One may ask whether the primary sequences of each of the many brain α- and/or β-tubulin isotypes of Antarctic fishes need be altered equivalently to ensure that microtubules polymerize efficiently at cold temperatures. Probably not. Wallin and Billger (37Wallin M. Billger M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have shown that brain tubulin or microtubule proteins from the cold-living Atlantic cod can recruit bovine brain tubulin dimers into hybrid microtubules in vitro at concentrations and temperatures that are non-permissive for assembly of the mammalian tubulin alone. Furthermore, two of three Atlantic cod β-tubulins (β1 with the M loop substitution A285S and β2 with the Y202F substitution), when expressed in human HepG2 cells, confer partial cold tolerance on hybrid fish/human microtubules in vivo (38Modig C.

To elucidate the structural mechanisms of DNA binding and selective dimerization of CREB, we determined to 3.0 Å resolution, the structure of the CREB bZIP (residues 283–341) bound to a 21-base pair deoxynucleotide that encompasses the canonical 8-base pair somatostatin cAMP response element (SSCRE). The CREB dimer is stabilized in part by ionic interactions from Arg<sup>314</sup> to Glu<sup>319′</sup>and Glu<sup>328</sup> to Lys<sup>333′</sup> as well as a hydrogen bond network that links the carboxamide side chains of Gln<sup>322′</sup>-Asn<sup>321</sup>-Asn<sup>321′</sup>-Gln<sup>322</sup>. Critical to family selective dimerization are intersubunit hydrogen bonds between basic region residue Tyr<sup>307</sup> and leucine zipper residue Glu<sup>312</sup>, which are conserved in all CREB/CREM/ATF-1 family members. Strikingly, the structure reveals a hexahydrated Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion bound in the cavity between the basic region and SSCRE that makes a water-mediated DNA contact.

https://openalex.org/W2065967387,"We report here that different cell stresses regulate the stability of cyclin D1 protein. Exposition of Granta 519 cells to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and arsenite induced the post-transcriptional down-regulation of cyclin D1.

The activity is also modulated negatively by phosphorylation at specific residues of the CDKs and by the binding of CDK inhibitors (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

Quiescent cells contain low levels of d-type cyclins. After growth factor stimulation, their synthesis is induced, and then cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complexes can be formed during G1 (12Won K.A. Xiong Y.

The maintenance of active cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complexes requires persistent mitogenic signaling, and mitogen withdrawal cancels cyclin D1 synthesis and cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes rapidly dissipate (18Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 turnover is regulated by degradation, mediated by phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue (Thr286) located near the carboxyl terminus. This phosphorylation promotes its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (19Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternative mechanism of cyclin D1 ubiquitination, independent of Thr286 phosphorylation, has been described (20Germain D. Russell A. Thompson A. Hendley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12074-12079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The Thr286 phosphorylation of cyclin D1 is catalyzed by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which is active in quiescent cells, but its activity is strongly decreased during proliferation (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Its inactivation is mediated by site specific phosphorylation by c-Akt (also named protein kinase B), which in turn is controlled by a Ras-activated pathway that includes phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (22Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 23Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Thus, Ras-activated pathways increase cyclin D1 stability by inhibiting GSK3β activity in proliferating cells (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). A variety of stresses induce growth arrest in bacteria and yeast but also in mammalians. Hyperosmolarity causes growth arrest in murine kidney cells, although the mechanisms involved in the proliferation blockade remain unknown (24Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol.

Low level oxidative stress causes a mitotic arrest by selective activation of MAP kinase kinase 3/6 and p38 SAPK stress signaling pathway (26Kurata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23413-23416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that lipopolysaccharide blocks CSF 1-induced cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression and proliferation in macrophages (27Vairo G. Argyriou S. Knight K.R. Hamilton J.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3469-3477PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Royston A.K. Novak U. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23104-23109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cellular MAP kinase modules that are responsible for stress signaling transduction are JNK and p38SAPK families, but their specific implication in the regulation of cell cycle machinery is still poorly understood. The stress-activated serine-threonine kinase p38SAPK2 promotes the transcriptional down-regulation of cyclin D1, thus having opposite effects to those triggered by the Ras-activated pathways (14Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing p38SAPK2 have reduced levels of cyclin D1, whereas blocking p38SAPK2 activity by the specific inhibitor SB203580 enhances cyclin D1 transcription and protein levels (14Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that p38SAPK2negatively regulates the expression of cyclin D1 at the transcriptional level, although it remains to be established whether p38SAPK2 modulates cyclin D1 post-transcriptionally. We report here that different cellular stresses regulate the stability of cyclin D1 protein. Likewise, we demonstrate that, in the case of osmotic shock, this down-regulation is mediated by p38SAPK2and is dependent on proteasome degradation. The effect of p38SAPK2 on cyclin D1 stability might be mediated by direct phosphorylation at specific sites. We found that p38SAPK2phosphorylates cyclin D1 in vitro at Thr286, and this phosphorylation triggers its ubiquitination and targets it for degradation by the proteasome. These results link for the first time a stress-induced MAP kinase pathway to cyclin D1 protein stability, and they will help in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which stress transduction pathways regulate the cell cycle machinery and take control over cell proliferation. Granta 519 cell line was obtained from the German Tissue Bank and was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries) with 10% fetal calf serum under a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Molt-4 lymphoblastoid cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Osmotic shock was performed by the addition of 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm CaCl2, or 50 mmMgCl2 to the culture media. Oxidative stress and arsenite treatment were performed by the addition of 500 μm of H2O2 or sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) (Sigma), respectively, to the culture media. The specific p38SAPK2inhibitors SB203580 and SB220025 (Calbiochem) were used at 40 μm final concentration, and the proteasome inhibitors were used at final concentrations of 100 μm for acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (aLLnL) (Sigma), 10 μm for lactacystin, and 50 μm for MG132. All recombinant proteins were obtained as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Cyclin D1 cDNA was obtained by digesting pET3d-cyclin D1 (29Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B. Beach D.

Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) at the same sites. Cyclin D1 fragments were obtained by subcloning into pGEX-KG the NcoI digestion and theNcoI-HindIII digestion from pGEX-cyclin D1 for cyclin D1-(1–200) and cyclin D1-(201–295) fragments, respectively. For the expression and purification of all these recombinant proteins, the resulting plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain carrying the pLysS plasmid. The expression and purification was performed as described in Ref. 32Neet K. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4908-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar with minor modifications. After purification, all recombinant proteins were resuspended in Kinase Buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2). To activate p38SAPK2 in Molt-4 cells, 0.4 m NaCl was added to the cell culture, and 10 min later cells were harvested and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The activity of p38SAPK2 was determined by Western blotting using a specific phospho-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs 9211S) that recognizes only the phosphorylated form of p38αSAPK2a(phospho-Thr180– Tyr182). Cells were lysed in IP Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 0.1% Triton X-100), containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmglycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4for 30 min on ice. Lysates (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit-anti-p38 antibody that recognizes the N-terminal part of p38αSAPK2a and to a lesser extent p38βSAPK2b (Santa Cruz, SC-728) or 1 μg of rabbit-anti-p38 antibody antibody that recognizes the C-terminal part of p38αSAPK2a (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 06-620) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) (10 μl) was added and the sample incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After that, it was washed three times with IP buffer and one time with Kinase Buffer. The immunoprecipitates were used as a source of active p38SAPK2. The kinase assays were performed in Kinase Buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 30 μmunlabeled ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 μm substrate, and then they proceeded during 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then electrophoresed, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. Similar experiments were performed using purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a, instead of immunoprecipitated kinase. Purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (14-251). In these experiments, 25 ng of GST-p38αSAPK2a active kinase were used and the kinase assay was performed exactly as described above. First, phosphorylation reactions were performed using 200 ng of recombinant active kinase and 2 μg of recombinant GST-cyclin D1 as substrate in Kinase Buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP and performed during 30 min at 37 °C. After stopping the reaction with SDS-sample buffer, the samples were electrophoresed and the proteins transferred to Immobilon membranes. The band corresponding to phosphorylated GST-cyclin D1 was excised and treated with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1.5 h. The samples were then lyophilized, and the hydrolyzed amino acids were resuspended in the presence of 1 mg/ml phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma), which were used as mobility standards. Finally, the samples were subjected to two-dimensional running (1000 V, 80 min, pH 1.9; and 1000 V, 80 min, pH 3.5). The Thr156 → Ala mutant was obtained by two-stage PCR using megaprimers. The first PCR reaction was performed using a 21-mer middle forward oligonucleotide (5′-ggCCgCAATggCCCCgCACgA-3′) carrying the mutation T156A (shown in bold) and a 30-mer reverse terminal oligonucleotide (5′-gAgCTCgAgAATTCAgATgTCCACTCCCg-3′). The second PCR was performed using a 30-mer initial forward oligonucleotide (5′-AACCCgggATCCATggAACACCAgCTCCTg-3′) and the first PCR product (megaprimer of 448 base pairs) as reverse mutated primer. The Thr286 → Ala mutant was obtained by single PCR amplification using a 30-mer initial forward oligonucleotide (5′-AACCCgggATCCATggAACACCAgCTCCTg-3′) and a 50-mer terminal reverse oligonucleotide (5′-gAgCTCgAgTgATCAgATgTCCACgTCCCgCACgTCggTgggTgCgCAAgCC-3′) carrying the mutation T286A (shown in bold). GST-cyclin D1 was phosphorylated with recombinant p38SAPK2 as described above but using cold ATP instead of [γ-32P]ATP. After phosphorylation reaction, 60 μl of reticulocyte cell lysate (Promega) were added to the total volume of reaction as a source of ubiquitin and ubiquitination enzymes. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the recombinant GST-fusion substrates were re-purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. The GST-fusion substrates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the presence of ubiquitinated cyclin D1 forms was analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz, SC-138) and an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Sigma U-5379). To study whether cellular stresses regulate the stability of cyclin D1 protein, the effect of osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and sodium arsenite on cyclin D1 protein levels was analyzed in proliferating Granta 519 cells. This cell line was derived from a case of high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, has a mature B cell immunophenotype, and harbors a translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) (33Jadayel D.M. Lukas J. Nacheva E.

This translocation is one of the most frequent alteration in mantle cell lymphomas and juxtaposes the bcl-1 (cyclin D1) locus to immunoglobulin gene sequences that lead to deregulation of cyclin D1 transcriptional expression (34Ronchetti D. Finelli P. Richelda R. Baldini L. Rocchi M. Viggiano L. Cuneo A. Bogni S. Fabris S. Lombardi L. Maiolo A.T. Neri A. Blood. 1999; 93: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Granta 519 cells overexpress cyclin D1 in a constitutive manner, being a helpful model to analyze the post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1. Osmotic shock (50 mm NaCl, 50 mmCaCl2, or 50 mm MgCl2), oxidative stress (500 μm H2O2), or arsenite (500 μm NaAsO2) induced a down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein levels (Fig. 1). Interestingly, cyclin D1 protein decrease induced by osmotic stresses was higher than those observed by oxidative stress or arsenite. To study whether degradation was implicated in these cyclin D1 protein decreases, three proteasome inhibitors (aLLnL, lactacystin, or MG132) were added to stressed Granta 519 cells. In all cases, the proteasome inhibitors prevented the down-regulation of cyclin D1 and even caused different levels of accumulation of this protein (Fig. 1). The different accumulation might be due to the constitutive transcription of cyclin D1 in these cells and to the different specificity of the inhibitors. Thus, these cellular stresses down-regulate cyclin D1 by increasing its degradation by the proteasome. To analyze the involvement of stress MAP kinase pathways in the down-regulation of cyclin D1, we first determined the activation of p38SAPK2 in Granta 519 cells subjected to all those stress treatments. Results revealed that all the treatments activated p38SAPK2 as determined by Western blotting using an anti-phospho-p38SAPK2 antibody that specifically recognizes the active (dually phosphorylated) form of p38SAPK2 (data not shown). Then, a time-course analysis of cyclin D1 protein levels in Granta 519 cells subjected to osmotic stress (50 mm NaCl) were performed in the presence or in the absence of the specific p38SAPK2 inhibitor SB203580. Results indicated that cyclin D1 decrease was very rapid and that, when cells were pre-incubated with SB203580, this effect was completely reversed (Fig.2). To further demonstrate that this effect was specific for p38SAPK2 activity, another chemically different and more potent p38SAPK2 inhibitor SB220025 was used (35Jackson J.R. Bolognese B. Hillegass L. Kassis S. Adams J. Griswold D.E. Winkler J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 687-692PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wang Z. Canagarajah B.J. Boehm J.C. Kassisa S. Cobb M.H. Young P.R. Abdel-Meguid S. Adams J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 1117-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Results indicated that this inhibitor also reversed cyclin D1 decrease. The addition of the proteasome inhibitor aLLnL to the incubation medium prevented the osmotic shock-derived cyclin D1 decrease. These results indicate that osmotic shock induces a p38SAPK2-dependent cyclin D1 decrease by triggering its proteasomal degradation. Similar experiments performed with the same cells under oxidative stress (500 μm H2O2) or arsenite treatment (500 μm NaAsO2) revealed that SB220025 or SB203580 only produced a very low reversion of cyclin D1 degradation (data not shown). These results indicate that, in these cases, p38SAPK2 protein did not significantly mediate cyclin D1 degradation. Since cyclin D1 stability is regulated by direct phosphorylation at threonine 286 (19Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether p38SAPK2 was able to directly phosphorylate cyclin D1. Thus, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant GST-cyclin D1 as a substrate. Active p38SAPK2 was immunoprecipitated from osmotically shocked Molt-4 lysates by using an antibody that specifically recognizes the N-terminal sequence of p38SAPK2 as described under ”Experimental Procedures.“ The immunoprecipitated p38SAPK2 was active as checked by Western blotting using an anti-phospho-p38SAPK2 antibody that specifically recognizes the active (dually phosphorylated) form of p38SAPK2 (data not shown). In vitro kinase reactions demonstrated that p38SAPK2 efficiently phosphorylated purified GST-cyclin D1 but not purified GST-CDK4, GST-CDK2, GST-cyclin A, or GST (Fig.3 A). Myelin basic protein that was used as a control substrate was also efficiently phosphorylated by p38SAPK2. Similar results were obtained when the immunoprecipitation was performed using another anti-p38SAPK2 antibody raised against a C-terminal sequence (data not shown). To confirm that no other kinase than p38SAPK2 was involved in this phosphorylation, kinase reactions were performed using purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a instead of that obtained by immunoprecipitation. Purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a also phosphorylated GST-cyclin D1 but not GST-CDK4, GST-CDK2, GST-cyclin A, or GST. Under these experimental conditions, cyclin D1 phosphorylation was abolished by the presence of SB203580 (Fig. 3 B). The affinity constant of p38SAPK2 versus cyclin D1 was measured by kinetic analysis. Results showed that theK m was 288 nm (Fig.4). These results indicate that cyclin D1 is a specific substrate for p38SAPK2, and its high affinity, compared with those of p38s to other substrates, suggests that cyclin D1 phosphorylation by this kinase may have physiological relevance (see ”Discussion“).Figure 4Kinetic analysis of cyclin D1 phosphorylation. Kinase assays were performed using p38SAPK2 obtained by IP from Molt-4 cell lysates, in the presence of growing concentrations of GST-cyclin D1 as a substrate. Results are shown as a Lineweaver-Burk representation where activity is represented as arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since p38SAPK2 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, TP or SP motifs were searched in the primary sequence of d-type cyclins. Three putative phosphorylation sites for proline-directed kinases were found in the sequence of cyclin D1. Two of them are threonines (Thr156and Thr286), and the other one is a serine (Ser219). Only one of these three sites (Thr286) is conserved in all d-type cyclins. The Thr156 site is conserved in both cyclin D1 and cyclin D2, whereas the Ser219 site is only present in cyclin D1. To analyze whether these sites may be phosphorylated by p38SAPK2 kinase assays were performed using two cyclin D1-excluding fragments. One of the fragments, cyclin D1-(1–200), contained one of the three putative phosphorylation sites (Thr156) whereas the other fragment, cyclin D1-(201–295), contained the other two putative sites (Ser219 and Thr286). Kinase reactions performed in vitrodemonstrated that both the immunoprecipitated p38SAPK2 from Molt4 lysates and the purified active GST-p38αSAPK2aefficiently phosphorylated both cyclin D1 fragments (Fig.5). These results indicate that both cyclin D1 fragments contain at least one phosphorylation site for p38SAPK2. Cyclin D1 amino acid residues phosphorylated by p38SAPK2were determined by phosphoamino acid analysis. GST-cyclin D1 was phosphorylated by the purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a and subjected to acid hydrolysis. The amino acids were then recovered and subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. Results revealed that threonine was highly phosphorylated, whereas only slight phosphorylation of serine was observed (Fig.6). These results suggested that Thr156 and Thr286 are good phosphorylation site candidates. To confirm this possibility, these two threonines were mutated to alanines. Then, we expressed the two fragments of cyclin D1 containing the mentioned mutations (cyclin D1-(1–200)-T156A and cyclin D1-(201–295)-T286A) and in vitro kinase assays were performed. These kinase reactions revealed that both the immunoprecipitated p38SAPK2 from Molt4 lysates and the purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a efficiently phosphorylated the wild type cyclin D1 fragments but not the mutated fragments (Fig.7). These results clearly confirm that the sites of p38SAPK2 phosphorylation were both Thr156 and Thr286.Figure 7In vitro phosphorylation of mutated fragments of cyclin D1 by p38SAPK2. Kinase assays were performed using p38SAPK2 obtained by IP of Molt-4 cell lysates (A) or purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a (B). A, IPs were performed using a polyclonal anti-p38SAPK2 antibody (α-p38) or a normal rabbit serum (NRS) as a control. GST-cyclin D1, GST-cyclin D1-(1–200), GST-cyclin D1-(1–200)T156A, GST-cyclin D1-(201–295), or GST-cyclin D1-(201–295)T286A were used as substrates as indicated.B, kinase assays using purified GST-p38αSAPK2aas kinase and GST-cyclin D1, GST-cyclin D1-(1–200), GST-cyclin D1-(1–200)T156A, GST-cyclin D1-(201–295), or GST-cyclin D1-(201–295)T286A were used as substrates as indicated. Experiments in the presence of the p38SAPK2 inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) were performed as a control. Note that GST-p38αSAPK2a became autophosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether both sites where phosphorylated by p38SAPK2 in the full-length cyclin D1, we expressed two full-length cyclin D1 forms, one containing an Ala for Thr286 substitution and another one containing these substitution plus an additional Ala for Thr156substitution. Kinase reactions were performed using these two mutated forms of the full-length cyclin D1. Interestingly, results revealed that both the immunoprecipitated p38SAPK2 from Molt4 lysates and the purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a did not phosphorylate neither of the two mutated forms (cyclin D1-T286A and cyclin D1-T156A-T286A) (Fig. 8). Thus, the substitution of Thr286 by Ala completely abolished the phosphorylation by p38SAPK2, indicating that, in the full-length cyclin D1, this is the major site of phosphorylation. Thr156 is not phosphorylated in the full-length cyclin D1, although it is a good phosphorylation site when cyclin D1 is fragmented. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 in Thr286 by GSK3β triggers its ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar, 37Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7362-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed whether phosphorylation of this site by p38SAPK2 also triggers the ubiquitination of cyclin D1. In vitro kinase reactions were performed using the wild type and T286A-mutant forms of cyclin D1 as substrates and the purified active GST-p38αSAPK2a as a source of kinase. Then, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed using the total volume of the kinase assay as a source of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated cyclin D1 and a reticulocyte cell lysate as a source of ubiquitin and ubiquitination enzymes (see “Experimental Procedures”). After that, the presence of ubiquitinated cyclin D1 forms was analyzed by Western blotting and results revealed that the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by p38SAPK2 promotes its ubiquitination (Fig.9). This ubiquitination was abolished when SB203580 was added to the kinase reaction or when the mutated form of cyclin D1 (T286A) was used as substrate. Thus, these data revealed that the specific phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr286 by p38SAPK2 promotes its ubiquitination in vitroand targets it for degradation by the proteasome. The regulation of the levels of d-type cyclins is a critical step for G1 progression. Quiescent cells contain low levels of d-type cyclins, and mitogenic stimuli induce their increase by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Studies on the post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 indicate that its phosphorylation has special relevance on the turnover of the protein. During G1, cyclin D1 turnover is rapid (t 12 ∼20–30 min), whereas that of its catalytic subunit CDK4 is relatively slow (t 12 ∼4 h) (19Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar,21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Dickson C. Peters G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1633-1640PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes exist in a dynamic equilibrium between bound and free cyclin D1 that permits continuous replacement of the cyclin subunit of the complex (38Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). For those reasons, slight changes in cyclin D1 protein levels can rapidly modulate cyclin D1-CDK4/6 activity; thus, the regulation of cyclin D1 protein stability is a crucial step for G1 progression. Cyclin D1 degradation is regulated by GSK3β, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue (Thr286), and this triggers its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The low levels of cyclin D1 in quiescent cells are due to the low rate of synthesis and to the high instability of the protein. This instability is probably due to the high activity of GSK3β in cells deprived of growth factors (40Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Mitogenic stimuli induce Ras-dependent signaling pathways that increase cyclin D1 transcription and also down-regulate GSK3β preventing cyclin D1 phosphorylation and degradation. These two mechanisms give a precise and fast control of the total amount of cyclin D1 protein that correlates with cyclin D1-CDK4/6 kinase activity in the cell. Results reported here revealed that different cellular stresses regulate cyclin D1 stability in vivo. For these studies proliferating Granta 519 cells were used because they have an abnormal constitutive expression of cyclin D1. This characteristic makes this cell line very useful to analyze the post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1. Osmotic shock and, to a lesser extent, oxidative stress or arsenite down-regulated cyclin D1 total protein levels in these cells. This effect was due to the increase of cyclin D1 degradation by proteasome, because the addition of different proteasome-specific inhibitors blocked cyclin D1 decrease. Although all these different stresses induced the activation of p38SAPK2, only in the case of osmotic stress was the down-regulation of cyclin D1 clearly mediated by this kinase. This differential response might be due to the fact that the different stresses can activate distinct additional signaling pathways, which can differentially participate in the modulation of cyclin D1 degradation. Thus, it has been reported that oxidative stress also induced the protein kinase B, ERK, and JNK pathways (41Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 42Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 43Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that arsenite activates ERK and JNK pathways in addition to p38SAPK2 (44Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A possible involvement of these different pathways might explain why cyclin D1 degradation was not reversed by p38SAPK2 inhibitors in these cases. Alternatively, the participation of SB203580-insensitive isoforms of p38 (p38δ or/and p38γ) might also explain the lack of reversion by these inhibitors. p38SAPK2 is a member of the MAP kinase family that is activated by environmental stresses such as osmotic shock and oxidative stress, but also by different agents as arsenite, pro-inflammatory cytokines or UV light (45Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). p38SAPK2 phosphorylates different protein substrates as GADD153 (46Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), transcription factors such as ATF2 (47Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), and protein kinases as MAP kinase-activated protein kinases 2 and 3 (48Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S.

Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8488-8492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Taking together previous reports and results reported here, it appears that p38SAPK2 may be a dual regulator of cyclin D1 levels, because it inhibits cyclin D1 transcription (14Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), and it triggers cyclin D1 degradation in cells under osmotic stress. Thus, p38SAPK2 regulates cyclin D1 transcription and degradation in the opposite way to Ras during proliferation. These results suggest that stress activated pathways may counteract the effects of mitogen-induced pathways as has been described in Ref. 51Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3857-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. In fact it is known that a variety of stresses induce growth arrest in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells. For instance, osmotic stress blocks proliferation in murine kidney cells (24Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Kultz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13645-13651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and lipopolysacharide blocks CSF 1-stimulated macrophage proliferation (27Vairo G. Argyriou S. Knight K.R. Hamilton J.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3469-3477PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Royston A.K. Novak U. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23104-23109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistent with this anti-mitogenic action, lipopolysaccharide inhibits CSF 1-induced cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression and pRB phosphorylation (52Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,53Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe E.J.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic stress and lipopolysaccharide are potent activators of p38 family members. Thus, it is possible that cell cycle arrest in both cases could be mediated by cyclin D1 degradation induced by p38SAPK2. We have demonstrated that p38SAPK2 phosphorylates cyclin D1in vitro by using enzymes obtained from two different sources. On one hand p38SAPK2 was obtained by immunoprecipitation of Molt4 cell extracts using specific anti-p38SAPK2 antibodies. On the other hand, a recombinant purified kinase was used. In both cases a high affinity cyclin D1 phosphorylation (K m 288 nm) was observed. This affinity constant was much lower than those reported for other p38SAPK2 protein and peptide substrates (ranging from 6.2 to 840 μm) (54LoGrasso P.V. Frantz B. Rolando A.M. O'Keefe S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 phosphorylation by p38SAPK2 occurs specifically at Thr286 as indicated by the fact that a mutant cyclin D1 Thr286 → Ala is not phosphorylated by p38SAPK2. Interestingly, other members of the MAP kinase family including JNK and ERK2 are not able to phosphorylate cyclin D1 in vitro (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by p38SAPK2 is specific and could have physiological relevance. p38SAPK2 phosphorylation of cyclin D1 triggers its ubiquitination in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Previous reports indicate that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr286 promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (19Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is catalyzed by GSK3β, which triggers in vivo cyclin D1 polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data and results reported here suggest that p38SAPK2 may regulate the stability of cyclin D1 in vivo by phosphorylation at Thr286 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Results obtained from the in vitro kinase assays, using the full-length cyclin D1, indicate that the only phosphorylated site was Thr286. These results are similar to those described in Ref. 21Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar, using GSK3β. However, another amino acid residue (Thr156) was also phosphorylated when the protein was truncated. These results suggest that the Thr156 position is masked in the free full-length form of cyclin D1 but it is accessible when protein is truncated by elimination of the carboxyl-terminal fragment containing the last 95 amino acid residues. Thus, Thr156 seems not to be accessible for p38SAPK2 in the free form of cyclin D1. However, it remains to be explored whether in other physiological conditions, for instance in cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes, this residue can be unmasked and consequently physiologically phosphorylated by p38SAPK2. In summary, results reported here indicate that different types of stresses down-regulate cyclin D1 levels by proteasomal degradation; in the case of osmotic stress, this degradation is mediated by p38SAPK2. The in vitro experimental analysis of cyclin D1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination suggests that this degradation might be induced by direct phosphorylation at Thr286 of cyclin D1 by p38SAPK2. The analysis of the physiological relevance of the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by p38SAPK2 is currently under way in our laboratory."

Its motile cycle consists of a sequential series of interactions between myosin, actin, MgATP, and the products of hydrolysis, where the affinity of myosin for actin is modulated by the nature of the nucleotide bound in the active site. The first step in the contractile cycle occurs when ATP binds to actomyosin and releases myosin from the complex. We report here the structure of the motor domain of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II both in its nucleotide-free state and complexed with MgATP. The structure with MgATP was obtained by soaking the crystals in substrate. These structures reveal that both the apo form and the MgATP complex are very similar to those previously seen with MgATPγS and MgAMP-PNP. Moreover, these structures are similar to that of chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1. The crystallized protein is enzymatically active in solution, indicating that the conformation of myosin observed in chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 is unable to hydrolyze ATP and most likely represents the pre-hydrolysis structure for the myosin head that occurs after release from actin.

This property is provided by a suite of molecular motors that includes, myosin, dyenin, and kinesin in eukaryotes and bacterial flagella motors in prokaryotes. In each molecular motor the energy to drive this process is derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. For all of these motors, it has long been suspected that conformational changes associated with differential affinity of the motor protein for ATP and its hydrolysis products are responsible for energy transduction. After many years of study, it has proved to be difficult to identify the nature of the conformational changes that underlie directed movement, with the exception of myosin. However, even with myosin important questions remain. Myosin is the most abundant and best known molecular motor. Although initially identified in skeletal muscle, isoforms of this protein have been observed in all eukaryotic cells where it fulfills a wide range of cellular functions from muscle contraction, cellular locomotion, and chemotaxis to organelle transport (1Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 2Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Indeed over 15 classes of myosin have now been identified. All of these proteins contain a section of their sequence that can be associated with a motor domain. The catalytic cycle of myosin reveals at first sight a counterintuitive relationship between the chemical step of hydrolysis and the energy transduction process. In myosin the energy transduction step is associated with product release rather than ATP hydrolysis. Kinetics studies have revealed that in the absence of ATP, myosin binds very tightly to actin to form the rigor state. Upon addition of ATP, myosin rapidly changes to a weakly bound state prior to nucleotide hydrolysis. Thereafter ATP is rapidly hydrolyzed, but the hydrolysis products remain tightly bound to myosin. Rebinding to actin catalyzes the release of inorganic phosphate and triggers the start of the powerstroke (3Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 4Dantzig J.A. Goldman Y.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 86: 305-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic and fiber diffraction studies have shown that conformational changes in the myosin motor domain and its attached light chains are intimately involved in the energy transduction step (5Irving M.

A full molecular understanding of this biological process requires a detailed structural view of each of the distinct states of the contractile cycle. The structure of myosin has been determined for four organisms in a range of conformations. These include chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 with sulfate in the active site (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M.

Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and scallop myosin S1 (17Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A question inherent to all of these structures is their relationship to the conformational states that are transitioned through or populated within the contractile cycle. The first structure for myosin subfragment-1 was that of chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 (9Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). This protein was crystallized from ammonium sulfate in the absence of nucleotide and was observed to contain a sulfate ion bound in the P-loop. Because this was the first determined structure, it was unknown where this structure belonged in the catalytic cycle. Initially, it was believed to represent a point after release from actin but prior to formation of the metastable state (18Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However because the overall structure seemed to fit a reasonable model for the actomyosin complex based on image reconstructions it was subsequently ascribed by Holmes (19Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R112-R118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the rigor state. Subsequent studies on a truncated myosin head or motor domain from D. discoideum revealed two conformations, one of which was obtained in the presence of MgADP·BeFx and was similar to that observed in chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 (10Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The other obtained in the presence of MgADP·AlF4 and MgADP·VO4 appeared to represent the conformation of the myosin head in the metastable state (10Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 11Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies on the motor domain and myosin head of smooth muscle myosin demonstrated that the structure of the motor domain observed in the complex with MgADP·AlF4 and MgADP·VO4are representative of the conformation of the myosin head at the start of the powerstroke (16Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Conversely a more recent structure of scallop myosin subfragment-1 complexed with MgADP revealed a similar conformation of the nucleotide binding pocket, but altered its orientation of the light chain binding motif relative to that seen in any of the other structures (17Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus the question still remains as to the relationship between the structure observed in chicken skeletal myosin S1 and the contractile cycle. To address the question of whether the conformation of the motor domain observed in chicken skeletal myosin S1 and Dictyosteliummyosin S1dC·MgADP·BeFx represents the structure in the rigor conformation, we have determined the structure of S1dC both in its apo state and bound to MgATP to high resolution. This establishes that the conformation seen in S1dC·MgADP·BeFx is unable to hydrolyze ATP and most likely represents the initial state (pre-hydrolysis) after release of myosin from actin. It also shows that the protein undergoes very small changes in conformation between the apo and ATP-bound states, which may account for the high binding affinity of myosin for ATP. The truncatedD. discoideum myosin II head fragment, which consists of residues 2–762, was prepared as described previously (10Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) with one exception. To ensure that the final purified S1dC was free of magnesium pyrophosphate (MgPPi) in the active site, 1 mm ATP was used as the final elution buffer instead of MgPPi and was followed by extensive dialysis. Crystals of apoS1dC were grown by microbatch from 8.0% (w/v) PEG-8000, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration in the final droplet was approximately 5.0 mg/ml. The protein/precipitant drops were immediately microseeded by streak-seeding from previous crystallizations and left at 4 °C. Small crystals appeared overnight and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.1 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm3 over a period of 1 week. Crystals of the S1dC·MgATP complex were prepared by transferring single crystals of apo·S1dC to a solution containing 15% PEG-8000, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The crystals were stored in this solution for 10 min at 4 °C prior to initiating the rapid cooling process. S1dC crystallizes in the space group P21212 with final unit cell dimensions of a = 103.5 Å, b = 179.7 Å, c = 54.1 Å (apoS1dC) and a = 104.1 Å, b = 180.4 Å, c = 54.2 Å (MgATP complex). High resolution x-ray data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 7–1 with a MAR 30-cm imaging plate detector. Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred stepwise into a cryoprotectant solution containing 15% PEG-8000, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 25% ethylene glycol, and 300 mm NaCl. The crystals were allowed to stand in this solution for 5 min at which point they were removed to a fresh droplet of cryoprotectant. This procedure was repeated three times to assure no traces of mother liquor remained. The crystals were then picked up in a loop of surgical suture and flash frozen in a stream of cold nitrogen gas (20Rodgers D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 183-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The similar protocol was used to freeze the crystals of the S1dC·MgATP complex, except that MgATP was included in every solution. The crystals spent a minimum of 25 min in contact with solutions of MgATP prior to the final step of rapid cooling. Intensity data were processed and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Refinement was carried out with TNT (22Tronrud D.E.

(1991) Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory, Vol. 86, Silicon Graphics.Google Scholar). At this point Mg(OH2)ATP could be clearly seen in the Fo-Fc electron density map for the ATP complex and was included in the model. For both structures, solvent molecules were added with the PEKPIK program of the TNT package (22Tronrud D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in locations where clear density and geometry consistent with a water molecule were observed. Additional cycles of conjugate gradient least squares were preformed with TNT until convergence was achieved. The quality of the models were assessed with PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W.

Open table in a new tab The three-dimensional structures of the S1dC myosin head fromDictyostelium in its apo state and complexed with MgATP were determined to 2.1 and 2.15 Å resolution, respectively. Models contain a total of 743 and 738 amino acid residues of a total of 761 for the apo and MgATP complex, respectively. The electron density for the apo structure is well defined except for three short gaps, Arg203–Gly207, Ile500–Phe503, and Lys623–Asn626. In addition, 20 amino acid residue side chains were disordered and built as alanines (Table II). For apoS1dC, 90.6 and 9.2% of the conformational angles for the mainchain atoms lie in the most favored and additionally favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. One residue, Thr274, lies outside these regions. Likewise the electron density for the S1dC·MgATP complex is well defined. There are three short gaps in the structure; Arg202–Gly207, Asn500–Leu508, Lys623–Phe627. In addition, 18 amino acid residue side chains were disordered and built as alanines (Table II). In the S1dC·MgATP complex, 90.3 and 9.6% of the residues exhibit conformational angles that lie in the most favored and additionally favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. Again, Thr274 lies outside these regions. The electron density surrounding this residue in both complexes is well defined so there is no obvious reason for its unusual angles. Although the structure of S1dC·MgATP was determined subsequent to that of apoS1dC, this structure is described first because of its relationship to the previously determined nucleotide complexes. As anticipated, MgATP binds in the nucleotide binding pocket defined by the P-loop and the surrounding secondary structural elements (Fig. 1). The electron density for MgATP is well defined (Fig. 2 a). Examination of the electron density values associated with the γ-phosphate and the temperature factors relative to the other atoms of the nucleotide suggests that exceedingly little hydrolysis has occurred. The structure is very similar to that of S1dC·MgATPγS and S1dC·MgAMP-PNP. The r.m.s. difference between 694 structurally equivalent α-carbons of S1dC·MgATP and S1dC·MgATPγS complexes is 0.21 Å whereas for 718 structurally equivalent α-carbons in S1dC·MgAMP-PNP the r.m.s. difference is 0.16 Å. The coordination of the nucleotides in the binding pocket is remarkably similar (Fig. 3).Figure 3Stereoverlap of the triphosphate-like moiety of MgATP (black), MgATPγS (dark blue), MgAMP-PNP (green), and MgADP·BeF x (red). The coordinates of each of these complexes were superimposed with the program ALIGN (25Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar) modified at the University of Wisconsin by Gary Wesenberg to allow selection of the segments used for alignment (available on request). The alignment was based on the α-carbons surrounding the nucleotide and consisted of residues 174–184, 235–245, and 450–455.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Careful examination of the hydrogen bonding pattern surrounding the γ-phosphate in the complexes with MgATP and MgAMP-PNP reveals that there are essentially no differences in the way that the phosphate interacts with the protein. Likewise, apart from the presence of a sulfur atom in MgATPγS, the coordination of the other oxygen atoms is identical to that of MgATP. Most of the water molecules observed in the γ-phosphate binding pocket are common to all these complexes. This raises the question of why MgATP binds so much more tightly to the active site of myosin relative to the commonly used non-hydrolyzable analogs. Thus far a total of three analogs that closely mimic ATP have been observed bound to Dictyostelium S1dC; these include MgATPγS, MgAMP-PNP, and MgADP·BeFx. Each of these share much in common with MgATP but differs in an important way from the true substrate such that the binding affinity or ability to be hydrolyzed is compromised. In the case of MgAMP-PNP the γ-phosphorous and its three non-bridging oxygen atoms overlap the equivalent atoms of MgATP remarkably well. The difference for MgAMP-PNP arises from the bridging nitrogen between β- and γ-phosphate moieties. This induces the amido side chain of Asn233 to rotate to accept a hydrogen bond from the proton on the bridging nitrogen (14Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the hydrogen bonding network surrounding the nucleotide is perturbed which accounts for the reduction in its binding affinity for myosin by a factor of at least 106 relative to ATP (27Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MgATPγS is broadly considered to be the best analog of MgATP; however, in the case of myosin this compound is slowly hydrolyzed. Even so, MgATPγS binds very tightly to myosin and induces a state where myosin binds weakly to actin. The rate of hydrolysis of MgATPγS is comparable with the steady rate of hydrolysis of ATP (28Goody R.S. Mannherz H.G. Sund H. Blauer G. Protein-Ligand Interactions. de Gruyter, Berlin1975: 109-127Crossref Google Scholar, 29Resetar A.M. Chalovich J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16039-16045Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but is considerably slower than the actin-activated rate. The rate of hydrolysis of MgATPγS is not enhanced by actin (28Goody R.S. Mannherz H.G. Sund H. Blauer G. Protein-Ligand Interactions. de Gruyter, Berlin1975: 109-127Crossref Google Scholar, 29Resetar A.M. Chalovich J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16039-16045Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which suggests that the metastable state is not attained for ATPγS and that the rate-limiting step for hydrolysis of this nucleotide is bond cleavage rather than product release as for ATP. Comparison of the structures of S1dC·MgATP and S1dC·MgATPγS reveals that all of the atoms of these nucleotides superimpose exceedingly well and only differ for the terminal sulfur atom on ATPγS (Fig. 3). Interestingly the oxygen of ATP that falls in the same location as the sulfur atom of ATPγS forms an ionic interaction with Nζ of Lys185 and hydrogen bonds to two solvent molecules. A similar ionic interaction is formed by Sγ of ATPγS; however, as might be expected there are no well defined hydrogen bonds to solvent molecules. In both cases, the oxygen of ATP and sulfur of ATPγS face toward the apex of the cleft that splits the 50-kDa region of the myosin heavy chain, which may account for the small penalty in reduced binding affinity by the replacement of an oxygen by a sulfur. Structural comparison of MgATP to MgADP·BeFx is more complex because of the ill defined nature of the exact metallo-hydroxyfluoride species bound in the active site (30Henry G.D. Maruta S. Ikebe M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10451-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the positions of the fluorines or hydroxyl groups are very close to those of the terminal oxygens of ATP. This confirms that MgADP·BeFx is a good structural analog of MgATP in that it serves to trap myosin in a conformation induced by the true substrate. Biochemical evidence suggests that MgADP·BeFxis more closely related to the pre-hydrolysis complex with ATP than the metastable state (31Ponomarev M.A. Timofeev V.P. Levitsky D.I. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Phan B.C. Cheung P. Stafford W.F. Reisler E. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 59: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Park S. Ajtai K. Burghardt T.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3368-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Formation of the MgADP·BeFxcomplex is sufficient to lower the binding affinity of myosin for actin (34Rostkova E.V. Moiseeva L.N. Teplova M.V. Nikolaeva O.P. Levitsky D.I. Biochemistry ( Mosc ). 1999; 64: 875-882PubMed Google Scholar). However, the complex with beryllium fluoride differs from the true substrate in that it is unable to induce the metastable state of myosin in solution and hence cannot drive the contractile cycle. Even so, it is a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity in solution, which suggests that there is a small conformational difference in free energy of the protein between the structure of myosin in solution and that bound to MgATP. This is confirmed by the structure of apoS1dC described below. Remarkably, the structure of apoS1dC is very similar to that of S1dC when co-crystallized with a variety of nucleotide analogs that mimic ATP. The r.m.s. difference between apoS1dC and S1dC·MgATPγS and S1dC·MgADP·BeFx is 0.31 and 0.53 Å, respectively for 729 and 734 structurally equivalent α-carbons. Similarly, binding of MgATP to crystalline apoS1dC does not induce any major conformational changes as indicated by the r.m.s. difference between 725 α-carbons of 0.28 Å. The structure of apoS1dC is also very similar to that of chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 where the r.m.s. difference between 603 structurally equivalent α-carbons is 1.13 Å. In addition to the similarity of the overall folds of the apo and ATP structures, the orientation of the ligands that coordinate the nucleotide are also remarkably similar. The only small changes are rotation of the side chains associated with the metal binding pocket in the nucleotide complexes, including Thr186, Ser237, and Lys241 (Fig. 4). There are also small movements of the side chains that interact with the adenine ring. Of these, only the movement of Ser237 and Thr186 are significant and even these simply reflect rearrangements to accommodate the absence of a metal ion and allow new interactions with the solvent molecules. The other small differences in the orientation of ligands that surround the nucleotide binding pocket are similar to those seen between the other complexes determined to date. The nucleotide binding pocket is occupied by more than 11 solvent molecules (Figs. 2 b and 4). Interestingly the constellation of ordered water molecules approximate the hydrogen bonding potential of ATP. For example, there is a water molecule located at the approximate location of each phosphate, the ribose ring oxygen, and also at the N1, N7 and N10 positions of the purine ring. Outside the water molecules that take up the space otherwise occupied by the nucleotide, the solvent structure in the nucleotide binding pocket is very similar to that seen in the S1dC complexes MgATP, MgATPγS, and other analogs. This again emphasizes the role that the water structure plays in coordination of ATP as noted previously in the study of the interaction of non-nucleotide analogs with myosin (15Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Pate E. Yount R.G. Rayment I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 398-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The remarkable similarity between the active site in the presence and absence of ATP accounts for, in part, the very high binding affinity of myosin for ATP. It is clear that very little of the binding energy of myosin for ATP is devoted toward changing the conformation of the protein. Even the water structure is conserved in the apo structure. Conservation of the protein and water structure would appear to reduce the entropic cost of coordinating the substrate in the active site. The structures of apoS1dC and S1dC·MgATP reveal two important pieces of information about myosin. First, the overall structure of apoS1dC is very similar to those obtained by co-crystallizing the protein in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP and second, when myosin is in this conformation it does not hydrolyze MgATP. Whereas the close similarity between the apo and nucleotide-bound states explains the high binding affinity of myosin for MgATP it comes as a surprise that MgATP is stable within the crystal lattice. This is a critical observation because in solution, the protein is fully active and would be expected to turn over the nucleotide within the time frame of the experiment (35Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima T. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Google Scholar, 36Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation is that the conformation observed here is unable to hydrolyze MgATP. This hypothesis was proposed previously on the basis of the studies with S1dC·MgATPγS, which when co-crystallized with the nucleotide analog showed no evidence of hydrolysis (14Gulick A.M. Bauer C.B. Thoden J.B. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the latter case it could have still been argued that MgATPγS does not have the correct hydrogen bonding pattern around the γ-phosphate and might not bind in a conformation induced by MgATP. This argument cannot be applied to the present structure. The conclusion appears to be that the conformation observed in the S1dC·MgATP complex and also in chicken skeletal myosin subfragment-1 is one of the pre-hydrolysis states available to myosin in solution. Evidence for additional states in solution are provided by the structure of scallop myosin that shows a different orientation of the converter domain even though the conformation around the γ-phosphate binding pocket is very similar (17Houdusse A.

These diseases may arise sporadically, may be inherited, or may be acquired by transmission of an infectious agent (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

According to the “protein only” hypothesis (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5131) Google Scholar, 2Horiuchi M. Caughey B.

Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar), the key event in the pathogenesis of prion disorders is the conversion of a normal prion protein, PrPC, into a pathogenic (scrapie) form, PrPSc. The latter protein accumulates in the diseased brain and is believed to be the sole component of the infectious prion pathogen. The transition between PrPC and PrPScoccurs post-translationally without any detectable covalent modifications to the protein molecule (4Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The two protein isoforms have profoundly different physicochemical properties. PrPCis highly soluble and easily degraded by proteinase K, whereas PrPSc exists as an insoluble aggregate that is resistant to proteinase K digestion and often has the characteristics of an amyloid (5Meyer R.K.

These differences in physical properties most likely reflect different conformations of the two isoforms. Indeed, spectroscopic data show that PrPC is highly α-helical, whereas PrPSc contains a large proportion of β-sheet structure (7Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I.

Another argument in favor of this hypothesis is the link between hereditary human spongiform encephalopathies (i.e. familial CJD, GSS, and FFI) and specific mutations in the gene coding for the human prion protein (1Prusiner S.B.

A key to understanding the mechanism by which familial mutations facilitate the pathogenic process is to determine how these mutations affect the conformational structure of prion protein. In the present study, we report the three-dimensional structure of the folded domain of the recombinant human prion protein containing a mutation (E200K) corresponding to the most common familial form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The E200K mutant was constructed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers 5′-GAACTTCACCAAGACCGACGTTAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTAACGTCGGTCTTGGTGAAGTTC-3′. The template DNA was the pRSETB vector with the cDNA corresponding to the wild-type huPrP-(90–231) inserted into the multiple cloning site as described previously (13Morillas M. Swietnicki W.

To obtain15N-/13C-labeled protein, bacteria were grown in a minimum medium containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/l) and 13C6-glucose (2 g/l) as a sole source of nitrogen and carbon, respectively. Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared at a protein concentration of 0.7–0.9 mm in 10 mm d 4-sodium acetate buffer containing 0.005% sodium azide and 10% (v/v) D2O, pH 4.6. Most NMR measurements were performed at 26 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance gradient probe.

Multiple signals were observed for several other residues in the flexible tail, but these signals likely result from cis forms of three Xxx-Pro peptide bonds present in this region (Fig. 1). The solution structure was calculated for the C-terminal domain 125–231 of the mutant protein. This domain consists of three α-helices that encompass residues 144–153 (helix 1), 172–194 (helix 2), and 200–227 (helix 3) and a short β-sheet formed by two strands at residues 129–131 and 161–163 (Fig. 2). A hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Met134 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asn159 suggests the presence of an irregular, β-bulge-type elongation of the second strand.Figure 2The three-dimensional structure of the folded domain (residues 125–228) in E200K huPrP. a, the ensemble of 30 energy-minimized conformers. b, Richardson representation of a representative structure (<SAr>).

Protein regions that encompass regular secondary structure elements display very high definition (r.m.s. deviations <0.4 Å). Loops are also well defined with r.m.s. deviations of 0.4–0.7 Å. The only undefined region in the folded domain is the loop connecting the second β-strand and helix 2 (residues 167–171). This loop is characterized by the absence of long- and medium-range NOEs. Further, the fact that some resonances in this region (such as the amide protons of Tyr169 and Ser170) could not be observed suggests the presence of multiple conformations, similar to the behavior of this region in the wild-type human prion protein (21Zahn R.

Open table in a new tab The amide exchange (proton to deuterium) experiments established that most of the residues located within regions of well defined secondary structure are solvent-shielded. The amide proton exchange protection factors for these residues are very similar to those reported for the wild-type human PrP (21Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). However, some parts of helices show surprisingly little protection from the exchange. In particular, the C-terminal portions of helix 2 (residues 187–194) and helix 3 (residues 222–227) undergo essentially complete isotope exchange within less than 30 min, suggesting relatively large conformational flexibility in these regions. A similar finding was reported for the wild-type human PrP (21Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Overall, the 3D structure of the folded domain of E200K huPrP appears to be essentially identical to the structure previously reported for wild-type human prion protein (21Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The boundaries between the secondary structure elements in these structures differ by one residue at most. The backbone r.m.s. differences are smaller than 2 Å for the entire folded domains and less than 1.5 Å for the non-loop regions. Slight differences seen among the structures (Fig. 3 a) are limited to loop 167–171, the first three residues in the loop connecting strand 1 and helix 1, and the C terminus of helix 2. However, factors such as flexibility and conformational averaging (see above) limit the accuracy of structural data for these regions in both the wild-type and mutant prion protein. Residue 200 is located at the beginning of helix 3 and is fully accessible to the solvent (Fig. 3 b). It is remarkable that the local structures of the wild-type and mutant protein in the vicinity of this residue are very similar. The only observable difference is the loss of salt-bridge interaction between the side chains of Glu200 and Lys204. In the wild-type protein, these side chains are intimately juxtaposed (within 5 Å) and therefore could be involved in a salt bridge (Fig. 3 c). In the mutant protein, the nearest negatively charged side chain to Lys200 is that of Asp196. However, these two side chains are 13 Å apart and thus too far for salt-bridge formation. Despite the essentially identical three-dimensional structure of the wild-type and mutant prion PrP, the Glu200 → Lys substitution has a major effect on the distribution of charges on the protein surface. At neutral pH values, the wild-type protein surface around Glu200 is characterized by largely negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 4). The E200K mutation breaks the relatively uniform distribution of charges, introducing patches of positive potential. The effect is even more dramatic under mildly acidic conditions (pH around 5) that lead to the protonation of His residues. Under such conditions, the surface around residue 200 in the wild-type protein contains patches of both negative and positive electrostatic potential, whereas the mutant protein surface is predominantly positively charged (Fig. 4). It is believed that transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by a conversion of cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a conformationally altered form, PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5131) Google Scholar, 2Horiuchi M. Caughey B.

Of special interest are familial (hereditary) forms of the disease that are associated with specific mutations in the PrP gene. Because the PrPC → PrPSc conversion in hereditary diseases appears to occur spontaneously (i.e. not requiring infection with exogenous PrPSc), understanding how familial mutations affect the conformational structure and biophysical properties of prion protein should provide important clues regarding the molecular basis of the disease. It has been previously postulated that these mutations may facilitate the conversion reaction by destabilizing the native structure of PrPC (26Huang Z. Gabriel J.M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, recent biophysical studies showed that many of disease-associated mutations have essentially no effect on the thermodynamic stability of the recombinant PrP, suggesting that not all hereditary prion disorders can be rationalized through a common mechanism based on thermodynamic destabilization of the cellular prion protein (28Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the structural basis of hereditary transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, here we have determined the solution structure of the prion protein containing a Glu200 → Lys mutation that is associated with the familial form of CJD. Although Glu200 → Lys substitution has very little effect on the thermodynamic stability of prion protein (28Swietnicki W. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31048-31052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 29Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), numerous observations argue for a causative role of this mutation in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In particular, carriers of Glu200 → Lys mutation who live sufficiently long appear to invariably develop CJD and the resulting neuronal degeneration (30Chapman J. Ben-Israel J. Goldhammer Y. Korczyn A.D. Neurology. 1994; 44: 1683-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A striking result of the present study is the finding that the three-dimensional structure of the E200K variant is essentially identical to that previously reported for the wild-type prion protein. The only major consequence of the Glu200 → Lys substitution appears to be the redistribution of surface charges, resulting in a dramatically altered electrostatic potential in the mutant protein. The above surface-restricted changes are unlikely to affect the folding pattern or conformational transitions of an isolated protein molecule. Such changes could, however, have a profound effect on the ability of PrPC to interact with other molecules present in a complex cellular environment. In particular, mutation-dependent surface effects could facilitate the conversion reaction by inducing abnormal interactions of E200K PrPC with Protein X or other chaperones implicated in the pathogenesis of prion disorders (31Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10069-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 32DebBurman S.K. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13938-13943Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The Glu200 → Lys replacement could also contribute to the pathogenic process by interfering with normal membrane interactions of PrPC. The latter possibility is especially likely in view of recent data indicating that the stability and conformational transitions of prion protein are strongly affected by electrostatic interactions with cellular membranes (13Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The presence of additional positively charged patches in the E200K variant could further promote these interactions, placing the protein in an environment that is especially conducive to the transition into the pathogenic PrPSc conformation. Regardless of the specific mechanism, the present data strongly suggest that mutation-dependent surface effects that may lead to abnormalities in cellular interactions of prion protein should be considered key determinants of a spontaneous PrPC → PrPSc conversion in the E200K form of familial CJD.

With hydrolysis of ATP, the SR actively accumulates Ca2+ into its lumen leading to muscle relaxation. Depolarization of the transverse tubule membrane results in the release of Ca2+from the SR and muscle contraction. The Ca2+ release protein is pharmacologically characterized by its ability to bind the plant alkaloid ryanodine with high affinity and high specificity, and hence this protein is now known as the ryanodine receptor (RyR). [3H]ryanodine has been used to identify the Ca2+ release protein and is important in characterizing this receptor (1Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar). It has been repeatedly demonstrated that reagents that open the Ca2+ release channel, increase equilibrium binding of ryanodine. The binding of ryanodine has become a functional probe to characterize the open versus closed state of the Ca2+ release mechanism. Recently, a great deal of attention has focused on understanding the sensitivity of the Ca2+ release mechanism to cellular redox changes (3Morad M. Suzuki Y, J. Okabe E. Antioxidant and Redox Signaling, Forum on Redox Control of SR. 2. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Larchmont, NY2000: 1-71Google Scholar). It is well established that oxidation of critical thiol groups activates the Ca2+ release mechanism, whereas addition of thiol reducing agents close down the Ca2+channel (4Trimm J. Salama G.

Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). It is clear from the above studies that redox reactions may play a critical role in controlling the kinetics of the Ca2+ release mechanism. Furthermore, from experiments carried out with a fluorescent maleimide, it has been shown that the reactivity of these hyperreactive thiols is very sensitive to the concentration of Ca2+channel modulators such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and caffeine (15Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). The redox potential within the cell is controlled by the concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), NAD+, and NADH. Zable et al. (16Zable A.C. Favero T.G. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have shown that GSH inhibits Ca2+ channel activity and equilibrium ryanodine binding, whereas GSSG stimulates the activity of the receptor. This suggests that changes in the cellular redox potential may influence the degree of activation of the Ca2+ release mechanism and effect the myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and the contractile state of muscle. Instead of using the more traditional method of measuring equilibrium ryanodine binding, in this study a model was developed in which the rate of ryanodine binding was related to the redox state of the receptor. For the first time, hyperreactive sulfhydryl groups associated with the Ca2+ release mechanism from skeletal muscle SR were shown to have a well defined redox potential, and this redox potential was controlled by physiologically relevant Ca2+ channel activators and inhibitors. Although it is unlikely that the redox state of these thiols controls excitation-contraction coupling, our results suggest that during oxidative stress, these hyperreactive thiols oxidize and activate the SR Ca2+ release mechanism and alter the Ca2+sensitivity of the release channel. Under mild oxidative stress, relatively small changes in the cellular redox potential can contribute to significant stimulation of the ryanodine receptor. SR vesicles were isolated from rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle by the method of MacLennan (17MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4508-4518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with small modifications. 50 μm dithiothreitol and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin were included in all buffers except for the final SR resuspension buffer. Samples were stored in liquid N2. The initial rate of [3H]ryanodine binding was determined from time-dependent measurements at 3, 6, 9, and 12 min at 37 °C. SR was pretreated with 0.1–0.3 mm GSH for 10 min at room temperature in binding buffer containing 250 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 20 mm Pipes, pH 7.1. The time-dependent reaction was initiated by addition of 4 nm [3H]ryanodine, Ca2+ (buffered with EGTA), and various concentrations of GSSG and GSH to yield the desired solution redox potential calculated from Equation 7. For Ca2+-dependent measurements, Ca2+was buffered with 50 μm EGTA to a free Ca2+concentration as calculated by WinMaxc (18Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Methods in Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The binding reaction was quenched by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters mounted on a 48-well Brandel Cell Harvester. Filters were rinsed twice with binding buffer containing 50 μm Ca2+. Scintillation vials were filled with scintillation fluid, shaken overnight, and counted the following day. The initial binding rate was calculated from a linear regression fit of 4 time-dependent measurements of bound ryanodine. The derived slope is the initial rate of ryanodine binding. Subtraction of nonspecific binding does not affect the rate of binding, and therefore no subtraction was made. SR was labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) using a method similar to that of Liu et al. (15Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). SR at 0.1 mg/ml was incubated in standard ryanodine binding buffer (without ryanodine) containing 1.0 mm CaCl2 and 20 nmCPM at room temperature with rigorous stirring for 3 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of EGTA and 0.1–0.3 mm GSH, and samples were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Ca2+-dependent binding of ryanodine was fit to a Hill equation of the form,B′=Bmax′[Ca] nHKd+[Ca] nHEquation 1 where B′ is the initial rate of ryanodine binding (pmol/mg/min), B′max is the maximum rate of binding, K d is the apparent affinity for Ca2+ of the receptor, and n H is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the degree of cooperativity for Ca2+ activation of receptor binding. Data were fit using a nonlinear regression curve fitting routine (Sigma Plot for Windows-version 5.0). EC50 = (K d)1/nH. CPM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The redox potential of the SR sulfhydryl groups that control ryanodine binding was determined by measuring the rate of [3H]ryanodine binding versus the redox potential of the aqueous environment. As shown in Fig.1 A, the amount of binding increased linearly with time over the first 12 min of exposure to [3H]ryanodine. Also, the initial rate of ryanodine binding increased as the solution redox potential became more positive (more oxidizing). Although only four traces are shown in Fig.1 A, in a typical redox titration the initial rate of ryanodine binding was measured at twelve different redox potentials. To determine the redox potential of receptor thiols, the rate of ryanodine binding was measured as a function of the solution redox potential. To fit these data, a simple model is proposed in which two rate constants, k + andk +′, describe the rate of ryanodine binding to the reduced receptor, R red and the oxidized receptor, R ox, respectively. As the solution redox potential becomes more positive, the fraction of receptors in the oxidized state increases and the initial rate of ryanodine bindingB′ increases according to Equation 2.B′=dB/dtinitial=k+(Ry)(Rred)+k+′(Ry)(Rox)Equation 2 The maximum rate of binding, B′max =k +′(Ry)(R tot), occurs when all of the receptors are oxidized (R ox = R tot), and the minimum rate of binding, B′min =k +(Ry)(R tot) occurs when all of the receptors are reduced (R red = R tot). Combining these terms yields the following equations.(B′−Bmin′)/(Bmax′−B′)=Rox/RredEquation 3 Bmax′/Bmin′=k+′/k+Equation 4 In a typical redox titration, as shown in Fig. 1 B,k +′/k + = 5.2 ± 1.4 (based on 21 independent experiments at different Ca2+concentrations). Interestingly, the ratio ofk +′/k + was found to be independent of the experimental conditions. AlthoughB′min varied slightly with Ca2+, caffeine, and Mg2+ concentration, the ratio ofB′max/B′min(k +′/k +) was always approximately equal to 5.2. If two protein sulfhydryl groups are oxidized to a disulfide, upon the addition of oxidized glutathione, the oxidation reaction is described by Equation 5.P−(SH) 2+GSSG⇄KoxP−S–S+2GSHEquation 5 At equilibrium, K ox = (P − S–S)(GSH2)/{(P − (SH)2(GSSG)}, and therefore is as follows.(P−S–S)/(P−(SH) 2)=Rox/Rred=Kox(GSSG)/GSH2=Equation 6 (B′−Bmin′)/(Bmax′−B′)The binding of ryanodine (Equation 2) is significantly slower than the oxidation reaction (Equation 5). Reconstitution data with an artificial bilayer lipid membrane has shown that the Ca2+release protein rapidly responds (less than 1 min) to changes in the local redox potential (19Feng W. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 123aGoogle Scholar). It is therefore valid to assume that the oxidation reaction has reached equilibrium before the earliest time point at which ryanodine binding is measured (3 min). Using GSH and GSSG as a redox buffer, the redox potential of the solution is defined by,Esol=Eo+2.3RT/(nF)log10(GSSG/GSH2)Equation 7 and the redox potential of the receptor is equal to the following,ERyR=Eo+2.3RT/(nF)log10(1/Kox)Equation 8 where the redox potential is referenced to a normal hydrogen electrode. E o is the standard potential of glutathione, −0.24 V, R is the gas constant (8.31 deg−1mol−1), T is the absolute temperature (K), n is the number of electrons transferred (n = 2), and F is the Faraday constant (96, 406 J/V) (20Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thiols that are more easily oxidized have larger values of K ox and more negative redox potentials. Combining Equations Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8 yields,2.303RT/nF log10((B′−Bmin′)/(Bmax′−B′))=Esol−ERyREquation 9 where the minimum and maximum initial rates of binding (B′min and B′max)are obtained from the highly reduced and oxidized data shown at the limits of the redox titration (Fig. 1 B). By plotting the left side of Equation 9 versus E sol, the redox potential of the receptor, E RyR is obtained from the x-intercept of Fig. 1 C. Moreover, the fact that Fig.1 C is linear with a slope of 1 indicates that Equations 3and 6 are valid. That is (B′ −B′min)/(B′max −B′) is proportional to GSSG and is inversely proportional to GSH2, as is expected for the formation of a pure disulfide. It is not proportional to 1/GSH, which is what would be expected if oxidation to a mixed disulfide had been responsible for activation of the receptor. In Fig. 1 B, the initial rate of ryanodine binding, B′, is plotted versus the solution redox potential, E sol. The solid line shown in Fig. 1 B is obtained from solving Equation 9 for B′,B′=(rBmax′+Bmin′)/(1+r)Equation 10 where r = 10(E(sol)−E(RyR))nF/2.303RT. As shown in Fig.1 B, the redox potential of thiols associated with activation of ryanodine binding was dependent on the experimental conditions. The trace on the left was derived from SR that is incubated in 0.1–0.3 mm GSH for 10 min at room temperature prior to the measurement of the initial rate of binding at the indicated solution redox potential (E sol). The trace on the right was derived from a redox titration carried out on SR vesicles without GSH pretreatment. Preincubation of the SR with GSH caused a 65 mV shift in the redox potential of the receptor to more negative values. In both the control and the pre-reduced samples, the maximum and minimum initial rates of binding (B′max andB′min) were identical, indicating that the same group of thiols were being oxidized in the two redox titrations shown in Fig. 1 B. Along with this shift in redox potential of the receptor, it was observed that the initial rates of ryanodine binding were highly reproducible only if the SR was first pre-reduced with GSH. As shown in Fig. 1 D, going back and forth between −140 and −180 mV or between −105 and −198 mV (data not shown) does not alter time-dependent ryanodine binding as long as the protein is pretreated with GSH. Samples of SR vesicles that were not pre-reduced did not show reproducible binding characteristics at more positive redox potentials (data not shown). All data presented in subsequent figures are from samples that are pre-reduced at room temperature for 10 min with GSH as indicated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the initial rate of ryanodine binding is controlled by the solution redox potential, as defined by Equation 7, not by the absolute amount of GSH or GSSG in the buffer. The Ca2+ release channel is activated by Ca2+, sensitized to activation by Ca2+ in the presence of caffeine and is inhibited by Mg2+. Redox titrations were carried out at various free Ca2+ concentrations, and the calculated redox potential of RyR1 thiols was plotted versusCa2+, in the presence and absence of caffeine (Fig.2 A) or Mg2+concentration (Fig. 2 B).Figure 1The ryanodine receptor has a well defined redox potential. Time-dependent ryanodine binding was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The initial rate of binding B′ (pmol/mg/min) was calculated from a linear regression fit of binding measurements at 3, 6, 9, and 12 min. The solution redox potential was calculated from Equation 7 using different mixtures of GSH and GSSG. In A, ryanodine binding as a function of time is shown at −230 mV (●), −180 mV (▵), −130 mV (▴), and −100 mV (○). In B , initial binding rate, B′, was plotted as a function of the solution redox potential and was fit to Equation 10 (solid lines). SR was either pretreated with GSH (●, E RyR = −165.5 mV) or was not pretreated with GSH (○,E RyR = −100 mV). In C, the data set derived from B following pretreatment with GSH was plotted as 30.8 × log10((B′-B′min)/(B′max− B′)) (mV) versus E sol(mV). From a linear regression fit, the slope = 1.023, the x-intercept = −165.5, and r 2 = 0.996. InD, following pretreatment of SR vesicles with GSH for 10 min at room temperature, the redox potential of the solutions were set to −140 mV (●, ▵) or −180 mV (▴,○), and samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The final redox potential of the binding buffer was adjusted to either −140 mV (●,○) or −180 mV (▴, ▵). Ryanodine binding was then initiated at t = 0 by addition of 4.0 nm [3H]ryanodine. All binding assays were carried out at 37 °C at 50 μm free Ca2+ and were repeated at least three times with almost identical results. Redox titrations, shown in A andB were repeated at least ten times on three different SR preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Ca2+, caffeine, and Mg2+ modulate the redox potential of RyR1.A, redox potentials of critical thiols on RyR1 were measured as a function of free Ca2+ concentration in the absence (●) and presence of 10 mm caffeine (▪).

As is evident in Table I, at highly oxidizing redox potentials (more positive than −140 mV), the receptor becomes more sensitive to activation by Ca2+(K d Ca2+ and the EC50 decreases). The Hill coefficient n H is unaffected by the redox potential of the solution. The data indicate a strong coupling between the Ca2+ binding site and the redox-sensitive thiols associated with RyR1.Table IThe Hill coefficient nH, Kd, and EC50 for Ca 2+ -dependent activation of the rate of ryanodine binding as a function of the solution redox potentialControl−60−90−120−140−160−220−230E sol (mV) n H0.770.780.820.710.680.690.720.77 K d 1-aμm.2.060.500.691.491.972.002.062.01 EC50 1-aμm.2.500.410.631.762.702.712.722.48All values listed are derived from the data shown in Fig. 3.1-a μm.

Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). They are specifically labeled by nanomolar concentrations of the alkylating reagent CPM, when the channel is in a closed configuration. In Fig.4 A, a redox titration is shown following pretreatment of the SR with 20 nm CPM, under conditions in which the Ca2+ release channel is in its closed state (1.0 mm CaCl2). Under these conditions, no increase in the rate of ryanodine binding is observed as the solution redox potential increases. The receptor no longer demonstrates redox sensitivity. In control experiments in which the Ca2+ release channel is in its open state during CPM pretreatment (50 μm Ca2+), a subsequent redox titration was identical to that shown in Fig. 1 B (data not shown). A normal redox titration is observed when CPM binds to non-hyperreactive thiols. Although the ryanodine receptor still shows a biphasic Ca2+ concentration dependence, following CPM treatment the enhanced rate of ryanodine binding observed at more positive redox potential (Fig. 3) is not present (Fig. 4). CPM eliminates redox control of the ryanodine receptor by blocking hyperreactive thiols. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that hyperreactive thiols on the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor (RyR1) have a well defined redox potential that is sensitive to the concentrations of channel modulators such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and caffeine. Conditions that favored the opening of the Ca2+ release channel (micromolar Ca2+ and millimolar caffeine) caused the redox potential of the receptor to become more negative, which favored the oxidation of critical thiols to a disulfide, and an enhancement of the rate of ryanodine binding (Fig. 1 B). Conditions that close down the Ca2+ release channel (submicromolar Ca2+, millimolar Ca2+, or Mg2+ (Fig. 2 B)), increase the receptor redox potential, which favors the reduced form of critical sulfhydryls and a decrease in the rate of ryanodine binding. Just as caffeine sensitizes the ryanodine receptor to activation by Ca2+, caffeine also maintained the redox potential of the receptor at more negative values, even at low Ca2+concentrations. This control of the redox potential of hyperreactive thiols by physiologically relevant channel modulators suggests that these thiols play a role in controlling channel gating during excitation-contraction coupling. However, even under conditions which strongly favor the activation of the Ca2+ release protein, 50 μmCa2+ and 10 mm caffeine, the redox potential does not get more negative than −175 mV. The normal cytoplasmic redox potential is approximately −230 mV (22Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar), as measured in cultured pancreatic cells. This is 55 mV more negative than the redox potential of the receptor under maximum activating conditions. Under these conditions, only 1.6% of the total receptors are oxidized and activated by thiol oxidation (calculated from Equations 6 and 9). Under less optimal conditions for channel activation, the receptor redox potential is more positive, and the open probability of the channel should be extremely small. The only condition in which a significant fraction of these thiols are oxidized is when the cell is oxidatively stressed and the cellular redox potential increases, or if the redox potential in the myoplasm is more positive than the estimated value of −230 mV (22Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, one would expect that small changes in the cellular redox potential to have a major influence on excitation-contraction coupling. In perhaps a related mode of operations, the OxyR transcription factor of Escherichia coli activates antioxidant genes in response to elevated H2O2 levels (23Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The redox potential of OxyR is −185 mV, which is significantly higher than that of the cellular redox potential under normal non-oxidatively stressed conditions (−270 mV). However, an oxidatively induced drop in the GSH/GSSG ratio leads to an increase in the cellular redox potential and an activation of OxyR. In a similar manner, an increase in the cellular redox potential during oxidative stress (induced by fatigue, aging, or ischemia) should result in oxidation of the ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release protein and the opening of the Ca2+ release pathway. Our previous studies have shown that oxidation induced by quinones, porphyrins and H2O2 is strongly Ca2+ dependent (8Abramson J.J. Buck E. Salama G. Casida J.E. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18750-18758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Favero T.G. Zable A. Abramson J.J. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1993; 301: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A likely explanation for the Ca2+ dependence of oxidation-induced Ca2+release from SR vesicles is directly related to the measurements of redox potential described in this manuscript. Ca2+ lowers the redox potential of the ryanodine receptor, which then allows these thiols to be oxidized more easily. We propose that conformational changes induced by channel activators stabilize one or both members of a redox pair, which in an appropriate redox environment results in thiol oxidation. It is well known that the SR Ca2+ release channel can be activated by non-thiol reagents in the absence of GSH and GSSG. An oxidation reaction is not required to open the Ca2+ release channel in vitro. However, as shown in Fig. 3, the degree of activation of the receptor is strongly dependent on the solution redox potential. In a more oxidized environment, there is a large stimulation of the receptor. Whereas in a more reduced environment, there is a relatively small degree of channel activation by Ca2+. The gain of the system appears to be set by the cellular redox potential. The labeling of hyperreactive thiols by CPM eliminates redox potential control of RyR1. It does not eliminate Ca2+-dependent activation and inhibition of RyR1. Studies that ignore the cellular redox environment are ignoring an important effector of Ca2+ channel function. A number of recent studies have shown that some thiol oxidizing reagents induce a biphasic concentration- and time-dependent activation and subsequent inactivation of RyR1 (10Favero T.G. Zable A.

Antioxidants and Redox Cycling. 2000; 2: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, the receptor is activated in a time-dependent manner. At higher concentrations, a time-dependent inactivation of ryanodine binding is observed after a delay of 30–50 min. The inactivation is likely to be caused by an oxidation of a second set of less reactive thiols. In this study, time-dependent inactivation was not observed. Experiments were designed to look at relatively short exposures to less oxidizing environments. The sulfhydryls examined are hyperreactive thiols whose oxidation is responsible for activation of the ryanodine receptor, not those responsible for subsequent inactivation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, pre-incubation of the SR with GSH caused a 65 mV shift in the redox potential of the receptor to more negative values. Two possible explanations explain this large shift in the redox potential of RyR1 upon pre-reduction with GSH come to mind. Despite the fact that most of the SR preparation was isolated in the presence of 50 μm dithiothreitol, oxidation during the last stages of the isolation procedure may have caused a shift in the redox potential of RyR1 to a more positive value. The redox potential of those hyperreactive thiols that control ryanodine binding may be altered by the oxidation of a second class of “regulatory thiols.” Aghdasi et al. (9Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) has previously shown that SR vesicle preparations are sensitive to oxidation by dissolved oxygen. Alternatively, the 10-min incubation with GSH may be required to transport GSH across the SR membrane and generate a suitable redox environment on the luminal side of the SR (21Banhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskas F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In other words, the luminal redox potential may influence the redox potential of hyperreactive thiols on the cytoplasmic face of the SR. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the IP3 receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum has a similar amino acid sequence to that of the ryanodine receptor. It has been shown that increased ratios of GSSG/GSH activate IP3 binding (26Renard-Rooney D.C. Joseph S.K. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that there are conserved sequences, which are strong candidates for sites of redox reactions common to both the IP3 and RyR (27Kaplin A.I. Ferris C.D. Vogimaier S.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28972-28978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RyR1, RyR2, and the IP3 receptors may contain similar or related molecular mechanisms for dealing with oxidative stress."

Well known guidance cues are collapsins/semaphorins, netrins, and ephrins (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar). The semaphorins are a large group of axonal guidance molecules with at least 30 members (2Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). They serve as repulsive guidance cues, influencing growth cone guidance not only in a contact-dependent way but also from a distance (3Messersmith E.K. Leonardo E.D. Shatz C.J. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Using a COS cell expression cloning approach, a transmembrane protein called neuropilin-1 was identified as a collapsin-1/semaphorin-3A (Sema3A)1 receptor (6He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Both neuropilin-1 and Sema3A knockout mice exhibited defasciculation and spreading of cranial nerves over a large area (8Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T.

Dorsal root ganglion growth cones from the neuropilin-1 knockout mice did not collapse in response to Sema3A, proving that the receptor neuropilin is necessary for inducing collapse (8Kitsukawa T.

In contrast to the rapid progress in identification and characterization of axon guidance molecules and their receptors, much remains to be explored about the intracellular mechanism by which signals are transduced into the eventual response of the growth cone. Since chick CRMP62 (now designated CRMP2) was first isolated as a factor required for collapsin-1 (Sema3A)-mediated signaling (10Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), a new family of cytoplasmic proteins that may be involved in such signal transduction for semaphorins has been identified through the work of several groups (11Quinn C.C.

To date, four different CRMP (TOAD/Ulip/DRP) genes have been described in rats, mice, and humans, with exclusive expression in the developing nervous system (12Wang L.-H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Byk T. Ozon S. Sobel A. Eur. J.

Dev. 1998; 51: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have been searching for topographically expressed molecules in the embryonic chick retina, using a cDNA subtraction technique and a novel cDNA display system called Restriction Landmark cDNA Scanning (23Yuasa J. Hirano S. Yamagata M. Noda M. Nature. 1996; 382: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Suzuki H. Yaoi T. Kawai J. Hara A. Kuwajima G. Watanabe S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to identify molecules that are involved in regional specificity in the retina, including those responsible for the topographic retinotectal projection. Among a number of molecules thus isolated, we found that CRMP3 was included in those asymmetrically expressed along the nasotemporal (anteroposterior) axis, although this expression pattern was transient during the retinal development. In the present study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library using chick CRMP3 as bait to identify CRMP3-interacting molecules and found a novel CRMP. This molecule, which we refer to as CRMP5, was nearly equally divergent from other CRMP members and DHPase but exclusively expressed in the nervous system. CRMP5 interacted with DHPase and other CRMPs except CRMP1, suggesting that CRMP5 is involved in axon outgrowth and guidance together with the other CRMP members. The cDNA fragment encoding the full-length coding region of chick CRMP3 (GenBankTMaccession number AF249294) was amplified by PCR with specific primers containing restriction sites using the isolated cCRMP3 clone as a template. After confirming the sequence identity, this fragment was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the bait vectors, pBTM116 (kindly provided by Drs. P. Bartel and S. Fields) containing the LexA-coding sequence and pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing GAL4 DNA-binding domain, to generate pLexA-cCRMP3 and pGAL4BD-cCRMP3, respectively. pLexA-cCRMP3 was then transformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40, which harbors reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ under the control of upstream LexA-binding sites. The library screening was performed as described (25Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar, 26Kawachi H. Tamura H. Watakabe I Shintani T. Maeda N. Noda M. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.0 × 106 clones were screened using a mouse 17-day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH). Positive clones were selected with 1 mm 3-aminotriazole on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. To confirm the positive interaction using another two-hybrid system, each positive clone thus obtained was again transformed into yeast strain SFY526 (CLONTECH) harboring reporter geneLacZ together with pGAL4BD-cCRMP3 and assayed for β-galactocidase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (MATCHMAKER Library User Manual; CLONTECH). The nucleotide sequences of positive clones thus isolated were determined on both strands. To obtain a longer 5′-flanking region, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed using total RNA prepared from embryonic day 17 (E17) mouse brains. Briefly, total RNA was reverse-transcribed with ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 0.6 m trehalose (Wako, Osaka, Japan) (27Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After two rounds of PCR, amplified DNAs were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subjected to sequence analysis. The direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization method was used for chromosomal assignment of the mouse CRMP5 gene. Preparation of R-banded chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed as described (28Matsuda Y. Harada Y.-N. Natsume-Sakai S. Lee K. Shiomi T. Chapman V.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1992; 61: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 29Matsuda Y. Chapman V.M. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Mitogen-stimulated splenocyte culture was synchronized by thymidine blockage, and the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine during the late replication stage was made for differential replication staining after the release from excessive thymidine. R-band staining was performed by exposure of chromosome slides to UV light after staining with Hoechst 33258. The chromosome slides were hardened at 65 °C for 2 h and then denatured at 70 °C in 70% formamide in 2× SSC and dehydrated in a 70, 85, and 100% ethanol series at 4 °C. Genomic fragments covering the mouse CRMP5 gene were screened from mouse genomic library using SalI (linker site)-NcoI cDNA fragment (nucleotide residues −42 to +249) as probe. One of the genomic fragments (22 kb long) was labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled DNA fragment was ethanol-precipitated with 10 times volume of mouse Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then denatured at 75 °C in 100% formamide. After hybridization, the slides were washed with 50% formamide in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 20 min, 2× SSC, and 1× SSC for 20 min each at room temperature. They were incubated with Cy2-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:500 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4× SSC for 1 h at 37 °C. The slides were washed with 4× SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, and 4× SSC for 10 min each on the shaker and then stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide. Nikon filter set B-2A (see Fig. 2 C) and UV-2A (data not shown) were used for observation. Kodak Ektachrome ASA100 films were used for microphotography. Total RNAs were prepared from various tissues of mice at postnatal day 0 (P0), and from whole embryos at E11, E13, and E15, whole heads at E17, and whole brains of postnatal mice at P0, P3, P7, and P14 by using ULTRASPECTM RNA (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). As for staging of mice, the day on which a vaginal plug was detected was considered E0, and the day of birth was considered P0. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from E17 whole brains using Dynabeads Oligo(dT)25 (DYNAL, Oslo, Norway). RNA separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 7.4% formaldehyde was transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was prehybridized at 68 °C in a solution containing 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 2% blocking solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 50% formamide. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 68 °C in the same solution containing the DIG-11-UTP-labeled antisense riboprobe transcribed from theApaI-SpeI cDNA fragment (nucleotide residues 1951–2828: noncoding probe) of CRMP5 (clone 1-8-7) (for nucleotide numbers, see Fig. 1) and detected using anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To verify the amount of RNA loaded, the membrane was rehybridized with DIG-labeled cRNA probe for mouse glycelaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In situhybridization was performed using DIG-riboprobes transcribed from the cDNA fragment (nucleotide residues 286–2066) of Ulip1/CRMP4 (GenBankTM accession number X87817) and the SalI (linker site)-BamHI cDNA fragment (−42 to +1652: coding probe) of CRMP5 (clone 1-8-7) as templates (23Yuasa J. Hirano S. Yamagata M. Noda M. Nature. 1996; 382: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). E17 mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. Cryosections were made at 14 μm. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 50 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.6 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 400 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 10% dextran sulfate and then incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Excess antibody was washed away, and the color substrates (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) were added to develop in the dark. To examine mutual associations among the CRMP family members and DHPase, DNA fragments covering the coding regions of mouse CRMP1–5 and DHPase were amplified by PCR using specific primers from the respective clones or RT-PCR (for CRMP2) to make restriction sites for cloning. After confirming the sequence, these fragments were inserted into the EcoRI andSalI sites of the pGBT9 bait vector. The CRMP1 and CRMP5 fragments were inserted also into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of the pACT2 prey vector (CLONTECH). The bait and prey constructs in various combinations were transformed into yeast strain Y190 (CLONTECH) harboring reporter genes HIS3and LacZ, and transformants were cultivated on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan. Assay was performed as described (26Kawachi H. Tamura H. Watakabe I Shintani T. Maeda N. Noda M. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For quantitative analysis of the mutual association, liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate according to the manufacturer's protocol (Yeast Protocols Handbook;CLONTECH). Myc-CRMP5, FLAG-CRMP1–5, and FLAG-DHPase expression vectors were constructed in the following way: Oligo nucleotides encoding c-Myc or FLAG peptide including the first methionine were ligated to mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA), which were digested withNheI and EcoRI, to yield pcDNA-Myc and pcDNA-FLAG, respectively. Full-length CRMP1–5 and DHPase cDNA were cut out from the various pGBT9 bait vectors with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into pcDNA-Myc or pcDNA-FLAG digested with EcoRI and XhoI. Myc-CRMP5 and FLAG-CRMPs/FLAG-DHPase thus prepared were co-transfected into COS-7 cells by using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared by sonication in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The lysates were incubated with agarose beads conjugated with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 3 h with agitation. The beads were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed four times by resuspension in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Proteins eluted from the beads with sample buffer were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To check the expression levels of FLAG-CRMPs and FLAG-DHPase, cell lysates were also analyzed using M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. To know the signal transduction cascade of CRMPs upstream and downstream, we attempted to identify CRMP3-interacting molecules by the yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse embryo cDNA library using chick CRMP3 as bait (pLexA-cCRMP3). Sixty-one clones were isolated by surveying approximately 1.0 × 106 transformants. Sequence analysis showed that CRMP1, CRMP3, CRMP4, and the mouse homologue of DHPase were included among them: six clones for CRMP1, one clone for CRMP3, 29 clones for CRMP4, and six clones for DHPase. This result supports the claim by Wang and Strittmatter (30Wang L.-H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that CRMP isoforms associate with one another. The sequence of mouse DHPase, determined for the first time in the present study, shared 94 and 88% amino acid identity with rat and human DHPase, respectively (GenBankTM accession number AF249296). Besides the already identified CRMP isoforms described above, we found one clone, 1-8-7, encoding a novel protein sequence that shows significant but relatively low homology with CRMP1–4 and DHPase. Interaction of this novel CRMP isoform with chick CRMP3 was verified by the two-hybrid method using another bait construct pGAL4BD-cCRMP3 (data not shown). We here designate this new CRMP member as CRMP5. Moreover, two clones with no homology to these CRMP isoforms, which are supposed to be novel CRMP-interacting molecules, were also identified among them (to be reported elsewhere). The CRMP5 cDNA clone, 1-8-7, contained a putative open reading frame that was in frame with the GAL4 activation domain sequence and therefore expected to be expressed as a fusion protein. Because clone 1-8-7 included no in-frame stop codon located upstream of the first methionine (nucleotides 1–3 in Fig.1), we performed 5′-RACE to identify further the upstream sequence. By reverse transcriptase reaction with trehalose (27Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we obtained longer RACE-PCR products and found two in-frame stop codons in clone 4-1. Thus, we concluded that the initially isolated CRMP5 cDNA clone, 1-8-7, has the full-length open reading frame. In Fig. 1, the contig nucleotide sequence composed of 1-8-7 and 4-1, together with the deduced amino acid sequence, is presented. Our search of the mouse EST data base identified 12 overlapping mouse cDNAs matching to the 3′-noncoding region of 1-8-7. The resultant contig sequence had an additional poly(A) signal that is located about 400 bp downstream of the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown; for GenBankTM accession numbers, see the legend). Therefore, two types of CRMP5 mRNA transcripts that are different only in the length of the 3′-noncoding region are probably generated. We screened EST data bases for homologues of CRMP5 in other species. This analysis identified six human EST sequences (GenBankTMaccession numbers N51749, AA350414, AA058664, AA351100, AA488145, and AI36969). They showed significant, although still partial, homology with mouse CRMP5; the N-terminal (corresponding to amino acid residues 1–184 of mCRMP5) and C-terminal (residues 482–564) amino acid sequences were predicted from the EST clones. Compared with mouse CRMP5, the deduced amino acid identity was 88% for the N-terminal part and 98% for the C-terminal part. The CRMP5 cDNA encoded a protein of 564 amino acids whose calculated molecular mass is 61,516 Da. It shares approximately 50% amino acid identity both with the members of the CRMP family (CRMP1–4; 49–50%) and with DHPase (51%) through the entire length (Fig. 2 A). Because the already known CRMP family members exhibit approximately 70% identity with each other (68–75%), CRMP5 might be categorized to another subfamily (12Wang L.-H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Byk T. Ozon S. Sobel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, a phylogenetic tree of CRMP isoforms indicated that CRMP5 is relatively close to DHPase and suggested that CRMP1–4 diverged first from a common ancestor with DHPase, followed after a lag by CRMP5. Amino acid sequences of CRMP isoforms were aligned (Fig.3). The N-terminal three-quarters is more conserved than the C-terminal region. When CRMP5 is compared with the other CRMPs, it is evident that some amino acid substitutions are identical or similar to those of DHPase, together with the gap at the N-terminal region. On the other hand, the sequence at aligned positions 54–57 is absent, and the C-terminal region after 530 is present, similar to other CRMP members. It is notable that some regions (at aligned positions 279–298, 313–339, 508–536, and 572–576) were different from all the other CRMP isoforms including DHPase. CRMP isoforms are known as phosphoproteins (18Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Byk T. Ozon S. Sobel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and bear several consensus sequences for phosphorylation sites that are conserved among the members. CRMP5 contains 17 such potential phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1): a single potential site for tyrosine phosphorylation, two potential sites for protein kinase A, six sites for protein kinase C, and eight sites for casein kinase II. Among them, three protein kinase C target sites are unique to CRMP5 (see legend to Fig. 1). This suggests that the function of CRMP5 could also be regulated by phosphorylation, specifically and/or commonly. Recently, it has been proposed that the amidohydrolases including DHPase share the same active site architecture (31Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Notably, four histidine residues (at aligned positions 77, 79, 202, and 258) and one aspartatic acid residue (at position 336) involved in metal binding are highly conserved (Fig. 3). Because CRMP5 has substitutions in two histidine residues, it is unlikely that it bears DHPase activity just as the other CRMP members do not (10Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 18Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J.

The chromosomal location of the mouse CRMP5 gene was determined by the direct R-banding fluorescence in situ hybridization using a mouse CRMP5 genomic DNA fragment as probe. The CRMP5 gene was localized to R-positive B1 band of chromosome 5 (32Evans E.P. Lyon M.F. Rastan S. Brown S.D.M. Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1446-1449Google Scholar, 33Somssich I.E. Hameister H. Lyon M.F. Rastan S. Brown S.D.M. Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1450-1451Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). The CRMP family members are known to be expressed in the nervous system, whereas DHPase is present in liver and kidney (21Hamajima N. Matsuda K. Sakata S. Tamaki N. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because CRMP5 is almost equally divergent from the other CRMPs and DHPase, we next addressed the issue of whether CRMP5 expression is neural-tissue specific. Northern blot analysis using P0 mouse tissues (Fig.4 A), clearly showed that CRMP5 mRNA is present only in the brain but not in the other tissues. Next, the expression profile of CRMP5 mRNA during development was examined. CRMP5 mRNA was already expressed at E11, as early as CRMP4/Ulip1 (data not shown), peaking in the first postnatal week when neural network formation and its refinement culminates and subsequently declining to a lower level during the second week (Fig. 4 B). By longer exposure, another minor hybridization band with an estimated mRNA size of 10.7 kb was detected. The hybridization band of about 4.2 kb is likely to be an artifact caused by overlap with 28 S ribosomal RNA. These results suggest that CRMP5 expression is neural-tissue specific and developmentally regulated as already reported for some CRMP members (10Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P.

When poly(A)+ RNA was analyzed, the 5.0-kb band for CRMP5 turned out to be double bands of 4.8 and 5.2 kb (Fig. 4 C). When the expression level of CRMP5 mRNA was compared with that of CRMP4 (18Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2093656658,"Activation by thioesterification to coenzyme A is a prerequisite for most reactions involving fatty acids. Enzymes catalyzing activation, acyl-CoA synthetases, have been classified by their chain length specificities. The most recently identified family is the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (VLCS). Although several members of this group are capable of activating very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), one is a bile acid-CoA synthetase, and others have been characterized as fatty acid transport proteins. It was reported that the Drosophila melanogaster mutantbubblegum (BGM) had elevated VLCFA and that the product of the defective gene had sequence homology to acyl-CoA synthetases. Therefore, we cloned full-length cDNA for a human homolog of BGM, and we investigated the properties of its protein product, hsBG, to determine whether it had VLCS activity. Northern blot analysis showed that hsBG is expressed primarily in brain. Compared with vector-transfected cells, COS-1 cells expressing hsBG had increased acyl-CoA synthetase activity with either long-chain fatty acid (2.4-fold) or VLCFA (2.6-fold) substrates. Despite this increased VLCFA activation, hsBG-expressing cells did not have increased rates of VLCFA degradation. Confocal microscopy showed that hsBG had a cytoplasmic localization in some COS-1 cells expressing the protein, whereas it appeared to associate with plasma membrane in others. Fractionation of these cells revealed that most of the hsBG-dependent acyl-CoA synthetase activity was soluble and not membrane-bound. Immunoaffinity-purified hsBG from transfected COS-1 cells was enzymatically active. hsBG and hsVLCS are only 15% identical, and comparison with sequences of two conserved motifs from all known families of acyl-CoA synthetases revealed that hsBG along with the D. melanogaster and murine homologs comprise a new family of acyl-CoA synthetases. Thus, two protein families are now known that contain enzymes capable of activating VLCFA. Because hsBG is expressed in brain but previously described VLCSs were not highly expressed in this organ, hsBG may play a central role in brain VLCFA metabolism and myelinogenesis."

Here, we show that treatment of cells specifically with agents inducing O6-methylguanine in DNA, such asN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, elevates the level of MSH2 and MSH6 and increases GT mismatch binding activity in the nucleus. This inducible response occurs immediately after alkylation, is long-lasting and dose-dependent, and results from translocation of the preformed MutSα complex (composed of MSH2 and MSH6) from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. It is not caused by an increase in MSH2 gene activity. Cells expressing the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), thus having the ability to repair O6-methylguanine, showed no translocation of MutSα, whereas inhibition of MGMT by O6-benzylguanine provoked the translocation. The results demonstrate that O6-methylguanine lesions are involved in triggering nuclear accumulation of MSH2 and MSH6.

The mismatch repair system is able not only to detect and repair mismatches derived from spontaneous base modification and replication but can also process chemically induced DNA damage. An important group of chemicals associated with mismatch repair are alkylating mutagens. These agents, such asN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)1 andN-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), cause methylation in the O6 position of guanine. The resulting O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) pairs with thymine instead of cytosine, thus leading to GC → AT transition mutations (7Karran P. Bignami M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Hampson R. Humbert P. Macpherson P. Aquilina G. Karran P. J. Biol.

O6-MeG paired with thymine, as well as various other mutagen-induced lesions such as 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-links generated by cisplatin, are subject of repair by the mismatch repair system (10Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Hurchie A.I.H. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 11Yamada M. O'Regan E. Brown R. Karran P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the case of O6-MeG-generating agents, which are most powerful mutagens and carcinogens, a lack of mismatch repair confers resistance to cytotoxicity and thus increases the mutagenic response of cells (12Branch P. Aquilina G. Bignami M. Karran P. Nature. 1993; 362: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Karran P. Bignami M. Bioassays. 1994; 16: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 14De Wind N. Dekker M. Berns A. Radman M. te Riele H. Cell. 1995; 82: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar); this implies that genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of O6-MeG are mediated by mismatch repair. This could occur by erroneous mismatch repair cycles because of repeated misincorporation of thymine opposite O6-MeG or by direct signaling of apoptotic functions due to faulty mismatch repair activity. Since O6-MeG is a highly mutagenic and genotoxic lesion, its repair by the repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) prior to replication is highly important for avoiding mutagenic, carcinogenic, and genotoxic effects. MGMT activity is highly variable among different tissues and cell types, and numerous cases (including cell lines, tumors, and knockout mice) have been reported unable to repair O6-MeG (15Mitra S. Kaina B. Progr. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Tsuzuki T. Sakumi K. Shiraishi A. Kawate H. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Tominaga Y. Zhang S. Shimizu S. Ishikawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Katsuki M. Sekiguchi M. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In these cases, O6-MeG-triggered cell death via mismatch repair might be advantageous for the organism as it lowers alkylation-induced mutation pressure. Mismatch repair of O6-methylguanine-thymine base pairs is initiated by the binding of a protein complex (designated as MutSα) to the mismatch (17Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Husuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This complex is composed of the bacterial MutS homologous proteins MSH2 and MSH6 (18Fishel R. Lescone M.K. Rao M.R.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J. Kane M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar), which is also known as GT-binding protein. In addition, MSH2 can also form a complex with the mismatch repair protein MSH3, designated MutSβ (19Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Depending on the binding partner, the heterodimers have differerent substrate specificities and therefore play different roles in mismatch repair. Thus, the MutSα complex (MSH2 and MSH6) is able to bind to base-base mismatches and to insertion/deletion mismatches (21Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Littmann S.J. Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) in contrast to the MutSβ complex (MSH2 and MSH3), which is capable of binding to insertion/deletion mismatches. Upon binding to the mismatch, MutSα associates with another heterodimeric complex (MutLα), consisting of the MutL homologous mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and PMS2 (24Nicolaides N.C. Papadopoulos N. Liu B. Wei Y. Carter K.C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Adams M.D. Venter J.C. Dunlop M.G. Hamilton S.R. Petersen G.M. de la Chapelle A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Whereas the function of the individual mismatch repair proteins has been studied in great detail, data are scarce regarding the regulation of mismatch repair. It has been shown that regulation of MSH2 is cell cycle-dependent, because MSH2 is expressed at higher level in proliferating than in resting cells (25Marra G. Chang C.L. Laghi L.A. Chauhan D.P. Young D. Boland C.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2189-2196PubMed Google Scholar). Whether MSH2 and/or other mismatch repair proteins are regulated by exogenous stimuli, notably mutagenic treatments, has not yet been analyzed. This subject, however, would be of great interest because mutagens are able to induce various immediate-early and late cellular responses, which are related to gene induction (c-fos, c-jun) and protein stabilization (p53) (for review see Refs. 26Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar and 27Kaina B. Haas S. Grösch S. Grombacher T. Dosch J. Biswas T. Boldogh I. Mitra S. Fritz G.

In this work, we addressed the question of whether DNA-damaging treatments exert an effect on the expression of mismatch repair proteins. Here, we show that treatment of cells specifically with O6-MeG-generating agents leads to an increase of mismatch repair proteins and GT binding activity in nuclear extracts due to translocation of MSH2 and MSH6 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon mutagen treatment. The data indicate a novel type of inducible response of cells to alkylating agents. The cell lines used (H4IIE, H5, BK4, E, HeLa MR, HeLaS3, and HeLa MR-adaC3) were grown at 6% CO2, 37 °C in F12/Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. DLD1 cells were grown at 6% CO2, 37 °C in F12/Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For preparing whole cell extracts, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested, resuspended in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5% glycerol) and sonicated on ice with a Branson sonifier (Branson, Dunbury, CT) at 30 kHz, three times for 15 s. The homogenates were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the clear supernatants were stored frozen at −80 °C. For the preparation of nuclear extracts, cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0, 5 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentration 0.5%) the solution was vortexed, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged (400 × g, 5 min). Thereafter, the pellet was washed again with lysis buffer I. To isolate nuclear extracts suitable for EMSA, pellets were resuspended in 2 volumes of lysis buffer II (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 600 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm DDT) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted by the addition of 1 volume of lysis buffer III (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm DDT). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%, and aliquots were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The amount of protein was determined as described (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). To isolate nuclear extracts for Western blot analysis, pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer IV (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 40 mmNa4P2O7, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS) and sonicated. After centrifugation, the amount of protein in the supernatant was determined. Extracts were stored at −80 °C. For preparing cytoplasmic protein extracts, cells were harvested as described above. The cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0, 5 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentration 0.5%), the solution was vortexed, incubated on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 min). The supernatant was centrifuged again to remove traces of nuclei. The amount of protein in the supernatant was determined as described, and extracts were stored at −80 °C. For gel retardation assays, 29-nucleotide oligomers with the general sequence 5′-GGGCTCGAGCTGCAGCTGCTAGTAGATCT-3′ were anealed to oligomers with the general sequence 5′-GGGAGATCTACTAGNAGCTGCAGCTCGAG-3′ (n= C or T) and labeled with [32P]dATP using polynucleotide kinase. An aliquot of 4 μg of nuclear proteins was incubated in 10% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCL, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg poly(dI·dC) with 25 fmol of radioactively labeled duplex for 30 min at 27 °C, after which the DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels using 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Samples of 25 μg of nuclear or cytoplasmic protein extracts were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run for 2 h at 35 mA. Separated proteins were transferred onto a 0.2-mm cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schüll) in a Bio-Rad blot cell using buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 86 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. To avoid unspecific binding, the filters were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 3 h. Thereafter, filters were incubated with monoclonal mouse antibody against hMSH2 (Calbiochem), hMSH6 (Transduction Laboratories), hPMS2 (PharMingen), hMLH1 (PharMingen), or polyclonal antibody against ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted in the same solution (1:750) overnight at 4 °C, and incubated afterward with donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; dilution 1:4000) for 1 h. The protein-antibody complexes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The human MSH2 promoter was cloned from HeLa S3 DNA as described (29Dosch J. Christmann M. Kaina B. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 4: 567-573Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, 106cells were seeded/10-cm dish. Cells were transfected 1 day later with 10 μg of hMSH2 promoter-CAT construct, using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (30Graham F.L. Van der Erb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated 36 h after transfection with mutagens, and 6 h later, cell extracts were prepared and the amount of CAT protein per cell extract protein was determined by the CAT ELISA kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For preparing nuclear protein extracts, cells were harvested as described above. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT) and incubated for 10 min on ice. After the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentration 0.5%), the solution was vortexed, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged (400 × g, 5 min). The pellet was washed and resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Thereafter, Triton X-100 (final concentration 1%) and SDS (final concentration 0.1%) were added, and samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, instead of Triton X-100 and SDS, Nonidet P-40 was added (0.5%) and incubated for 20 min and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was incubated on ice for 30 min together with 20 μl of protein G and centrifuged (400 × g, 2 min) to remove proteins that unspecifically bind protein G. The supernatant was incubated on ice together with 15 μl of the specific antibody. 1 h later, 25 μl of protein G was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. The protein-antibody complex was isolated by centrifuging it five times (400 × g, 2 min), washing it in 1 ml of RIPA buffer, and subjecting it to Western blot analysis. For preparation of cytoplasmic protein extracts, cells were harvested as described above. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer and incubated for 10 min on ice. After the addition of Nonidet P-40 (final concentration 0.5%), the solution was vortexed, incubated on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 2 min). The supernatant was centrifuged to remove traces of nuclei and incubated with protein G together with the specific antibody as described above. Cells were grown on coated glass slides in 10-cm dishes. 2 h after treatment with MNNG, cells were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100. After several rinses in cold PBS, cells were preincubated for 30 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After additional rinses in cold PBS, cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the primary antibody anti-MSH2 or anti-MSH6 (1:500) and thereafter rinsed again in PBS. After incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and washing in PBS, cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Initially, we observed that treatment of HeLa MR cells with a methylating agent such as MNNG induces an increase in the level of GT binding activity in nuclear extracts (Fig.1 A). A major component of the GT binding complex is MSH2. To determine whether induction of GT binding activity is caused by an increase in the level of MSH2, we quantified this mismatch repair protein in nontreated and mutagen-exposed cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, treatment of HeLa MR cells with MNNG significantly enhanced the level of MSH2 in nuclear extracts. This was also found to be the case for other highly potent alkylating mutagens, such as MNU and ENU, having in common the capacity to induce O6-alkylguanine in DNA. The MSH2 protein level was not enhanced, however, after exposure of cells to MMS, which induces only very low amounts of O6-MeG in DNA, nor was the amount enhanced following ultraviolet light and x-ray treatment (data not shown). The dose-response curve of induction revealed that MSH2 increased in amount linearly with doses up to 25 μm MNNG, where the maximum of increase was observed (∼8-fold above the control level). With higher doses of MNNG (>25 μm), the expression of MSH2 again declined, approaching the control level (Fig.2 A, left panel). We should note that even very low, nontoxic doses of MNNG (0.5 and 1 μm) caused an increase in the level of MSH2 (data not shown). Time course experiments revealed an immediate-early increase of MSH2 protein detectable already 30 min after the addition of MNNG to the medium, with a maximum of expression 4 h later. The increased MSH2 level stayed above the control level for at least 24 h after methylating treatment (Fig. 2 A, right panel).Figure 1Induction of GT binding activity and increase of MSH2 protein level in cells treated with alkylating agents.

HeLa MR cells were included for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transcriptional activation of themsh2 gene or mRNA stabilization would be a reasonable explanation for an observed increase in the MSH2 protein level. This, however, was not the case, since MNNG treatment did not increase MSH2 mRNA expression (Fig. 2 B). Also, the human MSH2 promoter, which was cloned into an expression plasmid and transiently transfected into HeLa MR cells, was found not to be inducible upon treatment with MNNG or with other alkylating agents (MNU, ENU, MMS) (Fig. 2 C). Obviously, the observed increase in MSH2 protein level is due neither to transcriptional activation of MSH2 nor to stabilization of MSH2 mRNA. The MNNG-induced increase of the amount of nuclear MSH2 protein was independent of de novo protein synthesis, since it occurred in the presence of cycloheximide and anisomycin (data not shown). An increase in the MSH2 protein level upon MNNG treatment was observed in different cell lines from human and rodent origin, an example of which is given in Fig.2 D. Remarkably, the increase was not dependent on the p53 status, since it was found in p53 wild-type, p53 mutant, and p53 null (knockout) cells (Fig. 2 D and data not shown). In the experiments performed so far, nuclear extracts have been used to analyze the level of MSH2 protein upon alkylation. Because MSH2 is located both in the nucleus and in relatively high amounts in the cytoplasm, the possibility arises that the observed MSH2 induction is caused by nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic protein. This hypothesis was proven by measuring the level of MSH2 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction after MNNG treatment. As shown in Fig.3 A (for a representative Western blot experiment) and Fig. 3 B (for quantification), the MSH2 level clearly increased in nuclear extracts, whereas at the same time it gradually decreased in the cytoplasm, as measured at various times after methylation. This demonstrates that after exposure of cells to MNNG, MSH2 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, leading to an increased nuclear MSH2 level. In view of the fact that MSH2 forms the GT binding complex MutSα together with MSH6, the question arises whether the expression level of MSH6 is also altered upon alkylation. Similar to MSH2, MSH6 was found to be present at a high level in the cytoplasm (see Fig.4 A). Upon treatment of cells with MNNG, the overall MSH6 level (determined in total cell extracts, data not shown) did not change, whereas it increased in the nuclear and decreased in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4, A andB (for quantification)). This indicates that MSH6, like MSH2, is subject to nuclear translocation in response to alkylation. We also observed an increase in the amount of two other MMR proteins, PMS2 and MLH1, within the nuclear fraction after treatment with MNNG. It is noted that we were unable to detect any MLH1 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction, which may indicate that for this protein a mechanism other than nuclear translocation is responsible for the increase in nuclear level (Fig. 4 A). Nuclear translocation of MSH2 and MSH6 in MNNG-treated cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown) and by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig.4 C, both MSH2 and MSH6 were detectable in cells in situ in the cytoplasm, whereas upon MNNG treatment the proteins were no longer detectable there, but significant levels were found in the nucleus. The complex composed of MSH2 and MSH6 is known to be preformed in total and nuclear extracts, which have been used for investigation in most experiments reported thus far (19Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 31Drummond J.T. Li M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To find out whether MutSα is cytoplasmically preformed and thus subject to nuclear translocation, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa MR cells. In nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts treated with an anti-hMSH6 antibody, the MSH2 protein was found to be co-precipitated. On the other hand, the addition of an anti-hMSH2 antibody to the extracts resulted in co-precipitation of MSH6 (Fig. 5). This shows that formation of the complex of MSH2 and MSH6 had occurred already in the cytoplasm. It also indicates that the preformed MutSα complex is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon MNNG treatment. If true, this would suggest that lack of either one of the proteins prevents nuclear translocation of the second protein. This is indeed the case, because in DLD1 cells deficient for MSH6 (32Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Liu B. Parson R. Lengauer C. Palombo F. D'Arrigo A. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Kinzler K.W. Jiricny J. Vogelstein B. Science. 1995; 268: 1915-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), translocation of MSH2 into the nucleus was not found (Fig.6 A). Also, as one would expect, GT binding activity of nuclear extracts did not increase in these cells upon MNNG treatment, in contrast to HeLa MR control cells (Fig. 6 B). (At the same time, this experiment confirmed the MSH6 deficiency of the cells we used.) Obviously, nuclear translocation of MSH2 requires MSH6. In this context, it should be noted that computer analysis revealed that MSH6 contains nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences not found in MSH2 protein (data not shown). It thus appears that the NLS of MSH6 are utilized for transportation of the preformed cytoplasmic MutSα complex into the nucleus upon DNA methylation.Figure 6Lack of translocation of MSH2 in MSH6-deficient cells. A, amounts of different MMR proteins (MSH2, PMS2, MLH1) in whole cell extracts and in nuclear and cytoplasmatic extracts of nontreated (−) and MNNG-treated (+) (25 μm) MSH6-deficient DLD1 cells 2 h after mutagen exposure.

O6-MeG is removed from DNA by the repair protein MGMT in a relatively fast methyl group transfer reaction (33Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The HeLa cells (strain HeLa MR) utilized for the experiments described above are deficient for MGMT and thus unable to remove O6-MeG from DNA (34Fritz G. Tano K. Mitra S. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4660-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).

We have measured zinc bound to NOS purified from pig brain (0.6 mol/mol of NOS) and baculovirus-expressed rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) (0.49 ± 0.13 mol/mol of NOS), by on-line gel-filtration/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and vanadium were all undetectable. Baculovirus-expressed nNOS also bound up to 2.00 ± 0.58 mol of copper/mol of NOS. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) reduced the bound zinc to 0.28 ± 0.07 and the copper to 0.97 ± 0.24 mol/mol of NOS. Desalting of samples into thiol-free buffer did not affect the zinc content but completely eliminated the bound copper (≤0.02 mol/mol of NOS). Most (≥75%) of the bound zinc was released from baculovirus-expressed rat nNOS byp-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (PMPS). PMPS-treated nNOS was strongly (90 ± 5%) inactivated. To isolate functional effects of zinc release from other effects of PMPS, PMPS-substituted thiols were unblocked by excess reduced thiol in the presence of DTPA, which hindered reincorporation of zinc. The resulting enzyme contained 0.12 ± 0.05 mol of zinc but had a specific activity of 426 ± 46 nmol of citrulline.mg−1.min−1, corresponding to 93 ± 10% of non-PMPS-treated controls. PMPS also caused dissociation of nNOS dimers under native conditions, an effect that was blocked by the pteridine cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin). H4biopterin did not affect zinc release. Even in the presence of H4biopterin, PMPS prevented conversion of NOS dimers to an SDS-resistant form.

Mayer B. Hemmens B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1714-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Three isozymes are known: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS), and endothelial (eNOS). The reaction occurs at the oxygenase domain of NOS, which contains a cysteine-thiolate-ligated heme and forms the N-terminal half of the protein. Reducing equivalents for the reaction are passed from NADPH to the heme via an integral FMN- and FAD-containing reductase domain, which forms the C-terminal half of the protein, under the control of Ca2+/calmodulin binding near the FMN site. Active NOS is a homodimer, with the structural dimeric interface being formed between the two oxygenase domains. Unlike other heme enzymes, NOS is completely dependent on the pteridine cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin), which binds to the oxygenase domain. Why the enzyme needs H4biopterin has not yet been determined unambiguously, although evidence is mounting for a novel, one-electron redox cycling of the pteridine (2Bec N. Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C.

The latter effect is so marked that H4biopterin-saturated NOS migrates in dimeric form during SDS-PAGE if the samples are not boiled before loading onto the gel (8Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this unusual SDS resistance has not been completely elucidated, although the dimeric interface features a large buried surface area, and the H4biopterin binding sites are intimately involved with the dimeric contact region. A new factor relevant to NOS dimerization was revealed in crystal structures of eNOS oxygenase dimers (3Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). This was a Zn(4S) cluster in which two cysteine-thiolate ligands were contributed by each subunit. The two cysteines are conserved in all known NOS sequences, with the more N-terminal of the pair about 30–35 residues from the N-terminal oxygenase domain boundary. Not all NOS oxygenase dimer structures have contained zinc at this site, the first structure of murine iNOS oxygenase contained a symmetric intersubunit disulfide bridge formed by the more C-terminal of the two pairs of cysteines (10Crane B.R.

Since then, pairs of zinc-containing and zinc-free structures of iNOS oxygenase dimers have been solved (11Li H. Raman C.S. Glaser C.B. Blasko E. Young T.A. Parkinson J.F. Whitlow M. Poulos T.M. J.

A site-directed mutant of the more C-terminal of the zinc-ligand cysteines (to alanine) had been studied in all three isozymes (13Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Wu K.K. Biochem.

This mutant (in nNOS) was recently re-examined with respect to its zinc content and found to contain about 0.05 zinc per dimer and could be reactivated by preincubation with l-Arg (16Miller R.T.

Thus, an intact zinc site may protect NOS against inactivation without being essential for activity. If the zinc is not necessary for NOS activity, it may not be incorporated into NOS under all physiological circumstances. Because of this, and because of a claim of non-heme iron involvement in NOS catalysis (17Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we aimed first to examine nNOS from both a baculovirus expression system and natural tissue, for bound zinc. Second, we wanted to study its contribution to structure and function of wild-type rather than mutant NOS: If it is inessential, we reasoned, it might be possible to remove it without destroying the enzyme activity. Finally, because such an intersubunit connection would be expected to contribute to dimer stability, we wanted to check whether, and how, removal of the zinc would affect the dimerization of the enzyme. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride (45 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO, and further purified by HPLC as described earlier (20Klatt P.

Solutions for experiments involving zinc release were made in new single-use plastic vessels with water prepared by glass distillation followed by passage through a milliQ apparatus (Millipore, Vienna, Austria). nNOS from pig cerebellum was isolated according to Mayer et al. (21Mayer B. John M. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Rat nNOS was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and purified by sequential affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and then calmodulin-Sepharose, as described previously (22List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the normal enzyme storage buffer contained 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mm EGTA, NOS samples for experiments involving zinc release were stripped of these compounds by gel filtration. NOS samples (3–5 mg) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and hen egg white trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml) were concentrated to about 15 mg.ml−1 in a dialysis tube (Spectra/Por, 8-mm flat width, cut-off 15 kDa) laid in solid sucrose, before injection onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column connected to an ÄKTA Purifier 10 chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Vienna, Austria). The elution buffer was 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. For convenience we refer to the resulting nNOS as “thiol-free.” Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. Metals bound to NOS enzymes were analyzed by gel filtration with on-line detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Before analysis, the ICP-MS was tuned to give typically ∼22,000 counts per second (cps) (background 3 cps) for lithium and ∼32000 cps (background 2 cps) for yttrium at a doubly charged ratio Ce2+/Ce ∼1.6% and an oxide ratio CeO/Ce ∼0.2% (at 10 μg/liter lithium, yttrium, and cesium). Gel filtration columns were connected to a Hewlett-Packard HP1100 ChemStation HPLC system incorporating a UV monitor set at 280 nm. The outlet of the UV detector was connected directly to the Babington-type nebulizer of a Hewlett-Packard HP4500 ICP-MS. In initial experiments, the following isotopes were monitored: 51V,55Mn,57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni,64Zn, 65Cu, 66Zn, 68Zn, and 95Mo. Because only iron, copper, and zinc were found in NOS samples, in subsequent experiments only 57Fe,64Zn, 65Cu, 66Zn, and68Zn were measured. 10–40 pmol of myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and azurin were run to calibrate the peak areas of the ICP-MS traces for iron, zinc, and copper, respectively. For each standard protein, the respective metal was found to be fully bound to the protein. For ICP-MS experiments, we used either a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml.min−1, or a SigmaChrom GFC1300 column (30 cm × 7.5 mm; Supelco) run at 0.5 ml.min−1 in 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 mNH4Cl. We sometimes (as specified below) injected samples of DTPA (90 μl, 2 mm) to purge metal ions from the chromatography system. Release of zinc from thiol-free NOS was monitored using the absorbance change of the metal-binding dye PAR at 500 nm (24Hunt J.B. Neece S.N. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Qiu H. Kodadek T. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2773-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAR was added to 200-μl samples to give a final concentration of 100 μm. The response was calibrated from 0 to 10 μm using solutions of zinc and/or copper acetate in the same buffer present in the enzyme samples (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15m NaCl). The slope of the absorbance increase was 76 mm−1 for zinc and 43 mm−1 for copper. The chelator NTA, when added to a final concentration of 2 mm, was found to completely abolish the response to zinc, whereas the signal for copper was only reduced to 33 mm−1. The PAR reaction was used to measure release of zinc from NOS on treatment with PMPS. PAR was added to samples of NOS (3–5 μm), and the absorbance spectrum was recorded. After adding 4 μl of PMPS (final concentration 0.16 mm), the absorbance at 500 nm was measured at intervals of 10 s for 200 s. Samples of NOS (5 μm; 400 μl), kept on ice, were treated with the following combinations of PMPS (0.15 mm), DTPA (2 mm), and l-cysteine (10 mm). To a control sample (control) were added DTPA and l-cysteine; this sample was incubated for 3 min. To a second sample (PMPS-only), PMPS was added, followed 1 min later by DTPA (2 mm) and 2 min of further incubation. To a third sample (PMPS/cysteine), PMPS was added, followed 1 min later by DTPA and after a further 2 min by cysteine. Immediately after these incubations, three 110-μl portions of each sample were frozen in liquid N2 for ICP-MS analysis. A further 10-μl portion was taken from each sample for NOS assays. Of each 110-μl sample for ICP-MS, 90 μl was injected onto the SigmaChrom GPC 1300 column. Samples were injected in the following order: first, two samples of 2 mm DTPA, then standards in the range 0–10 μm, then 2 × 2 mm DTPA, then two injections of 2 mm DTPA plus 0.3 mmPMPS, and then the three PMPS-only replicate samples. Next, the system was re-equilibrated for 1 h in buffer containing 10 mml-cysteine followed by 2 × 2 mm DTPA, and the control samples were applied. A single injection of DTPA was made between these and the PMPS/cysteine samples. For NOS assays, the 10-μl samples were diluted 10-fold in 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mmCHAPS and 0.8 mm DTPA, supplemented for the control and PMPS/cysteine samples, but not for the PMPS-only sample, with 10 mm cysteine. 20 μl of this diluted enzyme stock was added to 80 μl of assay mixture, containing (final concentrations) 100 μm [3H]l-Arg (∼50,000 cpm), 10 μg.ml−1 calmodulin, 40 μmH4biopterin, 5 μm FAD, 5 μmFMN, 200 μm NADPH, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0. Reactions were done at 37 °C for 5 min, then stopped by adding 1 ml of chilled 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 2 mm EDTA and 1 mml-citrulline. [3H]Citrulline was separated from [3H]l-Arg on Dowex-50 columns and measured by scintillation counting as described before (26Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). NOS dimerization was analyzed by gel filtration with a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column on an ÄKTA chromatography apparatus, at 10 °C. The flow rate was set to 0.3 ml.min−1 and the buffer used was 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 mNH4Cl. Samples of thiol-free NOS (400 μl; 1.6 μm) were treated with PMPS (0.15 mm) for 3 min on ice then either directly injected onto the column or re-reduced by adding l-cysteine (10 mm). Before PMPS-only samples were injected, a sample of PMPS (400 μl; 0.3 mm) was passed through the column. For samples to whichl-cysteine had been added, the column was first re-equilibrated in buffer supplemented with 10 mml-cysteine. For samples that had been preincubated with H4biopterin, the column was equilibrated in buffer containing 10 μm H4biopterin. Formation of SDS-resistant NOS dimers was investigated using the low temperature PAGE method of Klattet al. (8Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Enzyme samples were preincubated in a total volume of 70 μl at an NOS concentration of 1.6 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Some of the samples were preincubated with H4biopterin (0.2 mm) for 20 min on ice; of these, some were further treated with PMPS (0.15 mm) on ice for 3 min, before adding sample buffer. From each 70-μl preincubation, two portions of 32 μl each were taken and mixed with 8 μl of 5-fold Laemmli buffer, with (“reducing gel”) or without (“non-reducing gel”) 2-mercaptoethanol. The other components of the 5-fold sample buffer were 0.32 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.5m glycine, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, and 0.03% bromphenol blue (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Samples containing 8 μg of NOS were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5.5% SDS gels, using the Mini Protean II system from Bio-Rad (Vienna, Austria). Gels and buffers were equilibrated at 4 °C, and the buffer tank was cooled during electrophoresis in an ice bath. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R staining. Metal content of NOS samples was measured initially by on-line gel-filtration/ICP-MS with a Superose 6 column. Iron, zinc, and copper were detected in rat nNOS expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and in NOS isolated from pig brain (Fig. 1). The samples were also monitored for cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and vanadium, but none of these metals were detected. The pig brain NOS contained 0.60 mol of zinc and 0.35 mol of copper/mol of NOS; the baculovirus-expressed rat nNOS contained 0.49 ± 0.13 mol of zinc/mol of NOS and 1.35 ± 0.18 mol of copper/mol of NOS (means ± S.E. of three preparations). Values for the baculovirus-expressed rat nNOS, obtained with the SigmaChrom GPC 1300 column, are shown in TableI. We were surprised to find so much copper, and set out to characterize how tightly the metals were bound.Table IZinc, iron, and copper content of nNOSTreatmentMetal per NOS subunitIronZincCoppermolNo chelators added0.79 ± 0.070.50 ± 0.112.00 ± 0.58Column purged with DTPA1.01 ± 0.190.50 ± 0.041.23 ± 0.08DTPA added to samplesND 1-aND, not determined.0.28 ± 0.070.97 ± 0.24DTPA added to thiol-free samples0.76 ± 0.110.28 ± 0.03≤0.02Metal analysis was done by on-line gel-filtration/ICP-MS using a SigmaChrom GPC 1300 column.

Values are means ± S.E. of three preparations. First, we checked the effect of flushing our chromatography system with DTPA. In the initial samples, the small-molecule fraction at the end of the chromatograms had contained peaks of all metals (with no UV signal) 20- to 50-fold larger than those associated with NOS. Repeated injections of DTPA reduced these peaks to a ∼10-fold smaller value that was stable from the third injection onwards. After treating the column in this way, considerably less copper eluted with the NOS samples (Table I). When the column was flushed with DTPA as well as adding DTPA to the samples, the bound copper was reduced further and the bound zinc was almost halved (Table I). When NOS samples had been desalted to remove 2-mercaptoethanol prior to analysis, the zinc was not affected but bound copper was reduced to undetectable levels (TableI). Because a considerable fraction of the zinc bound to NOS was not removed by chelators and a previous study reported that use of oxidants was necessary to obtain release of the zinc (16Miller R.T. Martásek P. Raman C.S. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we tested the mercurial reagent PMPS, which is able to oxidize thiol groups reversibly, as a means of releasing zinc from NOS. Initially, we used the PAR assay to detect metal release. A maximal increase in absorbance at 500 nm was reached at about a 15-fold molar excess of PMPS over nNOS (data not shown); the absorbance changes were complete within 2 min (Fig.2). For baculovirus-expressed rat nNOS, we obtained an estimate of 0.49 ± 0.02 mol of zinc released per NOS subunit (mean ± S.E. of three preparations). We also measured release of zinc from NOS by PMPS using on-line gel-filtration/ICP-MS. Three-quarters of the bound zinc was released (from 0.28 ± 0.03 to 0.07 ± 0.01 mol of zinc/mol of NOS; means ± S.E. of three preparations). Thiol-free nNOS had a specific activity of 460 ± 20 nmol of citrulline.mg−1.min−1. PMPS-treated nNOS was strongly inactivated (residual activity 47 ± 22 nmol of citrulline.mg−1.min−1) and was nearly zinc-free (Fig. 3 B). When DTPA was present during the reaction with PMPS and the enzyme was subsequently reduced by l-cysteine, reincorporation of zinc could be limited to 43 ± 16% of the original value (Fig.3 C), or 0.12 ± 0.05 mol per NOS subunit. The reduced enzyme regained 93 ± 10% (426 ± 46 nmol of citrulline.mg−1.min−1) of the activity of non-PMPS-treated controls. We examined the effects of PMPS on dimerization of nNOS by gel filtration. Thiol-free nNOS treated with PMPS underwent substantial dissociation, from 83 ± 2% to 40 ± 3% dimer (means ± S.E. of three preparations) (Fig. 4, A andB). The monomers generated by PMPS treatment exhibited a peak in the 398-nm trace (dotted line in Fig.4 B). Addition of l-cysteine to the PMPS-oxidized enzyme resulted in a significant reversal of the dissociation, reaching a final value of 50 ± 4% dimer. l-Cysteine alone was found to cause a slight dissociation (to 65 ± 1% dimer). Because H4biopterin has been shown to stabilize NOS dimers, this experiment was repeated with nNOS that had been preincubated with a saturating concentration of H4biopterin before adding PMPS, and using an elution buffer supplemented with H4biopterin (Fig. 4, C and D). Under these conditions, PMPS treatment caused no significant dissociation (81 ± 3% to 79 ± 3% dimer). In the PAR assay, preincubation of thiol-free nNOS with H4biopterin did not affect the extent of zinc release. However, preincubation with H4biopterin did not prevent inactivation of the enzyme (to 7.6 ± 3.6% of controls; mean ± S.E. of three preparations). The ability of thiol-free nNOS to form SDS-resistant dimers was examined by low temperature SDS-PAGE (Fig.5). Samples that had been preincubated with or without H4biopterin and/or PMPS were split and subjected to electrophoresis under reducing (5% 2-mercaptoethanol (0.6m) in the sample buffer) or non-reducing (thiol-free sample buffer) conditions. On reducing gels, control samples to which no additions had been made contained a small proportion of SDS-resistant dimer (8.2 ± 3% (mean ± S.E. of three preparations)), which increased significantly in the samples preincubated with H4biopterin (to 38 ± 5%). This is the familiar behavior observed in earlier studies (8Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The same samples applied to non-reducing gels exhibited the same pattern, except that the basal formation of SDS-resistant dimer without added H4biopterin was more pronounced (20 ± 2%), rising to 38 ± 2% on preincubation with H4biopterin. Essentially the same behavior was observed for thiol-free nNOS. On reducing gels, H4biopterin increased the fraction of dimer present from 8.4 ± 2% to 41 ± 2%, and on non-reducing gels from 9.6 ± 5% to 23 ± 7%. However, on the non-reducing gels an additional band was observed above the “normal” SDS-resistant dimer. This species was resistant to heating at 95 °C (“boiled” sample on non-reducing gel) but disappeared when the same samples were electrophoresed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. When thiol-free nNOS that had been preincubated with H4biopterin was treated with PMPS, the “normal” SDS-resistant dimer band disappeared completely. The additional band of lower mobility was not affected. When a PMPS-treated sample was applied to a reducing gel, the SDS-resistant dimer content recovered to 23 ± 9%. “Normal” nNOS, which already contained 12 mm2-mercaptoethanol, was not affected by PMPS. Thus, as observed under native conditions, the effect of PMPS on SDS-resistant dimerization was antagonized by excess thiol. NO synthase has long been known to contain iron (28Mayer B. John M.

We report here that human Mrj, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein, directly binds to K18. Among the interactions between DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins and various intermediate filament proteins that we tested using two-hybrid methods, Mrj specifically interacted with K18. Immunostaining with anti-Mrj antibody showed that Mrj colocalized with K8/18 filaments in HeLa cells. Mrj was immunoprecipitated not only with K18, but also with the stress-induced and constitutively expressed heat shock protein Hsp/c70. Mrj bound to K18 through its C terminus and interacted with Hsp/c70 via its N terminus, which contains the J domain. Microinjection of anti-Mrj antibody resulted in the disorganization of K8/18 filaments, without effects on the organization of actin filaments and microtubules.

Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Although structural components of other major cytoskeletal proteins (actin and tubulin) are highly conserved in different cell types, the constituent proteins of IFs show intriguing molecular diversities and are expressed in tissue-specific programs, which makes them ideal molecular markers for the differentiation state in developmental biology and pathology (7Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic IFs are usually organized into 10-nm diameter fibers that are prevalent in the perinuclear region, where they appear to be attached to the outer nuclear envelope membrane or to nuclear pore complexes (4Skalli O. Goldman R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 19: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Continuous with this perinuclear array, IFs extend radially through the cytoplasm, eventually forming a close association with the plasma membrane. The intracellular IF networks were thought to be relatively stable in comparison with other cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments and microtubules; however, IFs have dynamic properties (8Inagaki M.

Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, keratin filaments are typically organized in a cytoplasmic reticular network of anastomosing filament bundles involving their noncovalent linkage at the surface of the nucleus and at cell adhesion complexes. This adhesion machinery consists of desmosomes, which mediate adhesion between cells, and hemidesmosomes, which mediate the adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basal lamina. One role that has been ascribed to various keratin filament networks of stratified squamous epithelia is to impart mechanical integrity to cells, without which the cells become fragile and prone to rupture (16Hutton E.

Among the positive clones, we identified two identical ones encoding the C-terminal portion of human Mrj, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein. We report evidence for the in vivo association of Mrj with K18 and suggest a possible role of the Mrj-Hsp/c70 chaperone in the regulation of K8/18 filament organization.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified Mrj, a recently cloned DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein, as a K18-binding protein using the yeast two-hybrid system, biochemical analysis, and cell biological techniques. The human Mrj gene has been mapped to the chromosome 11q25 region, and the open reading frame of the gene encodes a protein of 242 amino acid residues containing a canonical J domain, a highly conserved 70-amino acid region at the N-terminal end of DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins, and a glycine/phenylalanine-rich domain, which is also present in DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins (Fig.1 A) (40Seki N. Hattori A. Hayashi A. Kozuma S. Miyajima N. Saito T. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mouse homozygous Mrj mutants died at mid-gestation due to a failure of chorioallantoic fusion at embryonic day 8.5, of which the molecular mechanism is unknown (39Hunter P.J. Swanson B.J. Haendel M.A. Lyons G.E. Cross J.C. Development. 1999; 126: 1247-1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We addressed that one of the specific functions of Mrj may be to regulate K8/18 filament organization.The DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins work together with the DnaK/Hsp70 class of chaperones, which comprise a set of abundant cellular machines that assist a large variety of protein folding processes in almost all cellular compartments (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar, 44Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). The J domain of DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins is essential to stimulate the weak intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70 proteins (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar, 44Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Since Hsp70 proteins have a very broad substrate specificity (45Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 46Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.E. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 47James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that some of the DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins act as specialized co-chaperones that recruit an Hsp70 protein to a specific set of substrates (48Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 49Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 50Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Hsp/c70 has been reported to be associated with K8/18 via direct binding to K8, although the nature of the relationship between Hsp/c70 and K8/18 remains uncertain (30Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Ghori N. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 915-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We showed here that Mrj was associated in vitro with K8/18 filaments via direct binding to K18 using a co-sedimentation assay. In a two-hybrid assay, Mrj interacted strongly with K18, but not with other IF proteins, including K5, K8, K14, vimentin, GFAP, and desmin. Among the interactions between DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins and various IF proteins that we have thus far tested using the two-hybrid method, only the Mrj-K18 interaction was apparently positive. Mrj was associated in vivo with K18 and Hsp/c70 and colocalized with K8/18 filaments. Mrj interacted with Hsc70 via its N terminus-containing J domain and bound to K18 through its C terminus. These results suggest that Mrj may act as a K18 (K8/18)-specific adaptor protein to link K18 (K8/18) to the Hsp/c70 chaperone. Furthermore, microinjection of anti-Mrj antibody resulted in the disorganization of K8/18 filaments, indicating that Mrj plays an indispensable role in the organization of K8/18 filaments in vivo.In HeLa cells, the overexpression of the N-terminal region of Mrj (Myc-Mrj-N2) resulted in the disruption not only of K8/18 filaments, but also of actin filaments, microtubules, and vimentin filaments. Because Mrj-N2 can interact with Hsc70, but not with K18, the overexpressed Myc-Mrj-N2 protein would be initially expected to dominant-negatively inhibit the specific interaction between endogenous Mrj and Hsp/c70. As described above, Michels et al. (42Michels A.A. Kanon B. Bensaude O. Kampinga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36757-36763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) recently reported that the overexpression of a truncated protein restricted to the J domain of Hsp40 showed dominant-negative effects on the chaperone activity of Hsp70 in a living cell. Therefore, the effects of the overexpression of Myc-Mrj-N2 on major cytoskeletal systems observed in this study might be caused by the disturbance of some or overall functions of the Hsp/c70 chaperone system rather than by the specific inhibition of the Mrj-Hsp/c70 interaction. If this is the case, these results indicate a possibility that Hsp/c70 chaperones may play an important role in the regulation of the organization of actin filaments, microtubules, and vimentin filaments as well as K8/18 filaments. In addition, it is tempting to speculate that there may exist some specific DnaJ/Hsp40 family proteins that link actin, tubulin, or various IF proteins to Hsp/c70 (Fig.7). In support of this idea, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting an intimate relationship between the cytoskeleton and molecular chaperones, including the Hsp/c70 family (51Liang P. MacRae T.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, it was genetically demonstrated that Ssa1p (yeast cytosolic Hsp70) and Ydj1p (yeast cytosolic DnaJ homologue) play a role in the regulation of microtubule formation (52Oka M. Nakai M. Endo T. Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29727-29737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was also reported that in human gastric cancer cells, overexpressed BAG-1, a negative regulator of Hsp/c70 chaperone activity, colocalizes with keratin filaments as well as actin filaments and promoted cell migration (53Naishiro Y. Adachi M. Okuda H. Yawata A. Mitaka T. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3244-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations will shed new light on a possible role of the Hsp/c70 chaperone in the regulation of cytoskeletons.αB-crystallin and Hsp27, members of the small Hsp family, were reported to be associated with both soluble and filamentous IF proteins, including GFAP, vimentin, and keratin (54Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 55Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den IJssel P. Prescott A. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro polymerization of GFAP and vimentin is repressed by αB-crystallin (54Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) as well as by Hsp27 (55Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den IJssel P. Prescott A. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A physiological role for αB-crystallin with IFs was further demonstrated by a recent report describing that a mutation in the αB-crystallin gene causes desmin aggregation in certain myopathies called desmin-related myopathies (56Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). As for the pathological aggregation of K8/18, it is well known that Mallory bodies in the livers of human patients with alcoholic hepatitis and of griseofulvin-treated mice are the cytoplasmic accumulation of K8/18-containing aggregates (57Denk H. Gschnait F. Wolff K. Lab. Invest. 1975; 32: 773-776PubMed Google Scholar, 58Franke W.W. Denk H. Schmid E. Osborn M. Weber K. Lab. Invest. 1979; 40: 207-220PubMed Google Scholar, 59Jensen K. Gluud C. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 1330-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 60Jensen K. Gluud C. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As described earlier, old K18 null mice developed a distinctive liver pathology with abnormal hepatocytes containing K8-positive aggregates that resembled Mallory bodies (24Magin T.M. Schroder R. Leitgeb S. Wanninger F. Zatloukal K. Grund C. Melton D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The finding that K8/18 filament organization may be regulated by the Mrj-Hsp/c70 chaperone will provide a new clue to dissect the mechanism of the formation of Mallory bodies.Assembly and disassembly of IF organization are regulated by the site-specific phosphorylation state of IFs, and these phosphorylations are spatially and temporally regulated during cellular events, including mitosis (9Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Inagaki M. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Matsuyama M. Sato C. Nature. 1987; 328: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 11Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated by purified protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, or cAMP-dependent kinase, K8/18 filaments reconstituted in vitro undergo complete disassembly, and there is a significant release of soluble K8 and K18 proteins from the keratin filaments (12Yano T. Tokui T. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Shibata M. Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the increase in K8/18 phosphorylation is associated with the binding of the soluble fraction of K8/18 to 14-3-3 proteins (33Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because Mrj is associated with both soluble and filamentous K8/18, it is likely that the phosphorylation state of K8/18 may not directly affect the association of Mrj with K8/18. The relationship between the phosphorylation-dependent and Mrj-dependent regulation of K8/18 filaments needs to be investigated in the future.In conclusion, we are the first to report that human Mrj proteins directly interact with K18 and might regulate K8/18 filament organization as K18-specific co-chaperones working together with Hsp/c70. These observations will pave the way toward further research on K8/18 filament organization as well as understanding the pathological mechanisms of Mallory body formation. Intermediate filaments (IFs)1 are major components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear envelope in most types of eukaryotic cells (1Lazarides E.

Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Although structural components of other major cytoskeletal proteins (actin and tubulin) are highly conserved in different cell types, the constituent proteins of IFs show intriguing molecular diversities and are expressed in tissue-specific programs, which makes them ideal molecular markers for the differentiation state in developmental biology and pathology (7Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic IFs are usually organized into 10-nm diameter fibers that are prevalent in the perinuclear region, where they appear to be attached to the outer nuclear envelope membrane or to nuclear pore complexes (4Skalli O. Goldman R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 19: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Continuous with this perinuclear array, IFs extend radially through the cytoplasm, eventually forming a close association with the plasma membrane. The intracellular IF networks were thought to be relatively stable in comparison with other cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments and microtubules; however, IFs have dynamic properties (8Inagaki M. Nakamura Y. Takeda M. Nishimura T. Inagaki N. Brain Pathol. 1994; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Accumulating data strongly suggest that assembly and disassembly of IF organization are regulated by the site-specific phosphorylation state of IFs (9Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Inagaki M. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Matsuyama M. Sato C.

The keratin subfamily, which is preferentially expressed in epithelial cells, has over 20 members (keratins 1–20) that form obligate noncovalent heteropolymers of at least one type I keratin (keratins 9–20) and one type II keratin (keratins 1–8) (15Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, keratin filaments are typically organized in a cytoplasmic reticular network of anastomosing filament bundles involving their noncovalent linkage at the surface of the nucleus and at cell adhesion complexes. This adhesion machinery consists of desmosomes, which mediate adhesion between cells, and hemidesmosomes, which mediate the adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basal lamina. One role that has been ascribed to various keratin filament networks of stratified squamous epithelia is to impart mechanical integrity to cells, without which the cells become fragile and prone to rupture (16Hutton E. Paladini R.D., Yu, Q.C. Yen M. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1329-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) results in lysis of the targeted cell population whenever the skin of such mice is subjected to trivial mechanical trauma. Mutations in keratin genes, weakening the structural framework of cells, increase the risk of cell rupture and cause a variety of human skin disorders (6Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 21Coulombe P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are the major components of the IFs of simple or single-layered epithelia, as found in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and exocrine pancreas, from which many carcinomas arise. Gene targeting techniques have been used to elucidate the function of K8/18. K8 knockout mice in one strain died around day 12 from undetermined tissue damage (22Baribault H. Price J. Miyai K. Oshima R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1191-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), whereas in a different strain, they survived to adulthood, but colorectal hyperplasia and inflammation were present (23Baribault H. Penner J. Iozzo R.V. Wilson-Heiner M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2964-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). K18 null mice were fertile and had a normal life span, whereas old K18 null mice developed a distinct liver pathology with abnormal hepatocytes containing K8-positive aggregates that resembled the Mallory bodies seen in human livers with alcoholic hepatitis (24Magin T.M. Schroder R. Leitgeb S. Wanninger F. Zatloukal K. Grund C. Melton D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Together with the report describing a mutation in the K18 gene in a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis (25Ku N.O. Wright T.L. Terrault N.A. Gish R. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), additional work has indicated that K18 mutations may possibly cause or result in a predisposition to liver disease (26Omary M.B.

Here we characterize a physical association between the integrins α3β1 and α6β1 and CD36 on the surface of melanoma cells and show that ectopic expression of CD36 by CD36-negative MV3 melanoma cells increases their haptotactic migration on extracellular matrix components. The association was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, reimmunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting of surface-labeled cells lysed in Brij 96 detergent. Confocal microscopy illustrated the co-association of α3 and CD36 in cell membrane projections and ruffles. A requirement for the extracellular domain of CD36 in this association was shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using surface-labeled MV3 melanoma or COS-7 cells that had been transiently transfected with chimeric constructs between CD36 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) or with a truncation mutant of CD36. CD36 is known to engage in signal transduction and to localize to membrane microdomains or rafts in several cell types. Toward a mechanistic explanation for the functional effects of CD36 expression, we demonstrate that in fractionated Triton X-100 lysates of the MV3 cells stably transfected with CD36, CD36 was greatly enriched with the detergent-insoluble fractions that represent plasma membrane rafts. Significantly, when these fractionated lysates were reprobed for endogenous β1 integrin, it was found that a 4-fold increase in the proportion of the mature protein was contained within the detergent-insoluble fractions when extracted from the CD36-transfected cells compared with MV3 cells transfected with vector only. These results suggest that in melanoma cells CD36 expression may induce the sequestration of certain integrins into membrane microdomains and promote cell migration.

Integrin function extends beyond cell adhesion per se, and integrin-mediated signaling influences a range of biological processes including cellular division and migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Hynes R.O.

Integrin function is complex and is regulated at many levels. The binding of ligand to integrins can initiate signaling (1Hynes R.O.

Much emphasis has also focused on the process of “inside-out” signaling, where intracellular events enacted through the relatively short cytoplasmic tail sequences of integrins have a profound influence on the extracellular function of the integrin (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8739) Google Scholar). In addition to the molecular interactions occurring between cytoplasmic proteins and the cytoplasmic domains of integrins (reviewed in Refs. 11Dedhar S.

Several classes of cell surface glycoproteins have been documented to play a role in integrin-mediated events, the most widely studied being the integrin-associated protein (IAP1/CD47) and the unrelated transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF or tetraspannins). IAP associates with the αvβ3 integrin (13Brown E.J. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and influences integrin-mediated signal transduction, phagocytosis, cellular migration, and chemotaxis (14Zhou M.-J.

In vascular smooth muscle cells IAP also associates with the α2β1 integrin and modulates the chemotactic response of these cells to soluble collagen (18Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Numerous TM4SF members have been shown to associate with β1 integrins and with other TM4SF members (19Slupsky J.R. Seehafer J.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For example, the TM4SF molecule CD63 has been shown to specifically associate with α3β1 and α6β1 integrins (21Berditchevski F. Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17784-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the CD63-α3β1 complex was found to be associated with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity, suggesting a novel integrin-signaling pathway (28Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection studies with CD63 in a melanoma cell line resulted in marked inhibition of cell motility, an effect probably mediated by its influence on β1 integrin function (29Radford K.R. Thorne R.F. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3353-3358PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, another TM4SF member, CD9, also has been shown to associate with β1integrins and to be implicated in cellular signaling, adhesion, motility, and differentiation (19Slupsky J.R.

Cell Adhesion Commun. 1996; 4: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is believed that both IAP and the TM4SF molecules complex with integrins via extracellular domains, since the Ig domain of IAP is essential for effects on αvβ3 integrin function (33Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the β1 integrin association with CD63 occurs independently of the integrin α-subunit cytoplasmic tail (20Rubenstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More recently, Yaunch et al. (34Yauch R.L. Kazarov A.R. Desai B. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9230-9238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) demonstrated using chimeras that the CD151 (TM4SF)/α3β1 association required extracellular domains found in CD151 and the α-chain of the integrin. Furthermore, in K562 cells, in which the α4β7 integrin initiates cell adhesion under flow conditions, the extracellular domains of the integrin determine its localization to microvilli, where both IAP and TM4SF proteins were also found to be strongly concentrated (35Abitorabi M.A. Pachynski R.K. Ferrando R.E. Tidswell M. Erle D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Given the ubiquitous expression of both IAP and TM4SF, this suggests that regulation of integrin localization and function by these accessory molecules may play a widespread role in cellular processes. Other surface molecules have also been implicated in the modulation of integrin-mediated functions. The widely expressed CD98 molecule (initially described as an early T-cell activation antigen) was found to regulate β1 integrin activation in a genetic complementation assay (36Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and a physical association between CD98 and certain β1 integrins has recently been described (cited in Ref. 36Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar); in the case of CD98, however, the association with β1 integrins appears to occur between cytosolic domains of the two glycoproteins. The CD98 interaction with β1integrins appears to modulate the activation of T-cells (38Chandrasekaran S. Guo N.H. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) as well as the adhesion of breast carcinoma cells (39Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Other examples of integrin-associated molecules that may modify or regulate integrin function include the ErbB-2 oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with breast cancer progression in vivo. This interaction demonstrated to facilitate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent in vitro cell invasion by erbB-2-transformed 3T3 cells (39Gambaletta D. Marchetti A. Benedetti L. Mercurio A.M. Sacchi A Falcioni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10604-10610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cancer metastasis-promoting molecule, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) also associates with and regulates β1 and β2 integrin function (40Wei Y. Lukashev M Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Another candidate co-associated regulator of integrin-function is the transmembrane glycoprotein CD36. The archetype member of a small gene family, CD36 is unrelated to integrins or to currently known integrin-accessory molecules. CD36 expression is prominent on the surface of platelets, capillary endothelial cells, macrophages, and cultured cell lines from a variety of sources including melanoma (reviewed in Refs. 41Greenwalt D.E. Lipsky R.H. Ockenhouse C.F. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 42Thorne R.F. Dorahy D.J. Wilkinson R.M. Burns G.F. Berndt M. Thrombosis and the Vessel Wall. Harwood Academic Publishers, Chur, Switzerland2000: 149-172Google Scholar). A study using chemical cross-linking demonstrated that CD36 is spatially associated with the αIIbβ3 integrin on the surface of platelets (43Dorahy D.J. Berndt M.C. Shafren D.R. Burns G.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and although the functional consequence of this association is not known, it has been shown that platelet activation achieved by the addition of anti-CD36 antibodies involves signaling through this integrin (44Aiken M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Byers-Ward V. Plow E.F. Blood. 1990; 76: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mazurov A.V. Vinogradov D.V. Vlasik T.N. Burns G.F. Berndt M.C. Platelets. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is not known whether CD36 directly associates with integrins on other cell types (12Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), but there are several lines of evidence to suggest that certain functions ascribed to CD36 directly involve or implicate involvement of integrins. The phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophage requires the coordinate function of CD36 and the αvβ3integrin, possibly with involvement of the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin functioning as a molecular bridge (46Savill J. Nancy H. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Additionally, both CD36 and the αvβ5 integrin have been shown to be involved in the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor rod outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial cells (47Ryeom S. Sparrow J. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD36 functions as an adhesive cellular receptor for both thrombospondin (49Asch A.S. Barnwell J. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and collagen (50Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specificities that also overlap with integrins of both the αv and β1integrin subfamilies (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8739) Google Scholar, 11Dedhar S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of C32 melanoma cells into populations expressing either high or low levels of CD36 showed that high CD36 expression defined a more fibroblastoid cell phenotype, with this population demonstrating enhanced tumor growth and motility in in vivo studies using nude mice (51Wong J.E.L. Asch A.S. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. Blood. 1989; 74 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 638Google Scholar). Additionally, transfection of CD36 into human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in aberrant morphological changes affecting in vitro tube formation (52Dawson D.W. Pearce F.A. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that certain functions attributed to CD36 directly involve or implicate involvement of integrins, particularly phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and migration. How this accessory function is enacted is not known. Possibly significant in this regard is the reported association of CD36 with plasma membrane microdomains or “rafts” enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycolipids. Rafts can be isolated biochemically as low density Triton X-100-insoluble membranes, and such isolates have been termed detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched complexes (DIGs), also described as DRMs, GEMs, TIM, TIFF, and LDTI (reviewed in (53Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 54Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7622) Google Scholar, 55Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar)). CD36 was found to be highly enriched in DIGs from a variety of cellular sources including lung endothelium (56Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), platelets (57Dorahy D.J. Lincz L.F. Meldrum C.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and transfected COS-7 cells (58Thorne R.F. Meldrum C.J. Harris S.J. Dorahy D.J. Shafren D.R. Berndt M.C. Burns G.F. Gibson P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Raft domains have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, cholesterol homeostasis, the regulation of apoptosis, and cell motility (53Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 54Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7622) Google Scholar, 55Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 59Ko Y.G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane invaginations known as caveolae may represent a specialized structural form incorporating raft components contained within the structural coat protein caveolin (61Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). Early studies suggested that integrins were not compartmentalized to rafts/caveolae (56Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 62Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), but subsequent reports have indicated that a proportion of β1 integrins may physically and functionally associate with caveolin. For example, caveolin-1 can function to link Fyn kinase with the α1 integrin subunit, this resulting in downstream signaling promoting cell cycling (63Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Furthermore the GPI-linked uPAR, β1integrins and caveolin-1 co-immunoprecipitate in a single complex, and this complex appeared necessary for integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling (40Wei Y. Lukashev M Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 64Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Interestingly some Src-family kinases, including Fyn, Lyn, and Yes known to associate with CD36 (65Huang M.-M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7844-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 66Bull H.A. Brickell P.M. Dowd P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) are also associated with DIGs (56Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 57Dorahy D.J. Lincz L.F. Meldrum C.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 67Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD36 signaling and perhaps other CD36-mediated functions may be enacted via raft domains. The present study was initiated to examine further the reported effect of CD36 on melanoma cell morphology and growth (51Wong J.E.L. Asch A.S. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. Blood. 1989; 74 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): 638Google Scholar). A melanoma cell line that did not express endogenous CD36 was identified, and permanent CD36 transfectants were isolated. No differences were found in the morphology or growth rates of the transfectants compared with the parent cell line, but the CD36-transfected cells displayed higher haptotactic migration on extracellular matrix substrates. The possibility that integrins might be implicated in this functional effect was investigated by seeking a co-association between CD36 and endogenous integrins on the melanoma cell surface. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a physical association between CD36 and the integrins α3β1 and α6β1, and this association was also shown on C32 melanoma cells expressing endogenous CD36. We then used transient transfection of chimeric constructs of CD36 to demonstrate that the association between CD36 and β1 integrins requires the extracellular domain of the CD36 molecule. Finally, this association may occur within raft domains/DIGs, since ectopic expression of CD36 increased the proportion of β1integrin(s) found within this fraction. The MV3 melanoma cell line (a gift of Dr. G. N. P. van Muijen) was isolated from a lymph node metastasis as described previously (68van Muijen G.N.P. Jansen K.F.J. Cornelissen M.H.A. Smeets D.F.C.M.

C32 and WM115 melanoma and COS-7 monkey kidney cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CSL, Parkville, Australia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cytosystems, Castle Hill, Australia). The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 13 and 16 directed against the β1 and α5 integrin subunits, respectively, and polyclonal (pAb) anti-β1 integrin (69Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Dr. Ken Yamada (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). mAbs 13C2 and 23C6, directed against the αv integrin subunit and the αvβ3 complex, respectively, were gifts from Dr. M. Horton (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London). AK7 (anti-α2integrin), VM58 (anti-CD36) mAbs, and affinity-purified polyclonal anti-CD36 (70Berger G. Caen J.P. Berndt M.C. Cramer E.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3034-3044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. M. C. Berndt (Baker Institute, Victoria, Australia). IH4 anti-ICAM-1 and IA7 and IE8 anti-CD36 mAbs were provided by Dr. A. W. Boyd (Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Australia). E7P6 against β6 integrin was provided by Dr. M. V. Agrez (University of Newcastle, Australia). Polyclonal anti-calreticulin (LAR-090) and FMC56 (anti-CD9 mAb) were gifts of Dr. S. Dedhar (University of British Columbia, Canada) and Dr. H. Zola (Flinders Medical Center, Adelaide, Australia), respectively. mAb 11H5 directed against CD36 was provided by Dr. P. Simmons (Hanson Center, Adelaide). HB57 (anti-human μ chain), L230 (anti-αv integrin), and AP3 (anti-β3integrin) were obtained from the ATCC. Mouse anti-α1, α4, and α6 integrin subunits (TS2/7, 44H6, and 4F10, respectively) and the anti-α2 and α6 fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates (AK7 and 4F10) were purchased from Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, UK). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-α3 integrin was from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). P1B5 (anti-α3 integrin), M2 (anti-FLAG), and nonimmune mouse serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Eastman Kodak Co., and Vet Services (Adelaide, Australia), respectively. Polyclonal anti-caveolin was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The human cDNAs for CD36 (a gift of Dr. A. W. Boyd) and ICAM-1 (gift of Dr. D. Simmons, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) in the pCDM8 vector were subcloned to the high level eukaryotic expression vector pEF.BOS (71Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) using XbaI restriction endonuclease digestion. To substitute the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD36 with the ICAM-1 cytoplasmic tail (CD36/ICAM tail chimera) the pEF.BOS.ICAM-1 plasmid was used as template for polymerase chain reaction amplification using oligonucleotides 5′-cGcAtGcctctataaccgccagcggaag-3′ and 5′-ccccagggccatgcctcccagc-3′, which introduced an SphI restriction site to the 5′-end of the product (mismatched oligonucleotide bases are represented in uppercase type). Following digestion withSphI/MscI, the resulting fragment was then subcloned to an MscI/SphI partially digested “vector” fragment of pEF.BOS.CD36, thereby inserting the 31-amino acid ICAM-1 cytoplasmic tail following CD36 cysteine residue 466. A chimera consisting of the amino terminus of ICAM-1 and the CD36 carboxyl-terminal transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail (ICAM/CD36) was prepared by digestion of pEF.BOS.CD36 and pEF.BOS.ICAM-1 plasmid DNA with HincII/MscI andMscI restriction endonucleases, respectively. TheMscI fragment encoding the 5′-sequence of ICAM-1 and theHincII/MscI fragment encoding the 3′ sequence of CD36 were ligated together, resulting in the ICAM-1 extracellular region amino acids 1–409 fused to residues 390–472 of CD36.

https://openalex.org/W2035582882,"Although sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) participates in the uptake and intracellular trafficking of cholesterol, its effect on “reverse cholesterol transport” has not been explored. As shown herein, SCP-2 expression inhibited high density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated efflux of [3H]cholesterol and fluorescent 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3b-ol (NBD-cholesterol) up to 61 and 157%, respectively. Confocal microscopy of living cells allowed kinetic analysis of two intracellular pools of HDL-mediated NBD-cholesterol efflux: the highly fluorescent lipid droplet pool and the less fluorescent pool outside the lipid droplets, designated the cytoplasmic compartment. Both the whole cell and the cytoplasmic compartment exhibited two similar kinetic pools, the half-times of which were consistent with protein (t b12 near 1 min) and vesicular (t d12 = 10–20 min) mediated sterol transfer. Although SCP-2 expression did not alter cytoplasmic sterol pool sizes, the rapid t b12 decreased 36%, while the slower t d12 increased 113%. Lipid droplets also exhibited two kinetic pools of NBD-cholesterol efflux but with half-times over 200% shorter than those of the cytoplasmic compartment. The lipid droplet slower effluxing pool size and t d12 were increased 48% and 115%, respectively, in SCP-2-expressing cells. Concomitantly, the level of the lipid droplet-specific adipose differentiation-related protein decreased 70%. Overall, HDL-mediated sterol efflux from L-cell fibroblasts reflected that of the cytoplasmic rather than lipid droplet compartment. SCP-2 differentially modulated sterol efflux from the two cytoplasmic pools. However, net efflux was determined primarily by inhibition of the slowly effluxing pool rather than by acceleration of the rapid protein-mediated pool. Finally, SCP-2 expression also inhibited sterol efflux from lipid droplets, an effect related to decreased adipose differentiation-related protein, a lipid droplet surface protein that binds cholesterol with high affinity. Although sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) participates in the uptake and intracellular trafficking of cholesterol, its effect on “reverse cholesterol transport” has not been explored. As shown herein, SCP-2 expression inhibited high density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated efflux of [3H]cholesterol and fluorescent 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3b-ol (NBD-cholesterol) up to 61 and 157%, respectively. Confocal microscopy of living cells allowed kinetic analysis of two intracellular pools of HDL-mediated NBD-cholesterol efflux: the highly fluorescent lipid droplet pool and the less fluorescent pool outside the lipid droplets, designated the cytoplasmic compartment. Both the whole cell and the cytoplasmic compartment exhibited two similar kinetic pools, the half-times of which were consistent with protein (t b12 near 1 min) and vesicular (t d12 = 10–20 min) mediated sterol transfer. Although SCP-2 expression did not alter cytoplasmic sterol pool sizes, the rapid t b12 decreased 36%, while the slower t d12 increased 113%. Lipid droplets also exhibited two kinetic pools of NBD-cholesterol efflux but with half-times over 200% shorter than those of the cytoplasmic compartment.

Most of the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is localized in lateral domains that are, for the most part, relatively inert in terms of transfer kinetics (i.e. t 12 = hours to days), and movement between such domains is also slow. However, a small pool of plasma membrane cholesterol appears highly dynamic (reviewed in Ref. 6Schroeder F. Frolov A.A. Murphy E.J. Atshaves B.P. Jefferson J.R. Pu L. Wood W.G. Foxworth W.B.

Molecular details of cholesterol entry/exit, cholesterol organization, and mechanism(s) of cholesterol transbilayer movement in caveolae remain to be determined. Likewise, the relationships between caveolae, “rafts,” and other cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains is not yet clear (reviewed in Ref. 9Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1998: 273-288Crossref Google Scholar). The intracellular steps preceding cellular cholesterol efflux include transfer of cholesterol from the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid droplets to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Fielding C.J.

The time frame of bidirectional vesicular transfer of cholesterol between plasma membranes and Golgi has a t 12 of 10–20 min (reviewed in Refs. 8Smart E.J. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Chang T.Y.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1998: 93-121Crossref Google Scholar). Alternately, molecular cholesterol transfer, mediated by cholesterol-binding proteins in the cytoplasm, occurs much faster (t 12 near 1–2 min) from the lysosome (exogenous cholesterol) to the plasma membrane (20Brasaemle D.L.

Which one (or both) of the processes participate in cholesterol trafficking from lipid droplets, a primary site of cholesterol storage, is presently unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to visualize three aspects of cholesterol efflux in intact cells. (i) To determine the role of SCP-2 in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Previously it was shown that SCP-2 stimulates biliary cholesterol secretion (23Ito T. Kawata S. Imai Y. Kakimoto H. Trzaskos J. Matsuzawa Y. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1619-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Fuchs M. Lammert F. Wang D.Q.H. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Cohen D.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6490-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). (ii) To address the lack of information regarding the lipid droplet as a source for cholesterol efflux via the HDL pathway. Lipid droplets contain a surface coat of cholesterol and phospholipid surrounding a cholesterol ester/triglyceride core (26Bisgaier C.L. Chanderbhan R. Hinds R.W. Vahouny G.V. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,27Chanderbhan R.F. Kharroubi A. Pastuszyn A. Gallo L.L. Scallen T. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1998: 197-212Crossref Google Scholar). Further, the lipid droplet surface monolayer contains unique proteins including perilipin and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), neither of whose function is well understood (28Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J. Kimmel A.R. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Because ADRP binds cholesterol, this suggests a potential role of this protein in cholesterol trafficking from the lipid droplet (29Frolov A. Petrescu A. Atshaves B.P. So P.T.C. Gratton E. Serrero G. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12769-12780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). (iii) To examine the effect of SCP-2 expression on HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the lipid droplet. This possibility was suggested by the fact that SCP-2 stimulates cholesterol transfer from lipid droplets to mitochondria in adrenal cells (reviewed in Ref. 27Chanderbhan R.F. Kharroubi A. Pastuszyn A. Gallo L.L. Scallen T. Chang T.Y. Freeman D.A. Intracellular Cholesterol Trafficking. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1998: 197-212Crossref Google Scholar). The results presented herein provide fresh insights into the efflux process and for the first time establish new information demonstrating that SCP-2 expression: (i) inhibits HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and (ii) inhibits cholesterol efflux from a little understood, subcellular compartment, i.e. lipid droplets. [3H]Cholesterol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Sigma. HDL was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Lab-Tek Coverglass slides were from Fisher. NBD-cholesterol and Nile red were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sandoz 58-035 was a gift from T. Y. Chang (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). Rabbit polyclonal antisera to ADRP were prepared (30Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using ADRP generously provided by Dr. G. Serrero (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). Monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-scavenger receptor B1 antisera were from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). All reagents and solvents used were of the highest grade available and were cell culture tested. Murine L-cells (L arpt−tk−) were grown to confluency in Higuchi medium (31Schroeder F. Perlmutter J.F. Glaser M. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5015-5026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) as described (30Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Development of mock-transfected cells (designated as control) and cells transfected with cDNA corresponding to the 15-kDa pro-SCP-2 protein was as described earlier (30Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Moncecchi D.M. Murphy E.J. Prows D.R. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In high expression cells, SCP-2 comprised 0.036 + 0.002% of the total cytosolic proteins, whereas levels in the control and mock transfected cells were below the level of detectability. Cellular cholesterol and cholesterol ester mass were increased 20 and 100%, respectively, in the SCP-2 expression clones. For radiolabeled experiments, control and SCP-2 expressors were plated to 24-well plates at approximately 5 × 105 cells/well. For fluorescence imaging experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/chamber onto Lab-Tek Chamber Coverglass slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL). To ensure a monolayer, samples analyzed by imaging were examined within 20 h of seeding. Cells for radiolabeled experiments were treated as described below. Cholesterol efflux was done as described earlier (33Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Briefly, mock-transfected and SCP-2 expressors were plated in medium containing 1 μCi/ml of [3H]cholesterol and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (1 ml/well) overnight. The medium was then replaced with medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin to allow equilibration between different cholesterol pools. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. HDL at indicated concentrations was then added, and radiolabeled aliquots (50 μl) were removed at indicated time points and counted. At the end of the time course, the monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH (500 μl) overnight, and protein was determined (34Bradford M. Anal. Biochemistry. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, Sandoz 58-035 was included during labeling and equilibration to eliminate competition by intracellular [3H]cholesterol esterification. Extra wells without acceptor were harvested at the beginning of the time course to determine the initial [3H]cholesterol for each cell line. Efflux was determined from the fraction of [3H]cholesterol remaining in the cell at different time points. Data points were fitted to the single exponential decay curvey = Ae −kt + C, wherey is the fraction of initial cellular [3H]cholesterol remaining in the cells at timet; A is the cholesterol pool size available for efflux; and k is the apparent rate constant. Half-times (t 12) were determined from the equationt 12 = ln2/k. Half-time and k values were apparent values because of dependence on HDL acceptor concentrations. Confocal fluorescence imaging was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System. Confocal and co-localized images were acquired using multiple photomultiplier tubes under the control of LaserSharp v.3.2 software (Bio-Rad). For probe excitation, the MRC-1024 system utilized a 15 mW krypton-argon laser (American Laser Corp., Salt Lake City, UT) with a 5 mW output. Cells cultured on coverslips were placed on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and examined with a 63× oil immersion, infinity objective (numerical aperture 1.4). Fluorescence emission was detected using 488 nm excitation and a 540/32 band path emission filter for NBD-cholesterol (green channel) and 568 nm excitation with a HQ598/40 band path emission filter for Nile red (red channel). Samples were exposed to the light source for minimal time periods to minimize photobleaching effects. Image files were analyzed using either Metamorph software (West Chester, PA) or NIH Image, a program written by W. Rasband and available by anonymous FTP. To perform the efflux experiments, cells were first loaded with NBD-cholesterol (0.35 μm) in medium containing 2.5% FBS for 1 h in a 37 °C CO2incubator. Because only 7.8% of NBD-cholesterol is esterified at 24 h (29Frolov A. Petrescu A. Atshaves B.P. So P.T.C. Gratton E. Serrero G. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12769-12780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor was not used for the fluorescence experiments for the comparatively short (40 min) incubation time used herein. After loading, the cells were washed twice with Puck's buffer (1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.9 mmH2PO4, 5.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgSO4, 6 mm glucose, 138 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES) and placed in serum-free medium. A medial section passing through 5–10 cells was selected, and the section was scanned for initial fluorescence intensity of NBD-cholesterol. HDL was added to start the efflux experiment. The fluorescence in the total area of each cell was measured over time and was used to gauge the extent of NBD-cholesterol efflux from the cell. Three types of co-localization studies were performed to determine the identity of high intensity regions of NBD-cholesterol visible within the cell. First, NBD-cholesterol was co-localized with Nile red, a lipid stain. Second, Nile red was co-localized with ADRP, a protein closely associated with lipid droplets. Third, NBD-cholesterol was co-localized with ADRP. Cells overexpressing SCP-2 were incubated with both NBD-cholesterol (0.35 μm) and Nile red (0.4 μm) for 30 min in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. Although Nile red is known to stain other nonlipidic structures, care was taken to titer both Nile red and NBD-cholesterol to low levels to give a low cytoplasmic background with emphasis on lipid droplet staining in the co-localization experiments. However, it should be noted that Nile red and NBD-cholesterol are also located in sites outside lipid droplets where they also co-localize to a large degree. After incubation, cells were washed with Puck's buffer and then simultaneously imaged for NBD-cholesterol (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 540/30; green channel) and Nile red (excitation, 568 nm; emission, HQ598/40; red channel). The confocal images from the green and red channels were merged and appeared yellow where superimposition occurred (red and green are additive and yield yellow to orange in RGB color space). Pixel fluorograms were constructed, and correlation coefficients generated from the fluorograms were derived from the following equations as described earlier (35Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microscopy. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). Cred=∑iRi,coloc∑iRiEquation 1 Cgreen=∑iGi,coloc∑iGiEquation 2 where R i, coloc is the sum of intensities of all red pixels which also have a green component;R i is the sum of intensities of all red pixels in the image; G i, coloc is the sum of intensities of all green pixels, which also have a red component; andG i is sum of intensities of all the green pixels in the image. To co-localize ADRP with Nile red or with NBD-cholesterol, SCP-2 expressors were plated on 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at subconfluency. The cells were washed with serum-free medium and incubated with 0.005% of either Nile red or NBD-cholesterol in serum-free medium for 30 min, at 37 °C. Cells were washed with Hanks' solution, fixed with 70:30 (v/v) acetone:ethanol for 10 min at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in Hanks' for 5 min at room temperature, and then blocked with 10% FBS in Hanks' for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-ADRP (rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse ADRP, affinity purified, concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml; dilution, 1:20) was incubated in 5% FBS in Hanks' for 1 h at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with 2% FBS in Hanks' buffer. Next, the cells were incubated with either goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (for the ADRP/Nile red co-localization) or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas red (for the ADRP/NBD-cholesterol co-localization) for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash with Hanks', cells were mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's procedure and were visualized with the MRC1024 laser scanning system as described above. NBD-cholesterol efflux from the whole cell was compared with that arising from two compartments designated as lipid droplets (based on the above co-localization data) or cytoplasmic (defined as the nonlipid droplet, lower intensity, diffuse pattern of the remaining NBD-cholesterol fluorescence in the cell). Cells were imaged and analyzed by Metamorph software to graphically determine the separate contributions of the efflux process. Data points were fitted to either a biexponential (y =Ae − bt +Ce − dt ) or multiparameter (y = (Ae −bT 0 +Ce −dT 0)(e −h(t−T 0)) exponential decay equation where y was the fraction of initial cellular NBD-cholesterol remaining in the cells at timet; A and C were the size of the cholesterol pools available for efflux; b, d, andh were the apparent rate constants; andT 0 was the time at which depletion of the pools increased to completion. The multiparameter equation was employed to adjust for an inflection point observed in the time course data obtained from both control and SCP-2 overexpressors. It appeared that at some time T 0, the rate of efflux was altered, which effected a decrease in the half-life. To compare the data, a model was developed that allowed for the initial decay curve (Ae − bt +Ce−d t ) to be modified at someT 0 to become (Ae −bT 0 +Ce −dT 0)e −h(t−T 0). Using a nonlinear least squares routine in Sigma Plot 4.0, all parameters were obtained simultaneously from the fitted data. Unique fittings were obtained individually for each time course involving individual cells. This produced excellent results for the cytoplasmic compartment contribution from the cell. Statistical methods involving the pairedt test were used to compare the control and SCP-2 expressors. However, the lipid droplet contribution was quite “noisy,” and an inflection point could not be determined for these data, which were subsequently fit to the equationAe − bt + Ce− dt for all times. This also contributed some complication in determining the inflection point of the whole cell because it is the combination of lipid droplet plus cytoplasm. To overcome this difficulty, the time courses of n individual cells for the specified concentration and cell type were averaged to produce a single time course, which was then fitted to the multiparameter equation. Lipid droplets from control cells and SCP-2 expressors were isolated as described by Chanderbhan et al.(36Chanderbhan R. Noland B.J. Scallen T.J. Vahouny G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8928-8934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells scraped from 10 confluent trays (245 × 245 × 25 mm each; Nunc, Naperville, IL) were homogenized in 50 mm NaH2P04 buffer, pH. 7.4, containing 154 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2 and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 5,000 × gfor 20 min to sediment mitochondria. This was followed by centrifuging at 35,000 rpm in a SW 40.1 rotor for 2 h at 4 °C. The lipid droplet fraction, forming a distinct, white band on the surface of the preparation, was removed, and protein was quantified (34Bradford M. Anal. Biochemistry. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Lipid droplets and cell homogenates were analyzed by Western blot analysis to determine ADRP content in control and SCP-2 expressors. Cell homogenates were analyzed for presence of caveolin and SRB1. For all quantitative Western blots, protein samples (17–20 μg) were run on Tricine gels (12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked in 3% gelatin in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.055 Tween-20 before incubation with the polyclonal rabbit antibodies against either ADRP, caveolin, or SRB1. Alkaline-phosphatase conjugates of goat anti-rabbit IgG and Sigma Fast 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolim tablets (Sigma) were used to visualize and quantitate bands of interest (37Atshaves B.P.

Parker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Epithelia transport many times their own cellular mass of chloride and other ions, but it is unclear how cells sense [Cl−]i. It is known that [Na+]i and [Cl−]iinteract in cell volume regulation (2Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The multiple cellular functions regulated by [Cl−]i (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator channel conductance, epithelial sodium channels, cell volume, Na+K+2Cl-cotransporter activity, etc.) argue for a common regulatory pathway.We have previously shown that [Cl−]/[anions]/ATP/GTP differentially determine the profile of phosphorylation of a number of apical membrane proteins in airway epithelia (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Treharne K.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L592-L601PubMed Google Scholar). We identified two of the phosphoproteins, a 19/21-kDa doublet that showed chloride concentration-dependent phosphorylation, as two isoforms of nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Marshall L.J. Muimo R. Riemen C.E. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C109-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed that phosphorylation of a 37-kDa protein (p37) from both human nasal and sheep tracheal epithelia was differentially modulated by nucleotides (GTP, ATP, and GDP), [Cl−], and other anion species (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Treharne K.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L592-L601PubMed Google Scholar). We found that GTP was the principal phosphate donor for p37 from both species; and in the presence of ATP/GDP, phosphorylation of p37 was enhanced 20-fold. However, this phosphorylation could not be inhibited by known serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting that phosphorylation was not due to the activity of these enzymes.In this study, our objective was to establish the identity of the ion-sensitive phosphoprotein p37 and to characterize its phosphorylated amino acid residue. By selectively enhancing phosphorylation of p37 (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and by applying metal affinity chromatography, we show that p37 is identical to annexin I and provide evidence for novel annexin phosphorylation on histidine residues. Our data suggest that annexin is a component of an intracellular signaling system involving histidine phosphorylation, which is regulated by chloride concentration.DISCUSSIONThe transfer of a reactive phosphoryl group from phosphorylated histidine kinase to an acceptor is a primary step in many cellular signaling responses. For example, in bacteria, yeast, and higher plants, phosphorylation of histidine is the first step in substrate sensory cascades such as the two-component phosphorylation systems (for reviews, see Refs. 8Amster-Choder O. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5621-5624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 12Brown J.M. Firtel R.A Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R662-R665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Maeda T.

In mammals, phosphohistidine has previously been identified on the C terminus of P-selectin from activated platelet cells (15Crovello C.S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Cell. 1995; 82: 279-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and on G protein β-subunits in HL-60 cell membranes (16Wieland T. Nurnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18111-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its cellular role remains to be established. The work reported here identifies a previously recognized phosphoprotein (p37) from airway epithelia as annexin I and shows that the protein is phosphorylated on histidine residue(s) using either GTP or ATP as phosphate donor. This represents a novel phosphorylation of annexin I and is the first report of histidine phosphorylation of an annexin protein. The transient nature of phosphohistidine on annexin I and its susceptibility to hydrolysis under conditions used to detect phosphoesters may explain why it remained undetected in previous studies.The failure of annexin I to autophosphorylate when incubated with nucleotides indicates that it is a substrate for a distinct histidine protein kinase whose activity is predicted to be regulated by chloride and other ions (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Treharne K.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L592-L601PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, annexins share sequence homology with a cAMP-activated chloride channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, in the region of its common mutation Phe508 (17Chap H. Fauvel J. Gassama-Diaggne A. Ragab-Thomas J. Simon M.-F. Med. Sci. 1991; 7: 8-9Google Scholar) and, among other functions, appear to regulate secretion and ion transport by unknown mechanisms. Annexins II and IV have been shown to modulate various chloride channel activities in epithelial and endothelial cells (18Chan H.C. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32464-32468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jorgensen A.J. Bennekou P. Eskesen K. Kristensen B.I. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30631-30636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Structurally, annexins share a conserved series of 70-amino acid repeats organized into a core structure that binds reversibly to acidic phospholipids and cellular membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. Each annexin also contains an amino-terminal segment that is unique to each protein and that varies in sequence and length (for reviews, see Refs. 22Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 23Crompton M.R. Moss S.E. Crumpton M.J.

Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Although the repeat units of the core domain contain both the Ca2+- and phospholipid (membrane)-interactive elements of the protein, the N-terminal domain regulates both the binding affinities for phospholipids and the subcellular localization (26Seemann J. Weber K. Osborn M. Parton R.G. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1359-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is thus thought to provide functional specificity for individual annexins. Moreover, regulation via the N-terminal domain occurs through several post-translational modifications within the N-terminal sequences of some annexins and includes phosphorylation (27Rothhut B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), transglutamination (28Ando Y. Imamura S. Owada M.K. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteolytic cleavage (29Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and attachment to other proteins (30Donato R. Biochim. Biophys.

The above modifications influence the annexin-induced aggregation of phospholipid vesicles and chromaffin granules, together with the calcium requirement for these reactions (32Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Ando Y. Imamura S. Hong Y.M. Owada M.K. Kakunaga T. Kannagi R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9934-9939Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, they control the interaction with some S100 calcium-binding proteins (34Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6931-6937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Regnouf F. Sagot I. Delouche B. Devilliers G. Cartaud J. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. J. Biol.

The cellular consequences of these regulatory events remain to be established.The generation of a phosphorylated fragment whose sequence corresponds to the C-terminal half of annexin I localizes the site of histidine phosphorylation to the core. To our knowledge, this is only the second report showing phosphorylation of an annexin core. In vitrophosphorylation of annexin I at threonine 216 by PKA has been reported (37Varticovski L. Chahwala S.B. Whitman M. Cantley L. Schindler D. Chow E.P. Sinclair L.K. Pepinsky R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but its physiological significance is controversial. Thus, phosphorylation may regulate annexin I function via both the N-terminal and core domains. Notably, all the histidine residues of annexin I lie within the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding core and, with one exception, are located on the face of the molecule that interacts with phospholipids (38Weng X. Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The proposed functions of the core, which include membrane organization and aggregation (39Donnelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), may be affected by phosphorylation-induced charge alterations on histidine. Consistent with this notion, maximal changes in histidine ionization occur within the physiological range of intracellular pH. In addition, cAMP binds annexin I via a proposed cAMP-binding site, adjacent to a conserved histidine (His103), and profoundly alters both the membrane aggregating and calcium channel properties of annexin I in lipid bilayers (11Cohen B.E. Lee G. Arispe N. Pollard H.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our observed inhibition of histidine phosphorylation of annexin I by N 6-Bt-cAMP and AMP could result from an altered conformation such that the histidine residue(s) become inaccessible to the kinase. Alternatively, AMP may also bind to the histidine kinase and allosterically regulate its activity or compete with ATP for the active site. The inhibition by AMP is not observed with IMP or CMP, 2R. Muimo, unpublished data. indicating specificity for the adenosine moiety. cAMP binding and the resulting alteration of the conformation of intracellular effector molecules such as PKA are thought to be the basis of most of the cAMP effects on cellular function (41Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The cAMP signal is then subsequently inactivated and terminated by phosphodiesterases whose activity may be regulated by PKA in a feedback loop (42Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Corbin J.D. Beebe S.J. Blackmore P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8731-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a number of phosphodiesterases exist in airway epithelia (44Fuhrmann M. Jahn H.U. Seybold J. Neurohr C. Barnes P.J. Hippenstiel S. Kraemer H.J. Suttorp N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), our results suggest that PKA and phosphodiesterase activities do not directly influence the effects of cAMP on annexin I phosphorylation. Thus, cAMP may either act through a hitherto unknown pathway or bind directly to the histidine kinase and allosterically regulate its activity. The enhanced annexin I phosphorylation observed with both stereoisomers of cAMP indicates that, unlike PKA, the histidine kinase fails to distinguish between (R p)- and (S p)-cAMP-S; thus, cAMP-binding site(s) on the histidine kinase may be different from those on PKA. The failure of cGMP to influence annexin I phosphorylation suggests that there is no cross-activation between the two cyclic nucleotides.Phosphorylation within the core domain, which is highly conserved among annexins, suggests that histidine phosphorylation may also be a feature of other members of the annexin family. Considering the limited number of post-translational modifications that occur within the N-terminal domains of annexins and the diversity of processes in which annexin function has been suggested, it is possible that other post-translational modifications of the core exist. Clearly, modification of the core domain by phosphorylation suggests that phosphatase(s) and other proteins may interact with this domain to modulate the histidine phosphorylation signal. Proteolytic cleavage of annexin I within its N-terminal domain is well documented (although the protease responsible is not known) and has been shown to modulate annexin function (29Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 45Ando Y. Imamura S. Owada M.K. Kakunaga T. Kannagi R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 163: 944-951Google Scholar). Susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal “tail” is increased following phosphorylation on Tyr21 by the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (46Chuah S.Y. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6921-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the core has previously been regarded to be highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of [32P]annexin I within the core to generate a phosphorylated C-terminal fragment requires further investigation, as it is presently unclear whether or not its cleavage is induced by phosphorylation. A similarly sized fragment from annexin I has been reported previously in samples from cells labeled with phosphate (48Pepinsky R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is possible that phosphohistidine may initiate annexin I cleavage and thus generate active peptide fragments or lead to further degradation of the protein. In epithelia, both [Cl−]i and cell volume are tightly regulated during fluid secretion and/or absorption (1Sarkadi B. Parker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Epithelia transport many times their own cellular mass of chloride and other ions, but it is unclear how cells sense [Cl−]i. It is known that [Na+]i and [Cl−]iinteract in cell volume regulation (2Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The multiple cellular functions regulated by [Cl−]i (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator channel conductance, epithelial sodium channels, cell volume, Na+K+2Cl-cotransporter activity, etc.) argue for a common regulatory pathway. We have previously shown that [Cl−]/[anions]/ATP/GTP differentially determine the profile of phosphorylation of a number of apical membrane proteins in airway epithelia (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Treharne K.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L592-L601PubMed Google Scholar). We identified two of the phosphoproteins, a 19/21-kDa doublet that showed chloride concentration-dependent phosphorylation, as two isoforms of nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Marshall L.J. Muimo R. Riemen C.E. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C109-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed that phosphorylation of a 37-kDa protein (p37) from both human nasal and sheep tracheal epithelia was differentially modulated by nucleotides (GTP, ATP, and GDP), [Cl−], and other anion species (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Treharne K.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L592-L601PubMed Google Scholar). We found that GTP was the principal phosphate donor for p37 from both species; and in the presence of ATP/GDP, phosphorylation of p37 was enhanced 20-fold. However, this phosphorylation could not be inhibited by known serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting that phosphorylation was not due to the activity of these enzymes. In this study, our objective was to establish the identity of the ion-sensitive phosphoprotein p37 and to characterize its phosphorylated amino acid residue. By selectively enhancing phosphorylation of p37 (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Although the repeat units of the core domain contain both the Ca2+- and phospholipid (membrane)-interactive elements of the protein, the N-terminal domain regulates both the binding affinities for phospholipids and the subcellular localization (26Seemann J. Weber K. Osborn M. Parton R.G. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1359-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is thus thought to provide functional specificity for individual annexins. Moreover, regulation via the N-terminal domain occurs through several post-translational modifications within the N-terminal sequences of some annexins and includes phosphorylation (27Rothhut B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), transglutamination (28Ando Y. Imamura S. Owada M.K. Kannagi R. J. Biol.

The above modifications influence the annexin-induced aggregation of phospholipid vesicles and chromaffin granules, together with the calcium requirement for these reactions (32Johnstone S.A.

The cellular consequences of these regulatory events remain to be established.The generation of a phosphorylated fragment whose sequence corresponds to the C-terminal half of annexin I localizes the site of histidine phosphorylation to the core. To our knowledge, this is only the second report showing phosphorylation of an annexin core. In vitrophosphorylation of annexin I at threonine 216 by PKA has been reported (37Varticovski L. Chahwala S.B. Whitman M. Cantley L. Schindler D. Chow E.P. Sinclair L.K. Pepinsky R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but its physiological significance is controversial. Thus, phosphorylation may regulate annexin I function via both the N-terminal and core domains. Notably, all the histidine residues of annexin I lie within the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding core and, with one exception, are located on the face of the molecule that interacts with phospholipids (38Weng X. Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The proposed functions of the core, which include membrane organization and aggregation (39Donnelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), may be affected by phosphorylation-induced charge alterations on histidine. Consistent with this notion, maximal changes in histidine ionization occur within the physiological range of intracellular pH. In addition, cAMP binds annexin I via a proposed cAMP-binding site, adjacent to a conserved histidine (His103), and profoundly alters both the membrane aggregating and calcium channel properties of annexin I in lipid bilayers (11Cohen B.E. Lee G. Arispe N. Pollard H.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our observed inhibition of histidine phosphorylation of annexin I by N 6-Bt-cAMP and AMP could result from an altered conformation such that the histidine residue(s) become inaccessible to the kinase. Alternatively, AMP may also bind to the histidine kinase and allosterically regulate its activity or compete with ATP for the active site. The inhibition by AMP is not observed with IMP or CMP, 2R. Muimo, unpublished data. indicating specificity for the adenosine moiety. cAMP binding and the resulting alteration of the conformation of intracellular effector molecules such as PKA are thought to be the basis of most of the cAMP effects on cellular function (41Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The cAMP signal is then subsequently inactivated and terminated by phosphodiesterases whose activity may be regulated by PKA in a feedback loop (42Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Corbin J.D. Beebe S.J. Blackmore P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8731-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a number of phosphodiesterases exist in airway epithelia (44Fuhrmann M. Jahn H.U. Seybold J. Neurohr C. Barnes P.J. Hippenstiel S. Kraemer H.J. Suttorp N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), our results suggest that PKA and phosphodiesterase activities do not directly influence the effects of cAMP on annexin I phosphorylation. Thus, cAMP may either act through a hitherto unknown pathway or bind directly to the histidine kinase and allosterically regulate its activity. The enhanced annexin I phosphorylation observed with both stereoisomers of cAMP indicates that, unlike PKA, the histidine kinase fails to distinguish between (R p)- and (S p)-cAMP-S; thus, cAMP-binding site(s) on the histidine kinase may be different from those on PKA. The failure of cGMP to influence annexin I phosphorylation suggests that there is no cross-activation between the two cyclic nucleotides.Phosphorylation within the core domain, which is highly conserved among annexins, suggests that histidine phosphorylation may also be a feature of other members of the annexin family. Considering the limited number of post-translational modifications that occur within the N-terminal domains of annexins and the diversity of processes in which annexin function has been suggested, it is possible that other post-translational modifications of the core exist. Clearly, modification of the core domain by phosphorylation suggests that phosphatase(s) and other proteins may interact with this domain to modulate the histidine phosphorylation signal. Proteolytic cleavage of annexin I within its N-terminal domain is well documented (although the protease responsible is not known) and has been shown to modulate annexin function (29Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 45Ando Y. Imamura S. Owada M.K. Kakunaga T. Kannagi R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 163: 944-951Google Scholar). Susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal “tail” is increased following phosphorylation on Tyr21 by the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase (46Chuah S.Y. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47Haigler H.T. Schlaepfer D.D. Burgess W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6921-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the core has previously been regarded to be highly resistant to proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of [32P]annexin I within the core to generate a phosphorylated C-terminal fragment requires further investigation, as it is presently unclear whether or not its cleavage is induced by phosphorylation. A similarly sized fragment from annexin I has been reported previously in samples from cells labeled with phosphate (48Pepinsky R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is possible that phosphohistidine may initiate annexin I cleavage and thus generate active peptide fragments or lead to further degradation of the protein. The transfer of a reactive phosphoryl group from phosphorylated histidine kinase to an acceptor is a primary step in many cellular signaling responses. For example, in bacteria, yeast, and higher plants, phosphorylation of histidine is the first step in substrate sensory cascades such as the two-component phosphorylation systems (for reviews, see Refs. 8Amster-Choder O. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5621-5624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 12Brown J.M. Firtel R.A Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R662-R665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Maeda T.

In mammals, phosphohistidine has previously been identified on the C terminus of P-selectin from activated platelet cells (15Crovello C.S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Cell. 1995; 82: 279-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and on G protein β-subunits in HL-60 cell membranes (16Wieland T. Nurnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18111-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its cellular role remains to be established. The work reported here identifies a previously recognized phosphoprotein (p37) from airway epithelia as annexin I and shows that the protein is phosphorylated on histidine residue(s) using either GTP or ATP as phosphate donor. This represents a novel phosphorylation of annexin I and is the first report of histidine phosphorylation of an annexin protein. The transient nature of phosphohistidine on annexin I and its susceptibility to hydrolysis under conditions used to detect phosphoesters may explain why it remained undetected in previous studies. The failure of annexin I to autophosphorylate when incubated with nucleotides indicates that it is a substrate for a distinct histidine protein kinase whose activity is predicted to be regulated by chloride and other ions (3Muimo R. Banner S.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Treharne K.J. Marshall L.J. Mehta A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L592-L601PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, annexins share sequence homology with a cAMP-activated chloride channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, in the region of its common mutation Phe508 (17Chap H. Fauvel J. Gassama-Diaggne A. Ragab-Thomas J. Simon M.-F. Med. Sci. 1991; 7: 8-9Google Scholar) and, among other functions, appear to regulate secretion and ion transport by unknown mechanisms.

Structurally, annexins share a conserved series of 70-amino acid repeats organized into a core structure that binds reversibly to acidic phospholipids and cellular membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. Each annexin also contains an amino-terminal segment that is unique to each protein and that varies in sequence and length (for reviews, see Refs. 22Creutz C.E.

https://openalex.org/W2012288008,"Based on the x-ray crystal structure of lipid-free Δ43 apoA-I, two monomers of apoA-I were suggested to bind to a phospholipid bilayer in an antiparallel paired dimer, or “belt orientation.” This hypothesis challenges the currently held model in which each of the two apoA-I monomers fold as antiparallel α-helices or “picket fence orientation.” When apoA-I is bound to a phospholipid disc, the first model predicts that the glutamine at position 132 on one apoA-I molecule lies within 16 Å of glutamine 132 in the second monomer, whereas, the second model predicts glutamines at position 132 to be 104 Å apart. To distinguish between these models, glutamine at position 132 was mutated to cysteine in wild-type apoA-I to produce Q132C apoA-I, which were labeled with thiol-reactive fluorescent probes. Q132C apoA-I was labeled with either fluorescein (donor probe) or tetramethylrhodamine (acceptor probe) and then used to make recombinant phospholipid discs (recombinant high density lipoprotein (rHDL)). The rHDL containing donor- and acceptor-labeled Q132C apoA-I were of similar size, composition, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reactivity when compared to rHDL-containing human plasma apoA-I. Analysis of donor probe fluorescence showed highly efficient quenching in rHDL containing one donor- and one acceptor-labeled Q132C apoA-I. rHDL containing only acceptor probe-labeled Q132C apoA-I showed rhodamine self-quenching. Both of these observations demonstrate that position 132 in two lipid-bound apoA-I monomers were in close proximity, supporting the “belt conformation” hypothesis for apoA-I on rHDL."

Measurements of 45Ca2+release in premeabilized SH-SY5Y cells indicates that sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, but notN-acetylsphingosine are capable of mobilizing intracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, the effect of sphingosine was attenuated by the sphingosine kinase inhibitor dimethylsphingosine, or removal of ATP. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that LPA stimulated intracellular Ca2+ “puffs,” which resulted from an interaction between the sphingolipid Ca2+ release pathway and Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors. Down-regulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors uncovered a Ca2+response to LPA, which was manifest as a progressive increase in global cellular Ca2+ with no discernible foci.

Unlike traditional Ca2+ release processes, this novel pathway does not require the progressive recruitment of elementary Ca2+events. sphingosine 1-phosphate G protein-coupled receptor 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 4,5)P3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Krebs-Henseleit buffer lysophosphatidic acid methacholine sphingosylphosphorylcholine sphingosine N,N-dimethylsphingosine ryanodine receptor formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction pertussis toxin guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio) triphosphate The lipid signaling molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP)1 is now recognized to be the extracellular ligand for a subset of the recently cloned Edg-receptor family (1Lynch K.R.

However, SPP is also capable of acting as an intracellular second messenger, where it can stimulate mitogenesis and also mobilize intracellular Ca2+(7Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, sphingosine kinase, the enzyme responsible for SPP generation, has been recently cloned (11Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and overexpression of this enzyme, which increases SPP levels, also promotes cell growth via an intracellular action (12Olivera A.

The ability of sphingolipids such as SPP to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ has been subject to sporadic interest over the last 10 years (13Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L.

Importantly, SPP and the related compound sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) release Ca2+ from purified vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum (16Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22628-22635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that sphingolipids can have effects other than at the cell surface. The ability of inhibitors of sphingosine kinase to block Ca2+mobilization in response to such disparate agonists as IgE, epidermal growth factor, carbachol (via activation of M2- and M3-muscarinic receptors), as well as Fcγ-receptor aggregation, suggests that the involvement of SPP may be quite widespread (9Choi O.K.

However, investigating the role of sphingosine kinase in agonist-driven Ca2+ responses has been hindered by the additional ability of many of these agonists to stimulate Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, it is not clear whether SPP production is a Ca2+ signal in its own right, or whether it merely supports the better characterized Ins(1,4,5)P3 response. In a previous study in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line we have demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulates intracellular Ca2+release via a mechanism that does not involve either Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (InsP3R) or ryanodine receptor (RYR) pathways, but is sensitive to inhibitors of sphingosine kinase (19Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Mackrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, LPA signaling in these cells appears to be an ideal model to investigate GPCR-mediated activation of the sphingosine kinase pathway independently of the generation and action of Ins(1,4,5)P3. In this present study we identify Edg-4 as the probable LPA-receptor involved, and confirm the presence of a sphingolipid-mediated Ca2+ release pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, we describe for the first time the subcellular Ca2+ responses associated with increases in intracellular SPP, and uncover a functional interaction with InsP3R-mediated elementary Ca2+ events. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% (v/v) newborn bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, and 2.5 μg ml−1fungisone, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. SH-SY5Y cells, grown on 22-mm diameter coverslips, were incubated in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB, in mm: NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.7; MgSO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 1.3; KH2PO4, 1.2; NaHCO3, 4.2; Hepes, 10; pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 μm fura-2 AM for 60 min at 22 °C before being mounted on the stage of Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescene microscope and heated to 37 °C. Images at wavelengths above 510 nm were collected, after excitation at 340 and 380 nm, with an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Photonic Science). For experiments investigating the effects of DMS, cells were preincubated in KHB to which no Ca2+ had been added, plus DMS (where appropriate) for 10 min before agonist addition. Applications of LPA were supplemented with 10 μg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (which acts as a low affinity carrier). Confocal measurements of [Ca2+]i were made, at room temperature, at a sample rate of 7.5 Hz using a Noran Oz confocal scanning microscope. SH-SY5Y cells were loaded with fluo-3 AM, and approximate [Ca2+]i was calculated using a self-ratio method (20Lipp P. Thomas D. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7166-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells membranes (2 mg/ml) were incubated in 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2 (pH 7.2) supplemented with 10 μCi of [35S]GTPγS (12.5 mCi/ml) and various concentrations of GDP (10 μm for Gαi3, 1 μm for Gαq/11, or no GDP for experiments measuring Gα13 activation), for 2 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer and centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 6 min. Nonspecific [35S]GTPγS binding was determined by the addition of 10 μm GTPγS. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold solubilization buffer (100 mm Trizma (Tris base)-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Igepal, pH 7.4), and precleared with rabbit serum (1:100 dilution) plus 30 μl of a 3% solution of protein A-Sepharose. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 100 μl of supernatant was incubated with antisera raised against specific Gα-subunits (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz) for 2 h (Gαi3 and Gαq/11) or 16 h (Gα13) and the [35S]GTPγS-labeled Gα subunits immunoprecipitated by the addition of 70 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The samples were washed 3 times and 35S content was measured by liquid scintillation counting (21Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Burford N.T. Tolbert L.M. Sadee W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 342: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The antisera raised against Gαi3 is also reactive against Gαi1 and Gαi2. Cell pellets were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) and total RNA was extracted. The RNA was resuspended in autoclaved, ultra-pure water and the concentration calculated byA260 nm measurement. RNA quality was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out by oligo(dT) priming from 1 μg of each RNA (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer, 40 units of RNaseOUT ribonuclease inhibitor (Life Technologies), and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies)). Triplicate reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed along with an additional reaction in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted to allow for assessment of genomic DNA contamination of the RNA. The resulting cDNA products were divided into 20 aliquots for parallel Taqman PCR reactions using different primer and probe sets for quantification of multiple cDNA sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using an ABI 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on the cDNA samples (2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dUTP, 0.1 μm each primer, 50 mm Taqman probe, 0.01 units of AmpErase uracil-N-glycosylase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.0125 units of Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min). Additional reactions were performed on each 96-well plate using known dilutions of genomic DNA or plasmid containing the specific gene of interest as a PCR template to allow construction of a standard curve relating threshold cycle to template copy number. The initial template copy numbers for each sample were divided by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase initial copy numbers as derived from the standard curves. The resulting values were expressed as arbitrary units. Intracellular levels of [3H]SPP were measured by a modified method described in Ref. 15Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar. SH-SY5Y cells, grown on 6-well plates, were incubated in KHB for 15 min before replacing the buffer with 1 ml of KHB containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid free-bovine serum albumin and 30 nm [3H]sphingosine (20 Ci/mmol) for 1 min. This buffer was then removed and KHB ± agonists added for the appropriate time. Reactions were terminated by removal of KHB and the addition of 0.75 ml of ice-cold methanol. For experiments requiring DMS pretreatment, DMS was added during the 15-min equilibration period. The [3H]sphingolipids were collected by scraping the cells and rinsing with another 0.25 ml of MeOH. Chloroform (0.5 ml) was then added to the samples and the cells mixed vigorously, before centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. A portion of the supernatant (1 ml) was then vacuum-dried in a Speedvac centrifuge. The samples were re-dissolved in 25 μl of ethanol and spotted onto Whatman 60 A silica gel TLC plates. Samples were run in a butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1) solvent system, and sphingosine and SPP identified with ninhydrin. Bands were scraped and measured via liquid scintillation counting. SH-SY5Y cells were harvested in Hepes/EDTA solution (10 mm Hepes, 0.9% NaCl, 0.02% EDTA, pH 7.4) and washed twice in cytosol-like buffer (in mm: KCl, 135; MgCl2, 2.5; EGTA, 0.05; CaCl2 0.02; Hepes, 20; pH 7.1. Free [Ca2+] approximately 100 nm) before being resuspended in cytosol-like buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml β-escin, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine kinase, 2 mm ATP, and 1.7 μCi/ml 45Ca2+ for 10 min. Incubations were for 2 min at 37 °C, unless otherwise stated, and reactions were terminated by centrifugation. The pellet was isolated in a 1:1 mixture of Dow Corning 556:550 oil (BDH), which was then removed and 45Ca2+ content measured by vial liquid scintillation counting. Values were calculated as the mean45Ca2+ release expressed as the percentage of the Ca2+ pool released by 20 μm ionomycin. Stock SPH and SPC, made up in methanol, were vacuum dried and resuspended in 1 mg/ml fatty acid free-bovine serum albumin before being diluted 1:100 in the experiment. The activity of SPP if resuspended in this way was weak and erratic. Therefore stock SPP, made up in chloroform/methanol (1:1), was added directly to the incubations in a 1:100 dilution. The effect of chloroform/methanol alone was always subtracted from the SPP response. Single SH-SY5Y cells responded to an extracellular application of LPA with a transient increase in [Ca2+]i which was graded according to the strength of the stimulus (Fig. 1 A). Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor DMS (30 μm, 10 min) reduced the peak Ca2+ responses to 1 and 10 μm LPA by 88 ± 5 and 46 ± 19%, respectively (n = 3–4). Although higher concentrations of LPA were not tested, it was estimated that this DMS treatment would produce a greater than 100-fold increase in the EC50 for the LPA-mediated Ca2+ response (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that LPA-mediated Ca2+ responses occurred independently of the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway (19Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Mackrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was further confirmed using caffeine to inhibit any potential Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release (23Ehlrich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Thus, a 1-min addition of 40 mm caffeine was without effect on Ca2+ increases stimulated by a submaximal concentration of LPA, but abolished the Ca2+ response to methacholine (MCH), a prototypic Ins(1,4,5)P3 mobilizing agonist in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2). In addition to inhibiting InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ release, caffeine also stimulates RYRs. However, as caffeine itself did not produce a Ca2+ response in the majority of the cells examined, RYR-induced Ca2+ mobilization does not appear to be a major release pathway in SH-SY5Y cells.Figure 2Effect of caffeine on LPA - and MCH-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Fura-2-loaded SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 40 mm caffeine for 1 min before the addition of: A, 0.1 μm LPA or, B, 1 μm MCH. Traces are representative cells from three experiments for each condition. MCH was washed out after a 60-s application, caffeine was present throughout the experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the DMS-sensitive LPA Ca2+ response utilized the same intracellular Ca2+ pool as the Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated MCH response, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in 0 Ca2+ KHB for 1 min, and then stimulated with various combinations of agonists (also in 0 Ca2+ KHB). An initial 2-min application of 10 μm LPA reduced a subsequent response to 1 μm MCH by 32 ± 4%. However, a 3-min application of 1 μm MCH (the time required for the MCH response to return to basal levels) reduced the response to a subsequent application of 10 μm LPA by 91 ± 3% (n = 3–5). As the LPA-mediated Ca2+ response in SH-SY5Y cells appeared distinct from recombinant-receptor signaling (24An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the Edg-receptor profile was examined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR). Levels of Edg mRNA for each of the known human Edg-receptors were normalized to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA found in the cells. As seen in Table I, Edg-4 mRNA was found in greatest abundance, with a small amount of Edg-7 mRNA also present. Interestingly, mRNA for the SPP receptors Edg-3 and Edg-5 was also present, although in relatively low amounts, which is consistent with our previously noted effect of extracellular SPP on SH-SY5Y cells (19Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Mackrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IExpression of Edg-receptor mRNA in SH-SY5Y cellsReceptorRelative mRNAEdg-1Not detectedEdg-2Not detectedEdg-30.006 ± 0.001Edg-40.104 ± 0.010Edg-50.003 (n = 1)Edg-6Not detectedEdg-70.016 ± 0.007Edg-receptor mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells was examined using quantitative RT-PCR on the TaqMan system.

Results are expressed in arbitrary units and represent the mean data from three experiments. Open table in a new tab Edg-receptor mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells was examined using quantitative RT-PCR on the TaqMan system. Levels of Edg mRNA were normalized to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA found in the cell. Results are expressed in arbitrary units and represent the mean data from three experiments. The relative levels of Edg-receptor mRNA suggest that LPA-stimulated responses in SH-SY5Y cells are predominantly mediated via the Edg-4 receptor subtype. Recombinant receptor data suggests that this receptor couples to both Gi/o and Gq/11subfamilies of G-proteins (24An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Goetzl E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The G-protein coupling of the Edg-receptors in SH-SY5Y cells was examined directly by immunoprecipitation of [35S]GTPγS-labeled Gα subunits in a membrane preparation. MCH (100 μm), acting on endogenous muscarinic M3-receptors, produced a robust 3989 ± 83 cpm increase in [35S]GTPγS bound to Gαq/11 (p < 0.001, n = 3). However, neither LPA (10 μm) nor the fatty acid free-bovine serum albumin control, caused increases in [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαq/11(n = 3) (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, both LPA and MCH activated Gαi, such that basal [35S]GTPγS levels increased from 273 ± 12 cpm to 603 ± 70 and 1173 ± 96 cpm, respectively (p< 0.01 for LPA, and p < 0.001 for MCH,n = 4) (Fig. 3 B). No activation of either Gαs or Gα12 was observed, however, LPA did produce a significant increase in [35S]GTPγS bound to Gα13 subunits (basal, 69 ± 94 cpm; LPA stimulated, 523 ± 13 cpm; p < 0.001, n = 3) (Fig. 3 C). Although the effects of the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, DMS, suggested the possible involvement of intracellular SPP production in LPA-mediated Ca2+ responses, it was important to establish the presence of a SPP/Ca2+ release pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. To determine whether LPA, and GPCR activation in general, could elevate intracellular SPP, SH-SY5Y cells were preloaded with [3H]sphingosine ([3H]SPH) for 1 min, and then stimulated with either LPA (10 μm) or AlF4− (10 mm NaF, 10 μm AlCl3) using a method modified from that from (15Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Both receptor activation by LPA and direct G-protein stimulation by AlF4−, elevated [3H]SPP levels in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4). Basal [3H]SPP after the 1-min loading period was 608 ± 14 disintegrations/min (n = 4). Both the LPA and AlF4− responses peaked between 30 s and 1 min before returning to prestimulated levels, such that at 1 min, basal [3H]SPP increased from 494 ± 43 to 611 ± 43 and 717 ± 69 disintegrations/min with LPA and AlF4−, respectively (p< 0.05, n = 5–9). Increasing the preloading time with [3H]SPH to 5 or 15 min did not alter the observed responses (data not shown). Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng/ml 16–20 h) did not alter the response to 10 μm LPA, but reduced the AlF4− stimulated response by 32 ± 18% (n = 2). In contrast, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with DMS (30 μm) abolished the responses to both LPA and AlF4− (n = 3). This abolition was most probably due to an inhibition of sphingosine kinase activity as indicated by an increase in the cellular [3H]SPH content of the cells at the end of the experiment. It was also important to demonstrate that intracellular SPP could mobilize Ca2+ stores in SH-SY5Y cells. In order to remove possible involvement of cell surface SPP receptors (see above), β-escin permeabilized SH-SY5Y cells were diluted to approximately 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Under these conditions, muscarinic M3-receptor stimulation by MCH did not produce a measurable release of 45Ca2+ (Fig. 5 A), thus making it unlikely that any of the results described below could be attributable to effects at cell surface SPP receptors. A 2-min incubation with Ins(1,4,5)P3 (20 μm) released 81 ± 2% of the total ionomycin releasable store of45Ca2+ (n = 7). SPP and SPH (both at 50 μm) released 18 ± 5 and 29 ± 3% of the 45Ca2+ store, respectively (n = 5–7), and the related compound SPC (50 μm) released 34 ± 7% (n = 9) (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, DMS and N-acetylsphingosine were without effect, indicating that 45Ca2+release was not a general response to all sphingolipids. Furthermore, the Ca2+ response to SPH could be inhibited by either pretreatment with DMS or removal of ATP (using hexokinase + glucose), suggesting that SPH must first be converted to SPP by sphingosine kinase before causing 45Ca2+ release. Thus, a 10-min pretreatment with 30 μm DMS inhibited the response to 50 μm SPH by 47 ± 8% (n = 6), while a 1-min pretreatment with hexokinase and glucose (5 units/ml and 4 mm) inhibited the SPH response by 81 ± 10% (p < 0.01, n = 3) (Fig. 5 B). It should be noted that although DMS pretreatment had no significant effect on Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated45Ca2+ release, the addition of hexokinase and glucose reduced the response by 43 ± 8% (p < 0.001, n = 3). Concentration-response experiments suggested that sphingolipid concentrations of greater than 10 μm were required to produce measurable45Ca2+ release responses, and time course data indicated that although 45Ca2+ release responses were present at the shortest time measured (10 s), maximal release occurred around 2 min (data not shown). This contrasted sharply with the effect of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (20 μm) which maximally released 45Ca2+ within 10 s. Previous experiments have demonstrated that LPA-induced Ca2+ mobilization does not involve either RYRs or InsP3Rs (19Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Mackrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above data suggests that the signaling components, which allow LPA to utilize the production of intracellular SPP, are present in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, as other GPCRs so far investigated also appear to stimulate Ins(1,4,5)P3 production (18Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Kuchar I. Alemany R. Gio Y. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the action of LPA on SH-SY5Y cells may prove useful to examine the subcellular Ca2+events associated with the SPP pathway in isolation. Elementary Ca2+ events in response to LPA-receptor activation were compared with MCH-induced responses in fluo-3-loaded SH-SY5Y cells using confocal microscopy. LPA at 0.1 μm, which appeared to be near the threshold for responses, stimulated intracellular Ca2+ puffs in 38 out of 66 cells investigated. After a 10-min washout period, a subsequent application of MCH (0.1 μm) produced Ca2+ puffs originating from the same foci as the LPA response (Fig. 6). These Ca2+ puffs were indistinguishable in magnitude (26.3 ± 1.5 nm from 86 puffs in response to LPA, and 29.2 ± 2.2 nm from 72 puffs in response to MCH), and were manifest as repetitive puffs from a steady baseline, puffs superimposed upon a raised baseline, or puffs which appeared to summate as part of a global Ca2+ response (Fig. 7). Spatially, these puffs were most often observed in the cell body close to the nucleus (Fig. 6 B). Higher concentrations of LPA were also capable of stimulating Ca2+ puffs, however, higher concentrations of MCH produced an extremely rapid global Ca2+ response.Figure 7Comparison of LPA - and MCH-induced Ca2+ puffs originating from the same foci. Fluo-3 loaded SH-SY5Y cells were stimulated with 0.1 μm LPA (A-C), washed for 10 min, and then stimulated with 0.1 μm MCH (D-F). Traces are from the same foci in matched cells (i.e. A and D, B andE, C, and F), which responded to both LPA and MCH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In view of previous data, the ability of LPA to stimulate intracellular Ca2+ puffs was surprising, as this suggested an involvement of InsP3Rs in the Ca2+response. This question was addressed directly by pretreating with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (1 mm) for 16–24 h, in an established protocol to down-regulate the InsP3R population in SH-SY5Y cells (19Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Mackrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

However, the global Ca2+response to LPA remained intact. Thus, the LPA-mediated Ca2+ response in InsP3R down-regulated cells, which presumably results from increases i"

CPT-Iα is a key regulatory enzyme in the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. CPT-Iα is expressed in all tissues except skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which express CPT-Iβ. Expression of CPT-Iα mRNA and enzyme activity are elevated in the liver in hyperthyroidism, fasting, and diabetes. CPT-Iα mRNA abundance is increased 40-fold in the liver of hyperthyroid compared with hypothyroid rats. Here, we examine the mechanisms by which thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates CPT-Iα gene expression. Four potential T3 response elements (TRE), which contain direct repeats separated by four nucleotides, are located 3000–4000 base pairs 5′ to the start site of transcription in the CPT-Iα gene. However, only one of these elements functions as a TRE. This TRE binds the T3 receptor as well as other nuclear proteins. Surprisingly, the first intron of the CPT-Iα gene is required for the T3 induction of CPT-Iα expression, but this region of the gene does not contain a TRE. In addition, we show that CPT-Iα is induced by T3 in cell lines of hepatic origin but not in nonhepatic cell lines.

Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I)1 located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. CPT-I transfers the acyl moiety from acyl-CoA to carnitine (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Acylcarnitine is translocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane in exchange for carnitine by carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (2Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmieri F. Biochem.

Wilcox H.G. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 590-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The oxidation of long chain fatty acids is increased in the hyperthyroid state. We found that CPT-Iα activity, sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, and mRNA levels were altered by T3 (11Mynatt R.L. Park E.A. Thorngate F.E. Das H.K. Cook G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 201: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In hyperthyroid rats, there was a 5-fold increase in CPT-Iα mRNA abundance in the liver over euthyroid rats. CPT-Iα mRNA levels in the liver decreased 80% in hypothyroidism (11Mynatt R.L. Park E.A. Thorngate F.E. Das H.K. Cook G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 201: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CPT-Iα enzyme activity was increased in hyperthyroid and decreased in hypothyroid rats (11Mynatt R.L. Park E.A. Thorngate F.E. Das H.K. Cook G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 201: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of CPT-Iα to malonyl-CoA inhibition was greatly increased in hypothyroidism. CPT-Iα expression in the liver is altered by diet and during development. Oxidation of long chain fatty acids is increased in response to high fat diets and fasting, as well as in disease states such as diabetes (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 12McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Glucagon and long chain fatty acids stimulate whereas insulin inhibits CPT-Iα transcription (4Park E.A. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Kahfi K. Biochem.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). During fetal development, CPT-Iα is not expressed in the liver, but transcription of the gene is induced at birth (14Thumelin S. Esser V. Charvy D. Kolodziej M. Zammit V.A. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, CPT-Iα gene expression is controlled by hormonal and nutritional factors.The effects of T3 are mediated through the binding of the liganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR) to T3 response elements (TRE) in the promoters of genes (15Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 16Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). The consensus TRE contains a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4). Small variations in the AGGTCA motifs will affect the affinity of the TR for the DR4 motif. In addition, the TR can bind to single repeats and repeated motifs separated by various spacing (17Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Katz R.W. Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5238-5343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The TR binds to DNA primarily as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (19Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). On DR4 motifs, RXR binds to the 5′ motif, whereas the TR binds to the 3′ repeat (19Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of the TR: TRα and β (15Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The β isoform of the TR appears to mediate many of the effects of T3 in the liver. The T3 induction of several hepatic genes including S14 and malic enzyme is blunted in TRβ knockout mice (20Weiss R.E. Murata Y. Cua K. Hayashi Y. Seo H. Refetoff S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4945-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Previously, we cloned the promoter of the CPT-Iα gene (21Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The CPT-Iα promoter is TATA-less, and basal expression is driven by Sp1 and NF-Y (22Steffen M.L. Harrison W.R. Elder F.F.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we wished to examine the mechanisms by which T3 stimulates CPT-Iα gene expression. Our results demonstrate that there is a TRE in the promoter of the CPT-Iα gene. However, T3 induction is dependent on sequences within the first intron.RESULTSOur initial experiments were designed to define broad regions of the CPT-Iα gene that were involved in the stimulation of expression by T3. To conduct these experiments, the CPT-Iα promoter was ligated in front of the luciferase reporter gene (CPT-Iα-Luc). Previously, we had cloned the promoter of the CPT-Iα gene and characterized the proximal promoter of the gene (21Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The −6839/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector contains the full-length promoter, the first exon, the first intron and a portion of the second exon (Fig.1 A). Exon 1 is only 27 nucleotides long. The −6839/+19 CPT-Iα-Luc vector contains the CPT-Iα promoter and a portion of exon 1. The −6839/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of T3. Addition of T3 stimulated transcription of −6839/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc 5.5 ± 0.1-fold (Fig. 1 B). The −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector maintained T3 responsiveness with a 5.8 ± 0.6-fold induction by T3. Deletion of the promoter between −4495 and −1653 resulted in a loss of T3 responsiveness. Also, deletion of the first intron as in the −4495/+19 greatly reduced T3 stimulation from a 5.5 ± 0.1- to a 2.0 ± 0.1-fold induction. These observations indicate that two widely separated elements are required for the T3 induction of the CPT-Iα gene. As a control, one or two copies of an idealized TRE, which consists of DR4, were ligated in front of the enhancerless SV40 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. The vector containing two copies of the DR4 was stimulated 5.7 ± 0.7-fold by T3.To further analyze the T3 induction of CPT-Iα gene expression, we identified the TRE in the CPT-Iα gene. Initially, serial deletions were created in the promoter of the CPT-Iα gene between −4495 and −1653 to define a narrow region required for T3 responsiveness. The serial deletions removed approximately 50–400-base pair fragments from the 5′ end of the promoter in the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector (Fig. 2). The average 6-fold induction by T3 was lost with removal of the nucleotides between −2971 and −2912, suggesting that this region contained a TRE.Figure 3Identification of a T3-responsive element in the CPT-I α promoter.

The nucleotides 3′ to the start site of transcription are labeled with positive numbers so that exon 1 contains nucleotides +1 to +27 and exon 2 starts at +1201. Intron 1 and the translation start site (ATG) in exon 3 are labeled. The promoter and first exon (−6839/+19) or the promoter, first two exons and intron (−6839/+1240) were ligated in front of the Luc reporter gene as shown.B, HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with 3 μg of CPT-Iα-Luc vectors, 1 μg of a mammalian expression vector RSV-TRβ, and 1 μg of SV40-βgal as a transfection control. Some HepG2 cells were cotransfected with SV40-luciferase vectors, 1 μg of RSV-TRβ, and 1 μg of SV40-βgal. The SV40 promoter is the enhancerless SV40 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. Either one or two copies of a direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4) were ligated in front of the SV40 promoter. After an 18-h transfection, cells were incubated 24 h in the presence of 100 nm T3. Cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were conducted. The fold T3 induction was determined, and luciferase activity was corrected for protein concentration in the dish. Each transfection was conducted in duplicate and repeated four to six times.

Each of these elements appeared to be good candidates for TRβ-RXRα binding and raised the possibility that multiple TREs were involved in T3 action. However, deletion of the three most 5′ motifs had no effect on T3 responsiveness. The fourth DR4 fell between nucleotides −2971 and −2912 in the T3-responsive region, suggesting that this element was most likely the functional TRE.Table ILocation of DR4 motifs in the CPT-Iα promoterPromoter locationPotential TREs (DR4)Mutations introduced−4251/−4228 (−4251 Mut) TGCCCTcctcTGACCTgggggca TGCAATcctcTGATCA gggggca−3925/−3902 (−3925 Mut)AGGTAGtggcAGGACAtcAGGAGTAGGTAGtggcAATATT tcAGGAGT tcaAGGTCA tcaAGGTCA−3225/−3204 (−3225 Mut) AGGTTTacacAGGACAAGGAGG TGATTTacacATTACAAGGAGG−2938/−2923 (−2923 Mut) cgcTGTCCTcatgGAACCTggt cgcTGTTTTcatgGAATATggtNucleotides containing the DR4 motifs in the CPT-Iα promoter are indicated in the left column.

In the right column, mutated nucleotides are indicated by bold type. These mutations were introduced into the CPT-Iα-Luc vectors shown in Fig. 3. Open table in a new tab To specifically determine which of these elements was involved in the T3 induction of CPT-Iα transcription, each of the DR4 motifs was altered by site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector (Fig. 3). The specific mutations that were introduced are shown in Table I. In agreement with the data from our serial deletions, disruption of the three most 5′ elements did not diminish the 5.8 ± 0.6-fold T3 induction seen with the wild type vector. However, mutation of the most 3′ DR4 (−2938 Mut) resulted in a complete loss of T3 responsiveness (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that T3 stimulates CPT-Iα gene expression through a single TRE and not by synergism between several weak TREs. It is not clear why this DR4 motif serves as the TRE as opposed to the other DR4-like sequences.Next, we determined whether TRβ could bind to the TRE in the CPT-Iα promoter. Because the TR binds with higher affinity as a heterodimer with the RXR, TRβ and RXRα were prepared by overexpression in anE. coli expression system. These proteins contained a histidine tag on the amino terminus and were purified by nickel affinity chromatography (24Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both DNase I footprinting and gel shift mobility assays were used to examine binding to the TRE. A DNase I footprinting probe was generated from nucleotides −3143 to −2684. The probe was incubated with recombinant TRβ and RXRα as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nucleotides −2938 to −2923, which contain the most 3′ DR4 motif in the CPT-Iα promoter, bound the TRβ-RXRα heterodimer and were protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 4).Figure 4Binding of thyroid hormone receptor to the T3 response element. A DNase I footprint probe was constructed from nucleotides −3143 to −2697. The probe contains the most 3′ DR4 motif in the CPT-Iα promoter. The probe was labeled on the top strand with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with TRβ and RXRα before being subjected to DNase I digestion. The G-ladder is shown in theleft lane. The protected sequence is indicated by abox to the right of the footprint. The sequence of the footprinted region is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further analyze the binding of the TRβ to the CPT-Iα TRE, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted with a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the TRE. As shown in Fig.5 A, the probe was incubated with TRβ and RXRα. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing various mutations in the TRE were used in competition studies. The sequences of these oligomers are shown in TableII. The shifted DNA-protein complex was competed with the unlabeled CPT-Iα TRE oligomer. An oligomer with a mutation in both half-sites of the DR4 (Mut1) was unable to compete for TRβ-RXRα binding. This mutation was identical to the mutation that was introduced into −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc and eliminated T3 responsiveness. Similarly, an oligomer containing only a 3′ half-site disruption (Mut2) was unable to compete. A mutation in the 5′-flanking sequence of the CPT-Iα TRE (Mut3) and an oligomer consisting of an idealized TRE (Cons) were both able to compete for protein binding. Additional assays showed no binding of TRβ monomers or homodimers to the CPT-Iα TRE probe (data not shown). These data indicate that TRβ, as a heterodimer with RXRα, can bind to the TRE in the CPT-Iα promoter.Table IIOligonucleotide sequences of competitors used in gel mobility assaysCompetitorsOligonucleotide sequence (top strand 5′–3′)Wild type CPT-Iα TRE (WT)CTAGACGCCGCTGTCCTCATGGAACCTGGTGACGTMutation 1 (Mut1)CTAGACGCCGCTGTTTTCATGGAATATGGTGACGTMutation 2 (Mut2)CTAGACGCCGCTGTTTTCATGGAACCTGGTGACGTMutation 3 (Mut3)CTAGACGCCGCTGTCCTCATGGAACCT ATCGACGTDR4 Consensus (Cons)CTAGAAGGTCACGTAAGGTCATAbbreviations of the oligomers used in Fig. 5 are listed in the left column in parentheses.

All oligonucleotides were generated withXbaI restriction enzyme overhangs. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the TR in a nuclear extract could bind the CPT-Iα TRE, the binding of proteins isolated from rat liver nuclei (RLNE) to this element was examined using gel shift mobility assays. The CPT-Iα TRE probe was incubated with RLNE, and three DNA-protein complexes were observed (Fig. 5 B). Competition analysis was conducted with the same oligomers that were used in Fig. 5 A. All three complexes were competed away by a 100-fold excess of wild type probe. The most slowly migrating (top) complex was not competed by the consensus DR4 or the Mut3 oligomer, indicating that this complex does not contain the TR. The competition pattern of the middle complex was similar to that seen with the TRE-TRβ-RXRα complex in Fig.5 A, suggesting that this complex might contain the TR. Binding of the most rapidly migrating (bottom) complex was eliminated by unlabeled oligomers containing mutations in the DR4. To determine whether the middle complex contains the TR, supershift analyses with the TRβ antibody were conducted (Fig. 5 C). Addition of the TRβ antibody to the binding reaction disrupted the middle DNA-RLNE complex. Antibody alone produced no shifted band. These data indicate that TRβ-RXRα binds the TRE in the CPT-Iα promoter. In addition, other proteins present in rat liver nuclei can bind this element.Our data in Fig. 1 indicated that sequences in the first intron were required for the full T3 induction of CPT-Iα gene expression. These data raised the possibility either that there was a second TRE in the first intron or that an accessory factor site in the first intron was required for the T3 stimulation. Our next experiments examined the role of the first intron in the T3 induction of CPT-Iα gene expression. Internal deletions in the first intron were introduced in the context of the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector. The −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector containing the Sma to Sma (ΔSma) and Mlu to Mlu (ΔMlu) deletions within the first intron were tested for T3 responsiveness (Fig. 6 A). The ΔSma deletion that removes nucleotides (+199/+707) reduced the T3 induction to 2.5-fold, and the ΔMlu vector, which eliminates nucleotides (+130/+1066), was stimulated only 1.4-fold by T3. These data suggest that at least two elements in the intron contribute to the T3 response.Figure 6Participation of the first intron in the induction of CPT-I α by T3. A, deletions were introduced into the first intron in the context of the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector. The ΔSma deletion removes nucleotides +199 to +707, and the ΔMlu deletion removes nucleotides +130 to +1066. These vectors were transfected along with 1 μg of RSV-TRβ into HepG2 cells and assessed for T3 responsiveness as described in Fig. 1.

These data suggest that the intron contains elements that bind accessory factor(s) required for the T3 induction of CPT-Iα. In addition, there are no DR4-like elements within the first intron. Finally, we tested the ability of the CPT-TRE to confer T3 responsiveness on a neutral promoter (Fig. 6 C). Either one or two copies of the CPT-TRE was ligated in front of the SV40 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. T3 stimulated the vector containing two copies of the CPT-TRE to a similar extent as two copies of the idealized DR4 motif. These results indicate that the isolated CPT-TRE can confer a T3 induction on a neutral promoter. However, when the CPT-TRE is placed in the context of the CPT-Iα gene, elements within the first intron are essential for the T3 effect.We tested whether elements within the intron could enhance T3 responsiveness outside the context of the CPT-Iα gene. A Gal4 site was ligated in front of the SV40-luciferase (Gal4-SV40-Luc) vectors containing portions of the first intron. These vectors were cotransfected with a mammalian expression vector for TRβ in which the TRβ DNA-binding domain was replaced by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-TRβ) (27Baniahmad A. Ha I.

The Gal4-TRβ vector was used to eliminate the possibility that the TRβ was binding to a TRE in the intron.T3 stimulated the Gal4-SV40-Luc vector 7.8 ± 0.8-fold (Fig.7 A). The T3 induction of the intron vectors were compared with Gal4-SV40-Luc, which was normalized to 1.0. Addition of the Sma to Sma (+199/+707) region to Gal4-SV40-Luc did not further stimulate the T3 responsiveness. Gal4-SV40-Luc vectors containing the Mlu to Mlu (+130/+1066) and the Sma to Mlu (+707/+1066) regions were stimulated an additional 3.1 ± 1.0 and 3.4 ± 0.3-fold by T3, respectively (Fig. 7 A). The Mlu to Mlu vector without the Gal4 DNA-binding site was not stimulated by T3 when cotransfected with the Gal4-TRβ expression vector (data not shown). These data indicate that an accessory factor site between the +707 and +1066 region of the first intron enhances the T3 induction.Figure 7Contribution of specific intron regions in the T3 induction of CPT-I α.

Either the Sma to Sma (+199/+707), Mlu to Mlu (+130/+1066), or the Sma to Mlu (+707/+1066) regions of the first intron were included in these vectors. These constructs were cotransfected into HepG2 cells with 100 ng of a mammalian expression vector for Gal4-TRβ into HepG2 cells and exposed to T3 as described for Fig. 1. The Gal4-SV40-Luc vector was induced 7.8-fold by T3. The T3 induction of the intron vectors were compared with Gal4-SV40-Luc, which was normalized to 1.0.

The convergent death signals from the Fas receptor and TNF receptor 1 are transferred to FADD by death domain interactions triggering the same cellular event, caspase-8 activation. In this work, we investigated whether the same binding surface of FADD is used for both signaling pathways by using FADD death domain mutants. Mutations in helices α2 and α3 of the FADD death domain, the interacting surface with the Fas death domain, affected TNF-mediated apoptosis to various extents. This indicated that TNF-mediated apoptosis uses the same binding surface of the FADD death domain as Fas-mediated apoptosis. The binding specificity is not the same, however. Some mutations affected the binding affinity of the Fas death domain for the FADD death domain, but did not influence TNF-mediated apoptosis and vice versa. Interestingly, all mutants tested that affected TNF-mediated apoptosis have structural perturbations, implying that the structural integrity, involving helices α2 and α3 in particular, is critical in TNF-mediated apoptosis. Our results suggest that different signaling molecules use a similar structural interaction to trigger the same cellular event, such as caspase-8 recruitment, which could be typical in convergent signal transduction.

Activation of these upstream cysteine proteases is thought to trigger a proteolytic cascade, which apparently constitutes the execution of apoptosis. Under certain environments, however, Fas and other members of the TNFR family that contain death domains can stimulate alternative signaling pathways, which exert positive effects on cell survival and proliferation rather than triggering apoptosis (1Wallach D. Boldin M. Goncharov T. Goltsev Y. Mett I. Malinin N. Adar R. Kovalenko A. Varfolomeev E. Behring. Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 144-155PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous FADD associates with Fas in an activation-dependent fashion (11Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), and TRADD and RIP (receptor-interacting protein) have been found in the activated TNFR1 complex (8Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that TRADD acts as an adapter molecule for TNFR1, mediating the interaction of TNFR1 with FADD, whereas RIP is involved in nuclear factor κB signaling. Low levels of FADD were found in the TNFR1 complex when FADD, TRADD, and TNFR1 were coexpressed, raising the question of whether FADD is involved in TNF-mediated signaling. Apoptosis mediated by TNF and Fas is similar; both signaling cascades are initiated by death domains and end in activation of interleukin 1β converting enzyme-like proteases. However, clear differences in these two cell death pathways have been observed (12Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1751-1755PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schulze-Osthoff K. Krammer P.H.

A dominant-negative version of FADD blocks TNF- and Fas-induced apoptosis, indicating that FADD functions as the common signaling conduit for cytokine-mediated cell death (15Chinnaiyan A.M.

It is not known yet whether the different signaling molecules use the same interaction surface of the molecule in the common conduit to trigger the same cellular event, such as caspase-8 recruitment, in this convergent signaling pathway. The homotypic interactions of the death domains, death effector domains, and caspase recruitment domains are critical to the signaling pathways in apoptosis. These interactions are specific, as not all death domains interact with each other. The three-dimensional structures and site-directed mutagenesis of the death domains of Fas and FADD revealed that electrostatic interactions might be responsible for molecular recognition between the death domains (17Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized several mutant FADD-DD proteins that do not interact with Fas-DD (18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effect of those mutations in FADD-DD on the TNF-mediated apoptosis of a CHANG liver cell. Several mutations that affected the binding of Fas-DD to FADD-DD also affected TNF-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that the same binding surface of FADD is used for the signal transduction of Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis. Our results suggest a possible structural mechanism for convergent signal transduction. The interaction between the death domains of Fas and FADD was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fas-DD protein (1 μg/well) in carbonate buffer (0.1 m, pH 9.8) was incubated overnight in a 96-well cell culture plate. The surface of the plate, which was coated with Fas-DD, was treated with blocking buffer (PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.47 mmKH2PO4) containing 5% skim milk and 0.01% Antifoam, pH 7.4) and washed six times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (PBST). The plate was then incubated with 3.5 μm His-tagged FADD-DD protein dissolved in different salt concentrations in PBS base buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.47 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing with PBST six times, the bound His-tagged FADD-DD protein was detected by successive treatment with anti-His5 antibody (in PBS base buffer; 20 ng/well) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted in blocking buffer. The plates were washed again before 100 μl of substrate buffer (100 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mmcitric acid, 0.1% o-phenylenediamine, and 0.003% H2O2) was added to each well. After 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 2 mH2SO4/well. The intensity was measured by absorbance at 490 nm using a Spectra Max 340 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The Fas-DD and FADD-DD proteins were produced as described previously (18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The FADD-DD proteins were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 710 instrument. Each scan was recorded between 195 and 280 nm at 10 °C, and five scans were accumulated. The 15N-labeled samples for heteronuclear NMR experiments were prepared by culturing the recombinant cells in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 g of15NH4Cl/liter. All NMR data were acquired at 30 °C on a Varian UNITYplus 600 spectrometer (Advanced Analysis Center of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology) using ∼2 mm protein dissolved in 90% H2O and 10%2H2O. Typical carrier frequencies employed in the NMR experiment were 4.7 ppm for 1H and 118.5 ppm for15N. Each amide proton and nitrogen of the FADD death domain was assigned based on previously reported data (18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All of the NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11620) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the program PIPP (20Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The FADD-DD mutants were generated by overlap polymerase chain reaction as described previously (18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 284-base pair fragment extracted from the amplified polymerase chain reaction products was ligated into the pET-15b expression vector containing NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. To construct the mammalian expression system, pET-15b harboring the FADD-DD gene was digested with NdeI and then filled in by Klenow fragment (Promega). The resulting fragments were cut byBamHI and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). CHANG liver cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) before transfection. For transient expression experiments, 2∼8 × 104 CHANG liver cells were grown to 60% confluence in a well and washed with DMEM prior to treatment with transfection mixtures containing DNA (0.9 μg of the wild-type or mutant FADD-DD plasmids and 0.3 μg of LacZ) and 3 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1.0 ml of serum-free DMEM. After 4 h of incubation, DMEM was substituted with serum-supplemented DMEM and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were then exposed to TNF-α (30 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (4 μg/ml) for 16 h. To determine cell viability, cells were stained for β-galactosidase activity as described by Kumar et al. (21Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS; fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde; and stained with PBS containing 20 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 20 mmK4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mg/ml X-gal for 3 h. Viability was then determined based on the morphology of X-gal-positive cells. All Fas and TRADD proteins were of human origin, and FADD was of mouse origin (22Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutations of charged residues in helices α2 and α3 of FADD-DD alleviated the binding affinity for Fas-DD (Fig.1). It is believed that charged residues in helices are involved in death domain interactions, but that structural perturbation of helices α2 and/or α3 induced by mutations could break interactions. If electrostatic interactions between charged residues in death domains were responsible for death domain interactions, the interactions would be dependent on salt concentration. To investigate the salt effect on death domain interactions, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been designed to detect the interaction between Fas-DD and FADD-DD in vitro. The binding affinity of FADD-DD for Fas-DD up to an additional 50 mm NaCl was not affected, but a higher concentration of salt significantly reduced the binding affinity (Fig.2). This result indicates that electrostatic interactions play a role in death domain interactions between FADD and Fas.Figure 1Structure of FADD-DD and mutation sites in helices α2 and α3.Charged residues in helices α2 and α3 are shown in the FADD-DD structure (18Jeong E.-J.

Plates were coated with Fas-DD (1 μg/well); and the next day, the plates were incubated with 3.5 μmHis-tagged FADD-DD in PBS base buffer containing different concentrations of NaCl (8.5, 50, 150, 200, and 500 mm and 1m). The bound fraction of FADD-DD was then determined with anti-His5 antibody as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ Binding was normalized to the absorbance value in 150 mm NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutations of charged residues in helices α2 and α3 of FADD-DD might affect the structural integrity of the protein. If the structure of the protein is perturbed by mutation, it is not safe to say that electrostatic interactions play a role in death domain interactions, although mutations of charged residues are responsible for the alleviation of the binding affinity of FADD-DD for Fas-DD. To investigate the effect of mutations on the structural integrity of the protein, CD spectra were obtained for each mutant as well as for wild-type FADD-DD. The CD spectra of the FADD-DD mutants showed that each mutation affected the conformation of FADD-DD to a different extent (Fig. 3). Some mutations induced significant structural change, and others hardly affected the protein conformation, which is almost indistinguishable from the wild-type spectrum. The loss of the secondary structures in the proteins can be observed either by local structural perturbation or by increasing the unfolded fraction of the protein. However, all of the mutant proteins except K113A have unfolding transition temperatures high enough to affect the CD spectrum at the experimental temperature (10 °C), indicating that the structural perturbation observed by CD is correlated with the local structural perturbation rather than the global unfolding. The mutant K113A has a completely unfolded CD spectrum. Many of the mutants studied by CD showed that the secondary structure was lost by mutation. However, it is not clear whether the structural change is localized around the mutation site or not. To localize the structural perturbation, we obtained 1H-15N HSQC spectra of FADD-DD mutants (R110A and E123A) and compared them with the wild-type protein spectrum (Fig. 4). In the case of the mutant protein R110A, a few residues around the mutation site in helix α2 (Gly109, Arg110, Asp111, Trp112, and Lys123) were perturbed, as shown by chemical shift perturbation. Significant chemical shift perturbation was observed in helices α2 (Arg114, Leu115, and Arg117) and α3 (Val121, Ser122, Glu123, Ala124, Asp127, Gly128, Ile129, Glu130, Glu131, and Ser136) in the E123A mutant protein. These results indicate that structural perturbations are localized around mutation sites in helices α2 and α3 and that the conformations of helices α2 and α3 are highly sensitive to a mutation. Although a significant conformational change in FADD-DD was induced by mutations at Arg110, Glu118, Lys120, Val121, and Glu123, the structural perturbations were localized in helices α2 and α3. On the other hand, other mutations at Arg117, Asp127, and Glu130 did not perturb the structure. However, the binding affinity of these mutants varied regardless of the extent of structural perturbation. This indicates that a single amino acid substitution can break death domain interactions by disrupting electrostatic interactions. We previously demonstrated that charged residues in helices α2 and α3 are involved in death domain interactions and that the interacting helices appear to interact in an anti-parallel pattern, helix α2 of FADD with helix α3 of Fas and vice versa (18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To elucidate the physiological function of FADD-DD in TNF-mediated apoptosis, FADD-DD and its variants were transiently expressed in a CHANG liver cell line using the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The effect of mutations in FADD-DD on TNF-mediated apoptosis was investigated by treating the cells with TNF-α. Approximately 71% of the cells transfected with a control plasmid (pcDNA3.1) died upon treatment with TNF-α and cycloheximide compared with ∼7% without treatment. One the other hand, wild-type FADD-DD transfection induced 43% death with TNF-α compared with 24% without treatment (Fig.5). This result indicates that FADD-DD inhibits TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. The expression of mutants R110A, D111A, R117A, and E130A blocked TNF-α-induced cell death, as in the wild type. In contrast, mutants K113A, E118A, K120A, V121N, and E123A did not block TNF-induced cell death. The dominant-negative effect of FADD-DD on cell death induced by TNF-α indicates that FADD participates in TNF-mediated apoptosis. The abrogation of the inhibitor activity of FADD-DD by mutations in helices α2 and α3 indicates that helices α2 and α3 are involved in TNF-induced apoptosis. FADD is both a necessary and sufficient mediator of Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis, as overexpression of FADD engages the cell death machinery (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), whereas a truncated derivative acts as a potent dominant-negative regulator (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that electrostatic interaction is responsible for death domain interactions by mutation work (17Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here, we further confirmed this by investigating the salt effect on death domain interactions. A high salt concentration virtually abolished the binding affinity of FADD-DD for Fas-DD. The CD and 1H-15N HSQC spectra of FADD-DD mutants indicate that mutations in helices α2 and α3 induce structural perturbation to various extents, but most of the perturbation is limited to helices α2 and α3. A similar observation was also reported for Fas-DD, where mutations in helices α2 and α3 marginally perturbed the structure (23Martinez O.M. Krams S.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 18: 527-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The lpr mutation in the Fas death domain disrupted helices α2 and α3 and alleviated the binding affinity of Fas-DD for FADD (17Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W.

A few mutations in the Fas death domain that disrupted the global fold have also been reported in autoimmune lymphoproliferation syndrome (23Martinez O.M. Krams S.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 18: 527-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the FADD death domain, the K113A mutation disrupted the global fold of the protein completely. After all, interactions between death domains are mediated by electrostatic interactions, but the structural integrity of helices α2 and α3 is also important for death signal transduction. It is clear that Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis is relayed by FADD, but it has not been known whether Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis uses the same binding surface of FADD or not. Our results show that TNF-mediated apoptosis uses the same binding surface of FADD-DD, helices α2 and α3. The binding specificity is not the same, however. Some mutations affected the binding affinity of Fas-DD for FADD-DD, but did not influence TNF-mediated apoptosis and vice versa. Interestingly, all mutants tested that affected TNF-mediated apoptosis have structural perturbations, implying that the structural integrity, involving helices α2 and α3 in particular, is critical in TNF-mediated apoptosis (Table I and Fig. 3). The interaction observed between the death domains of TRADD and FADD (16Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility that TRADD might be able to recruit FADD to TNFR1. If the death domain of TRADD interacts with the death domain of FADD, the death domain of TRADD should have a unique pattern of interactions since the death domains of TNFR1 and RIP also interact with the TRADD death domain. Our results indicate that the binding surface of FADD for Fas is also involved in TNF-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that TRADD interacts with FADD at the same surface that Fas does (Table I). FADD recruits a caspase-8 upon binding to Fas or TRADD death domains. This suggests that the conformational change in FADD required for caspase-8 recruitment is triggered in a similar pattern, although the interacting molecules are different. TNFR1 recruits TRADD by binding to part of the death domain and enables TRADD to recruit FADD to the other part of the death domain. Amino acid sequence alignment of death domains shows that TRADD has a longer loop between helices α2 and α3 than other death domains (18Jeong E.-J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Considering that helices α2 and α3 are involved in death domain interactions between Fas and FADD, the long loop might be involved in other roles, assuming that helices α2 and α3 of TRADD are also involved in death domain interactions. It is interesting that the mutations in the aforementioned loop do not affect cell death induced by the TRADD death domain and that they fail to activate nuclear factor κB (25Park A. Baichwal V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9858-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), implying that the loop is involved in RIP-activated cell death. Considering that other death domains such as Pelle and Tube (26Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have a different interaction mode from the Fas and FADD death domains, TRADD would have at least two distinctive surfaces for TNFR1 and FADD interactions. However, a detailed picture of the pattern of binding of TRADD to different death domains must await further structural work.Table IInteraction of FADD-DD with Fas-DD and effect on TNF-induced apoptosisFADD-DD mutantsInteraction with Fas-DD 1-aThe relative binding profile of FADD-DD mutants and Fas-DD measured by the BIAcore system was adapted from Jeong et al.

Open table in a new tab In the cell, many interacting molecules bind to a single molecule and trigger diverse cellular events or a single cellular event. One molecule can have different or similar binding surfaces for each interacting molecule. In divergent signal transduction, where the diverse cellular events are triggered, each interacting molecule is likely to have a different binding surface. In this way, they are not competitive in signal transduction. In convergent signal transduction, however, the interacting molecules may have the same binding surface. If an interaction is required in creating a new binding surface, the specific conformational change in the molecule is necessary. To trigger a specific conformational change in the molecule, the interacting molecules should bind to the same surface. In the case of FADD, our results indicate that Fas or TRADD is required for creating a new binding surface for caspase-8. This indicates that the different signaling molecules bind to the same surface of the molecule to trigger convergent signal transduction. In conclusion, we showed that helices α2 and α3 of the FADD death domain are critical in the death domain interaction in Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis. The death domain interaction in Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis is mediated by electrostatic interactions, but the integrity of the structure is also important. The convergent signals from the Fas receptor and TNFR1 to FADD are transferred using the same surface of FADD. This result suggests that the different signaling molecules use the same structural interaction to trigger the same cellular event, such as caspase-8 recruitment in convergent signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2093485679,"Two sequences important for pre-mRNA splicing precede the 3′ end of introns in higher eukaryotes, the branch point (BP) and the polypyrimidine (Py) tract. Initial recognition of these signals involves cooperative binding of the splicing factor SF1/mammalian branch point binding protein (mBBP) to the BP and of U2AF65 to the Py tract. Both factors are required for recruitment of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U2 snRNP) to the BP in reactions reconstituted from purified components. In contrast, extensive depletion of ST1/BBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not compromise spliceosome assembly or splicing significantly. As BP sequences are less conserved in mammals, these discrepancies could reflect more stringent requirements for SF1/BBP in this system. We report here that extensive depletion of SF1/mBBP from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells results in only modest reduction of their activity in spliceosome assembly and splicing. Some of these effects reflect differences in the kinetics of U2 snRNP binding. Although U2AF65 binding was reduced in the depleted extracts, the defects caused by SF1/mBBP depletion could not be fully restored by an increase in occupancy of the Py tract by exogenously added U2AF65, arguing for a role of SF1/mBBP in U2 snRNP recruitment distinct from promoting U2AF65binding.

The correct recognition of 5′ and 3′ splice sites occurs in the spliceosome, a large and dynamic macromolecular complex of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs)1 and non-snRNP proteins that assembles in a stepwise manner on the pre-mRNA (1Burge C. Tuschl T. Sharp P. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar,2Krämer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Five snRNPs play a role in removal of canonical GU/AG introns, each composed of a different U snRNA, a set of polypeptides common to most spliceosomal snRNPs and a set of proteins specific for each snRNP (reviewed in Refs. 3Will C. Behrens S. Lührmann R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 4Kambach C. Walke S. Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The first ATP-dependent step in spliceosome assembly is the stable association of U2 snRNP with the 3′ part of the intron (reviewed in Refs. 5Hodges P. Beggs J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 264-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and 6Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This part of the pre-mRNA contains three sequence elements important for the splicing process as follows: the branch point region (BP), the polypyrimidine tract (Py tract), and the conserved dinucleotide AG at the 3′ splice site. The BP is highly conserved in yeast (UACUAAC) and is more degenerate in higher eukaryotes (consensus YNCURAY, Y is pyrimidine, R is purine, N is any nucleotide). The BP establishes base pairing interactions with a specific sequence of U2 snRNA, bulging out the nucleotide, usually adenosine, that forms a 2′–5′ phosphodiester bond with the 5′ end of the intron (7Parker R. Siliciano P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1987; 49: 229-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 8Wu J. Manley J.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Py tract, particularly important for splicing in higher eukaryotes, is a pyrimidine-rich sequence located immediately downstream of the BP and upstream of the AG dinucleotide (1Burge C. Tuschl T. Sharp P. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar).Biochemical fractionation of mammalian nuclear extracts indicated that stable binding of purified U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA requires four activities as follows: SF3a, SF3b, U2AF, and SF1 (11Krämer A. Utans U. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SF3a and SF3b were subsequently found to be integral components of the 17 S U2 snRNP that dissociate during purification (12Behrens S. Tyc K. Kastner B. Reichelt J. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). U2AF is composed of two subunits of 65 and 35 kDa (13Zamore P. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). U2AF65 binds to the Py tract (14Zamore P. Patton J. Green M. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas U2AF35 recognizes the 3′ splice site AG and helps to stabilize the U2AF65/Py tract interaction (15Wu S. Romfo C. Nilsen T. Green M. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Zorio D. Blumenthal T.

Nature. 1999; 402: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). SF1, also called mammalian branch point binding protein (mBBP), was purified as a 75-kDa polypeptide and found to recognize specifically the BP (18Krämer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4545-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Berglund J. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).The mechanisms by which U2AF and SF1/mBBP facilitate U2 snRNP binding are not well understood. The amino-terminal arginine-serine (RS) rich domain of U2AF65 contacts the BP, and it has been proposed that its positively charged residues can stabilize the limited base pairing interactions that can be established between U2 snRNA and the BP (20Lee C. Zamore P. Green M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13472-13478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gaur R. Valcárcel J. Green M. RNA (NY ). 1995; 1: 407-417PubMed Google Scholar, 22Valcárcel J. Gaur R. Singh R. Green M. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). An interaction between U2AF65 and SAP 155, a protein subunit of SF3b, can provide an additional mechanism for U2 recruitment (23Gozani O. Potashkin J. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4752-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). U2AF65 also interacts with UAP56, a DEAH box helicase found to be important for U2 snRNP binding (24Fleckner J. Zhang M. Valcárcel J. Green M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).SF1/mBBP and U2AF65 interact with each other, and this interaction can facilitate cooperative recognition of the BP and Py tract that are adjacent to each other in the pre-mRNA (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 26Berglund J. Abovich N. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear whether SF1/mBBP plays other roles in promoting U2 snRNP assembly.SF1/mBBP contains at least five distinct structural domains. The amino-terminal region contacts U2AF65 (27Rain J. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), an essential interaction for SF1/mBBP function that is disrupted by phosphorylation by the serine/threonine kinase PKG-1 in response to cGMP (28Wang X. Bruderer S. Rafi Z. Xue J. Milburn P. Krämer A. Robinson P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This region of the protein is followed by an hnRNP K homology domain (KH domain) and a zinc knuckle, two motifs implicated in RNA binding (reviewed in Ref. 29Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The KH domain is sufficient for specific recognition of the pre-mRNA BP (27Rain J. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Berglund J. Fleming M. Rosbash M. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the zinc knuckle seems to confer additional RNA binding affinity, probably through interaction with the negatively charged phosphate backbone (30Berglund J. Fleming M. Rosbash M. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 998-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The RNA binding domains are followed by a proline-rich region and a carboxyl-terminal domain. Alternatively spliced variants of human SF1/mBBP are expressed in a cell type-specific manner that differ in the length of the proline-rich region and have distinct carboxyl termini (31Arning S. Grüter P. Bilbe G. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar, 32Krämer A. Quentin M. Mulhauser F. Gene (Amst. ). 1998; 211: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus and the proline-rich region are not only dispensable for SF1/mBBP activity in spliceosome assemblyin vitro but also for viability in yeast (27Rain J. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and might be required for other functions of SF1/mBBP in vivo.A Saccharomyces cerevisiae SF1/mBBP homolog was genetically identified by its synthetic lethality with MUD2, the gene encoding the functional homolog of U2AF65 in yeast (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments showed that ySF1/BBP also contacts the 3rd RNA Recognition Motif of Mud2p and binds the BP (19Berglund J. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of ySF1/BBP with prp40, a component of U1 snRNP, suggests that ySF1/BBP can form a bridge between the 5′ splice site and the 3′ splice site region in one of the first detectable complexes able to commit the pre-mRNA to undergo splicing (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Human SF1/mBBP has also been found to be a component of such complexes in mammals (19Berglund J. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). SF1/mBBP is not present, however, in pre-spliceosome complexes, suggesting that BP recognition by the protein is no longer needed and/or is incompatible with the stable association of U2 snRNP with this sequence (19Berglund J. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that ySF1/BBP plays a kinetic role in the progression through the two commitment complexes observable in yeast extracts (33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Depletion of ySF1/BBP resulted in a reduction in the accumulation of commitment complex 2 (CC2), in which the 5′ splice site is recognized by U1 snRNP and the BP by ySF1/BBP and MUD2. Surprisingly, however, spliceosome formation was not affected by ySF1/BBP depletion. These results suggest that under conditions of reduced amounts of ySF1/BBP, formation of CC2 became rate-limiting and the CC2 complexes formed were immediately chased into spliceosomes (33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).In this report we have developed an immunodepletion protocol allowing removal of SF1/mBBP from HeLa nuclear extracts, and we used this method to answer two questions. First, is the activity of SF1/mBBP essential for U2 snRNP binding in mammals but more dispensable in yeast, as suggested by the differences between biochemical reconstitution experiments in HeLa extracts and depletion experiments in S. cerevisiae? Second, is the only role of SF1/mBBP in mammalian spliceosome assembly to assist U2AF65 binding to the Py tract? Consistent with the results in yeast and in contrast with the requirement of SF1/mBBP in reconstituted reactions with purified components, extensive depletion of SF1 had relatively small effects in the accumulation of complexes containing U2 snRNP. Although substitution of the weak BP of an IgM pre-mRNA by the yeast BP consensus conferred a kinetic advantage in spliceosome assembly, this advantage was no longer observed in SF1-depleted nuclear extracts. These effects correlated with a reduced cross-link of U2AF65 to the RNA and could be reversed by supplementing the depleted extract with recombinant SF1/mBBP. Interestingly, addition of U2AF65 also increased the cross-linking signal but was unable to restore splicing complex formation. These observations imply additional functions for SF1/mBBP in spliceosome assembly distinct from facilitating U2AF65 binding.DISCUSSIONSF1/mBBP was first identified as a biochemical activity necessary, together with U2AF, to allow binding of purified human U2 snRNP to a model pre-mRNA (11Krämer A. Utans U. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SF1/mBBP was subsequently found to be essential for the viability of S. cerevisiae andCaenorhabditis elegans (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 42Mazroui R. Puoti A. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 1615-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The essential nature of theSF1/mBBP gene could be due to the activity of its protein products in pre-mRNA splicing. Depletion experiments in yeast (33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in mammalian extracts (Figs. 2 and 3), however, indicate that significant reduction of SF1/mBBP levels cause only modest changes in the efficiency of formation of splicing complexes and in the accumulation of splicing products. It is possible that the splicing defects are more pronounced for pre-mRNAs of some essential gene(s) than for the model pre-mRNAs used in these studies. Indeed, the results of Figs. 2 and 3 are consistent with the possibility that the effects of SF1/mBBP depletion can be quantitatively different for different pre-mRNA substrates. Splicing defects upon ySF1/BBP depletion were also more readily noticeable in S. cerevisiaewhen reporters with mutated splice sites were analyzed. 2B. Rutz and B. Séraphin, personal communication. Alternatively, the essential function(s) of SF1/BBP may be unrelated to pre-mRNA splicing. In line with the latter possibility, one SF1/mBBP isoform, ZFM1, was independently identified as a transcriptional repressor (43Zhang D. Paley A. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The low levels of ySF1/BBP required for viability and splicing of model substrates are particularly striking considering that S. cerevisiae cells in which transcription of the ySF1/BBPgene has been efficiently turned off can live for several generations with only some delay in their doubling time (33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Rutz and Séraphin (33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have interpreted their observations as revealing a transient interaction of ySF1/BBP with splicing complexes that kinetically facilitates their assembly. A similar transient interaction was also observed for MUD2p, the yeast homolog of U2AF65. As yeast SF1/BBP and MUD2p interact with each other through protein domains conserved in their mammalian counterparts (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 27Rain J. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), both proteins may bind to and leave the pre-mRNA as a complex, at least in the yeast system.Depletion of mammalian SF1/mBBP and of U2AF65, however, have dramatically different effects in spliceosome assembly. The relatively modest effects of SF1/BBP depletion are in contrast with the substantial loss of activity of extracts chromatographically depleted or immunodepleted of U2AF65 (14Zamore P. Patton J. Green M. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 21Gaur R. Valcárcel J. Green M. RNA (NY ). 1995; 1: 407-417PubMed Google Scholar, 22Valcárcel J. Gaur R. Singh R.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This is despite the fact that the two proteins bind cooperatively to the same region of higher eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, act at a similar step in spliceosome formation, their levels in HeLa nuclear extracts are comparable, and the extent of the reduction of their concentration in the depleted extracts is also comparable (compare, for example, Fig. 3B in Ref. 36Guth S. Martinez C. Gaur R. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8263-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar with Fig. 1 in this work). The dissociation constants for SF1/BBP binding to the yeast consensus BP range between 0.5 (yeast) and 30 μm (human). The affinity of U2AF65 for typical polypyrimidine tracts is significantly higher, the correspondingly lower dissociation constants ranging between 0.1 and 0.01 μm. If the effect of the depletion would depend solely on the relative affinities of these factors for their cognate sites, one would expect that reduction in the levels of the factor that has higher binding affinity for its binding site would be less detrimental for activity. However, the opposite is observed. These observations may imply a more critical function for U2AF65than for SF1/mBBP in mammalian spliceosome assembly. Alternatively, they may reflect additional roles that U2AF65 plays in spliceosome assembly and that are independent of SF1/mBBP. In any case, the results argue against the possibility that the recognition of the more degenerate mammalian BP requires a more substantial contribution of SF1/mBBP compared with that of the conserved branch point by ySF1/BBP in the yeast system.The strong dependence on SF1/mBBP to reconstitute U2 snRNP binding from purified components (11Krämer A. Utans U. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is in contrast with the modest effects that SF1/BBP depletion has in the same process in extracts (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). It is possible that other factors present in the nuclear extract can mitigate the effects of SF1/mBBP depletion by either facilitating alternative pathways of assembly or by taking over SF1/mBBP function in the immunodepleted extracts.A key and still unsolved question is the molecular mechanism(s) by which SF1/BBP promotes U2 snRNP binding and/or other events in spliceosome assembly. SF1/BBP was proposed to be involved in initial cross-intron bridging by interacting simultaneously with the branch point sequence and Prp40p, which is associated with U1snRNP bound to the 5′ splice site (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Both synthetic lethality in yeast and GST-pulldown experiments were compatible with this proposal (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region of yeast SF1/BBP and the WW domain of PrP40p were suggested to mediate this interaction. Analogous interactions were proposed in the mammalian system, involving the WW domain of the formin-binding protein FBP21 that can interact with human SF1/BBP, the U1-specific polypeptide U1C, and the snRNP core components SmB/SmB′ (44Bedford M. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Several results, however, have challenged the role of these interactions in the initial bridging between splice sites. First, domain mapping analysis showed that the proline-rich region of ySF1/BBP located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein was not required for binding to Prp40p (25Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Second, FBP21 has been found in pre-spliceosome and spliceosome (A and B) complexes, probably associated to U2 snRNP, but not in commitment (E) complexes (44Bedford M. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Third, the proline-rich region was found to be dispensable for promoting mammalian U2 snRNP binding in reconstituted reactions from purified components (27Rain J. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and in SF1/mBBP-depleted extracts (Fig. 2) and also for yeast growth (27Rain J. Rafi Z. Rhani Z. Legrain P. Krämer A. RNA (NY ). 1998; 4: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Given that SF1/mBBP recognizes the nucleotide bases at the BP and that these bases also establish base pairing interactions with U2 snRNA, it seems unlikely that SF1/mBBP and U2 snRNA can be bound simultaneously at the BP sequence. In fact, previous data are consistent with SF1/mBBP being replaced from the BP upon U2 snRNP binding (33Rutz B. Séraphin B. RNA (NY ). 1999; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 45MacMillan A. Query C. Allerson C. Chen S. Verdine G. Sharp P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3008-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 46Chiara M. Gozani O. Bennett M. Champion-Arnaud P. Palandjian L. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SF1/mBBP could interact with a protein component of U2 snRNP or with U2 snRNA to bring the snRNP in close proximity to the BP, or to induce conformational rearrangements within the snRNP necessary for its recruitment, and then be displaced when extensive RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions stabilize snRNP binding to the BP. SF1/mBBP could act in this case as a “guide” molecule that identifies the correct sequence for U2 snRNP binding, a task particularly demanding in higher eukaryotes where the BP sequence is rather degenerate and several base pairing arrangements between U2 snRNA and the BP region are possible. This activity could be at the basis of the improved kinetics of U2 snRNP binding afforded by an efficient BP-SF1/BBP interaction observed in the experiments presented in Fig. 3.Alternatively, SF1/mBBP could help (with the assistance of U2AF65) to clear the BP region from factors associated with the pre-mRNA before its commitment to spliceosome assembly, like hnRNP proteins. In fact, Chiara et al. (46Chiara M. Gozani O. Bennett M. Champion-Arnaud P. Palandjian L. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that hnRNPI/PTB can be cross-linked to the BP sequence of a model pre-mRNA in those complexes. These factors may have more relaxed binding specificity but represent, because of their associated domains, activities or factors, a significant block to U2 snRNP binding and therefore their substitution by SF1/BBP could result in effective clearance of the BP region for U2 snRNP binding, particularly in combination with the cooperative binding and recruiting activities of U2AF65.The interaction between SF1/BBP and U2AF65 mutually facilitates their interaction with the BP and Py tract (19Berglund J. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One possible scenario is that SF1 simply assists U2AF65 binding to the Py tract and that only U2AF65 has a recruitment function for U2 snRNP. RNA binding experiments using purified proteins have shown that SF1/BBP increases the affinity of U2AF655-fold (19Berglund J. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This increase in affinity may be higher for pre-mRNAs containing weak Py tracts and more consensus BPs. The results of Fig.4, however, argue that the function of SF1/BBP cannot be justified exclusively by its effects on U2AF65 binding, and argue that additional mechanisms like those discussed above can indeed play a role in SF1/BBP function. It is also possible that the interaction of SF1/BBP with U2AF65 enhances the recruitment activities of the latter, for example by triggering a conformational change that will allow more extensive contacts between U2AF65 and U2 snRNP components like SAP 155 (23Gozani O. Potashkin J. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4752-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The expression of eukaryotic genes requires the accurate removal of intervening sequences (introns) and the concomitant fusion of the flanking exons via RNA splicing. The correct recognition of 5′ and 3′ splice sites occurs in the spliceosome, a large and dynamic macromolecular complex of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs)1 and non-snRNP proteins that assembles in a stepwise manner on the pre-mRNA (1Burge C. Tuschl T. Sharp P. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar,2Krämer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Five snRNPs play a role in removal of canonical GU/AG introns, each composed of a different U snRNA, a set of polypeptides common to most spliceosomal snRNPs and a set of proteins specific for each snRNP (reviewed in Refs. 3Will C. Behrens S. Lührmann R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 4Kambach C. Walke S. Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The first ATP-dependent step in spliceosome assembly is the stable association of U2 snRNP with the 3′ part of the intron (reviewed in Refs. 5Hodges P. Beggs J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 264-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and 6Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This part of the pre-mRNA contains three sequence elements important for the splicing process as follows: the branch point region (BP), the polypyrimidine tract (Py tract), and the conserved dinucleotide AG at the 3′ splice site. The BP is highly conserved in yeast (UACUAAC) and is more degenerate in higher eukaryotes (consensus YNCURAY, Y is pyrimidine, R is purine, N is any nucleotide). The BP establishes base pairing interactions with a specific sequence of U2 snRNA, bulging out the nucleotide, usually adenosine, that forms a 2′–5′ phosphodiester bond with the 5′ end of the intron (7Parker R. Siliciano P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1987; 49: 229-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 8Wu J. Manley J.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It is present chronically in 70–90% of the population in developing countries (2Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 720-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its mode of transmission and its potential initial reservoir are not known. This organism is well adapted to the hostile environment in which it thrives, thanks to the production of a high level of urease that neutralizes acidic pH (3Smoot D.T. Mobley H.L. Chippendale G.R. Lewison J.F. Resau J.H. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1992-1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its virulence has been associated with its motility that is conferred by a unipolar sheathed flagella (4Josenhans C. Labigne A. Suerbaum S. J.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to PglF fromCampylobacter jejuni (11Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). FlmA and PglF have been shown to be involved in glycosylation of flagella proteins by knockout analysis. Consequently, FlaA1 was originally assigned a flagellar-related function, hence its name. However, glycosylation of flagella has not been demonstrated in H. pylori itself, although it has been demonstrated in several species of Campylobacter (11Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 12Doig P. Kinsella N. Guerry P. Trust T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which is closely related to H. pylori. Moreover, no biochemical evidence is available to assign a specific enzymatic function to FlmA, PglF, and FlaA1. The study of a family of enzymes essential for the production of virulence factors in a variety of human bacterial pathogens has led us to propose that FlaA1 could be a C6 sugar-nucleotide dehydratase. The enzymes studied were WbpM from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, BplL from Bordetella pertussis, Cap8D fromStaphylococcus aureus, and TrsG from Yersinia enterocolitica (13Burrows L.L. Charter D.F. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Allen A. Maskell D. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Sau S. Lee C.Y. J.

A refined analysis of the sequences of these 4 enzymes using the MEME motif discovery software (available on the World Wide Web) revealed the existence of five highly conserved domains that are present in the same order and same spacing within their sequences (Fig. 1). A search of the entire data base using these five conserved domains with the MAST (Motif Alignment and Search Tool) program led to the discovery of FlaA1 and numerous additional homologues of unknown function that display the same conserved domains in the same pattern. Most homologues are large membrane proteins like WbpM. However, several homologues, including FlaA1, only correspond to the soluble terminal half of WbpM. In contrast to a recent observation (17Burrows L.L. Urbanic R.V. Lam J.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the complementation data presented in this paper show that FlaA1 and WbpM are functionally equivalent in a P. aeruginosa background. Hence, FlaA1 represents an ideal candidate to determine the biochemical function of this entire family of enzymes. Analysis of the known surface carbohydrate structures of the organisms that harbor FlaA1 or a homologue suggested that these enzymes were C6 dehydratases involved in the formation of 6-deoxysugars (18Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biokhimiya. 1994; 59: 1784-1851PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fournier J.M. Vann W.F. Karakawa W.W. Infect.

Perry M.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By analogy to previously established biosynthetic pathways where dehydration is the first step of the pathway (21Liu H.W. Thorson J.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 223-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Zanardi D. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1998; 80: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and also considering that UDP-GlcNAc is an essential precursor for surface carbohydrate biosynthesis (23Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we predicted that FlaA1 and all other members of the family could be UDP-GlcNAc C6dehydratases. FlaA1 also shares high amino acid sequence homology with GalE, the C4 UDP-Glc epimerase of Escherichia coli (45% similarity) (24Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and WbpP, the UDP-GlcNAc C4 epimerase ofP. aeruginosa serotype O6 (49% similarity) (25Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These homologies span the entire sequence of FlaA1 and include the main features found in the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (26Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Namely, the typical SYK catalytic triad is conserved, as well as the GXXGXXG signature for nucleotide-binding proteins (27Rossmann M.G. Argos P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7525-7532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homologies among these proteins also extend to the predicted secondary structure, with conserved alternating stretches of α-helices and β-sheets. Based on all of these observations, we predict that the biological function for FlaA1 might be related to the production of virulence factor determinants via flagella glycosylation or LPS biosynthesis. We also predict the biochemical function to be C6dehydration of UDP-GlcNAc, although C4 epimerization cannot be excluded. Determining the biochemical function of FlaA1 will help sort out ambiguous functional assignments and carbohydrate biosynthetic pathways that involve homologues of FlaA1. It will also provide clues for potential inhibitor development. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between WbpM fromP. aeruginosa and FlaA1 from H. pylori byin vivo complementation in a P. aeruginosabackground. We also describe the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of FlaA1. Using a combination of spectrophotometric assays, capillary electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry analysis, we show that FlaA1 is a new bifunctional UDP-GlcNAc C6 dehydratase/C4 stereospecific reductase that leads to the production of UDP-QuiNAc via formation of a UDP-4-keto,6-methyl-GlcNAc intermediate. The gene encoding FlaA1 (HP0840) was obtained from the TIGR/ATCC microbial genome special collection (construct GHPEP02). The geneflaA1 was subcloned in the AflIII andBamHI sites of a pET23 derivative (28Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with a N-terminal histidine tag. The sequence of the primers used to amplifyflaA1 by polymerase chain reaction were 5′-ACTGTACATGTCAATGCCAAATCATCAAAAC-3′ (top) and 5′-AAGCTGGATCCTCATAATAATTTCAACAAA-3′ (bottom). The polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using Expand Long Range Template DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The constructs obtained were checked by restriction analysis and sequencing. The construct was subsequently transformed into the expression strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml) selection. For protein expression, 2 ml of an overnight culture were inoculated into 100 ml of TB in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The culture was grown at 37 °C. When the A 600 reached 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and expression was allowed to proceed for no more than 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was stored at −20 °C until needed. Expression was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, with Coomassie Blue staining or Western immunoblot using the penta-His anti-histidine tag antibody (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer. The FlaA1 gene together with its histidine tag and with the vector ribosome binding site was subcloned from the pET construct into the complementation vector pUCP26 (29West S.E. Schweizer H.P. Dall C. Sample A.K. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 148: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction. The top and bottom primers were 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ and 5′-CAACTGCAGTCATAATAATTTCAACAA-3′, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cloning was performed in E. coliDH5α under repressing conditions (0.2% glucose) to ensure recovery of correct clones. The candidate clones were sequenced over the entire length of the construct. The His-FlaA1/pUCP26 construct was introduced into a knockout of WbpM made in P. aeruginosa serotype O5 (13Burrows L.L. Charter D.F. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using the calcium chloride transformation method. The transformation was done under repressing conditions (0.2% glucose). LPS were prepared using the Hitchcock and Brown method (30Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from overnight cultures grown in LB without repression. The LPS were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining or Western blotting using A-band (N1F10) or B-band (MF15–4) LPS specific monoclonal antibodies. The purification of FlaA1 by nickel chelation was done as reported previously for WbpP (25Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) except that all buffers were adjusted at pH 7 instead of pH 8. The eluted protein was subjected to further purification by cation exchange chromatography on HS-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after dilution 1:30 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7. The column (8 ml) was washed with 30 column volumes of Tris buffer, and the protein was eluted with 3 column volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7, 1 m NaCl. The eluted protein was desalted by overnight dialysis (cut off at 3500 Da) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, at 4 °C and concentrated by overlay with polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma) for 4–5 h at 4 °C. Protein quantitation was done using the BCA reagent (Pierce). The purified enzyme was either used fresh or stored at −20 °C in 25% glycerol in 50 mm Tris, pH 7. A 45 × 1.6-cm column of G100 Sephadex (Sigma) run at 1.4 ml/min in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl buffer was used to determine the oligomerization status of FlaA1. FlaA1 or the molecular mass standards (Sigma; 12–150 kDa) were applied onto the column as a diluted solution (50 μg/200 μl deposited). Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight spectra were acquired in the linear mode on a PerSeptive Biosystems Elite-STR (Framingham, MA) system equipped with delayed extraction technology. One μl of a 0.5 mg/ml solution of protein was mixed with 10 μl of sinapinic acid matrix solution prepared at 10 mg/ml in a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/water (1:1:1, v/v/v), and an aliquot of 0.5 μl was deposited on the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization plate. External mass calibration was carried out using the singly protonated ions of insulin and apo-myoglobin. A freshly purified and extensively dialyzed sample of FlaA1 was concentrated up to 1.75 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7, by polyethylene glycol 8000 overlay. The sample (100 μl) was subjected to digestion by proteinase K (10 μg, for 45 min at 37 °C) and chemical reduction by sodium borohydride (1 μl of 10 mg/ml, for 1 h at 37 °C). Quantitation of bound NAD(P)+ in FlaA1 was performed using standard curves of NAD+ subjected to chemical reduction or not. The precise concentration in NAD+ was calculated using ε260 nm = 17,400 m−1 × cm−1, and the efficiency of reduction was calculated using ε340 nm = 6270m−1 × cm−1. Reactions were performed with a total reaction volume of 35 μl at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, in the presence of 1.5 mmsubstrate and 1 mm NAD+. The amount of enzyme used for each reaction is indicated in the figure legends and tables. The reactions were stopped by acid hydrolysis of the UDP moiety of the substrate. The spectrophotometric quantification of GalNAc and GlcNAc using DMAB was performed as described by Creuzenet et al.(25Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

The enzymatic reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, with 50–300 ng of freshly purified enzyme and 0.8 mm of UDP-Glc or UDP-Gal in a total reaction volume of 44 μl. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the glucose present in the reaction mixture was measured spectrophotometrically using a glucose-specific coupled assay (25Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) analyses were performed using a P/ACE 5000 system (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) with UV detection as described before (25Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To assess substrate specificity, reactions were performed in a total reaction volume of 35 μl at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, in the presence of 1.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, dTDP-Glc, or GDP-mannose, with or without NAD+ (1 mm). The reactions were quenched by boiling without hydrolysis of the nucleotide moiety. All reactions contained 440 ng of enzyme and 1.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc with a total volume of 35 μl. They were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C unless stated otherwise. For the buffer study, the buffers tested were 20 mm Tris, sodium phosphate, or Bis-Tris-propane at pH 7 or 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. For the pH study, the reactions were performed in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5 as well as in 50 mmBis-Tris-propane buffer at pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, and 10.0. For the temperature study, the reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7. The reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice or at 15, 20, 30, 37, 42, 55, or 65 °C. To determine the kinetic parameters, all reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, and incubated at 37 °C for the required amount of time. For time course studies, reactions were set up with UDP-GlcNAc at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.5 mm and incubated in the presence of 440 or 54 ng of fresh enzyme. The reactions were quenched every 15 min for 2 h. ForK m and V max determinations, the final UDP-GlcNAc concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 1.50 mm, and the reactions were quenched after 20 min of incubation with 440 ng of fresh enzyme. Kinetic parameters were calculated by linear regression from Eadie-Hofstee plots and are the average of two experiments. Mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a Crystal CE system (APIUNICAM) directly coupled to a electrospray API3000 mass spectrometry system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analyses were performed using a 90-cm-long bare fused silica capillary in 30 mm morpholine buffer at pH 9, under 30 kV. Samples were injected for 0.1 min under 100–150-millibar pressure. Mass spectrometry acquisitions were done in the negative mode betweenm/z = 50 and 1200. Reactions (35 μl) containing 440 ng of enzyme and 1.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, buffer were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. They were treated with 0.30 or 0.03 g/liter (final concentration) sodium borohydride for 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by CE, CE/MS, and MS/MS as described above. A reaction mix (24.5 μl) containing 1.5 mm UDP-Glc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Gal, UDP, or none and 440 ng of FlaA1 in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7, was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. After incubation, 10.5 μl of UDP-GlcNAc serial dilutions were added so that the final UDP-GlcNAc concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 1.50 mm. The samples were incubated 20 min at 37 °C and boiled afterward for 6 min to quench the reactions. They were analyzed by CE, and Eadie-Hofstee plots were constructed for determination of kinetic parameters. For time course experiments, a reaction mixture (630 μl total) containing 68, 34, 17, or 0 μg of FlaA1, 0.8 mmUDP-GlcNAc, and 0.2 mm NAD(P)H or NAD(P)+ in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, was incubated at 37 °C. TheA 340 was read every 15 min for 5 h. For the determination of the K m andV max of FlaA1 for NADH, reactions (98 μl total) containing 10.6 μg of FlaA1, 1.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 0.005–0.2 mm of NADH in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. TheA 340 was read using a 50-μl microcell. Kinetic parameters were determined from Eadie-Hofstee plots and are the average of two experiments. Fig. 2 shows that the histidine-tagged FlaA1 is able to complement a WbpM knockout. It restored the entire ladder-like pattern of B-band LPS that is typical for P. aeruginosa serotype O5 and that represents chains of B-band LPS with varying degrees of polymerization of a repeating trisaccharide unit. This result shows that WbpM and FlaA1 are functionally equivalent. It also shows that the presence of the N-terminal histidine tag is not deleterious for the function of FlaA1. FlaA1 is a small protein (37.4 kDa) of basic isoelectric point (pI = 8.65). It was overexpressed as an N-terminally histidine-tagged protein in the pET system using E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS grown in terrific broth. Very high levels (30% of total cell proteins) of expression were obtained, and 50–60% of the expressed protein were soluble and could be purified to homogeneity by nickel chelation and cation exchange chromatography (data not shown). Typically, 1.5–2 mg of 95–98% pure FlaA1 could be obtained from 100 ml of culture (TableI). Gel filtration chromatography suggested that purified FlaA1 existed as a dimer in native conditions (data not shown).Table IPurification table for FlaA1 established using the DMAB assay and UDP-GlcNAc as a substrateFractionVolume 1-aValues refer to the purification of FlaA1 from 100 ml of culture.ConcentrationProteinPurity 1-bThe purity is estimated from the intensity of the bands after Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Units 1-cOne unit is defined as the amount of protein necessary to catalyze 1 μmol of substrate per min under our experimental conditions.

Open table in a new tab DMAB is a reagent specific for N-acetylhexosamines (32Reissig J.L. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DMAB assay allows us to quantitate GlcNAc or GalNAc present in an enzymatic reaction by measuring the optical density at 595 nm (25Creuzenet C. Belanger M. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19060-19067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, DMAB reacts 6-fold more with GlcNAc than with its C4 epimer GalNAc. When FlaA1 was incubated with UDP-GlcNAc, a significant decrease in A 595 was observed. This decrease was dependent on the substrate concentration and amounted to a maximum of 55% substrate conversion under the experimental conditions used in this assay (Fig.3 A). This clearly indicated that UDP-GlcNAc is a good substrate for FlaA1. The disappearance of UDP-GlcNAc was dependent on the amount of enzyme present in the reaction (Fig. 3 B). It was also specific for FlaA1 as indicated by the increase in specific activity (9.9-fold) along the purification (Table I). When the reactions were performed with UDP-GalNAc, a slight decrease in the A 595 was observed (data not shown). This indicated that UDP-GalNAc did interact with the enzyme but with less efficiency than UDP-GlcNAc. Moreover, this result clearly excludes the existence of a C4UDP-GlcNAc epimerase activity for FlaA1. Such an activity would form UDP-GlcNAc from UDP-GalNAc and would result in a clear increase ofA 595 in the DMAB assay after incubation of FlaA1 with UDP-GalNAc. The GalE assay is a well established method that is glucose-specific and allows us to follow the disappearance or appearance of UDP-Glc when the enzyme assay is performed using UDP-Glc or UDP-Gal, respectively (31Moreno F. Rodicio R. Herrero P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1981; 27: 589-592Google Scholar). When the enzymatic reactions were performed using UDP-Glc and high amounts of FlaA1 (300 ng), a slight disappearance (5%) of UDP-Glc was observed (data not shown). This indicated that UDP-Glc could interact with the enzyme. When the reactions were performed with UDP-Gal, no UDP-Glc formation was observed. This excluded the existence of C4 UDP-Glc epimerase activity for FlaA1. No reaction product could be identified by capillary electrophoresis analysis after incubation of FlaA1 with UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, or UDP-GalNAc (data not shown). Similarly, no reaction product was detected when dTDP-Glc or GDP-mannose were used as substrates. However, when UDP-GlcNAc was used as a substrate, two reaction products were identified (Fig.4). One (product A) eluted at 13.9 min, and the other (product B) eluted at 12.9 min, whereas the substrate UDP-GlcNAc eluted at 11.6 min. As high as 60% substrate conversion could be obtained at equilibrium using 1.5 mm substrate, and up to 80% conversion could be obtained at lower substrate concentrations. Time course experiments performed with very low amounts of enzyme showed that products A and B appear in a sequential manner (data not shown). Product B only appears after 5–7% of the substrate has been converted into product A. This suggested that product B could be a derivative of product A. CE/MS analysis of the reaction mixtures containing either both products A and B or only product A allowed to assign products A and B to new peaks at m/z 588 and 590, respectively. Compared with the substrate peak (m/z 606), these two peaks could correspond to a 4-keto, 6-methyl derivative of UDP-GlcNAc (m/z588) and to 6-methyl-UDP-GlcNAc, also called UDP-QuiNAc (m/z 590) that would arise from stereospecific reduction of the first product (Fig. 5). Further analysis of each peak by MS/MS revealed a fractionation pattern consistent with this hypothesis (Fig. 5 and TableII). Several peaks common to the MS/MS map of each parent peak attested to an unaltered structure of the UDP moiety, as expected. Others were specific for each parent peak. They attested to the replacement of the CH2OH group (observed in peak at m/z 606) on C6 of the glucose ring by a CH3 group (in peak m/z 588 and 590) and to the replacement of a CHOH group (in peak atm/z 606 and 590) by a C=O group (in peak atm/z 588) on C4 of the glucose ring. They also confirmed that the N-acetyl group on C2 of the glucose ring was not affected by the enzymatic reaction. Partial C2 deacetylation occurred during CE/MS, resulting in the appearance of parent peaks atm/z 563 (deacetylated UDP-GlcNAc), 545 (deacetylated product A), and 547 (deacetylated product B). The MS/MS fragmentation patterns of these peaks also matched with the fragment sizes expected for the enzymatic modifications described above (data not shown). This confirmed further that the acetyl group of the glucose moiety was not involved in the enzymatic reaction. Taken together, the above results confirmed that FlaA1 has a C6 dehydratase activity of UDP-GlcNAc and were consistent with the participation of a 4-keto,"

Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The replicon hypothesis states that most DNA replication systems will have a replicator sequence that is part of the genome of the organism and an initiator protein that binds to the replicator and initiates DNA replication (2Jacob F. Brenner S. Cuzin F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1963; 28: 329-348Crossref Google Scholar). The dnaA protein in Escherichia coli and the large T antigen of SV40 are among the best studied initiators of DNA replication. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, autonomous replication of plasmids required the presence of an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) consensus sequence in the plasmid, which serves as the hypothetical replicator element. Yeast ORC was purified from yeast extracts because of its ability to bind to the ARS consensus sequence in a sequence-specific, ATP-dependent reaction, consistent with its function as an initiator. The genes for all six subunits of yeast ORC (named ORC1 to ORC6) were cloned and shown to be essential for viability (3Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B.

Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Given the central role of the six subunit ORC in the initiation of DNA replication, it is important to examine the status of this complex in the mammalian somatic cells that give rise to cell proliferative diseases like cancers. All studies on the biochemistry of ORC have utilized cells that either proliferate rapidly or have the potential to do so, e.g. yeast cells, Drosophila embryo extracts, or Xenopus egg extracts. In this paper we examine for the first time the biochemical and cell biological properties of human ORC in somatic cells that proliferate at a far slower rate than the special cases utilized to date and come to the conclusion that a tight complex containing all subunits of ORC is difficult to detect in these cells. In addition, individual ORC subunits are selectively expressed in certain non-proliferating tissues, suggesting that isolated ORC subunits might have functions unrelated to replication initiation. Even in proliferating cells in culture several of the ORC subunits are associated with unique proteins that are not the other known ORC subunits, raising the possibility that either there are more than six ORC subunits in mammalian cells or that some of the subunits are in complexes unrelated to DNA replication initiation. Culture conditions for human HeLa, U2OS, and 293T cells as well as conditions for cell cycle synchronization with nocodazole and hydroxyurea have been described previously (20Quintana D.G. Hou Z.H.

For in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, cells were incubated in phosphate-free medium for 2 h and then in medium containing 350 μCi (80 pm) of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 8500 Ci/mmol) for another 4 h before harvesting. Northern blots containing RNA from 16 adult human tissues were obtained commercially (CLONTECH), and hybridizations using32P-labeled cDNA probes were performed as suggested by the manufacturer.

Anti-Orc1 antibody was raised in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals) against a bacterially expressed recombinant His6-tagged fragment of Orc1 from amino acids 579–861 created by cloning into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET14.b. 5 × 106 293T cells were extracted in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged (15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the clear lysate was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The filtrate was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column chromatography using lysis buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Alternate fractions were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with anti-ORC antibodies. For immunohistochemistry, 4-μm-thick paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tissue were used after deparaffinization and rehydration (27Dorfman D.M. Shahsafaei A. Mod. Pathol. 1997; 10: 859-863PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were blocked for 15 min at room temperature with 1.5% goat serum in PBS and then incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h in a humid chamber. Antibodies used were anti-Orc3 and anti-Orc5, with matched pre-immune sera. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, sections incubated with anti-Orc5 or matched pre-immune serum were processed with the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) as specified by the manufacturer and developed using 3,3′- diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as substrate.

For immunofluorescence, U2OS cells were transfected with vectors expressing T7-tagged Orc1. For analysis of Orc2-Orc5, untransfected HeLa (Orc2 and Orc5) or U2OS (Orc3 and Orc4) cells were used.

To study ORC expression in normal human tissues, Northern blots of a panel of 16 tissues were hybridized sequentially with cDNA probes specific for Orc1-Orc5 (Fig. 1). Multiple RNA species were not observed; rather, a single transcript of the size predicted by the full-length cDNA was observed for each ORC subunit. The results suggest that the mRNA of individual ORC subunits are sometimes expressed in non-proliferating tissues that do not always express all the other known subunits.Figure 3Nuclear localization of ORC in proliferating cells of the testis. Paraffin sections of normal testis were used for immunohistochemical analysis with anti-Orc5 (a) or anti-Orc3 (c) antibodies or with matched pre-immune control serum (b) and (d).

Highest levels of Orc1 mRNA were observed in tissues with high proliferative activity such as testis and colon mucosal lining. Orc1 mRNA is also high in a tissue like the placenta, which would have proliferated rapidly in its recent history and is moderately expressed in the thymus with proliferating T lymphocytes (after correcting for slight underloading of mRNA from the latter). Orc1 mRNA essentially is undetectable in primarily non-proliferating tissues such as heart, brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocyte. The mRNA from the small intestine was obtained from the entire thickness of the gut and so was not enriched in the proliferating cells of the mucosa. Therefore, Orc1 mRNA levels reflect the proliferative activity in tissues consistent with regulation of Orc1 expression by the E2F transcription factor (28Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, mRNA levels of the other ORC subunits (Orc2–5) were not dependent on the proliferative activity in the tissue. As observed with Orc1, Orc2–5 are expressed at high levels in testis. However, high levels of Orc2–5 were observed in tissues with low proliferation such as heart, pancreas, and ovary. Intermediate expression of Orc2–5 was seen in brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and kidney. The levels of Orc2–5 mRNA are high in heart and skeletal muscle even after the signal intensity is adjusted to reflect overloading (as judged from the control β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes). In several tissues, only a subset of ORC subunits are expressed at significant levels. In lung, Orc3 and Orc4 mRNA are seen, whereas Orc2 and Orc5 mRNA are virtually absent. In thymus, only Orc1 and Orc5 show measurable levels, whereas in the small intestine only Orc5 exhibits a faint band. In all tissues the control β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes yield strong signals, suggesting that the low level of ORC subunit signal in some tissues is not due to drastic sample underloading. In addition, note that even in proliferating tissues expressing Orc1, signal ratios between various ORC subunits are not constant. For example, thymus expresses Orc1 at much higher levels than Orc2–4, and Orc1 is expressed at a higher level than Orc2 in colonic mucosa. In testis, however, Orc1 appears underexpressed relative to most of the other subunits. Since analysis of ORC subunit RNA levels in normal tissue suggested that abundance of transcripts does not correlate strictly with proliferation status, we investigated whether the same held true at the protein level. A commercially obtained blot containing protein from normal human tissue was immunoblotted sequentially with polyclonal antisera specific for Orc1-Orc5 (Fig. 2). Ponceau S staining of total proteins on the blot indicated that the brain extract was significantly underloaded. Orc1 is nearly undetectable in non-proliferating tissues, consistent with its mRNA being seen exclusively in proliferating tissues. Very low levels of Orc1 are observed in kidney and spleen when the immunoblot is overexposed. The approximately 90-kDa protein detected in heart also is recognized by pre-immune serum, and thus, we do not believe it to be Orc1. Orc 2–4 also were detected in testis. The absence of Orc5 in the testis extract is explained by our earlier observation that Orc5 is associated with the nuclear matrix of cultured proliferating cells (21Quintana D.G. Thome K.C. Hou Z. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27137-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is expected to be extracted poorly under the conditions used to prepare these tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry (see below) indeed confirms that Orc5 protein also is abundant in the testis. Thus, a proliferating tissue like the testis contains all ORC subunit proteins. Several non-proliferating tissues, however, expressed subsets of ORC subunits. A 70-kDa Orc2 protein was detected in non-proliferating tissues like pancreas, liver, brain, kidney, ovary, and heart. An 80-kDa Orc3 protein was also detected in non-proliferating tissues like the heart, but the levels in other non-proliferating tissues did not correlate with that of the mRNA. For example, non-proliferating tissues like pancreas, spleen, and ovary expressed Orc3 mRNA (Fig.1), but the protein was undetectable (Fig. 2), suggesting regulation of expression at the post-transcriptional level. Orc4 protein of approximately the correct size (45 kDa) was detected in testis and at least three non-proliferating tissues (lung, kidney, and heart), consistent with the presence of Orc4 mRNA in these tissues. Orc5 was detected in extracts from two non-proliferating tissues: brain and heart. In our hands Orc5 is poorly extracted from proliferating cells using conditions other than 8 m urea, and therefore, the lack of protein in the testis lane probably reflects poor extraction from proliferating cells. The ease of extraction of Orc5 from non-proliferating tissues like the brain and heart, on the other hand, is most likely because the protein is not in a holo complex interacting with the DNA replication machinery. We had earlier reported that the ORC5 locus produces an alternatively spliced mRNA that codes for an ORC5T protein containing the N-terminal two-thirds of Orc5 and a unique cytoplasmic tail of 31 amino acids (21Quintana D.G. Thome K.C. Hou Z. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27137-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Specific anti-ORC5T antibody raised against this unique C-terminal peptide confirmed that the extractable Orc5 protein from brain and heart is not ORC5T (data not shown). Slight variations in the size of ORC protein subunits in some tissues are most likely due to tissue-specific post-translation modifications. For example, the Orc1 protein in the testis and spleen is about 20 kDa larger than the protein in HeLa cells or in the kidney. Orc2 in the liver is about 5-kDa larger that in other tissues. The Orc4 protein exhibits mobility shifts of 2–4 kDa in various tissues. In all cases, the bands shown in the figure were the sole polypeptides detected upon immunoblotting with the relevant antibody (in addition, the anti-Orc2 and anti-Orc4 antibodies had been affinity-purified on recombinant Orc2 or Orc4), leading us to believe that these reactions are specific and recognize either the authentic ORC subunit or a closely related variant. In addition, to eliminate cross-reactive proteins we immunoblotted with the relevant pre-immune control antisera (data not shown). Besides small variations in the sizes of some of the ORC subunits there were two instances with a large variation in the size of the detected protein in a given tissue. A variant protein of 45 kDa reacted with the anti-Orc2 antibody in heart lysates. Similarly, brain expressed a 47-kDa protein that reacted strongly with the anti-Orc3 antibody (instead of the expected 80-kDa Orc3 protein). In both these instances, the cognate mRNA was abundant (Orc2 in heart and Orc3 in brain), so that one hypothesis is that the variant proteins are the products of alternatively spliced mRNA (as we have shown with ORC5T (21Quintana D.G. Thome K.C. Hou Z. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27137-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). We cannot, however, rule out cross-reaction of the antibody to an unrelated tissue-specific protein. The abundance of ORC subunit proteins in tissues that have not proliferated in decades such as heart and brain raise the possibility that the subunits are expressed by infiltrating cells from the blood rather than the non-proliferating cardiac myocytes or neurons. Immunohistochemistry on sections of tissues is another method by which one can confirm the presence of a protein and determine the specific cells expressing the protein of interest. Conditions for immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections were established using sections of testis as positive controls (Fig. 3). The anti-Orc3 and anti-Orc5 antibodies were the only antibodies that gave positive results on these sections, with pre-immune sera giving negative results. Positive staining with two out of the five antibodies tried is a reasonable success rate for immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections. In testis, with its high level of cell proliferation, both Orc3 and Orc5 proteins were detected in the nuclei of proliferating germ cells. Orc3 protein is present in the nucleus of non-proliferating cells in at least three tissues: heart (myocytes), tonsil (lymphocytes outside germinal center), and adrenal (epithelial cells) (Fig.4). We believe that the anti-Orc3 antibody stains Orc3 protein in the tissue section for the following reasons. In all tissues examined, the pre-immune serum exhibited no background staining in the nucleus. Of the tissues on the immunoblots (Fig. 2), nuclear staining with anti-Orc3 antibody was detected only in the testis and the heart (Figs. 3 and 4), the two tissues with an 80-kDa Orc3 protein. Tissues on the blot that did not have the 80-kDa protein (liver, brain, lung, kidney, spleen, and pancreas) did not show nuclear staining with anti-Orc3 antibody (not shown). Based on this correlation we are most certain that nuclear staining in paraffin sections with anti-Orc3 antibody detects the authentic 80-kDa Orc3 protein. Despite the expression of Orc3 mRNA in brain, kidney, spleen, and pancreas, the Orc3 protein is undetectable in these tissues by two independent methods (immunoblot and immunohistochemistry) confirming that the expression must be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The 47-kDa protein detected by the anti-Orc3 antibody in immunoblots of brain extracts (Fig. 2) was not detected by immunostaining (not shown), indicating th"

Furthermore, HCC cells stably transfected with a TFPI-2 expression vector became spontaneously invasive. HCC cells express tissue factor and specifically factor VII. Addition of an antibody to factor VII abolished the pro-invasive effect of TFPI-2. We suggest that TFPI-2 induces invasion following binding to a tissue factor-factor VIIa complex preformed on HCC cells.

Hepatology. 1992; 15: 948-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It is a major complication of liver cirrhosis, although more rarely it will develop on a non-cirrhotic liver. HCC are characterized by a high rate of local, intra-hepatic invasion. HCC are infiltrated by myofibroblast-like cells, located around tumoral sinusoids and in fibrous septa and capsule, when present (2Enzan H. Himeno H. Iwamura S. Onishi S. Saibara T. Yamamoto Y.

In further studies, we showed that HGF induced invasion by increasing the expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) by the cancer cells (6Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V.

Indeed, myofibroblast- or HGF-induced invasion was dose-dependently blocked by a selective uPA antagonist (6Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V. Dubuisson L. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Desmoulière A. Rosenbaum J. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One of the main functions of uPA is to convert the inactive zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, a broad-spectrum proteinase able to degrade several components of the extracellular matrix and thus a likely effector of cancer cell invasion. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), also known as placental protein 5 is a serine proteinase inhibitor containing 3 tandemly arranged Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domains, homologous to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (7Sprecher C.A. Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 exists as 3 isoforms of 27, 31, and 33 kDa that are synthetic products of a single gene and arise from differential glycosylation. TFPI-2 is a strong inhibitor of plasmin as well as of trypsin, plasma kallikrein, and factor XIa. It does not inhibit uPA (8Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 synthesis has been described in dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (9Rao C.N. Liu Y.Y. Peavey C.L. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y. O'Toole E. Reeder D. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem.

In these cell types, the major part of TFPI-2 is sequestered within the extracellular matrix (ECM), presumably bound to heparan sulfate. In the course of a systematic sequencing of a human liver myofibroblast cDNA library described elsewhere (12Blazejewski S. Le Bail B. Boussarie L. Blanc J.F. Malaval L. Okubo K. Saric J. Bioulac-Sage P. Rosenbaum J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar), we found that these cells expressed transcripts for TFPI-2. Given the ability of TFPI-2 to inhibit plasmin, we were interested in defining the contribution of myofibroblast-derived TFPI-2 in regulating the pro-invasive effect of these cells toward HCC cells. Human recombinant rTFPI-2 was expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified as described previously by a series of chromatographic steps (7Sprecher C.A. Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Human recombinant HGF was a generous gift from Dr. George Vande Woude (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). An affinity purified anti-human factor VII IgG was prepared as described (13Wildgoose P. Kisiel W. Blood. 1989; 73: 1888-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by applying a redissolved 50% ammonium sulfate pellet from rabbit anti-factor VII antiserum to a recombinant factor VIIa-Affi-Gel 15 column equilibrated with TBS and eluting with 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), 0.5 m NaCl into a 1/10 volume of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) to immediately neutralize the glycine. HepG2, HuH7, and Hep3B human HCC lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.). HT1080 cells, derived from a human fibrosarcoma, were obtained from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection and grown as the HCC cell lines. Human hepatic myofibroblasts were obtained from explants of non-tumoral liver resected during partial hepatectomy as described previously (14Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were characterized as myofibroblasts as described previously (14Win K.M. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J.

Specifically, the procedure, that is based on the selective growth advantage of myofibroblasts in the culture conditions used, allowed for a 100% pure myofibroblast population, as shown by positive staining for smooth muscle α-actin and vimentin, and negative staining for CD 68 (a Kupffer cell marker), von Willebrand factor (an endothelial cell marker), or cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker) (not shown). This procedure is in accordance with INSERM ethical regulations imposed by French legislation. Myofibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing 5% FCS, 5% pooled human AB serum (Center Régional de Transfusion Sanguine, Bordeaux, France), and 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. Ten μg were analyzed by Northern blot as described (6Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V. Dubuisson L. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P.

Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Three μl of the reaction were used for amplification with the following human TFPI-2 primers: 5′-GTCGATTCTGCTGCTTTTCC-3′, sense primer, corresponding to nucleotides 64–84 of the published sequence (7Sprecher C.A. Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and 5′-ATGGAATTTTCTTTGGTGCG-3′, antisense primer (nucleotides 484–504). Thirty-five cycles were performed, each consisting of 94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min. PCR was performed in 50 μl of a reaction buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1% Triton X-100, 2.4 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μmprimers, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). An aliquot of the reaction was then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of the predicted product is 440 base pairs. For negative controls, reverse transcriptase was omitted during the reverse transcription procedure, or PCR was performed without cDNA. Similar conditions were used to amplify the cDNAs of human tissue factor and human factor VII, using the following primers: tissue factor sense (5′-TTCCTGACCTCAGGTGATCC-3′), tissue factor antisense (5′-GCATATTAGGAAGGTGCCCA-3′), factor VII sense (5′-GGATGCACACACAGATGGTC-3′), and factor VII antisense (5′-ACAGCACACATGGAGTCAGC-3′). The size of the predicted product is 296 base pairs for tissue factor, and 295 base pairs for factor VII. β2-Microglobulin was used as a positive control for RNA integrity and reverse transcription efficiency. To prepare extracellular matrix extracts for Western blotting, cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with serum-free DMEM, and incubated for 24 h in the same medium. The ECM was prepared as described by Raoet al. (10Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y. O'Toole E. Reeder D. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem.

Briefly, cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. The remaining ECM was washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and another 3 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. ECM was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with reducing Laemmli buffer and collected by scraping. ECM or conditioned medium extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) by semi-dry transfer (Transblot-SD, Bio-Rad, Ivry s/Seine, France). The membrane was blocked with 4% skimmed milk in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) for 2 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-TFPI-2 IgG (10 μg/ml) (10Rao C.N.

Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France). For metabolic labeling, cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes. They were washed and incubated for 6 h in 1 ml of methionine-cystine-free DMEM containing 0.25 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN, Orsay, France). The labeled medium was briefly centrifuged and the supernatant was mixed with 1 volume of 2-fold concentrated immunoprecipitation buffer (RIPA buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 138 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm Pefabloc, final concentrations). The cell layer including ECM was directly lysed in warm 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS. Samples were precleared with normal rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma, L'Isle d'Abeau, France) for 1 h, then incubated with 10 μg of anti-TFPI-2 antibody with shaking overnight at 4 °C. As a negative control, the anti-TFPI-2 antibody was replaced by normal rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose. They were washed as described (16Barouki R. Finidori J. Chobert M.N. Aggerbeck M. Laperche Y. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7970-7974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eluted by boiling in 2-fold concentrated reducing loading buffer. They were run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained, destained, dried, and exposed for autoradiography. The full-length human TFPI-2 cDNA was subcloned in the EcoRI site of the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherland). This plasmid, or the empty pcDNA 3.1 vector, was transfected into HepG2 cells with the FugeneTM6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Selection of transfected cells with G418 was initiated 24 h following transfection. Resistant colonies were individually picked, amplified, and analyzed for TFPI-2 expression by RT-PCR and Western blot. Tumor cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 2% FCS and cultured in plastic 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells per well). After 15 h, cultures were washed twice with serum-free DMEM. Triplicates were counted after incubation with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) to determine the number of cells that had adhered to the plastic support (No). In other wells, tumor cells were incubated in triplicate in serum-free DMEM (control medium), with or without 50 nmrTFPI-2. After 2 days of culture, tumor cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and counted in a hemocytometer. Results were expressed as percentages of proliferation (P) as compared with proliferation in control medium. P = (Ne − No/Nc − No) × 100, where No = number of cells that had adhered to the plastic support at the time of seeding; Nc = number of cells in the presence of control medium; Ne = number of cells in experimental samples. A Matrigel invasion assay was performed as described previously (6Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V. Dubuisson L. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Desmoulière A. Rosenbaum J. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8-μm polycarbonate pore size filters inserted in 24-well plates were coated with Matrigel basement membrane matrix (14 μg/filter). 45 × 103HepG2 cells were seeded onto the filters in 2% FCS/DMEM. Serum-free medium was added to the lower compartment so that the final concentration of FCS was 0.4%. In some experiments, rhHGF (100 ng/ml) was added in the lower compartment. After 48 h, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were wiped with a cotton swab. Filters were fixed for 10 min with methanol and stained with hematoxylin. Cells that invaded the lower surface of the filter were counted under a photonic microscope at a final magnification of 320. HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells in 35-mm diameter dishes. After 6 h, they were washed 3 times with serum-free DME and incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM. They were then stimulated for various times with rTFPI-2 in 0.8 ml of DMEM. At the end of the incubation, the dishes were put on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmPefabloc, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, final concentrations. The cells were finally lysed in RIPA buffer with added 0.25% deoxycholate (w/v) and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins were measured with a reagent from Bio-Rad. Fifty μg of proteins were loaded on 10% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Equivalence of loading was assessed by staining the blots in Ponceau Red. The membranes were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the anti-phospho-MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) antibody (Promega), diluted 1/4000. The blots were washed with 10 mmTris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20. The peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in the same buffer containing also 5% skimmed dry milk. The blots were subsequently rehybridized with an antibody to total MAPK (Promega). Northern blot analysis demonstrated a major 1.2-kilobase as well as a minor 1.8-kilobase transcript in myofibroblasts. No TFPI-2 transcripts were detectable in HepG2 cells by either Northern blotting or RT-PCR (not shown). Western blot of myofibroblasts ECM extracts demonstrated the 27-, 31-, and 33-kDa isoforms of TFPI-2 (Fig. 1). No TFPI-2 antigen could be detected in myofibroblast culture medium by this technique. However, using metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, TFPI-2 was observed in both cell/ECM extracts and in culture medium. Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of signal in samples precipitated with control IgG.Figure 1Human liver myofibroblasts express TFPI-2. A, Northern blot. B, Western blot. Extracellular matrix extracts from cultured myofibroblasts were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-TFPI-2 antibody. C,myofibroblasts were labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine. Cell lysates (lanes 1 and 2) and supernatants (lanes 3 and 4) were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to TFPI-2 (lanes 1 and3) or a nonspecific IgG (lanes 2 and4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that myofibroblast-induced invasivity was dependent on secretion of HGF by myofibroblasts, and could be reproduced by rhHGF through an uPA-dependent pathway (6Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V. Dubuisson L. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Desmoulière A. Rosenbaum J. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As HepG2 cells do not produce any detectable TFPI-2, we thus tested whether exogenous rTFPI-2 would counteract HGF-induced invasion of HepG2 cells. Surprisingly, TFPI-2 (50 nm) potentiated the effect of HGF on invasion (Fig. 2 A). This effect was highly significant (p = 0.01, Wilcoxon paired test). The use of control plasmin inhibitors such as ε-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid resulted in a major inhibition of HGF-induced invasion, showing that the latter is indeed plasmin-dependent (Fig.2 B). Moreover, TFPI-2 alone induced invasion of Matrigel by HepG2 cells. This effect was dose-dependent (Fig.2 C). TFPI-2 also increased the invasive behavior of 2 other human HCC cell lines, HuH7 and Hep3B (not shown). As shown on Fig.3 A, the pro-invasive effect of TFPI-2 was not artifactually secondary to an increased proliferation of the cells in the presence of TFPI-2. Additionally, as it had been reported that rTFPI-2 increased the activation of the MAPK ERK1 and ERK2 (17Shinoda E. Yui Y. Hattori R. Tanaka M. Inoue R. Aoyama T. Takimoto Y. Mitsui Y. Miyahara K. Shizuta Y. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5379-5384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we evaluated this activation, using immunoblotting with an anti-active MAPK. No increase in MAPK phosphorylation was observed in dose-response (5–75 nm) (Fig. 3 B) or kinetics study (5 min to 1 h) (not shown) whereas HGF used as positive control was highly active. Interestingly, TFPI-2 abolished the anti-proliferative effect of HGF, even at the lowest concentration tested (5 nm) (Fig. 3 A). To rule out the possibility that the pro-invasive effect of TFPI-2 was due to a contaminant carried over through the purification of the recombinant molecule, we repeated the experiments in the presence of an anti-TFPI-2 antibody. At a concentration of 50 μg/ml, the specific TFPI-2 antibody inhibited by 49.4 ± 11.3% the invasion induced by 50 nm TFPI-2 (n = 5). Control IgG at the same concentration produced only a 6.5 ± 4.7% inhibition. Furthermore, we established stable clones of HepG2, transfected with a TFPI-2 expression vector. Expression of TFPI-2 was verified by RT-PCR (not shown), Western blotting (Fig.4 A), and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 B). One clone that expressed high levels of TFPI-2 was further studied, together with a clone transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 4 C). The TFPI-2-expressing clone was significantly more invasive than the clone containing the empty vector (p = 0.018, Kruskal-Wallis test). The invasivity of this clone could be blocked with anti-TFPI-2 IgG (58 and 42% inhibition with 50 μg/ml antibody in two separate experiments), but not control IgG (10.5 and 6% inhibition, respectively). Invasive activity of the control clone could be enhanced by exogenous rTFPI-2, showing that this clone still retained its sensitivity to TFPI-2 (Fig.4 C). RT-PCR analysis showed that HepG2 cells expressed transcripts for factor VII, as well as for tissue factor. On the other hand, HT 1080 cells did not express detectable factor VII transcripts (Fig. 5 A). An antibody to factor VII dose-dependently blocked the pro-invasive effect of TFPI-2 on HCC cells, whereas a nonimmune IgG was uneffective (Fig.5 B). The antibody effect was highly significant by ANOVA (p = 0.0002). Invasion is a characteristic feature of HCC. In previous studies, we have shown that tumor-associated myofibroblasts strongly promotedin vitro invasion of HCC cells through a HGF/uPA mechanism (5Neaud V. Faouzi S. Guirouilh J. Le Bail B. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V. Dubuisson L. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Desmoulière A. Rosenbaum J. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proteolytic pathway of invasion is dependent on the balance of many components including among others serine proteinases such as uPA and plasmin, matrix metalloproteinases, and proteinase inhibitors (18Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 19Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 20Toi M. Ishigaki S. Tominaga T. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The latter include well characterized proteins such as the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and the plasminogen activator inhibitors-1 and -2. TFPI-2 has been recently recognized as identical to placental protein 5, a serine proteinase inhibitor. We have shown that rTFPI-2 strongly inhibited the in vitroinvasion of the highly invasive HT1080 cell line, presumably through plasmin inhibition (21Rao C.N. Cook B. Liu Y. Chilukuri C. Stack M.S. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that cultured human liver myofibroblasts synthesize TFPI-2 and secrete it, mainly in their ECM. We were thus interested to know whether TFPI-2 regulated the invasivity of HCC cells that involves uPA and plasmin. We tested the effect of exogenous, rTFPI-2, on the invasion of HCC cells that do not synthesize detectable TFPI-2. In our experimental conditions, human HCC cell lines are spontaneously poorly invasive. In these experiments, invasion was induced by addition of rhHGF that mimics the co-culture with myofibroblasts, as described previously (5Neaud V. Faouzi S. Guirouilh J. Le Bail B. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, rTFPI-2 did not decrease invasion in these conditions. On the contrary, it had an additive effect with HGF. Moreover, rTFPI-2 in the absence of HGF induced dose-dependently an invasive activity. These effects were observed with 3 different human HCC cell lines. Several arguments rule out the possibility that this effect was due to a contaminant carried over through the purification of rTFPI-2: first, the effect of rTFPI-2 was blunted by an anti-TFPI-2 antibody; second, HCC cells stably transfected with a TFPI-2 expression vector are more invasive spontaneously that control-transfected cells. As transfected HepG2 cells express the 3 differently glycosylated isoforms, this latter result also argues against the hypothesis that the lack of anti-invasive effect of rTFPI-2 was due to the absence of the lower molecular weight species from the recombinant preparation. Altogether, these results suggested that TFPI-2 could have both an anti-invasive effect, probably indirect and mediated via plasmin inhibition, as well as a direct pro-invasive effect. Other proteinase inhibitors share such a dual effect. Plasminogen activator inhibitors-1, as an inhibitor of plasminogen activation, has anti-invasive properties. On the other hand, it can displace the binding of the uPA receptor to vitronectin, thus allowing cell migration and invasion (22Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This has been nicely demonstrated in vivo using plasminogen activator inhibitor 1−/− mice that show impaired tumor invasion (23Bajou K. Noël A. Gérard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 inhibits MMP-2 activity and can thus reduce ECM breakdown and invasion. However, it also participates in the ternary activation complex of pro-MMP-2, together with MT1-MMP and can thus increase MMP-2 activity (24Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest a mechanism for the pro-invasive effect of TFPI-2. It has recently been shown that the TFPI-2 homolog, TFPI-1, could induce the migration of tissue factor expressing bladder tumor cells in the presence of exogenous factor VIIa (25Fisher E.G. Riewald M. Huang H.Y. Miyagi Y. Kubota Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We reasoned that TFPI-2 could have the same property and that HCC cells, being derived from hepatocytes, were the only tumor cell type with the ability to synthesize factor VII themselves. We have confirmed this expression, as well as that of tissue factor by RT-PCR. On the other hand, HT 1080 cells, which invasion is inhibited by TFPI-2 (21Rao C.N. Cook B. Liu Y. Chilukuri C. Stack M.S. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), do not express factor VII. Finally, we demonstrated that TFPI-2-induced invasion could be dose-dependently inhibited by an antibody to human factor VII. These data suggest that TFPI-2 could induce invasion following binding to a tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, preformed on the surface of HCC cells. Further work is still needed to identify the transduction mechanisms involved in the pro-invasive effect. Altogether, our data identify a new mechanism of invasion, that could be specific for HCC cells. We thank Dr. Yu-ichi Kamikubo and Dr. George Vande Woude for their generous gifts of rTFPI-1 and rhHGF, respectively."

In this study, a CaM-binding protein from maize pollen (maizepollen calmodulin-bindingprotein, MPCBP) was isolated in a protein-protein interaction-based screening using 35S-labeled CaM as a probe.

To map the CaM-binding domain several truncated versions of the MPCBP were expressed in bacteria and tested for their ability to bind CaM. Based on these studies, the CaM-binding domain was mapped to an 18-amino acid stretch between the first and second TPR regions. Gel and fluorescence shift assays performed with CaM and a CaM-binding synthetic peptide further confirmed MPCBP binding to CaM. Western, Northern, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis have shown that MPCBP expression is specific to pollen. MPCBP was detected in both soluble and microsomal proteins. Immunoblots showed the presence of MPCBP in mature and germinating pollen.

Induced Ca2+ fluctuation in the cytosol or modifying extracellular Ca2+ influx redirected pollen tube growth toward the high Ca2+ concentration (13Bibikova T.N. Zhigilei A. Gilroy S.

Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1935-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for pistil-derived Ca2+ in the directed growth of pollen tubes toward the ovary. These studies showed that the establishment and maintenance of a precise tip-focused intracellular Ca2+gradient, possibly through regulating Ca2+ influxes at the tip, is essential for pollen tube elongation and directional growth. How the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient at the tip regulates pollen tube growth and direction is poorly understood. Some studies suggest that Ca2+ interacts directly or indirectly, through Ca2+-binding proteins, with the cytoskeleton to regulate cytoplasmic streaming, vesicle fusion, and the function of cytoskeletal elements required for tube emergence and growth (6Steer M.W.

Calcium-regulated physiological responses are often mediated directly or indirectly by Ca2+-modulated proteins of which CaM is ubiquitous in all eukaryotes. Calmodulin, a Ca2+-modulated protein with four Ca2+-binding EF-hands, is considered to be the primary intracellular Ca2+ receptor in all eukaryotes. In plants, over the last 10 years CaM and CaM isoforms have been identified, and their involvement in transducing Ca2+ signals into a variety of cellular responses has been reported (41Roberts D.M. Harmon A.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 375-414Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 42Snedden W.A. Fromm H.

Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Since CaM acts by modulating the activity of a variety of other proteins directly by interacting with them, research in recent years has focused on identifying the CaM-target proteins and analyzing the function of these proteins in cellular processes. Whereas a wide variety of CaM-activated proteins were described and characterized in animals only a few CaM-binding proteins have been identified in plants and their function in regulating plant growth and development in response to elevated Ca2+ signals is still in its infancy (42Snedden W.A. Fromm H. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 299-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Furthermore, very little is known about CaM-target proteins in pollen (37Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Considering the widespread association between CaM and Ca2+-sensitive cellular processes, it is reasonable to expect CaM to mediate Ca2+ action in pollen tubes. Some reports suggest the involvement of CaM in mediating Ca2+effect on pollen tube growth (37Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Exogenous CaM enhances pollen germination and pollen tube growth (30Ma L. Xu X. Cui S. Sun D.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1983: 53-60Google Scholar), whereas CaM antagonists and anti-CaM serum inhibit pollen germination and tube growth (18Picton J.M. Steer M.W.

Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 319-327PubMed Google Scholar) in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, upon CaM antagonist treatment of pollen tubes, Ca2+ remains in the tip membranes (45Polito V.S. Mulcahy D.L. Ottoviano E. Pollen: Biology and Implications for Plant Breeding. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., Amsterdam1983: 53-60Google Scholar) or its level increases behind the tip (17Obermeyer G. Weisenseel M.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 319-327PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CaM is involved in maintaining Ca2+gradients in the pollen tubes through Ca2+ influx from the plasma membrane channels and/or sequestration of Ca2+ into the internal organelles by CaM-regulated Ca2+-ATPases (34Taylor L.P. Hepler P.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar,47Hepler P.K. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 79-80Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activity has been detected in the plasma membrane of the pollen tube tip as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria behind the tip and these ATPases are stimulated by CaM (7Tirlapur U.K. Cresti M. Ann. Bot. 1992; 69: 503-508Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Calmodulin localization in the pollen during various stages of pollen growth has produced contradicting results. Calmodulin is localized to the region of germinal apertures of the hydrated pollen, the plasma membrane, and the cytoplasm in the vicinity of the germination bubble and in the plasma membrane and the cytosol of the growing pollen tube where it forms an apically focused gradient similar to the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient (7Tirlapur U.K. Cresti M. Ann. Bot. 1992; 69: 503-508Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Tirlapur U.K. Scali M. Moscatelli A. Del Casino C. Cai G. Tiezzi A. Cresti M. Zygote. 1994; 2: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar localization of CaM is observed in the Fucus rhizoid tip pre-emergence location (37Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for CaM in polar growth and tip extension. In other localization studies, however, CaM was found to be diffuse and uniformly distributed in the pollen tube (50Hausser I. Herth W. Reiss H.D. Planta ( Basel ). 1984; 162: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,51Moutinho A. Love J. Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Sex. Plant Reprod. 1998; 11: 131-139Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and no tip high gradient of the protein was observed (51Moutinho A. Love J. Trewavas A.J. Malho R. Sex. Plant Reprod. 1998; 11: 131-139Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent studies on effects of exogenous CaM on pollen tube germination and growth concluded that CaM acts extracellularly exerting its effect on pollen possibly through a signal transduction pathway involving a receptor-mediated stimulation of a G protein (30Ma L. Xu X. Cui S. Sun D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 46Ma L. Sun D. Planta ( Basel ). 1997; 202: 336-340Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although these studies implicate the involvement of CaM in pollen germination and tube growth, little is known about proteins that bind to CaM in pollen. Hence studies on pollen-specific CaM-binding proteins should help us understand the role of CaM in Ca2+-mediated signal transduction pathways in pollen. Here we report the isolation of a gene encoding a maize pollencalmodulin-binding protein (MPCBP) using a protein-protein interaction-based screening of an expression library with radiolabeled CaM. The MPCBP is expressed specifically in mature and germinating pollen and binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The MPCBP contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that are known to function in protein-protein interaction. The region of the protein that binds to CaM is mapped to an 18-amino acid stretch between the TPR1 and TPR2. Pollen-specific expression of MPCBP and its CaM-binding ability suggest a role for this protein in pollen germination and tube growth. Maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines KYS and A632 seeds were germinated on moist filter paper, and the tissues (roots, hypocotyls, and leaves) were collected after 10 days of germination. Mature pollen was collected from tassels of field or greenhouse-grown maize. Freshly collected maize pollen was germinated on a medium containing 12% sucrose, 300 mg/liter CaCl2, 100 mg/liter boric acid, and 0.7% agarose. Triton X-100-free nitrocellulose filter discs were obtained from Millipore. Easy tag35S-isotope labeling mixture was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Exassist helper phage and Escherichia coliSOLR cells were obtained from Stratagene. Nitro blue tetrazolium, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, IPTG, and Trizol were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. pET vectors and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen. Gelatin and diaminobenzidine were obtained from Sigma. Biotinylated CaM and bovine CaM were from Calbiochem. Complete protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, bovine CaM Sepharose-4B, and CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Vanadyl ribonucleoside RNase inhibitor was from BioLabs. Expression and purification of the carboxyl-terminal region of KCBP (1.4C) was described in Reddy et al. (52Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. pET expression vectors containing CaM-2, -4, or -6 isoforms were kindly provided by Dr. Raymond Zielinski (53Liao B. Zielinski R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 49: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expected molecular weights for AtCaM2, -4, and -6 are 16,808, 16,824, and 16,822, respectively. The AtCaM isoforms were induced and purified as described earlier with some modifications (53Liao B. Zielinski R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 49: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the recombinant pET CaM expression clone were grown to A 600 of 0.6 and induced by 1 mm IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C in 1 liter of NZY medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin as described by Fromm and Chua (54Fromm H. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were harvested, washed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and resuspended in extraction buffer (Buffer A with 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml lysozyme, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). After treatment with DNase to remove DNA, the cell extract was clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant fraction was precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate. The proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 50% H2SO4(pH 4) for 30 min with stirring. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 1 mm DTT, dialyzed first in distilled water, and then in buffer A containing 100 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. After adjusting CaCl2 concentration to 5 mm, the protein was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column CL-4B (10 ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm DTT). The column was washed with buffer B containing 5 mm NaCl and the AtCaM protein was eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. The eluates containing the proteins were dialyzed in water. The 35S-AtCaM isoforms were prepared and purified as described (54Fromm H. Chua N.-H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Initially, the cells were grown in M9 medium with 10 g/liter tryptone and 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight and then the cells were concentrated in 10 ml of M9 medium with ampicillin. One mm IPTG was added to the cells (0.6 A 600), 2 mCi of Easy tag35S-labeling mixture was added after 15 min, and the cultures were grown for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A (see above), lysed with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml), and DNase-treated (50 units) in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2. After centrifuging the lysate at 30,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was heated for 3 min at 90 °C, centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used to purify the radiolabeled CaM on a 1-ml phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column as described above. A cDNA library from maize pollen constructed in the EcoRI site of λ Zap II vector was used for screening. About 120,000 recombinants were screened with a mixture of 35S-labeled AtCaM isoforms 4 and 6. Approximately 9000 pfu per 15-cm plate were plated on NZCYM plates using E. coli XL1-blue MRA (Stratagene) as the host strain. The plates were incubated at 42 °C until the plaques appeared, at which time the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that were previously soaked in 10 mm IPTG. Plaques were allowed to resume growth overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then placed at 4 °C for 1 h. The nitrocellulose filters were removed and washed briefly in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2). The filters were blocked in TBS containing 1% nonfat milk for 15 min with gentle shaking at room temperature and then incubated in a mixture of 35S-labeled AtCaM isoforms at 5 μg/ml for 12 h. The membranes were rinsed in TBS/Ca2+ (TBS containing 5 mmCaCl2) three times for 5 min each and dried between 2 sheets of 3MM paper for 24 h before exposing to a x-ray film. The putative positive plaques were plaque-purified by two additional rounds of screening. The cDNA inserts from λ Zap II were excisedin vivo in a plasmid form using the Exassist helper phage and by infecting E. coli SOLR cells with phage recombinant. The insert was excised by digesting the plasmid DNA withEcoRI. The positive clones were confirmed for Ca2+ dependence in binding to CaM by expressing the purified clones as above, incubating the membrane in35S-CaM probe, and washing the membrane in TBS buffer containing either 2 mm Ca2+ or 5 mmEGTA, a Ca2+ chelator. Maize genomic library in λ EMBL3 (CLONTECH) was screened with a32P-labeled cDNA (1.2 kb) according to the standard (55Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). About 650,000 recombinants were screened and about 20 positives were isolated after two rounds of screening. Restriction mapping and Southern analysis of the positive clones indicated that all of the isolated clones were derived from the same gene. The clone with the largest hybridizing fragment was sequenced by primer walking. Both strands of cDNAs were sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination using double stranded DNA. Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector and Sequencher programs. BLAST searches were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. The 1.2-kb cDNA insert (named P3) containing the coding region for 242 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region was cloned in-frame into pET 28b expression vector. For mapping the CaM-binding domain, several truncated constructs were prepared in pET vector. The P3 cDNA in pET 28 vector was digested with either NcoI or BamHI to release the 168- or 717-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of the cDNA. The NcoI andBamHI fragments were cloned into pET 28b vector digested with respective enzymes to generate P3/NcoI and P3/BamHI clones. The P3 clones lacking eitherNcoI or BamHI fragments were religated to generate PΔNcoI and PΔBamHI expression clones. A 531-bp fragment representing the BamHI fragment without the NcoI fragment was also cloned in pET 28b vector. All the clones were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) and expressed. Expression of the protein was achieved by growing the bacterial cells containing the subclones at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.6, IPTG was then added to the cultures to a final concentration of 1 mm and the cells were allowed to grow for 3 more hours at 30 °C. The cells from induced and uninduced cultures were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100), vortexed, and incubated on ice for 1 h. The mixture was then sonicated 3 times, 10 s each, using a Virsonic digital 475 ultrasonic cell disruptor (Virtis, NY). The lysate was then centifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to separate the soluble (supernatant) from the insoluble (pellet) fractions. The pellet was dissolved in either 6 murea containing buffer or sample buffer, and the supernatant and the pellet were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad transfer cell. Expressed proteins were detected by T7 tag monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (T7-AP) (Novagen). Briefly, the blots were blocked for 2 h in TBST buffer (10 mmTris-H"
https://openalex.org/W2020814966,"We recently showed that BNIP-2 is a putative substrate of the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and it possesses GTPase-activating activity toward the small GTPase, Cdc42. The carboxyl terminus of BNIP-2 shares high homology to the non-catalytic domain of Cdc42GAP, termed BCH (forBNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP homology) domain. Despite the lack of obvious homology to any known catalytic domains of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), the BCH domain of BNIP-2 bound Cdc42 and stimulated the GTPase activity via a novel arginine-patch motif similar to that employed by one contributing partner in a Cdc42 homodimer. In contrast, the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP, although it can bind Cdc42, is catalytically inactive. This raises the possibility that these domains might have other roles in the cell. Using glutathione S-transferase recombinant proteins, immunoprecipitation studies, and yeast two-hybrid assays, it was found that BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP could form homo and hetero complexes via their conserved BCH domains. Molecular modeling of the BNIP-2 BCH homodimer complex and subsequent deletion mutagenesis helped to identify the region 217RRKMP221 as the major BCH interaction site within BNIP-2. In comparison, deletion of either the arginine-patch 235RRLRK239 (necessary for GAP activity) or region 288EYV290 (a Cdc42 binding sequence) had no effect on BCH-BCH interaction. Extensive data base searches showed that the BCH domain is highly conserved across species.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Despite lacking obvious sequence homology to the canonical catalytic domain of GAP proteins, BNIP-2 was shown to possess a GAP activity toward Cdc42 (2Low B.C.

We recently identified that this unexpected GAP activity is mediated by several key arginine residues within the COOH terminus of BNIP-2 (25Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that constitute an apparently catalytic motif similar to the “arginine finger” demonstrated in Cdc42 homodimers (26Zhang B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2609-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the COOH-terminal region of BNIP-2 shares a high degree of sequence homology with a region at the NH2-terminal, non-catalytic half of Cdc42GAP, which we termed the BCH (BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAPhomology) domain (25Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP BCH domains can bind Cdc42, but only the BCH domain of BNIP-2 functions as a GAP toward Cdc42 as Cdc42GAP lacks the arginine-finger motif (25Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).We initially identified Cdc42GAP as a BNIP-2-binding protein by a candidate approach based upon the assumption that both proteins, by having a similar domain, can either bind to a common target or bind to each other (2Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There is, however, support for the BCH domain being a potential lipid-targeting sequence. This came from a recent suggestion that the BCH domain shared some homology, albeit low, with Sec14p-like lipid-binding domains (28Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sec14p is a phospholipid exchange protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that mediates the exchange of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol between membrane bilayers. Inactive Sec14 mutations inhibit Golgi transport to endosomes and recently it was demonstrated that temperature-sensitive mutants have decreased amounts of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (29Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In this context phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate seems to be a target phospholipid similar to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and both may play a role in intracellular trafficking.We previously employed precipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid analysis to demonstrate that while BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP can individually bind to and enhance Cdc42 GTPase activity they could also bind to each other (2Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such an interaction between proteins that bind to and activate the same substrate provides a potential controlling mechanism with several layers of complexity. We are primarily interested in establishing which regions of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP are responsible for their homophilic and heterophilic interactions. To do this we have used a series of deletion studies and molecular modeling techniques that enabled a hypothetical model to be constructed and formed the basis for more detailed mutational studies. Using these approaches we found that the BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP are responsible for their homophilic or heterophilic interactions. We further identified a discrete region within the BNIP-2 BCH domain that is responsible for the interactions involving BNIP-2. Having presented evidence to show that the BCH domain was involved in protein-protein interactions we searched various data bases to see what other proteins might contain this domain and to see what other domains they are associated with. The significance of this novel BCH domain-containing family is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe present study examined the interaction between BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP by using in vitro and in vivo binding experiments and demonstrated that their homologous BCH domains primarily mediate both homophilic and heterophilic interaction between the proteins. Deletion studies aided by computer modeling allowed us to further define a unique region at 217RRKMP221of BNIP-2 as the major determinant in the complex formation. This region is distinct from two other regions of BNIP-2 we had recently identified; the arginine-patch 235RRLRK239 and the region 288EYV290 both of which are important for GAP activity of BNIP-2 and its binding to Cdc42, respectively (25Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since all these regions lie within the BCH domain it raises the interesting question as to how the homophilic and heterophilic interaction of BNIP-2 and/or Cdc42GAP (either in their BCH forms or as their full-length entities) would influence their GAP activity toward Cdc42. Our previous studies had shown that the presence of both BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP led to a decreased GAP activity toward Cdc42 in comparison to when either protein was present alone (2Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such experiments suggest that the presence of BNIP-2 could antagonize the GAP activity of Cdc42GAP and vice versa. We have now demonstrated that their binding via BCH domains is at least partly responsible for this inhibitory effect. The BCH-mediated binding of BNIP-2 (specifically via the region-M) negatively regulates the GAP activity of BNIP-2 as well as the Cdc42GAP. We are now trying to establish the site(s) in the Cdc42GAP-BCH domain that is involved in its homophilic and heterophilic interaction, and it remains to be seen whether deletion of such a binding region(s) in Cdc42GAP could lead to an increase in its GAP activity as was seen for BNIP-2.In the case of Cdc42GAP, it was intriguing to see that this molecule harbors two Cdc42-binding domains. In addition to the canonical GAP domain at the carboxyl terminus, we recently identified that the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP can also bind Cdc42 but lacks catalytic activity as it is devoid of the arginine-patch motif found in the BNIP-2 BCH domain. The question arises as to what is the role of the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP? Potentially the Cdc42GAP-BCH domain can act as another binding interface for Cdc42, perhaps by interacting with other regions of the GTPase. Our current findings that Cdc42GAP is also capable of homophilic binding and/or heterophilic interactions with BNIP-2, via the same BCH domain, has added another layer of complexity to the potential regulation of both GAP proteins.The notion that both the BCH and GAP domains in Cdc42GAP and in other members of the RhoGAP subfamily are vital for their possible activation and function is supported by our observations that the spacing between the two domains is well conserved (Fig. 6 B). Nevertheless, the BCH and GAP domains of the various RhoGAPs in tandem are not a universal corollary of RhoGAP catalysis as they appear in only a subset of RhoGAP family proteins. It remains to be seen if there are any unique biochemical or cellular locational peculiarities for this subclass of RhoGAP when compared with those without the proximal BCH domains. Currently there is scant information pertaining to this class of RhoGAP proteins. Similarly, all proteins containing a type-1 BCH distribution, i.e. with their BCH domains at the carboxyl end, have no known functions. Work is currently underway in our laboratory to characterize proteins with each type of BCH domain distribution.To date, all structural studies, and their functional inferences, pertaining to Cdc42GAP and Cdc42 are based on bimolecular complexes between Cdc42 or Rho with the catalytic GAP domain. No studies have been made with either the BCH domain or full-length Cdc42GAP. Structural determinations involving the BCH domain, or better still the whole protein, would give a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of this protein and its interaction with other proteins.The occurrence of at least a dozen distinct proteins with highly conserved BCH domains across so many species suggests that this domain should play a significant role(s) in some biological process(es). With more genomes being sequenced, it is anticipated that the number of proteins harboring similar domains would increase. Although we have shown that the BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP represent a novel protein-protein interaction domain it remains to be seen if all other BCH domains in other proteins are also involved in mediating protein-protein interaction. If they do, interaction among some of these BCH-containing molecules would confer functional diversity for various biological processes. It is worth noting that in the model of the BNIP-2 BCH domain, the region involved in mediating its binding is not conserved in all other “family members” including one of its binding partners, the Cdc42GAP-BCH domain. This non-homology of actual binding region within a conserved structure might provide a mechanism for the regulation of target specificity.Recently, part of the BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP were deemed, after multiple rounds of iteration in PSI-BLAST analysis, to share a limited homology to the Sec14p-like domain, previously known to mediate the exchange of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine inS. cerevisiae (28Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The implications of this observation are manifold. One possibility is that in vivo the BCH domain actually targets to some specific phospholipid moiety and this would direct associated catalytic domains into favorable locations near their substrates. A second possibility is, in addition to mediating protein-protein interaction, BCH domains might bind lipids such that their interaction could be modified and thus regulated, either directly on the protein-binding site or in an allosteric fashion. Regulation of protein-protein interaction by lipids has recently been reported for the intramolecular interaction between the lipid-binding pleckstrin homology and the catalytic Dbl homology domains of Vav or Sos1, two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (39Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase substrate promotes the binding of these two domains and blocks Rac binding to the Dbl homology domain, whereas products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase disrupt such interaction and allows Rac binding for activation. A third possibility is that BCH domains are purely protein-protein interaction domains that have diverged sufficiently from Sec14p lipid-binding domains to have evolved a separate function.Our preliminary data on indirect immunofluorescence of BNIP-2 does not show any unique membrane localization of the protein in cells. Neither plasma or organelle membranes appeared to be stained; instead we observed a punctate pattern of distribution more likely linked to a cytoskeletal distribution (data not shown). This observation apparently rules out the notion of at least the BNIP-2 BCH domain being a membrane lipid-targeting device. Current work is aimed at addressing the detailed intracellular localization of BNIP-2.In conclusion, our present work has shown that BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP define a novel class of protein-protein interaction domain that includes various uncharacterized proteins. It may represent another example of proteins that form dimers as a functional necessity such as: various receptor tyrosine kinases (40Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Our work also highlights the fact that although several structural studies have used the catalytic domain of Cdc42GAP to define a precise interaction with Cdc42 (and Rho) (18Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 46Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) there is still much to be understood about how this protein is targeted and activated and indeed what its actual physiological role is. A better understanding of the structure and functional roles of the BCH domains of BNIP-2, Cdc42GAP, and of other proteins will answer these questions. We recently identified BNIP-2, a previously cloned Bcl-2 and adenovirus E1B-interacting protein (1Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C.

When not tyrosine-phosphorylated BNIP-2 can bind to two cellular targets: Cdc42, a small GTPase and its regulator, Cdc42GAP but this binding is abrogated upon its tyrosine phosphorylation (2Low B.C.

We have now demonstrated that their binding via BCH domains is at least partly responsible for this inhibitory effect. The BCH-mediated binding of BNIP-2 (specifically via the region-M) negatively regulates the GAP activity of BNIP-2 as well as the Cdc42GAP. We are now trying to establish the site(s) in the Cdc42GAP-BCH domain that is involved in its homophilic and heterophilic interaction, and it remains to be seen whether deletion of such a binding region(s) in Cdc42GAP could lead to an increase in its GAP activity as was seen for BNIP-2.In the case of Cdc42GAP, it was intriguing to see that this molecule harbors two Cdc42-binding domains. In addition to the canonical GAP domain at the carboxyl terminus, we recently identified that the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP can also bind Cdc42 but lacks catalytic activity as it is devoid of the arginine-patch motif found in the BNIP-2 BCH domain. The question arises as to what is the role of the BCH domain of Cdc42GAP? Potentially the Cdc42GAP-BCH domain can act as another binding interface for Cdc42, perhaps by interacting with other regions of the GTPase. Our current findings that Cdc42GAP is also capable of homophilic binding and/or heterophilic interactions with BNIP-2, via the same BCH domain, has added another layer of complexity to the potential regulation of both GAP proteins.The notion that both the BCH and GAP domains in Cdc42GAP and in other members of the RhoGAP subfamily are vital for their possible activation and function is supported by our observations that the spacing between the two domains is well conserved (Fig. 6 B). Nevertheless, the BCH and GAP domains of the various RhoGAPs in tandem are not a universal corollary of RhoGAP catalysis as they appear in only a subset of RhoGAP family proteins. It remains to be seen if there are any unique biochemical or cellular locational peculiarities for this subclass of RhoGAP when compared with those without the proximal BCH domains. Currently there is scant information pertaining to this class of RhoGAP proteins. Similarly, all proteins containing a type-1 BCH distribution, i.e. with their BCH domains at the carboxyl end, have no known functions. Work is currently underway in our laboratory to characterize proteins with each type of BCH domain distribution.To date, all structural studies, and their functional inferences, pertaining to Cdc42GAP and Cdc42 are based on bimolecular complexes between Cdc42 or Rho with the catalytic GAP domain. No studies have been made with either the BCH domain or full-length Cdc42GAP. Structural determinations involving the BCH domain, or better still the whole protein, would give a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of this protein and its interaction with other proteins.The occurrence of at least a dozen distinct proteins with highly conserved BCH domains across so many species suggests that this domain should play a significant role(s) in some biological process(es). With more genomes being sequenced, it is anticipated that the number of proteins harboring similar domains would increase. Although we have shown that the BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP represent a novel protein-protein interaction domain it remains to be seen if all other BCH domains in other proteins are also involved in mediating protein-protein interaction. If they do, interaction among some of these BCH-containing molecules would confer functional diversity for various biological processes. It is worth noting that in the model of the BNIP-2 BCH domain, the region involved in mediating its binding is not conserved in all other “family members” including one of its binding partners, the Cdc42GAP-BCH domain. This non-homology of actual binding region within a conserved structure might provide a mechanism for the regulation of target specificity.Recently, part of the BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP were deemed, after multiple rounds of iteration in PSI-BLAST analysis, to share a limited homology to the Sec14p-like domain, previously known to mediate the exchange of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine inS. cerevisiae (28Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The implications of this observation are manifold. One possibility is that in vivo the BCH domain actually targets to some specific phospholipid moiety and this would direct associated catalytic domains into favorable locations near their substrates. A second possibility is, in addition to mediating protein-protein interaction, BCH domains might bind lipids such that their interaction could be modified and thus regulated, either directly on the protein-binding site or in an allosteric fashion. Regulation of protein-protein interaction by lipids has recently been reported for the intramolecular interaction between the lipid-binding pleckstrin homology and the catalytic Dbl homology domains of Vav or Sos1, two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (39Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase substrate promotes the binding of these two domains and blocks Rac binding to the Dbl homology domain, whereas products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase disrupt such interaction and allows Rac binding for activation. A third possibility is that BCH domains are purely protein-protein interaction domains that have diverged sufficiently from Sec14p lipid-binding domains to have evolved a separate function.Our preliminary data on indirect immunofluorescence of BNIP-2 does not show any unique membrane localization of the protein in cells. Neither plasma or organelle membranes appeared to be stained; instead we observed a punctate pattern of distribution more likely linked to a cytoskeletal distribution (data not shown). This observation apparently rules out the notion of at least the BNIP-2 BCH domain being a membrane lipid-targeting device. Current work is aimed at addressing the detailed intracellular localization of BNIP-2.In conclusion, our present work has shown that BCH domains of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP define a novel class of protein-protein interaction domain that includes various uncharacterized proteins. It may represent another example of proteins that form dimers as a functional necessity such as: various receptor tyrosine kinases (40Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Our work also highlights the fact that although several structural studies have used the catalytic domain of Cdc42GAP to define a precise interaction with Cdc42 (and Rho) (18Nassar N. Hoffman G.R.

Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) there is still much to be understood about how this protein is targeted and activated and indeed what its actual physiological role is. A better understanding of the structure and functional roles of the BCH domains of BNIP-2, Cdc42GAP, and of other proteins will answer these questions. The present study examined the interaction between BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP by using in vitro and in vivo binding experiments and demonstrated that their homologous BCH domains primarily mediate both homophilic and heterophilic interaction between the proteins. Deletion studies aided by computer modeling allowed us to further define a unique region at 217RRKMP221of BNIP-2 as the major determinant in the complex formation. This region is distinct from two other regions of BNIP-2 we had recently identified; the arginine-patch 235RRLRK239 and the region 288EYV290 both of which are important for GAP activity of BNIP-2 and its binding to Cdc42, respectively (25Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since all these regions lie within the BCH domain it raises the interesting question as to how the homophilic and heterophilic interaction of BNIP-2 and/or Cdc42GAP (either in their BCH forms or as their full-length entities) would influence their GAP activity toward Cdc42. Our previous studies had shown that the presence of both BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP led to a decreased GAP activity toward Cdc42 in comparison to when either protein was present alone (2Low B.C. Lim Y.P. Lim J. Wong E.S. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33123-33130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

We report here that cell attachment to the extracellular matrix, an intact actin cytoskeleton, and c-Src are absolutely required for the calcitonin-induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins. In contrast to the phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 in cells attached to fibronectin-coated dishes, calcitonin failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 in suspended cells, in cells attached to poly-d-lysine-coated dishes, and in attached cells pretreated with the RGD-containing peptide GRGDS. Overexpression of wild-type c-Src increased calcitonin-induced paxillin and HEF1 phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of kinase-dead Src or Src lacking a functional SH2 domain inhibited the calcitonin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Overexpression of Src lacking the SH3 domain did not affect the calcitonin-induced phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1. In contrast to the regulation of paxillin and HEF1 phosphorylation, the calcitonin-induced phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 did not appear to involve c-Src and was only partially dependent on cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and an intact actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, inhibition of Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation had no effect on the calcitonin-induced phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1. Thus, in C1a-HEK cells, the calcitonin receptor is coupled to the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins and to Erk1/2 phosphorylation by mechanisms that are in large part independent.

The mechanism by which integrin ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been well studied. Upon cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is autophosphorylated, creating a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src (15Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The subsequent binding of Src to FAK activates Src kinase, resulting in the Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of several other FAK tyrosine residues. The Src·FAK complex then binds to and phosphorylates other proteins such as Grb2, paxillin, and p130Cas (16Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

The CT receptor (CTR) is a member of the calcitonin/parathyroid hormone/secretin family of GPCRs. CT inhibits motility and induces marked cellular retraction of isolated osteoclasts, two effects that are related to cell attachment and cytoskeleton organization and that are thought to be essential to the CT-induced inhibition of bone resorption (22Zaidi M.

Using a HEK-293 cell line that overexpresses the C1a isoform of the CTR (C1a-HEK), we have previously shown that CT stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation and association of HEF1 (humanenhancer of filamentation 1), paxillin, and FAK (23Zhang Z.

However, although the Erk1/2 phosphorylation that results from integrin-mediated cell adhesion is inhibited by cytochalasin D (38Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), indicating the need for an intact actin cytoskeleton, this requirement may not apply to the GPCR-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (6Luttrell L.M.

Thus, the mechanisms that couple GPCRs to Erk1/2 phosphorylation, on the one hand, and to the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated cytoskeletal proteins, on the other, appear to differ in some respects. In this study, we show that the CT-induced phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 is completely dependent on integrin-mediated cell adhesion and an intact actin cytoskeleton, but that CT-stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation is partly independent of these requirements. The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 is dependent on c-Src; but, in contrast to what has been reported for some other GPCRs, c-Src is not required for CT-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation does not have an effect on the CT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1. Therefore, the downstream mechanisms that couple the CTR to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion-associated proteins paxillin and HEF1, on the one hand, and to the phosphorylation and activation of Erk1/2, on the other, are apparently independent.

The report that integrin engagement to the ECM is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin downstream of muscarinic m3 receptors (8Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggests that there may be cross-talk between the integrin and GPCR signaling pathways. The activation and phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinases Erk1 and Erk2 can also be activated by both integrin- and GPCR-induced signaling. We have previously shown that CT induces both paxillin/HEF1 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in C1a-HEK cells via protein kinase C- and calcium-dependent mechanisms (23Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25093-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,28Chen Y. Shyu J.-F. Santhanagopal A. Inoue D. David J.-P. Dixon S.J. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19809-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of cell adhesion on the CT-induced phosphorylation of paxillin, HEF1, and Erk1/2 in C1a-HEK cells to determine the role of integrin engagement in these responses. As previously reported (23Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25093-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 1 nm CT stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 in serum-starved C1a-HEK cells attached to culture dishes. However, when the cells were detached and kept suspended in serum-free medium, CT failed to stimulate paxillin and HEF1 phosphorylation (Fig.1, left panels). In contrast, CT stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation in both the suspended and the attached cells, although the degree of stimulation was less in the suspended cells (Fig. 1, left panels). We also examined CT-induced paxillin, HEF1, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cells that were replated on dishes coated with fibronectin or poly-d-lysine. After replating, the cells were cultured for 2.5 h, an interval shown by others to be sufficient for the initial attachment-induced tyrosine phosphorylation to return to basal levels (8Slack B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and then treated with 1 nm CT for an additional 3 min. As shown in Fig. 1 (middle panels), CT stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 in cells plated on fibronectin, but not in cells plated on poly-d-lysine. Again, in contrast to the lack of phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1, CT induced an increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cells replated on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes, although the level of phosphorylation was somewhat less than that seen in cells replated on fibronectin-coated dishes. Finally, we examined the effect of the GRGDS peptide on CT-induced paxillin, HEF1, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This peptide mimics the integrin recognition site on ECM molecules such as fibronectin and vitronectin (45Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit integrin-mediated cell adhesion (46Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GRGDS peptide blocked CT-induced paxillin and HEF1 phosphorylation, but only weakly inhibited CT-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. An inactive analogue, GRGES, had no effect on any of the responses (Fig. 1, right panels). Together, these results suggest that the CTR, like the muscarinic m3 receptor, absolutely requires integrin engagement to induce the phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins. In contrast, CT induces the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 by both attachment-independent and attachment-dependent mechanisms. We showed previously that the CT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and HEF1 is inhibited by cytochalasin D, which prevents actin polymerization and disrupts focal adhesions (23Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25093-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since we found that CT-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation is partly independent of integrin engagement, unlike paxillin and HEF1 phosphorylation, we considered the possibility that CT-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation might also be insensitive to agents that disrupt actin filaments. To test this, C1a-HEK cells were pretreated with either cytochalasin D or latrunculin A, both of which prevent the formation of actin filaments by different mechanisms (47Mehta D. Gunst S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1999; 519: 829-840Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). After stimulating the cells with CT, the phosphorylation states of paxillin and Erk1/2 were characterized. Both cytochalasin D and latrunculin A blocked the CT-induced phosphorylation of paxillin, whereas Erk1/2 phosphorylation was only slightly inhibited (Fig. 2). Thus, in contrast to the case of paxillin and HEF1 phosphorylation, the actin cytoskeleton apparently does not play a major role in the CT-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2. It has been reported that, in at least some instances, the tyrosine kinase c-Src plays a role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and p130Cas and in Erk1/2 phosphorylation downstream of both GPCRs and integrins (10Ishida T.

To investigate this, we incorporated purified Type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor from rat cerebellum into planar lipid bilayers and monitored effects at altered luminal [Ca2+] using K+ as the current carrier. At a high luminal [Ca2+] and in the presence of optimal [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and cytosolic [Ca2+], a short burst of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor channel activity was followed by complete inactivation. Lowering the luminal [Ca2+] caused the channel to reactivate indefinitely. At luminal [Ca2+], reflecting a partially empty store, channel activity did not inactivate. The addition of cytosolic ATP to a channel inactivated by high luminal [Ca2+] caused reactivation. We provide evidence that luminal Ca2+ is exerting its effects via a direct interaction with the luminal face of the receptor.

A further possible role for luminal Ca2+ interaction with the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor is in the control of capacitative Ca2+ entry. The idea of conformational coupling between Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor and a Ca2+ entry channel was proposed by Irvine (16Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and elaborated by Berridge (33Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Recently, direct evidence for interaction between Ins(1,4,5)P3receptors and Ca2+ entry channels in controlling capacitative Ca2+ entry in a variety of cells has been presented (34Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 35Yao Y. Ferrer-Monteil A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y.

Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A key question now is whether or not Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors are capable of direct transduction of the signal concerning the Ca2+ filling status of the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane Ca2+ entry channels or whether accessory proteins are involved. Planar lipid bilayer experiments allow manipulation of the free [Ca2+] on either the cytosolic (cis) or luminal (trans) face of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor, thereby providing a means for studying intraluminal Ca2+ effects under conditions where the free Ca2+ concentrations on either side are clamped at a set value throughout the experiment. Bezprozvanny and Ehrlich (37Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) investigated the effects of trans (or intraluminal) Ca2+ using cerebellar microsomes fused to planar lipid bilayers, with Sr2+, Ba2+, or Mg2+ as current carrier (the use of K+ was precluded by the presence of K+ channels in the microsomal membranes). They found that, in contrast to the effects predicted by Irvine (16Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), intraluminal Ca2+ slightly inhibited channel activity at concentrations greater than 1 mm. However, interpretation of the data is complicated by the possibility of interactions of the divalent cations used as current carriers with potential Ca2+ binding sites on the luminal face of the receptor. To resolve this complication, we have used purified cerebellar Type 1 receptor inlaid into bilayers prepared by the method of Schindler (38Schindler H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This has enabled us to use K+ as current carrier, and since the luminal face of the Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor is likely to be exposed physiologically to around 100 mm K+, K+ is unlikely to interfere with any physiologically relevant properties of the receptor, unlike Sr2+ and other divalent cations (39Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 40Hannaert-Merah Z. Combettes L. Coquil J-F. Swillens S. Mauger J-P. Claret M. Champeil P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Published estimates of luminal free Ca2+ are quite varied depending on the method of measurement (41Bygrave F. Benedetti A. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, most recent estimates seem to put the value for a full Ca2+ store at around 0.5 mm (42Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have looked at the effects of luminal Ca2+ at 1 mm (the upper end of the estimate for a full store), 0.6 mm (around the consensus estimate for a full store), 100 μm (the lower end of the estimate for a full store and the consensus value for a partially empty store), and 300 nm (a totally depleted store).In essence, we find that at 1 and 0.6 mm luminal Ca2+, there is a very rapid run-down of channel activity. This channel activity can be restored by decreasing the Ca2+ on the trans side of the bilayer. Importantly, channel run-down is not observed when ATP is present on the cytosolic face of the receptor, and ATP addition can reactivate channels that have been inactivated. We present evidence that the inhibition by luminal Ca2+ cannot be attributed to Ca2+ moving through the channel and exerting its effects on the cytosolic face of the receptor. The detailed channel parameters that we describe strongly support the idea that channel behavior is dependent on luminal Ca2+ concentrations and that, therefore, the receptor is a potential transducer for the filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores.DISCUSSIONA major finding reported here is that at 1 mm luminal Ca2+ the Type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor appears to show only very transient channel activity, unless ATP is present on the cytosolic side. This is consistent with the observations in perfused, permeabilized cell preparations, where ATP increases the amount of Ca2+ release at relatively high Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations without changing the threshold Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration required for Ca2+release (48Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Sienaert I. Sipma H. Vanlingen S. Maes K. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, a key question is whether luminal Ca2+ is exerting its effect by binding to the luminal face of the receptor or in some other way. Since we have used purified Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor in these experiments, we can eliminate the influence of accessory proteins, unless they are very tightly associated with the receptor and not removed during the purification.There remains the question of whether or not luminal Ca2+is passing through the channel and having an effect on the cytosolic face, where it is known to have both activating and inhibitory effects (1–15). We feel that this is very unlikely for several reasons. First, Bezprozvanny and Ehrlich found a value ofP Ba/P K of 6.3 in their experiments (37Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The unitary current for Ca2+ is lower than for Ba2+, and we have 500 mmK+ present as the major current carrier. This would suggest that in our experiments only about 1% of the single channel current is carried by Ca2+ at 1 mm transCa2+, and the build up of Ca2+ at the cytosolic exit from the channel will, thus, be very small. Since we have 10 mm HEDTA on the cytosolic face, the Ca2+buffering is very substantial, and precisely similar effects are observed when BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) is substituted for HEDTA on the cis side. Furthermore, during the prolonged silent phase after the initial burst of channel activity, it is highly unlikely that an inhibitory Ca2+concentration would remain at the channel mouth for a sufficiently long period to prevent channel re-opening over this time scale. In a few experiments, reversing the polarity of the applied p.d. so that cations would move from cytosolic to luminal face caused a transient reactivation. However, this reactivation was very short-lived and is not compatible with the prolonged activation that would be expected if inhibitory [Ca2+] was being dissipated from the channel mouth by Ca2+ ions moving back up the channel. The cause of this transient reactivation remains obscure, but it may reflect an effect of the rapid reversal of the p.d. on the conformational state of the receptor. We have also previously found that the purified receptor in bilayers is substantially less sensitive to high cytosolic Ca2+ than the receptor incorporated into bilayers from microsomal membranes (15Thrower E.C. Lea E.J.A. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, Mak et al. (49Mak D.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) find that cytosolic ATP does not alter inhibition by cytosolic Ca2+ of the type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor fromXenopus oocytes. We cannot, however, eliminate the possibility that the site of action of luminal Ca2+ is actually within the channel domain of the receptor rather than on the luminal face.In the absence of ATP there are pronounced differences in channel behavior over the range of trans[Ca2+]free that we have used in these experiments. This implies that the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor changes its conformational state in response to luminal Ca2+ and is thus capable, at least in theory, of transducing changes in Ca2+ store loading from the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum to proteins outside of the endoplasmic reticulum such as Ca2+ entry channels. Also, particularly at high luminal [Ca2+], the channel shows transient activation followed by inactivation. It is tempting to equate this behavior with the pronounced biphasic kinetics of Ca2+release from intracellular stores (for review, see Ref. 50Dawson A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 544-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where there is an initial fast phase of Ca2+ release followed by an ongoing slower phase. It should be noted that the experiments at 300 nm trans Ca2+ were continuations of experiments begun at 1 mm transCa2+, the trans Ca2+ being chelated with an appropriate HEDTA concentration. It seems, therefore, that a channel that has inactivated in the presence of high luminal Ca2+ is capable of reactivation by decreasing the luminal Ca2+. Also, at 100 μm transCa2+, the channel shows no sign of inactivation. Physiologically, these effects appear to provide a further form of positive feedback; once a store starts emptying it will continue at an accelerating rate. Decreased inhibition due to decreasing luminal Ca2+ coupled with positive feedback due to released Ca2+ would then act as a “push-pull” mechanism, leading to a very steep channel activation once Ca2+ release is initiated. Particularly at lower trans[Ca2+]free, several subconductance states were routinely observed. Our preparations of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor do not contain detectable levels of FKBP12. Dissociation of this protein from ryanodine receptors has been shown to promote subconductance states in that channel (51Ondias K. Marx S.O. Gaburjakova M. Marks A.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since the immunosupressant FK506 dissociates FKBP12 and affects Ca2+fluxes in cerebellar microsomes (52Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), it is possible that the presence of FKBP12 as an accessory protein in endoplasmic reticulum might lead to changes in the conductance states of the Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor also, although recent evidence suggests (53Bultynck G. De Smet P. Weidema A.F. Ver Heyen M. Maes K. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 681-693Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that the effect on Ca2+ fluxes in this system is probably due to inhibition of the Ca2+ pumps.It is clear from our observations and those of others that ATP is an extremely important regulator of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Under the conditions used in Fig. 7, it behaves, along with Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ca2+, as a co-agonist for channel activation. Physiologically, this may be very significant. As pointed out by Bezprozvanny and Ehrlich (54Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), activation of the receptor by ATP may act as a device to prevent cytosolic Ca2+ overload when the energy state of the cell is compromised. Our results would support this view, with the addition that the effect of ATP is particularly marked when the luminal [Ca2+]free is very high. It should also be noted that there is a close association between mitochondria and the Ca2+ release sites of the endoplasmic reticulum (55Hajnóczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) so that a population of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors may be positioned to monitor directly the rate of ATP production by mitochondria. Although the observations reported here appear to rule out major activating effects of high luminal [Ca2+] on Ins(1,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ release, this contrasts with a number of publications where this has been observed (9Parys J.B. Missiaen L. DeSmedt H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25206-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R.

Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 91-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have studied only the Type 1 receptor, and other isotypes may show different behavior. The second messenger inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)1binds to Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing release of stored Ca2+ into the cell. The subsequent changes in localized levels of cytosolic-free Ca2+ have been shown to exert both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (1–15). This regulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors by cytosolic Ca2+ is highly concentration-dependent. Small elevations in cytosolic [Ca2+] (<300 nm) potentiate Ca2+ release and channel opening, whereas higher concentrations are inhibitory (4Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 6Bezprozvanny I.

A role for intraluminal Ca2+ has been proposed (16Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) in which Ca2+ content of the stores modulates the sensitivity of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor to Ins(1,4,5)P3, and there is some evidence supporting this (9Parys J.B.

DISCUSSIONA major finding reported here is that at 1 mm luminal Ca2+ the Type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor appears to show only very transient channel activity, unless ATP is present on the cytosolic side. This is consistent with the observations in perfused, permeabilized cell preparations, where ATP increases the amount of Ca2+ release at relatively high Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentrations without changing the threshold Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration required for Ca2+release (48Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Sienaert I. Sipma H. Vanlingen S. Maes K. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, a key question is whether luminal Ca2+ is exerting its effect by binding to the luminal face of the receptor or in some other way. Since we have used purified Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor in these experiments, we can eliminate the influence of accessory proteins, unless they are very tightly associated with the receptor and not removed during the purification.There remains the question of whether or not luminal Ca2+is passing through the channel and having an effect on the cytosolic face, where it is known to have both activating and inhibitory effects (1–15). We feel that this is very unlikely for several reasons. First, Bezprozvanny and Ehrlich found a value ofP Ba/P K of 6.3 in their experiments (37Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The unitary current for Ca2+ is lower than for Ba2+, and we have 500 mmK+ present as the major current carrier. This would suggest that in our experiments only about 1% of the single channel current is carried by Ca2+ at 1 mm transCa2+, and the build up of Ca2+ at the cytosolic exit from the channel will, thus, be very small. Since we have 10 mm HEDTA on the cytosolic face, the Ca2+buffering is very substantial, and precisely similar effects are observed when BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) is substituted for HEDTA on the cis side. Furthermore, during the prolonged silent phase after the initial burst of channel activity, it is highly unlikely that an inhibitory Ca2+concentration would remain at the channel mouth for a sufficiently long period to prevent channel re-opening over this time scale. In a few experiments, reversing the polarity of the applied p.d. so that cations would move from cytosolic to luminal face caused a transient reactivation. However, this reactivation was very short-lived and is not compatible with the prolonged activation that would be expected if inhibitory [Ca2+] was being dissipated from the channel mouth by Ca2+ ions moving back up the channel. The cause of this transient reactivation remains obscure, but it may reflect an effect of the rapid reversal of the p.d. on the conformational state of the receptor. We have also previously found that the purified receptor in bilayers is substantially less sensitive to high cytosolic Ca2+ than the receptor incorporated into bilayers from microsomal membranes (15Thrower E.C. Lea E.J.A. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, Mak et al. (49Mak D.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) find that cytosolic ATP does not alter inhibition by cytosolic Ca2+ of the type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor fromXenopus oocytes. We cannot, however, eliminate the possibility that the site of action of luminal Ca2+ is actually within the channel domain of the receptor rather than on the luminal face.In the absence of ATP there are pronounced differences in channel behavior over the range of trans[Ca2+]free that we have used in these experiments. This implies that the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor changes its conformational state in response to luminal Ca2+ and is thus capable, at least in theory, of transducing changes in Ca2+ store loading from the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum to proteins outside of the endoplasmic reticulum such as Ca2+ entry channels. Also, particularly at high luminal [Ca2+], the channel shows transient activation followed by inactivation. It is tempting to equate this behavior with the pronounced biphasic kinetics of Ca2+release from intracellular stores (for review, see Ref. 50Dawson A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 544-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where there is an initial fast phase of Ca2+ release followed by an ongoing slower phase. It should be noted that the experiments at 300 nm trans Ca2+ were continuations of experiments begun at 1 mm transCa2+, the trans Ca2+ being chelated with an appropriate HEDTA concentration. It seems, therefore, that a channel that has inactivated in the presence of high luminal Ca2+ is capable of reactivation by decreasing the luminal Ca2+. Also, at 100 μm transCa2+, the channel shows no sign of inactivation. Physiologically, these effects appear to provide a further form of positive feedback; once a store starts emptying it will continue at an accelerating rate. Decreased inhibition due to decreasing luminal Ca2+ coupled with positive feedback due to released Ca2+ would then act as a “push-pull” mechanism, leading to a very steep channel activation once Ca2+ release is initiated. Particularly at lower trans[Ca2+]free, several subconductance states were routinely observed. Our preparations of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor do not contain detectable levels of FKBP12. Dissociation of this protein from ryanodine receptors has been shown to promote subconductance states in that channel (51Ondias K. Marx S.O. Gaburjakova M. Marks A.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since the immunosupressant FK506 dissociates FKBP12 and affects Ca2+fluxes in cerebellar microsomes (52Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), it is possible that the presence of FKBP12 as an accessory protein in endoplasmic reticulum might lead to changes in the conductance states of the Ins(1,4,5)P3receptor also, although recent evidence suggests (53Bultynck G. De Smet P. Weidema A.F. Ver Heyen M. Maes K. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 681-693Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that the effect on Ca2+ fluxes in this system is probably due to inhibition of the Ca2+ pumps.It is clear from our observations and those of others that ATP is an extremely important regulator of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Under the conditions used in Fig. 7, it behaves, along with Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ca2+, as a co-agonist for channel activation. Physiologically, this may be very significant. As pointed out by Bezprozvanny and Ehrlich (54Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), activation of the receptor by ATP may act as a device to prevent cytosolic Ca2+ overload when the energy state of the cell is compromised. Our results would support this view, with the addition that the effect of ATP is particularly marked when the luminal [Ca2+]free is very high. It should also be noted that there is a close association between mitochondria and the Ca2+ release sites of the endoplasmic reticulum (55Hajnóczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) so that a population of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors may be positioned to monitor directly the rate of ATP production by mitochondria. Although the observations reported here appear to rule out major activating effects of high luminal [Ca2+] on Ins(1,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ release, this contrasts with a number of publications where this has been observed (9Parys J.B.

Unsaturation with ribose 5-phosphate increased the apparent cooperativity of Pi activation. At unsaturating Pi concentrations partial substrate inhibition by ribose 5-phosphate was observed. Together these results suggest that saturation of the enzyme with Pi directs the subsequent ordered binding of Mg2+ and substrates via a fast pathway, whereas saturation with ribose 5-phosphate leads to the binding of Mg2+ and substrates via a slow pathway where Pibinds to the enzyme last. The random mechanism for Pibinding was further supported by studies with competitive inhibitors of Mg2+, MgATP, and ribose 5-phosphate that all appeared noncompetitive when varying Pi at either saturating or unsaturating ribose 5-phosphate concentrations.

Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was found that ADP appears to bind to the allosteric site only in the presence of Rib-5-P. As a consequence, the interaction of PRPP synthase with the allosteric inhibitor ADP appears to involve ADP binding to the allosteric site of the enzyme prior to Mg2+ binding as well as to the enzyme in complex with Mg2+ and substrates. From analysis of the hydrodynamic properties of S. typhimurium PRPP synthase, it was found that Pimaintains the oligomeric structure of the enzyme (23Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. Shelton E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7492-7500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that removal of Pi results in irreversible loss of activity (8Switzer R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Pi in the steady state kinetics of PRPP synthase has not previously been analyzed in detail. Indirect evidence that allosteric Pi activation and ADP inhibition occur by competition for binding to the same site has been presented. The analysis of mutant forms of human PRPP synthase I that have a reduced sensitivity to allosteric inhibition by ADP and GDP revealed a concomitant increase in affinity for Pi (17Becker M.A. Smith P.R. Taylor W. Mustafi R. Switzer R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The inhibitor 4-amino-8-(β-d-ribofuranosylamino)pyrimido[5,4-d]pyrimidine appears to bind at the allosteric site of both human PRPP synthases I and II, and the concentration of the inhibitor needed for half-maximal inhibition increased with increasing Pi concentration (24Fry D.W. Becker M.A. Switzer R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 810-815PubMed Google Scholar). The recent structure of the B. subtilis PRPP synthase in complex with ADP or sulfate ions revealed a hexameric arrangement. The structures indicated that the allosteric site defined by three subunits is the target for binding of both ADP and Pi, the latter being represented by a sulfate ion (25Eriksen T.A. Kadziola A. Bentsen A.K. Harlow K.W. Larsen S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest a more subtle mechanism behind Pi activation apart from maintaining the structure. To gain a more detailed understanding of the regulation of the PRPP synthase, we have analyzed the steady state kinetics of Pi activation of the E. colienzyme and suggest a complete model for the interaction of PRPP synthase with all of its known ligands. ATP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, mATP and Rib-5-P were obtained from Sigma, and cRib-5-P was a gift from R. J. Parry (Rice University, Houston, TX) (26Parry R.J. Burns M.R.

The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid procedure (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

Unless otherwise noted, the free Mg2+ concentration varied within a saturating level of 3–5 mm, because of the varying Piconcentrations. The MgATP concentration was maintained at 2 mm. The nucleotides ADP and mATP was calculated to be more than 90% complexed with Mg2+. The binding of Ca2+ by ATP was neglected when calculating the free Ca2+ concentration, because Mg2+ was present in at least 15-fold excess. The stability constant used for the calculation of the Ca2+ complex with Pi was 0.03 mm−1 (29Smith R.M. Alberty R.A. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 2376-2380Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The concentration of Pi, Rib-5-P and inhibitors varied as indicated. Results of initial velocity experiments were analyzed by fitting data by nonlinear regression to the appropriate Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 using the computer program UltraFit (BioSoft, version 3.01). The standard errors for kinetic parameters presented are those calculated by the program. Equation 1 is the Michaelis-Menten equation for hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics, Equation 2 is the Hill equation for cooperative substrate saturation kinetics, Equation 3 is a general equation for nonhyperbolic saturation kinetics (30Ferdinand W.

Ligand binding was performed as described previously (33Ormö M. Sjöberg B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Lundegaard C. Jensen K.F.

PRPP synthase (4.5 nmol) was incubated at pH 8.2 in 150 μl of 50 mm Pi, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and varying concentrations of ADP (0.2 nCi of [8-14C]ADP per incubation). When present the Rib-5-P concentration was 2 mm. Each incubation was transferred to a Millipore Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter unit and equilibrated to 25 °C and centrifuged for 5–10 min at 5000 × g in a thermostated microcentrifuge (OLE DICH Instruments, Copenhagen, Denmark). Samples (30 μl) from the incubation prior to centrifugation (total ligand) and from the eluent after centrifugation (free ligand) was withdrawn, and radioactivity was quantitated with a Packard 2000 liquid scintillation analyzer. The ADP binding data were analyzed by fitting to Equation 7 or 8 for data obtained in the absence or presence of Rib-5-P, respectively. Equation 7 applies to simple hyperbolic binding, and Equation 8 is a two-site binding model with one site, the allosteric site, showing cooperative binding. N=AmaxL/(KA+L)Equation 7 N=AmaxL/(KA+L)+BmaxLnb/(KBnb+Lnb)Equation 8 where N is mol ADP bound per mol monomer;A max and B max are the numbers of active sites and allosteric sites per monomer of enzyme (34,000 kDa), respectively; L is the unbound ADP concentration; K A and K Bare the half-saturation constants for the active site and the allosteric site, respectively; and nb is the Hill coefficient for binding to the allosteric site. PRPP synthase from E. coli is normally stored and diluted in the presence of 50 mm Pito maintain stability (16Hove-Jensen B. Harlow K.W. King C.J. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to study Piactivation it was necessary to find a condition where the enzyme was stable in the absence of Pi. With 2 mm MgATP or more the enzyme was found to be fully stable upon dilution and subsequent incubation at 37 °C. Because concentrations of free Mg2+ that were kinetically subsaturating, in combination with 2 mm MgATP, fully stabilized the enzyme, it was possible to study the influence of Mg2+ and Rib-5-P, but not MgATP, on the activation of PRPP synthase by Pi. Saturation with free Mg2+ resulted in nearly hyperbolic activation of PRPP synthase by Pi, whereas cooperative activation by Pi was observed at unsaturating free Mg2+ concentrations (Fig.1 A). Apparently, also theS 0.5 for Pi increased when the free Mg2+ concentration was lowered to 14 μm (Fig.1 A). Mg2+ activation appeared hyperbolic at Pi concentrations of 5 mm and above but was clearly cooperative at 1.5 mm Pi (Fig.1 B). However, the concentration for half-saturation with free Mg2+ changed by less than a factor of two over the entire range of Pi concentrations (Fig. 1 B). The apparent cooperativity of Pi activation increased when the Rib-5-P concentration was lowered to 0.5 mm and showed a 2-fold decrease in S 0.5 for Picompared with the results obtained at 5 mm Rib-5-P (Fig.2 A). At 0.5 mmRib-5-P, beginning inhibition by Pi concentrations exceeding 25 mm was observed, probably because of competitive binding to the Rib-5-P binding site. Apparently, the saturation of PRPP synthase with Rib-5-P was sensitive to the Pi concentration because increasing Rib-5-P concentrations induced partial substrate inhibition that was relieved by 50 mm Pi (Fig. 2 B).Figure 1Activation of PRPP synthase by Pior Mg2+.

Results from experiments where Pi was varied in the presence of different fixed concentrations of inhibitor at saturating or nonsaturating Rib-5-P concentrations are presented in Table I. All three inhibitors exhibited linear noncompetitive inhibition of Pi binding regardless of the Rib-5-P concentration. At the tested concentrations of inhibitor and Rib-5-P neither Ca2+, MgmATP, nor cRib-5-P induced inhibition by increasing Pi concentrations.Table IMode of inhibition of Pi activation by inhibitors of PRPP synthaseInhibitorMode of inhibition[Rib-5-P] 1-aThe Pi concentration varied from 0 to 50 mm, except with 0.5 mmRib-5-P, where the Pi concentration varied from 0 to 25 mm.K isK iiK is1K is2mmμmμmμmμmCa2+ b,cnoncompetitive5.032 ± 647 ± 4Ca2+ b,cnoncompetitive0.553 ± 10110 ± 6MgmATP 1-dThe MgmATP concentration varied from 0 to 1.0 mm.noncompetitive5.0229 ± 65230 ± 19MgmATP 1-dThe MgmATP concentration varied from 0 to 1.0 mm.noncompetitive0.5790 ± 279560 ± 34cRib-5-P c,enoncompetitive1.01180 ± 325716 ± 33ADP 1-fConditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 3 A.nonlinear5.018 ± 2111 ± 24competitiveADP 1-gConditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 3 B.nonlinear0.5334 ± 2815 ± 340 ± 14noncompetitiveInhibition constants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b The Ca2+ concentration varied from 0 to 0.2 mm.c The free Mg2+ concentration was maintained at 1.2 mm.e The cRib-5-P concentration varied from 0 to 1.0 mm.1-a The Pi concentration varied from 0 to 50 mm, except with 0.5 mmRib-5-P, where the Pi concentration varied from 0 to 25 mm.1-d The MgmATP concentration varied from 0 to 1.0 mm.1-f Conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 3 A.1-g Conditions were as described in the legend to Fig. 3 B.

When Pi was varied at either 0.5 mm or 5 mm Rib-5-P, the presence of increasing fixed concentrations of ADP resulted in a pronounced nonlinear effect onS 0.5 for Pi (Fig.3 and Table I). The effect of ADP on bothS 0.5 and V app for saturation of the enzyme by Pi in the presence of 0.5 mm Rib-5-P could readily be determined when the data were fitted to Equation 5 (Fig. 3 B and Table I). Data from ADP inhibition of Pi saturation at 5 mm Rib-5-P were fitted as nonlinear competitive inhibition because no effect of ADP on V app could be estimated for the data within the range of Pi concentrations available to us (Fig.3 A and Table I). Increasing the concentration of Pi beyond 50 mm in the assay incubation results in the rapid formation of a MgPiprecipitate. An observed cooperativity in binding of MgmATP to PRPP synthase (14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 0 °C was shown to be an effect of the temperature at which the experiment was performed, because it is absent at 25 °C (11Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the high degree of cooperativity associated with ADP binding to the allosteric site previously determined (14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would also be influenced by temperature, we performed ADP binding experiments at 25 °C. However, the extent of cooperativity in ADP binding to the allosteric site at 25 °C (Fig.4) was not significantly different from that determined previously at 0 °C (14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady state kinetics and ligand binding studies of the S. typhimurium and E. coli PRPP synthases have identified the mechanism for Mg2+, MgATP, and Rib-5-P binding to the enzyme as occurring in that order (8Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2854-2863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2447-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Allosteric binding of ADP has been shown to occur either at conditions where the enzyme is fully saturated with Mg2+ and substrates (14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Switzer R.L. Sogin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hove-Jensen B. Harlow K.W. King C.J. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6765-6771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or prior to binding of Mg2+ and substrates as revealed by cooperative competitive ADP inhibition of Mg2+ activation (11Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By comparing MgmATP and ADP inhibition of Pi activation at 0.5 mm Rib-5-P (Table I) the K ii for ADP is likely to represent binding to the active site in competition with MgATP. The nonlinear effect of ADP on S 0.5 for Pi described by K is1 andK is2 is observed both at 0.5 and 5 mm Rib-5-P. This nonlinear effect of ADP onS 0.5 for Pi is sufficient to explain the inhibition by ADP at 5 mm Rib-5-P. Although aK ii for ADP at 5 mm Rib-5-P would have been expected by comparing with MgmATP inhibition under similar conditions, this could not be extracted from the data. The nonlinear effect of ADP on S 0.5 for Pi, (TableI) suggests that ADP competes with Pi for binding to the regulatory site. However, because neitherK is1 norK is2 is comparable withK is for MgmATP under similar conditions, we hesitate to further assign an exact physical meaning forK is1 andK is2. It appears that ADP and Pi compete for binding to the same enzyme form in a manner largely independent of the Rib-5-P concentration. On the basis of the previous data from ADP inhibition and ligand binding studies mentioned above, we suggest that ADP and Pi compete for binding to the allosteric site of the enzyme either prior to or after binding of Mg2+ and substrates. The results of Fig. 2 shows the characteristics of a steady state random mechanism (30Ferdinand W. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Neet K.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 139-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Wells B.D. Stewart T.A. Fisher J.R. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 60: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with a preferred pathway in which Pi binds to the enzyme prior to Rib-5-P. The kinetic pattern shown in Fig. 2 is likely to result from a difference in the magnitude of the rate constants of otherwise similar kinetic equilibria for a random binding of Pi and Rib-5-P. Because substrate inhibition by Rib-5-P is only partial, it is unlikely to result from formation of a dead end complex. The apparent noncompetitive inhibition of Pi activation observed by Ca2+, MgmATP, or cRib-5-P (Table I) suggests two mechanisms that both would agree with the results of Fig. 2. Either substrates can bind fully random to the enzyme with respect to Pi (i.e. before or after binding of Pi) by a steady state random mechanism, or an ordered binding of Mg2+ and MgATP is proceeded by a random binding of Rib-5-P and Pi. In favor of a fully random mechanism is the absence of inhibition at increasing Pi concentrations induced by the presence of inhibitor. This would be observed to the extent that obligatory binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme occurs prior to Pi and if downstream binding of substrates and Pi also occurs to the enzyme inhibitor complex (36Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ (15Switzer R.L. Sogin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MgmATP (11Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) induce substrate inhibition by Rib-5-P in agreement with the ordered binding mechanism where Rib-5-P binds to the enzyme last. A random mechanism where Mg2+ and substrates bind to PRPP synthase either before or after Pibinding therefore appears most consistent with the results presented here and those previously obtained as mentioned above. In Scheme FS1 an outline of the interaction of PRPP synthase with substrates, activators, and ADP is suggested. The allosteric effectors Pi and ADP compete for binding to the allosteric site of either the free enzyme or enzyme in complex with Mg2+ and substrates. To explain the data of Fig. 2, we have made the assumption that a fast pathway and a slow pathway exist from the free enzyme to the catalytic complex. Furthermore, it is assumed that the binding order of Mg2+, MgATP, and Rib-5-P is conserved whether Pi is bound to the enzyme or not. The noncompetitive inhibition of Pi activation by Ca2+, MgmATP, and Rib-5-P is also consistent with the mechanism in Scheme FS1. According to Scheme FS1 the Mg2+ activation of PRPP synthase should resemble the saturation of the enzyme with Rib-5-P under similar conditions. Accordingly, the results of Fig. 1 A where unsaturation of PRPP synthase with Mg2+ yields cooperative Pi activation can be explained by a preferred pathway in a random mechanism. However, unlike the saturation with Rib-5-P at low Pi concentrations (Fig. 2 B), the Mg2+ activation at 1.5 mm Pi is cooperative (Fig. 1 B), and no inhibition by increasing Mg2+ concentrations is observed. Because apparently no cooperativity is associated with Ca2+ inhibition of Pi activation, it may suggest that the apparent cooperativity of Mg2+ activation at low Pi is not due to homotropic site-site interactions. The apparent cooperativity of Mg2+ activation in the presence of 1.5 mm Pi (Fig. 1 B) may be interpreted in terms of the apparent increase in S 0.5 for Pi at low Mg2+ (Fig. 1 A). If the affinity of the enzyme for Pi binding via the slow pathway is relatively higher, it may favor this pathway over the fast pathway at low Mg2+ concentrations. We realize that Scheme FS1 must somehow be a simplification of the actual overall mechanism for PRPP synthase. One consistent observation that is not explained by Scheme FS1 is the high degree of cooperativity for binding of ADP to the allosteric site (Fig. 4) with Hill coefficients between 3 and 4.4 when determined in the presence of 50 mmPi (11Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Gibson K.J. Schubert K.R. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2391-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results from ADP inhibition of Pi activation at 0.5 mm and 5 mmRib-5-P can be explained without including any cooperativity associated with the ADP inhibition. It seems controversial that ADP and Pi can only bind to the allosteric site of either free enzyme or enzyme complexed with Mg2+ and substrates. However, at present there seems to be no experimental evidence supporting the possibility that ADP can bind to the intermediates of Scheme FS1 other than those indicated, and because ADP and Piapparently compete for binding to the same form(s) of the enzyme, this should be true for Pi as well. Apart from explaining the observed competition between binding of Mg2+ and ADP (11Willemoës M. Hove-Jensen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5078-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,18Sonoda T. Ishizuka T. Ishijima S. Kita K. Ahmad I. Tatibana M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) as a simple consequence of a random mechanism, Scheme FS1 also allows for an equilibrium between active and inactive forms of the enzyme that can be shifted by allosteric effectors and apparently by specific amino acid changes, as suggested from analysis of human mutant enzymes (17Becker M.A. Smith P.R. Taylor W. Mustafi R. Switzer R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The recent solving of the crystal structure of B. subtilisPRPP synthase (25Eriksen T.A. Kadziola A. Bentsen A.K. Harlow K.W. Larsen S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) seems very promising for our attempts to understand the mechanism behind the allosteric regulation of the enzyme. The kinetic analysis presented here suggests what complexes can be expected to be formed between the enzyme and its ligands. When the structural details of more complexes are known other than those likely to represent free enzyme complexed with ADP and Pi, we may address specific questions about the regulatory mechanism in SchemeFS1. The mechanism in Scheme FS1 also addresses the question of actual substrate and activator concentrations under physiological conditions. Because the response of the PRPP synthase to substrates, activators, and ADP seems very dependent on the concentration of Rib-5-P and Pi, it may suggest that the mechanism proposed in Scheme FS1can play a regulatory role in determining the rate of PRPP synthesis in response to changes in metabolite concentrations. This is the topic of work currently in progress in our laboratories. We thank Jørgen Andresen for excellent technical assistance. K. Frank Jensen and Robert L.

Pleckstrin homology domains can mediate inter- and intra-molecular binding events to regulate enzyme activity. They occur in numerous proteins including many that interact with Ras superfamily members, such as p120 GAP. The pleckstrin homology domain of p120 GAP is located in the NH(2)-terminal, noncatalytic region of p120 GAP. Overexpression of the noncatalytic domains of p120 GAP may modulate Ras signal transduction pathways. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the isolated pleckstrin homology domain of p120 GAP specifically inhibits Ras-mediated signaling and transformation but not normal cellular growth. Furthermore, we show that the pleckstrin homology domain binds the catalytic domain of p120 GAP and interferes with the Ras/GAP interaction. Thus, we suggest that the pleckstrin homology domain of p120 GAP may specifically regulate the interaction of Ras with p120 GAP via competitive intra-molecular binding."
https://openalex.org/W1964843584,"Many ligand-independent receptor tyrosine kinases are tumorigenic. The biochemical signals that mediate ligand-independent transformation of cells by these transmembrane receptors are poorly defined. In this report, we demonstrate that a constitutively activated mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (v-ErbB) induces the formation of a transformation-specific signaling module that complexes with myosin II. The components of this signaling complex include the signal adapter proteins Shc, Grb2, and Nck, and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of p21-activated kinase (Pak), caldesmon, and myosin light chain kinase. Transformation-specific, tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak enhances the catalytic activity of this serine/threonine kinase. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak is Rho-, but not Ras-, Rac-, or Cdc42-dependent. These results demonstrate that a ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor mutant can transduce oncogenic signals that are distinct from ligand-dependent, mitogenic signals. In addition, these data provide evidence for the coupling of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases with the actomyosin molecular motor. This myosin-associated signaling module may mediate some of the biochemical changes of myosin found in v-ErbB- transformed fibroblasts, thereby contributing to the regulation of the mechanical forces governing cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal tension, and, hence, anchorage-independent cell growth.

The biochemical signals that mediate transformation by these ligand-independent receptors are poorly defined, including the signals that influence the reorganization of the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton and anchorage-independent cell growth. Two fundamentally distinct mechanisms of oncogenic signaling may be at work: (i) the persistent stimulation of mitogenic signaling pathways by the kinase, or (ii) the stimulation of novel, transformation-specific, signaling networks arising from altered substrate specificity of the kinase. To distinguish between these alternative models, we have studied fibroblast transformation by v-ErbB, a ligand-independent, oncogenic homolog of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).1 Our previous studies provided compelling evidence that there are qualitatively distinct signaling pathways associated with v-ErbB-mediated transformation compared with ligand-dependent, mitogenic signaling. Specifically, we identified a novel, transformation-associated phosphotyrosine protein complex (4McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Src homologous collagen protein (Shc)-phosphotyrosine multiprotein complex forms in fibroblasts expressing a transforming v-ErbB protein, but not in cells stimulated with ligand, or in cells expressing a non-transforming v-ErbB mutant with a constitutively active kinase domain (4McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the signal adapter protein Shc, this protein complex includes growth factor receptor binding protein-2 (Grb2), a 78-kilodalton (kDa) tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the actin-myosin regulatory protein caldesmon, and unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins migrating at 210, 68–75, and 47 kDa (refer to Fig. 1 A, lane S3; see also Ref. 5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although Shc commonly transduces signals through Ras-regulated pathways (6Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), we recently showed that the formation of the transformation-specific Shc-phosphoprotein complex is Ras-independent (7Boerner J.L. McManus M.J. Martin G.S. Maihle N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, anchorage-independent cell growth of v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts is not inhibited by the expression of dominant-negative Ras (7Boerner J.L. McManus M.J. Martin G.S. Maihle N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that the formation of this transformation-specific Shc-phosphoprotein signaling module is dependent on the activation of the guanosine triphosphatase Rho A and is associated with actin stress fiber disassembly and anchorage-independent cell growth. 2J. L. Boerner, M. J. McManus, A. J. Danielsen, and N. J. Maihle, submitted for publication. 2J. L. Boerner, M. J. McManus, A. J. Danielsen, and N. J. Maihle, submitted for publication. Our current studies demonstrate that a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the serine/threonine kinase p21-activated kinase (Pak) is a component of this signaling complex. Specifically, tyrosine-phosphorylated Pak associates with Shc, Nck, caldesmon, myosin, and a 210-kDa isoform of myosin light chain kinase. Furthermore, we show that the transformation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak activates its catalytic domain. Taken together, the transformation-specific tyrosine phosphorylation events and the formation of this phosphotyrosine protein complex demonstrate that oncogenic signaling is distinct from mitogenic signaling, and favor an altered substrate model for ligand-independent signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor. These studies use two v-erbB-encoded epidermal growth factor receptors, designated E1-v-ErbB and S3-v-ErbB. E1-v-ErbB has a truncated extracellular ligand-binding domain resulting in a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain, and transforms erythroblasts but not fibroblasts. S3-v-ErbB has the same ligand-binding domain truncation and constitutively active kinase domain as E1-v-ErbB and, in addition, has a 139-amino acid in-frame deletion in its carboxyl-terminal end. Due to this COOH-terminal deletion, S3-vErbB has lost its leukemogenic potential, but has gained the ability to transform fibroblasts in vitro and to cause avian fibrosarcomas and hemangiosarcomasin vivo (8Raines M.A. Maihle N.J. Moscovici C. Moscovici M.G. Kung H.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2444-2452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). v-erbB cDNAs encoding these mutant oncoproteins were cloned into avian leukosis virus-derived retroviral vectors as described previously (9Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts were infected with these v-erbB helper-independent retroviruses, cultured, and assayed for protein expression of E1-v-ErbB and S3-v-ErbB by immunoblotting as described previously (4McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression levels of these two v-ErbB oncoproteins were consistently equivalent (Fig. 4). Dominant negative (DN) RhoA (T19N) was a gift from Anne Ridley (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom) and was subcloned into RCAS envelope subtype B retroviral vectors. S3-v-erbB and E1-v-erbB were subcloned into RCAN envelope subtype A retroviral vectors (9Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low passage chick embryo fibroblasts were infected with DN RhoA-containing retroviral vectors, then infected with v-erbB-containing retroviral vectors in the presence of Polybrene (10Aftab D.T. Kwan J. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins of Grb2 were produced and purified as described previously (5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The lysate from S3-v-ErbB-transformed CEF (500 mg) was passed over a column of GST-Grb2 glutathione-agarose beads equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl; then eluted with 100 mmphosphotyrosine in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Fractions were collected and monitored for phosphotyrosine content by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Phosphotyrosine-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted in Centricon-10 centrifuge tubes (Amicon, Beverly, MA); they were then lyophilized and solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and amino acid analysis was performed as described previously (5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These methods were performed as described previously (5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Antibodies for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting included monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine IgG (4G10) and polyclonal α-Shc (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), polyclonal α-MLCK (Covance/Babco), monoclonal α-MLCK and monoclonal α-MLC IgM (Sigma), polyclonal α-Pak (C-19) and monoclonal α-Rho (Santa Cruz), monoclonal α-Shc and monoclonal α-Nck (Transduction Laboratories), polyclonal antibody specific for MLCK-210 (gift from D. M. Watterson, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL), polyclonal anti-phosphoserine-19 MLC phosphospecific antibody (11Matsumura F. Ono S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates (500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2 using α-MLCK antibodies (Sigma), followed by the addition of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). Beads were washed in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mmMgCl2 and resuspended in 50 μl of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mmCaCl2-2H2O, 1 μm calmodulin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 13Blumenthal D.K. Stull J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2386-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Purified rat aorta smooth muscle regulatory MLC (gift of P. de Lanerolle, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the reaction mixture was rocked at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 75 μm (final concentration) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction tubes were rocked at room temperature, and aliquots of the supernatant were removed at various time points over 40 min. The assay was terminated in the aliquots by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 3 min. Proteins were separated by 12.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of32P into regulatory MLC was detected by autoradiography. The regulatory MLC bands were excised and counted in a Beckman LS 5000TD liquid scintillation system. For the analysis of the phosphorylation of MLCK-210, the immunoprecipitated MLCK bound to protein A/G-agarose beads (remaining at the conclusion of the MLCK assay described above) was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, heated, and separated by 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of32P into MLCK-210 was detected by autoradiography. We interpreted the phosphorylation of MLCK-210 under these conditions to result from the catalytic activity of co-precipitating Pak (Fig.1 E and Ref. 12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), as MLCK autophosphorylation activity under saturating concentrations of Ca2+/calmodulin is known to be severely depressed (14Tokui T. Ando S. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MLCK-210 by a co-precipitating serine/threonine kinase other than Pak or a tyrosine kinase cannot be ruled out. Pak catalytic activity was measured in an immunocomplex kinase assay using myelin basic protein as the substrate, as described previously (15Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).N,N-Dimethylsphingosine (Sigma) in ethanol was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and solubilized by water bath sonication prior to its use in the Pak assays (16Bokoch G.M.

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP was purified from GST-SHP (a gift from Taolin Yi, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH) by activated factor X. Pak was dephosphorylated by 1 μg of SHP in 25 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C (17Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Protein immunoblot analysis confirmed that equal amounts of PAK were immunoprecipitated from each sample (Fig. 1 E,middle panel; data not shown). The novel, phosphotyrosine protein complex in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts is composed of the signal adapter proteins Shc and Grb2, a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the actomyosin regulatory protein caldesmon, and several unknown phosphotyrosine proteins (5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The formation of this phosphoprotein complex is correlated with transformation by v-ErbB; it does not form in cells stimulated with transforming growth factor-α, or in cells expressing a kinase-active, non-transforming v-ErbB mutant (Fig.1 A and Refs. 4McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Of note, this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein complex does not form in normal fibroblasts as a result of actin microfilament disruption by cytochalasin D 3M. J. McManus, unpublished results. or by inhibitors of Ras or Rho family GTPases (7Boerner J.L. McManus M.J. Martin G.S. Maihle N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar).2 The unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in this complex migrate at 210, 68–75, and 47 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane S3). To identify the 68–75-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein components, we used glutathione S-transferase-Grb2 affinity chromatography followed by phosphotyrosine elution (5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One of the Coomassie-stained protein bands isolated by this method migrated at 75 kDa. Subsequent microsequence analysis of the peptides generated from this 75-kDa protein matched conserved sequences in the kinase domain of p21-activated kinases 1, 2, and 3 (Pak) (data not shown). Next, we used immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis to verify the identity of Pak as a component of the Shc-phosphoprotein complex. Shc co-immunoprecipitation assays detected Pak in association with Shc in both normal and transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, anti-Pak antibodies co-immunoprecipitated the 55- and 52-kDa isoforms of avian Shc in both normal and transformed fibroblasts (Fig.1 C). To verify that the 68–75-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein bands in Fig. 1 A (lane S3) contained tyrosine-phosphorylated isoforms of Pak, we precleared Pak from lysate of v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts prior to anti-Shc immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Fig. 1 D(lane S3 preclear α-Pak) shows that preclearing Pak by immunoprecipitation removes greater than 90% of the 68–75-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated bands, as determined by densitometry. In addition, this preclearing with anti-Pak antibodies removes the 210- and 47-kDa phosphoproteins and significantly diminishes the phosphotyrosine signal at 78, 55, and 52 kDa. Comparison of the densitometric measurements of the 55-kDa Shc protein band in thetwo lanes in Fig. 1 D reveals that at least 50% of this tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc isoform associates with Pak. Furthermore, the fact that the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins migrating at 210, 78 (caldesmon), 68–75 (Pak), 52–55 (Shc), and 47 kDa are precleared by an antibody to Pak offers evidence that these proteins associate in a common, stable complex. The tyrosine-phosphorylated 68–75-kDa proteins found in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts are not present in fibroblasts overexpressing wild type epidermal growth factor receptor and grown in the presence of transforming growth factor-α, nor are they present in fibroblasts overexpressing a constitutively active, non-transforming v-ErbB mutant (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 4McManus M.J. Connolly D.C. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3631-3638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that it is Pak that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in a transformation-associated manner, we immunoprecipitated Pak, followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Fig. 1 E(middle panel, lane S3) demonstrates that Pak is tyrosine-phosphorylated only in transformed fibroblasts. In addition, the 47-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in this complex (Fig. 1 E, bottom panel) was identified as the signal adapter protein Nck (Fig. 1 F,bottom panel). In contrast to Pak, Nck is tyrosine-phosphorylated in both normal and transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 1 E, bottom panel), consistent with previous reports (18Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5843-5856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Guided by our previous results suggesting that this phosphoprotein complex regulates the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton, we used immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses to identify the 210-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that associates with the protein complex in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. Fig. 1 F(top panel) shows that Pak co-precipitates with the 210-kDa isoform of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK-210). MLCK-210 is a recently described major, nonmuscle isoform of MLCK that contains an additional 934 amino-terminal residues compared with smooth muscle MLCK (20Watterson D.M. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Birukov K.G. Stepanova O.V. Shirinsky V.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis revealed that MLCK-210, like Pak and caldesmon, is only tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 1 E, top panel). The observation that MLCK-210 is associated with the Shc-Grb2-caldesmon-Nck-Pak complex suggests that one specific function of this transformation-associated signaling complex is to regulate the phosphorylation state of myosin. It is clear that the phosphotyrosine protein complex in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts contains several components that potentially can regulate the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton. One such regulatory protein is the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of caldesmon, which is a stable component of a Shc-Grb2 signal adapter complex in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (21Wang Z. Danielsen A.J. Maihle N.J. McManus M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33807-33813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine if this Shc-Grb2-caldesmon phosphoprotein complex is a stable subunit of an even larger multiprotein module involving Nck and Pak, we looked for a caldesmon-Pak interaction by co-precipitation assay. Fig.1 G demonstrates that there is a marked increase in Pak association with caldesmon in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts. In fact, Pak antibodies co-immunoprecipitate the majority of caldesmon found in lysates of v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (data not shown and Ref. 5McManus M.J. Lingle W.L. Salisbury J.L. Maihle N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11351-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified a multiprotein signaling module that forms in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts that consists of the signal adapter proteins Shc, Grb2, and Nck, and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of caldesmon, myosin light chain kinase, and Pak. To analyze the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on Pak kinase activity, fibroblasts transformed with v-ErbB and control fibroblasts were incubated in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor-α (Fig.2 A). Using a Pak immunocomplex kinase assay, Pak activation by growth factor stimulation of the control fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A, CEF), or fibroblasts expressing a kinase-active, non-transforming v-ErbB mutant (data not shown), could be detected as early as 1 min after treatment. In contrast, Pak is constitutively active in serum-starved v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 2 A, S3-CEF). To investigate the mechanism of Pak activation in v-ErbB-transformed cells, we used the recently described Pak inhibitorN,N-dimethylsphingosine, which can effectively interfere with the ability of both GTPases and sphingolipids to activate Pak (16Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The activity of Pak immunoprecipitated from ligand-stimulated normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B,CEF + TGF α), or fibroblasts expressing a kinase-active, non-transforming v-ErbB mutant (data not shown), is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by N,N-dimethylsphingosine. However, the kinase activity of Pak derived from v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts is not inhibited by this sphingosine analogue (Fig. 2 B,S3-CEF + TGF α). To determine if the catalytic activity of Pak is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated Pak from v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts and dephosphorylated it's tyrosine residues with a constitutively activated, amino-terminal truncation mutant of the Src homology protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (17Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows that recombinant SHP can efficiently dephosphorylate Pak in vitro. Subsequently, an in vitro kinase assay was used to measure the catalytic activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of Pak derived from v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. Fig. 3 B shows that there is a significant (consistently 2–3-fold) decrease in Pak kinase activity with SHP dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues. In contrast, growth factor-induced Pak kinase activity in normal chick embryo fibroblasts is not affected by the SHP tyrosine phosphatase (data not shown). Recently, we have shown that the formation of the Shc-Grb2-Nck-Pak-caldesmon-MLCK complex and anchorage-independent cell growth in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts is disrupted by the expression of a dominant negative Rho mutant.2 To test whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak also is disrupted by DNRho expression, we co-infected fibroblasts with transforming or non-transforming v-ErbB mutants and a DNRho mutant using avian retroviral vectors. Fig.4 A demonstrates the expression of DNRho (top panel) and both v-ErbB products (middle panel) in the co-infected fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of Pak and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis of lysates from v-ErbB-infected fibroblasts demonstrate that Pak tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited by the expression of DNRho (Fig.4 A, bottom panel, + DNRhoA, + S3-v-ErbB lane). In addition, co-precipitation of Pak with the tyrosine-phosphorylated isoforms of Shc is inhibited by DNRhoA. Fibroblast contractility and tension are regulated by the action of kinases and phosphatases on myosin regulatory light chains and by the direct interaction of myosin with caldesmon (22Helfman D.M. Levy E.T. Berthier C. Shtutman M. Riveline D. Grosheva I. Lachish-Zalait A. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3097-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Pak, MLCK, and caldesmon regulate the actomyosin molecular motor in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts, thereby influencing contractility, tension, and anchorage-independent growth in transformed cells. To determine if there is a direct interaction between the phosphotyrosyl protein complex and the myosin molecular motor assembly, we used anti-myosin immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis. These experiments revealed an association between myosin heavy chain and several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins migrating at 210, 68–78, 55, and 47 kDa (Fig.5 A). This association only occurs in the v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 5 A,lane S3) and is not seen in control fibroblasts or in fibroblasts expressing the kinase-active, non-transforming v-ErbB mutant (Fig. 5 A, lanes CEF andE1, respectively). These transformation-specific, myosin-associated, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified as MLCK (210-kDa isoform), caldesmon (78-kDa isoform), Pak (68–75-kDa isoforms), Shc (55-kDa isoform), and Nck (47-kDa form) by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 B, middle and bottom panels; data not shown). Also noted in these experiments was the dramatic increase in myosin content in the Triton-soluble fraction of v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 5 B, top panel). In addition, we have shown that the myosin-associated phosphoprotein complex does not co-precipitate with actin under these lysis conditions (data not shown). Because myosin-binding proteins regulate the solubility and localization of myosin II in non-muscle cells (23Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), we suggest that this myosin-binding complex influences the conformation, solubility, and actin-binding ability of myosin. To further evaluate the affect of v-ErbB-mediated transformation on myosin localization, we immunostained v-ErbB-transformed and control cells using anti-myosin heavy chain antibodies. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a dramatic reorganization of myosin in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts. As expected, myosin is localized periodically along actin stress fibers and within the membrane ruffles at the leading edge of normal fibroblasts (Fig. 5 C,CEF). In contrast, in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts (Fig.5 C, S3) myosin is diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm with some areas of focal cytoplasmic accumulation. This observation is consistent with the increased Triton X-100-solubility of myosin in v-ErbB-transformed cells (Fig. 5 B, top panel; data not shown) and the association of myosin with the cytoplasmic signal adapter protein Shc (Fig. 5 B,bottom panel). Together, these data suggest that the myosin-associated phosphotyrosine protein complex alters the solubility and localization of myosin in these transformed fibroblasts. In addition to the regulatory role of myosin-binding proteins, the phosphorylation state of myosin has a profound effect on its function. In v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts, the phosphorylation state of myosin II may be regulated by the Pak and MLCK components of the transformation-associated phosphoprotein complex (12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In this model, constitutively activated Pak could down-regulate MLCK activity by direct phosphorylation (12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Consequently, the decreased phosphorylation of regulatory MLC on serine 19 by MLCK would promote the disassembly of myosin filaments and dampen myosin ATPase activity (23Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we determined the phosphorylation status and catalytic activity of MLCK and the phosphorylation status of regulatory MLC in v-ErbB-transformed cells. First, we performed a MLCK immunocomplex phosphorylation assay on MLCK-210. This study revealed that, although MLCK-210 is expressed at similar levels in normalversus transformed cells (Fig.6 A, top panel), MLCK-210 is extensively phosphorylated only in v-ErbB-transformed cells (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). Next, we assessed the catalytic activity of MLCK in normal versus transformed fibroblasts by the ability of MLCK to phosphorylate purified MLC, and by assaying for the in vivo phosphorylation status of regulatory MLC. In vitroanalysis of MLCK catalytic activity shows that MLCK activity in v-ErbB-transformed cells is approximately 60% less than in normal cells (Fig. 6 B). The phosphorylation status of MLC in normalversus transformed fibroblasts corroborates this observation (Fig. 6 C). Specifically, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of MLC show that, although there are equivalent levels of regulatory MLC in transformed versus normal cells (Fig.6 C, left panel), MLC is significantly phosphorylated on serine 19 only in normal cells (Fig. 6 C,middle panel). Furthermore, the overall phosphorylation level of MLC in vivo is decreased in transformed cells (Fig. 6 C, right panel). In summary, Pak is constitutively activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, MLCK is hyperphosphorylated with decreased catalytic activity, and regulatory MLC phosphorylation is significantly decreased in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. Evidence is mounting that dominant transforming genes contribute to the development of human cancers. For genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinases, these dominant mutations commonly disrupt the ligand-binding ability of the receptor and, consequently, cause constitutive activation of the catalytic domain (2Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Examples of such ligand-independent oncoproteins in human malignancies include the Ret tyrosine kinase in multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (24Asai N. Iwashita T. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1613-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P.

Grzeschik C.H. Humphrey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 28Ekstrand A.J. Sugawa N. James C.D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The ligand-independent signaling pathways downstream of these dominant transforming tyrosine kinases continue to be defined; however, the transformation-specific nature of these transduced signals has been difficult to establish. By investigating the signaling pathways of well characterized oncogenic and non-oncogenic mutants of the epidermal growth factor receptor, we have demonstrated ligand-independent, transformation-associated signal transduction mediated by a receptor tyrosine kinase. Specifically, we demonstrate the formation of a myosin-binding, phosphotyrosine protein complex in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts. Components of this complex include: (i) the signal adapter proteins Shc, Nck, and Grb2; (ii) novel, tyrosine-phosphorylated isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase Pak; (iii) tyrosine-phosphorylated MLCK-210; and (iv) tyrosine-phosphorylated caldesmon. The formation and tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein complex represent signaling events that are distinct from the Ras-dependent, mitogenic signal transduction pathways stimulated by the ligand-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor (7Boerner J.L. McManus M.J. Martin G.S. Maihle N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we recently have shown that actin stress fiber disassembly, anchorage-independent cell growth, and formation of this phosphoprotein complex in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts are Rho-dependent events that are independent of the activation of Ras, Rac, and Cdc 42 (7).2 It is important to note that the constitutively activated (but non-transforming in fibroblasts) E1-v-ErbB mutant does not induce the formation of this phosphoprotein complex. Our evidence for novel signaling by an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase not only supports a model in which oncogenesis involves altered substrate specificity of the kinase and the formation of transformation-specific signaling modules, but also suggests that these modules may be ideal targets for the development of cancer-specific molecular therapeutic agents. The Pak component of this signaling module is of particular interest. In v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts Pak is resistant to the inhibitorN,N-dimethylsphingosine. This observation suggests that the mechanism of Pak activation in v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts, in contrast to transforming growth factor-α (TGFα)-dependent Pak activation, does not require either GTPase binding or phospholipid targeting. Given the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak in v-ErbB-transformed cells, we speculate that the constitutive activation of Pak may be related to its tyrosine phosphorylation. In fact, our findings demonstrate that tyrosine dephosphorylation of Pak results in a subsequent decrease in Pak kinase activity in direct support of this hypothesis. Based on these observations, we propose that the transformation-associated tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak may mimic the autoregulatory effect of serine/threonine phosphorylation. This idea is supported by the observation that the replacement of serine/threonine residues with acidic amino acids at known phosphorylation sites in the catalytic domain can directly activate Pak (30Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the conformation of the amino-terminal negative regulatory domain of Pak may be altered by tyrosine phosphorylation, in a manner similar to the allosteric modulation of Pak associated with binding to GTPases (31Tu H. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the mechanism, the constitutive activation of Pak may play a vital role in establishing and maintaining the transformed phenotype of cells. Specifically, it has been shown that constitutively active Pak can disrupt actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (30Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pak also has been shown to regulate upstream components of the actomyosin molecular motor assembly by phosphorylating myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (12Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), LIM kinase (32Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), and caldesmon (33Foster D.B. Shen L.-H. Kelly J. Thibault P. Van Eyk J.E. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, Pak has recently been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate the death-promoting factor Bad (34Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Pak may allow the EGFR oncoprotein to influence not only cytoskeletal mechanics, but block pro-apoptotic pathways as well. Additional studies will be needed to address these potential contributions of Pak to the transformed phenotype. Increasingly, signaling modules are being recognized as a new level of biological organization and regulation (35Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. Nature. 1999; 402 Suppl.: C47-C52Crossref Scopus (2767) Google Scholar). Signaling modules that associate with the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton, such as the module we describe in v-erbB-transformed fibroblasts, could have wide ranging influences on microfilament mechanics, cytoskeletal tension generation, focal adhesion complex formation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and cell cycle progression (36Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 37Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 38Cai S. Pestic-Dragovich L. O'Donnell M.E. Wang N. Ingber D. Elson E. De Lanerolle P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1349-C1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In v-ErbB-transformed fibroblasts, there appears to be a cascade of events involving the ligand-independent activation of Rho and subsequent Pak tyrosine phosphorylation, the formation of the myosin-binding signaling module, the down-regulation of MLCK activity, the dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory subunits, and the reorganization of myosin II. In these transformed fibroblasts, we hypothesize that such modulation of mechanochemical signal transduction events induces anchorage-independent cell growth and other elements of the transformed phenotype (39Huang S. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E131-E138Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Our findings directly support this notion. When dominant negative Rho inhibits Pak tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibits assembly of the multiprotein complex, fibroblasts lose their ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Details of the link between Rho and the formation of this phosphoprotein complex will require further study; however, the fact that tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak does not occur in the presence of dominant negative Rho suggests either that a Rho-dependent tyrosine kinase phosphorylates Pak, and that this phosphorylation is necessary for proper protein-protein interactions within the complex, or that localized disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by DNRho inhibits kinase localization, proper scaffolding, and/or assembly of this complex. In summary, ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor mutants can transduce transformation-specific signals that are distinct from ligand-dependent, mitogenic signals. In this study, we show that these transformation-specific events include the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of Pak and the formation of a Shc-Grb2-caldesmon-Nck-Pak-MLCK protein complex that associates with myosin. This novel signaling pathway couples an oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase with regulatory components of the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton, thus potentially allowing the oncoprotein to alter the balance of mechanical forces governing cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal tension, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent cell growth (36Chicurel M.E.

The proportion of membrane-bound tetramers increases steadily during development and becomes predominant in the adult (5Fernandez H.L. Moreno R.D. Inestrosa N.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1335-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These amphiphilic tetramers (G4a) form clusters on the surface of cultured neurons (6Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2063-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and represent the physiologically active AChE species (7Sorensen K. Gentinetta R. Brodbeck U. J.

The heteromeric structure of these molecules formally resembles that of collagen-tailed forms; in both cases, the catalytic subunits are linked in pairs by disulfide bonds through the cysteine residue located at position −4 from the C terminus of the T peptide; two subunits are linked directly to each other, and the other two are attached to a structural subunit (10Roberts W.L. Doctor B.P. Foster J.D. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7481-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rosenberry T.L. Richardson J.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the membrane-bound tetramers from mammalian brain, two subunits are linked to subunit P. Thus, electrophoresis of the denatured protein without reduction separates light dimers, with two catalytic AChE subunits only, and heavy dimers, which contain two catalytic subunits linked to subunit P. In collagen-tailed AChE this arrangement is reproduced with the PRAD, the proline-rich attachment domain of the ColQ subunit (12Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

The PRAD not only is linked through disulfides to two catalytic subunits but also interacts noncovalently with each of the four T-peptide sequences in a tetrameric cluster (14Simon S. Krejci E. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When AChET subunits are expressed alone in transfected COS cells or Xenopus oocytes, no AChE appears on the cell surface; AChE surface expression does occur when AChET subunits are cotransfected with a chimeric membrane-bound PRAD (14Simon S. Krejci E. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

In mice in which the exon encoding the PRAD of ColQ is deleted by homologous recombination, extracts from brain and muscle contain a G4a AChE form, suggesting that a gene different from ColQ can be involved in anchoring tetrameric AChE at the cell surface (16Feng G. Krejci E. Molgo J. Cunningham J.M. Massoulié J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In order to understand the biosynthetic regulation of physiologically active AChE in brain and muscle, it is necessary to analyze its membrane anchoring. We report here the purification and cloning of a 20-kDa protein that was present in several AChE preparations from bovine brain. This protein is homologous to the Escherichia coli CutA protein (copper tolerance A) (17Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and has already been cloned from various sources. We discuss the structure and expression of the mammalian gene, mCutA, and we compare its homology with proteins from other organisms, including bacteria. We also identify subunit P as a distinct protein by immunoblotting with a specific anti-peptide antibody. Finally, we show that expression of an mCutA antisense mRNA in neuroblastoma cells eliminated AChE accumulation on the cell surface and reduced the level of G4aAChE. AChE was solubilized from fresh or frozen bovine caudate nuclei with 1% Triton X-100 and purified by affinity chromatography with an acridinium resin (2Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high purity of the preparations was indicated by the observation that all bands detectable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining prior to disulfide reduction contained AChE catalytic subunits. Two approaches were taken to obtain peptide sequences from subunit P. In the first approach, purified AChE was reductively radiomethylated with sodium cyanoborohydride and 10 mm14C-labeled formalin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the procedure of Haas and Rosenberry (18Haas R. Rosenberry T.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and dialyzed extensively. This procedure converts primary amine groups in lysine and N-terminal residues to radiolabeled dimethyl amino groups.14C-Methylated bovine brain AChE was reduced by boiling for 5 min in sample buffer containing 40 mm dithiothreitol and 4% SDS and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Preparative electrophoresis was performed in a 6.5-cm cylindrical 10% Tricine gel (approximately 20 ml) with a 1.5-cm stacking gel (19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), contained in a model 491 preparative cell, graciously lent by Dr. S. Dyviniak (Bio-Rad). The upper tank buffer was 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 mTricine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3 (not adjusted). The lower tank buffer was 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, and the elution buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% SDS, pH 8.9. Electrophoresis was at 20-mA constant current (approximately 50 V) for the first hour and thereafter at 40-mA constant current. Proteins electrophoresing off the lower end of the gel were eluted with elution buffer at the rate of 0.08 ml/min and collected in fractions of 17 drops. Fluorographic analysis of samples of seven pools of fractions after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on slab gels (19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) revealed a single diffuse radiolabeled band in each pool with progressively increasing sizes from 3 to 22 kDa, perhaps reflecting varying extents of proteolysis of a 20-kDa anchor component. The pool that contained the highest amount of radioactivity, corresponding to a band of about 16 kDa, was taken for further analysis. The samples were concentrated 5-fold, dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.01% SDS (pH 7), and denaturated with 30% acetonitrile, which was decreased to 5% acetonitrile by evaporation (20Haas R. Rosenberry T.L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) before digestion with 2% (w/w) trypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 37 °C in 0.1 m N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonate (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm calcium acetate. Digests were fractionated by HPLC (Beckman Gold, in a Vydac C18 column) with a gradient from 5 to 70% acetonitrile (containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and water (containing 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid). A second approach was taken in another series of experiments. Purified bovine brain AChE was selectively reduced with 1 mmdithiothreitol in the absence of denaturants and alkylated with [14C]iodoacetamide. This procedure has been shown to reduce and alkylate only sulfhydryl groups involved in intersubunit disulfide bonding in brain AChE (10Roberts W.L. Doctor B.P. Foster J.D. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7481-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled samples were subjected to electrophoresis in Tris-Tricine gels. Electroblotted bands in the 20-kDa region were sequenced directly, or tryptic peptides were isolated by HPLC and sequenced (10Roberts W.L. Doctor B.P. Foster J.D. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7481-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar procedure had been previously used to obtain sequence from the collagen-like subunits associated with Torpedo AChE (21Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The sequences of isolated peptide fractions were determined with by gas phase sequencing (Applied Biosystems model 477A). Radiomethylated lysine residues were identified by scintillation counting of aliquots from effluent fractions. We used cDNA libraries of bovine substantia nigra (gift of Dr. M. Bronstein, NIMH, Bethesda, MD) and reinnervated rat soleus muscle (13Krejci E. Thomine S. Boschetti N. Legay C. Sketelj J. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

The bovine library was made in pCD3 plasmids, and the rat soleus muscle cDNA library was made in pCDM8 plasmids. Both libraries were grown inE. coli in approximately 80 pools of 8000 clones each. Plasmidic DNA prepared from each pool was digested by BamHI (pCD3) or XhoI (pCDM8), loaded on an agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane for Southern blotting. The membranes were hybridized in tetramethylammonium chloride (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar) with degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from peptide sequences (Table I). Hybridization was performed at 37 °C, and washing was as follows: twice at 4 °C for 30 min in 5× SSC, twice in 3 mtetramethylammonium chloride at 20 °C, and twice at 51 °C for 20 min. in 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride. One positive clone was isolated by serial dilution of the positive pools. Screening of the membranes with a probe derived from this clone yielded several other positive signals, from which the longest were isolated. The cDNA corresponding to the longest insert is described. The BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The fusion with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was made using the BamHI site in pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The FLAG peptidic epitope (DYKDDDDK) was introduced at the C terminus of the rat protein by polymerase chain reaction. GST fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli and purified on a glutathione resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according the manufacturer's protocol. A 0.785-kilobase pair insert of the complete coding sequence of the rat mCutA was introduced in antisense orientation in the expression plasmid pTracer SV40 (catalogue number V871–20; Invitrogen). This vector controls the production of a fusion protein GFP-zeocin to select the transfected cells. Human erythrocyte AChE that had been purified by affinity chromatography (24Rosenberry T.L. Scoggin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to prepare a rabbit antiserum, with the assistance of Dr. Linda Younkin (Mayo Clinic Jacksonville). Since erythrocyte AChE corresponds to AChEHand contains no separate membrane attachment subunits, this antiserum interacts only with catalytic subunits. It also cross-reacts with AChE from other mammalian species, as shown by immunofluorescence studies of AChE in mouse neuromuscular junctions (25Rich M. Lichtman J.W. Neuron. 1989; 3: 677-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum denoted C17V against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an internal sequence deduced from the cloned mCutA cDNA with an added N-terminal cysteine (CTSIYEWKGKIEEDSEV) was prepared by coupling the peptide to carrier protein (bovine serum albumin) and injecting into rabbits (Biocytex, Marseille, France). Antibodies against a second peptide GVDANSAVEYPMT, denoted G13T, were purified from rabbit antiserum by adsorption on the immobilized peptide and elution at pH 2.8. AChE samples in gel loading buffer (6.25% glycerol, 4% SDS, 30 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8; with or without 40 mm dithiothreitol as indicated) were incubated at 50 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis in precast Tris-HCl criterion 4–15% linear acrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) with 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, and 0.1% SDS (pH 8.5) as the electrophoresis buffer. Gel electroblotting onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was conducted in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot apparatus. After transfer, blots were blocked by soaking 1–3 days in 50 mmTris-H3PO4, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), and 10% newborn calf serum and incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies as described. Blots were then washed for 30 min in blocking buffer containing 0.01% Tween 20, incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Life Technologies, Inc.) (diluted 1:20,000), and washed further for 3–6 days. The blots were then developed for enhanced chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce). COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (26Duval N. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained at 37 °C and extracted 2–4 days after transfection. The murine neuroblastoma cell line, N18TG2 (kindly provided by M. Thomasi and M. Israël), was maintained in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2, and cells were mechanically dislodged for passages. The culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Life Technologies) was supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Prior to experiments, cells were grown for 5 days in tissue culture flasks (75 cm2) or 35-mm Petri dishes without changing the culture medium, which was supplemented with 2% Me2SO to induce differentiation. N18TG2 cultures were transfected with either 1 μg of mCutA antisense vector or 1 μg of pTracer-SV40 without the insert as a control, using 3 μl of Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche) (27Hanner M. Vianna-Jorge R. Kamassah A. Schmalhofer W.A. Knaus H.G. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16289-16296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stably transfected clones were selected with 300 μg/ml zeocin for ∼20 days and visually checked for the expression of the fusion protein GFP-zeocin. The surface of the cell monolayer was washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cells were then mechanically dislodged in PBS and pelleted. The pellet was homogenized by repeated pipetting and 30 s in a glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in extraction solution (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmbenzamidine, 1% Brij 96, 0.8 m NaCl, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were clarified by a short centrifugation facilitate the determination of AChE activity (28Ellman G.L. Courtney D.K. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21510) Google Scholar). Sedimentation analysis of AChE forms was performed in 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradients containing 0.8m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1% Brij 96 that were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) at 7 °C for 16 h. AChE activity was assayed by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (28Ellman G.L. Courtney D.K. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21510) Google Scholar) and normalized to the total extracted protein determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). Sedimentation coefficients were deduced by a linear relationship from the positions of internal marker proteins alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) and β-galactosidase (16 S) from E. coli. Microscope slides were coated with poly-l-ornithine (10 μg/ml) in PBS for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were attached to slides, and the slides were first washed once in PBS and then preincubated in protein block serum-free ready-to-use solution (DAKO) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated with A63 primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-rat AChE (29Marsh D. Grassi J. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) diluted 1:300 or with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody at 7 ng/ml (Eastman Kodak Co.) in Dulbecco's Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (TBS-BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed and then incubated with the secondary antibody (rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit or fluorescein anti-mouse IgG 1:250 in TBS-BSA) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing, samples were mounted in a glycine-containing mounting solution (Fluoprep, Biomérieux). No staining was observed in controls where the primary antibody was omitted. Initial sequence information on 20-kDa proteins that are candidates for subunit P was obtained after selective reduction of AChE purified from bovine caudate nucleus and electrophoresis on Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Large quantities of up to 400 μg of protein per lane were necessary to obtain sequences from electroblotted bands in the 20-kDa region. We thus obtained an N-terminal sequence EPQKSXSKVTDS and a tryptic peptide sequence GVDANSAVEYPMT. In order to isolate larger amounts of the 20-kDa peptides, we ran radiomethylated and reduced brain AChE on preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gels and collected individual fractions. Several tryptic peptides were isolated and sequenced from a labeled peak fraction corresponding to about 16 kDa, as shown in Table I. We screened cDNA libraries from bovine substantia nigra with degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from the peptide sequences in TableI. A first screening of the library with oligonucleotides allowed us to identify a partial cDNA clone, which was then used as a probe for a further screening of the bovine library and of a rat soleus library. We thus obtained complete bovine and rat cDNAs. The deduced protein, mCutA, corresponded to 19 kDa and included several sequenced peptides (underlined in Fig. 1), indicating that we cloned a 20-kDa protein that was present in our purified AChE preparations. It is noteworthy that the same cDNA was cloned by similar procedures from human brain AChE purified by a different affinity chromatography protocol (30Navaratnam D.S. Fernando F.S. Priddle J.D. Giles K. Clegg S.M. Pappin D.J. Craig I. Smith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Partial cDNA clones (EST) corresponding to mCutA have also been found in a number of mammalian tissues (brain, placenta, and several other organs). Fig. 1 shows the alignment of bovine and rat peptide sequences deduced from cDNAs. The human mCutA gene, also calledCUTA, is localized in a BAC (AL050332) on chromosome 6 (6p21.3), as reported (30Navaratnam D.S. Fernando F.S. Priddle J.D. Giles K. Clegg S.M. Pappin D.J. Craig I. Smith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We analyzed the structure of the human gene by mapping ESTs to the cosmid. We found alternative splicing, generating at least four different transcripts that may be translated into three putative proteins (Fig. 1). The mCutA cDNA that was found in rat, bovine, and human encodes a hydrophobic N-terminal sequence that is predicted to represent either a cleavable secretion signal, a mitochondrial import signal, or a transmembrane anchor of type II (with a cytoplasmic N terminus). The bovine and rat proteins are very similar, except that in addition to two conserved cysteines, the rat protein contains two additional cysteines, located in the N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. The presence of cysteines in the mature protein might allow the formation of disulfide bonds with AChET, but the cloned protein contains no peptidic motif resembling the binding domain of the collagen tail, the proline-rich attachment domain, in which two adjacent cysteines are followed by a series of prolines (12Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Simon S. Krejci E. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mCutA sequence includes the six peptides shown in Table I but not the two peptides EPQKSXSKVTDS and GVDANSAVEYPMT from the initial electroblots. Screening of cDNA libraries, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses did not reveal alternative transcripts, originating from the mCutA gene, that could encode these peptides. In addition, a cosmid containing the human mCutA gene did not contain corresponding sequences. These data suggest that at least two distinct proteins were present in highly purified AChE preparations. In order to understand their relationship with the enzyme, we generated two antisera, one (C17V) to an mCutA peptide and the other (G13T) to the peptide GVDANSAVEYPMT that presumably is in the second protein. With these antibodies, we analyzed purified AChE preparations by Western blots. Analysis of nonreduced and reduced brain AChE samples on SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed a variety of components. In a nonreduced sample (Fig. 2 A,lane 1), antibodies against AChE catalytic subunits labeled light monomers (60 kDa), a small amount of heavy monomers (80 kDa), light and heavy dimers (140 and 160 kDa), and higher oligomers, as described previously (2Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide reduction decreased the intensity of most heavy bands and slightly retarded the migration of light monomers (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), in agreement with the presence of three intrasubunit disulfide bonds (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). These patterns correspond to those obtained by silver staining bands of purified brain AChE on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (2Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B (lane 1) shows that, in the absence of reduction, the polyclonal antibodies G13T, directed against the peptide GVDANSAVEYPMT, mostly labeled heavy dimers and other heavy bands to a lesser degree. This pattern is similar to that previously reported with the monoclonal antibody 132-6, prepared against heat-denatured human brain AChE, which recognizes subunit P when it is disulfide-linked to catalytic subunits (31Liao J. Norgaard-Pedersen B. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a reduced sample (Fig.2 B, lane 2), G13T recognized a doublet or a triplet of about 15–17 kDa. The banding patterns inlanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 2 Bare identical to those in autoradiographs obtained after labeling bovine brain AChE with the hydrophobic photoactivated reagent125I-labeled TID (2Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J.

Since this reagent essentially labels only subunit P (2Inestrosa N.C. Roberts W.L. Marshall T.L. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4441-4444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Boschetti N. Brodbeck U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these patterns provide strong evidence that G13T recognizes subunit P. Fig. 2 C shows that the C17V antiserum, directed against mCutA, recognized a low molecular mass band of around 10 kDa, which was observed in nonreduced as well as in reduced samples and therefore was not disulfide-linked to AChE. Because of the high sensitivity of the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system and"

In our laboratory, the adenovirus system has been used as a model to gain insight into consequences of foreign DNA integration. We have shown that the insertion of foreign DNA can lead to changes in cellular DNA methylation patterns even remote from the site of transgene integration (18Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P.

We have studied the dynamics of 7-1A methylation for up to 12 generations in different mouse strains. We have also asked additional questions. Are the observed changes in transgene methylation restricted to specific 5′-CG-3′ sites? How many factors influence the observed alterations in methylation? Is there a correlation between transgene methylation and the copy number of heterologous genome segments present? The origins and relationships of the inbred mouse strains DBA/2, 129, FVB/N, C57BL/6, Balb/c, and CBA are reviewed in Beck et al. (33Beck J.A. Lloyd S. Hafezparast M. Lennon-Pierce M. Eppig J.T.

Cleavage at the seven HpaII sites (see map inb) revealed a loss of methylation in the DBA/2 line, as evidenced by the almost complete absence of the 4.8- and 5.3-kbp off-size bands (arrows on the left) which represented the junctions linking the transgene to genomic DNA. The 3.3-kbp transgene repeat fragment in the C57BL/6 and Balb/c lines exhibited about double intensity when compared with DBA/2 DNA. This fragment was created by the cleavage at the unique BamHI restriction site. Densitometric evaluation (see “Experimental Procedures”) of the cleavage patterns revealed that the transgene copies in DBA/2 mice were approximately 20% methylated, whereas the C57BL/6 lines (about 55% methylation) and Balb/c (about 62% methylation) favored de novo methylation of their transgenes. C, control animal DBA/2. b, thepAd2E2AL-CAT construct contained seven HpaII (H) restriction sites, one BamHI and a singleHhaI site. The transgene consisted of two short pBR322 vector sequences at both ends, as well as a simian virus 40 (SV40) poly(A) sequence with the CAT gene as reporter gene, driven by the adenoviral E2A late (Ad2-E2AL) promoter. This construct was used as hybridization probe in all hybridization experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Animals were screened for the presence of the transgene by cutting tail tips of 3–4-week-old mice. Tail and organ tissues were frozen in liquid N2, mortar-pulverized, and then incubated at 55 °C for a minimum of 12 h in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 500 μg of proteinase K per ml). Proteinase K was then inactivated for 30 min at 65 °C. Subsequently, RNase A (20 μg/ml) was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was then purified by one phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction followed by one phenol:chloroform (1:1) treatment. The DNA samples were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and 20 μg of each sample was used to identify transgenic animals. The methylation levels were determined by cleaving the DNA with BamHI (10 units/μg DNA) for 5 h followed by either HpaII orMspI (10 units/μg DNA) incubation overnight. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels in 1× TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for about 14 h at 30–40 V. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for 5–10 min, destained in water, and then prepared for downward Southern transfer (35Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar) to Nylon plus membranes (Qiagen). ThepAd2E2AL-CAT construct with flanking pBR322 vector sequences was used as 32P-labeled hybridization probe in all hybridization experiments. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray films for 1–3 days. Methylation indices were determined by comparing the intensities of the HpaII (methylated) with theMspI (unmethylated) bands on the autoradiogram. The autoradiograms were scanned and analyzed by two different computer programs, Cybertech CS-1 Image Processing Software and TINA version 2.08. Some of the blots were also evaluated with the help of a PhosphorImager (Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS 1000). In earlier work in our laboratory, six mouse lines transgenic for the pAd2E2AL-CATwere established (34Lettmann C. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The founder animal of line 7-1 originated from a microinjection experiment with an unmethylated transgene and had a mixed C57BL/6 × DBA/2 genetic background. Mouse line 7-1 was characterized by the stable integration of an estimated number of 10 transgene copies in a de novo methylated state. These animals had initially been mated to C57BL/6 animals for one generation. Out of this offspring, a transgenic male was selected to initiate systematic crossing experiments (Fig. 1, animal F1, number 8). The methylation patterns of all animals from the ensuing crosses were routinely screened by BamHI/HpaII restriction and subsequent Southern blot hybridization. Transgenic male animals were crossed further with non-transgenic hybrid strain B6D2F1females (C57BL/6 × DBA/2) for at least 4 generations. Although these transgenic animals were heterozygous for thepAd2E2AL-CAT transgene, they transmitted transgenes usually to about 70% of the offspring. Thus, the transgenes were located on separate chromosomes. As previously shown, the 7-1 mouse line carried two short arrays of four (A) and six (B) transgenes, respectively, in two different chromosomal locations (12Koetsier P.A. Mangel L. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Starting from the F4 cross, the separate transgene arrays were isolated on individual loci, resulting in the mouse lines 7-1A and 7-1B. Most of the six transgenes in the 7-1B animals were completely methylated at the 5′-CCGG-3′ (HpaII) sites, whereas transmission of the7-1A transgenes in a mixed B6D2F1 background sometimes led to a significant decrease in transgene methylation. Males from both 7-1 mouse lines were subsequently mated to non-transgenic C57BL76, DBA/2, or Balb/c females. These crosses revealed that the methylation status of the 7-1A locus was influenced by the genetic background of the mouse strain. The DBA/2 background favored the loss of methylation from the 7-1A transgenes, whereas the C57BL/6 and Balb/c backgrounds not only maintained the methylation pattern but led to an increase in transgene methylation. Strain-specific effects were, however, not found for the 7-1B line. This finding indicated position effects on the methylation of thepAd2E2AL-CAT transgene. Starting with animals F5number 18 and F5 number 24 (Fig. 1), consecutive matings with animals from different mouse strains (C57BL/6, Balb/c, DBA/2, CB20, FVB/N, or 129/sv) were performed to assess the effect of the inbred genetic background on the methylation patterns of the transgene in the 7-1A progeny. The breeding experiments generated four main 7-1A lines that were screened for over 11 generations as follows: two C57BL/6 lines with moderate to highde novo methylation of the transgene, very high methylation levels in the Balb/c line, and the decrease of methylation in the DBA/2 line. Typical transgene methylation profiles of the 7-1A transgene in animals from different strains are presented in Fig. 2 a. Among different animals, there is some variability in the extent of transgene methylation. In the experiment shown here, densitometric evaluation of transgene methylation revealed 22% for the DBA/2 animals, 55% for C57BL/6, and 62% for Balb/c mice. The HpaII-MspI cleavage patterns were evaluated by densitometry. The ratio of HpaII bands representing methylated transgene segments, most of which were larger than 2.0 kbp,1 to MspI fragments reflecting unmethylated transgene segments facilitated an assessment of the levels of 5′-CCGG-3′ methylation in the transgenes of these mice. The cleavage patterns of the seven HpaII sites (Fig. 2 b) revealed that the transgene in the DBA/2 line lost methylation, as evidenced by the almost complete absence of the 4.8- and 5.3-kbp off-size bands (Fig. 2 a). These bands carried the junctions that linked the transgene to genomic DNA. Cleavage at the unique BamHI restriction site in the transgene produced a strong signal for the 3.3-kbp transgene repeat band, which exhibited about twice the intensity in the DNA from the highly methylating mouse strains C57BL/6 and Balb/c (Fig. 2 a). The transgene copies with low levels of methylation were approximately 20% methylated, whereas the hypermethylated copies in the C57BL/6 strain reached levels of methylation between 40 and 60%. In the Balb/c genetic background, the methylation of the pAd2E2AL-CAT transgene was in excess of 80%. The high degree of 5′-CCGG-3′ methylation correlated with the loss of CAT activity in the transgene. These methylation and expression patterns were identical in all organs, except when the transgenic construct had become demethylated and regained CAT activity (34Lettmann C. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The increasing loss of methylation from the transgene in the germ line might signal an epigenetic reprogramming event at early stages of gametogenesis. Obviously, in the chromosomal location of the7-1A transgene, the genetic background of the animals played a major role in determining the maintenance or alterations of the methylation status in a foreign DNA transgene that had been introduced into the founder generation of hybrid C57BL/6-DBA/2 mice. The kind and number of genetic strain-specific factors affecting de novomethylation and its alterations in transgenes were unknown. Therefore, we performed a large number of crosses to transfer the transgene from the hybrid strain into a more homogeneous background and to keep it there for several generations. For example, starting with the F7 animal 10 (Fig. 1) nine generations of backcrosses to DBA/2 mice resulted in a 99.8% DBA/2 genetic background. Since a DBA/2 background favored the loss of methylation of the 7-1Atransgenes, matings were set up to investigate to what extent, after the prolonged crossing to DBA/2 animals, methylation in the transgene was decreased and whether the expression of the CAT gene could be reactivated. With successive backcrossings in a genetic DBA/2 background, methylation of the 7-1A transgene was reduced to and maintained at the 10–30% level (Fig.3 a). In these breedings, the transgene was always transmitted by the males to rule out a putative cytoplasmic reprogramming mechanism of the transgene during oogenesis. However, no significant variations in methylation were observed when transgenic 7-1A females were crossed with males of the same strain (data not shown). Regression analyses of methylation levels (Fig. 3 a) demonstrated that in the DBA/2 animals transgene methylation remained stable at a level of 21%. Among siblings of the same litter, a 10% variation in transgene methylation was found. However, these differences were not transmitted to the offspring. Even in a pure genetic background of >99%, the transgene methylation remained mosaic and was associated with the silencing of thepAd2E2AL-CAT transgene. All transgenes in animals resulting from Balb/c × 7-1A-Balb/c or C57BL/6 × 7-1A-C57BL/6 crosses remained hypermethylated after the initial de novo methylation in the F1generation (Fig. 3, b and c). The transgenes in the C57BL/6 animals showed comparable methylation levels at around 55%; transgenic animals from backcrosses into Balb/c had a methylation level of 61.5% in the transgenes. In earlier work, we had shown in crosses with mixed genetic background BDF1 × BDF1 (Fig. 1) that in only 10% of the offspring transgene methylation was lost, and in the following generations the grandparental methylation patterns were usually reestablished (12Koetsier P.A. Mangel L. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ensemble of results (Fig. 3) suggests that both mouse strains, C57BL/6 and Balb/c, supply dominant factors favoring de novomethylation. The methylation dynamic of the 7-1A transgene resembles that of the TKZ751 transgene in mice (22Allen N.D. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 853-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23Reik W. Howlett S.K. Surani M.A. Development. 1990; 3 (suppl.): 99-106Google Scholar) in which the Balb/c genetic background led to stronger de novomethylation than the C57BL/6 background. In addition to these B6 mouse lines, an additional C57BL/6-(b) line was established. In contrast to C57BL/6-(a), this line originated from animal number 24F5 which was derived from animals showing no loss of methylation in their transgenes. After the first backcross, however, these animals exhibited a methylation pattern similar to that in the C57BL/6-(a) line. In both lines, the variation of transgene methylation was somewhat higher than in the other strains analyzed. For a more detailed analysis of these reproducibly observed strain-specific modifications, we backcrossed the 7-1A transgene into mouse strains FVB/N, 129/sv, or CB20 (data not shown). Starting from a DBA/2 animal with a hypomethylated transgene, its transfer into the FVB/N strain did not further affect the low level of transgene methylation. This observation paralleled the behavior of the RSVIgmyctransgenes in the same mouse strain (36Chaillet J.R. Bader D.S. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with 129/sv mice. Again like for other transgenes (22Allen N.D. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 853-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the 129/sv background favored a moderate loss of methylation of the transgene. In testis, the transgene was fully demethylated, an effect typical for many strain-specifically methylated transgenes (8Chaillet J.R. Vogt T.F. Beier D.R. Leder P. Cell. 1991; 66: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Sapienza C. Paquette J. Tran T.H. Peterson A. Development. 1989; 107: 165-168PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lettmann C. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to the FVB/N and 129/sv strains, the CB20 background led to de novo methylation. The CB20 mouse strain originated from Balb/c and C57BL/6 animals and might also harbor factors promoting methylation. The observed strain-specific variations of transgene methylation are presumably subject to the control of modifying genes that are different in individual mouse strains. To test this hypothesis, a series of crosses was analyzed. At first, we investigated to what extent the highly methylated transgene phenotype in Balb/c mice could be reversed. Hence, we crossed the highly methylated transgene in the Balb/c animals into a DBA/2 background (Fig. 4). Conversely, the hypomethylated transgene from DBA/2 animals was backcrossed into a Balb/c background (Fig. 5 a). In both experiments, the transgenes in the offspring showed the hypermethylated phenotype of the Balb/c mice. Therefore, the Balb/c genetic background seemed to play a dominant role in this process. At least after the first backcross, the methylation phenotypes were not immediately reversed.Figure 5Epigenetic stability of the hypomethylated transgene copies. a, methylation status of transgenic progeny from crosses with 7-1A DBA/2 males with hypomethylated transgene. The following crosses were analyzed: C57BL/6 × 7-1A-DBA/2 (black bars), Balb/c × 7-1A-DBA/2 (white bars), and DBA/2 × 7-1A-DBA/2 (dark gray bars). All male transgenic animals were randomly chosen for analyses and stemmed from the 9th DBA/2 backcross generation with an estimated 99.8% pure genetic background. All transgenes that were maintained in a DBA/2 background remained hypomethylated, whereas transmissions into Balb/c or C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds always led to significant de novo methylation of the transgenes. Therefore, both genetic backgrounds, Balb/c and C57/BL6, may contribute at least one dominant factor directing the de novomethylation of the 7-1A transgene. b, non-mendelian segregation of methylation phenotypes in progeny of crosses (C57BL/6 × DBA/2)F1 × 7-1A-DBA/2. One-third of the F1 animals exhibited the typical DBA/2 pattern (0–30% methylation), and two-thirds showed the C57BL/6 phenotype in their 7-1A transgenes (31–60% methylation). Methylation indices were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also tested whether the genetic factors would work in an independent fashion or, when inherited as heterozygous loci, by complementing each other. The hypermethylated transgene from Balb/c males was, therefore, crossed into a C57BL/6 genetic background. Intriguingly, all offspring showed the typical B6 methylation pattern of the 7-1Atransgene (Fig. 6). These data indicated that the B6 allele was not only dominant over the DBA/2 allele (Fig.5 a) but also over the Balb/c allele. This result suggests the existence of a dominant factor affecting levels of DNA methylation in the C57BL/6 genetic background. The initial strategy was to correlate the methylation in the offspring of crosses between DBA/2 males and (B6 × D2)F1 females with previously characterized polymorphic loci. But instead of either the B6 or the D2 methylation phenotypes, additional methylation phenotypes were observed (data not shown). This result indicated that a multitude of factors could contribute to the establishment of distinct methylation phenotypes. Similarly complex patterns of methylation were encountered in segregation analyses with the transgenes E36 (25Schweizer J. Valenza-Schaerly P. Goret F. Pourcel C. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Hadchouel M. Farza H. Simon D. Tiollais P. Pourcel C.

Academic Press, New York1992: 69-73Crossref Google Scholar) and TKZ751(22Allen N.D. Norris M.L. Surani M.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 853-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the complex role of genetic backgrounds in transgene methylation was adduced by crossing (C57BL/6 × DBA/2) F1 females with 7-1A males of the DBA/2 background. Consistent with the notion of multiple methylation modifier loci, a non-mendelian segregation of methylation levels was apparent in the progeny (Fig. 5 b). One-third of the offspring carried hypermethylated transgenes, whereas two-thirds of the progeny showed ade novo methylation that represented the B6 phenotype. These results indicate that the effect of several factors combine to modulate the transgene methylation in the 7-1A lines. Interestingly, the observed de novo methylation might be directed to specific 5′-CG-3′ dinucleotides (Fig.7). HpaII and HhaI cleavage patterns of transgenic DNA from DBA/2, Balb/c, and C57BL/6 (not shown) were compared among animals of both sexes, which were randomly chosen from the sixth and seventh backcross generations. Although striking differences in HpaII-(CCGG) methylation were observed, the same animals showed no difference in theirHhaI-(GCGC) cleavage patterns. This HhaI sequence is the only such site located within the pBR322 sequences of the construct. We conclude that the process of strain-specific transgene methylation seems to be a very specific modification that is dependent on more than one host-specific factor as well as on position effects. In recent years, a large number of transgenic mice have been generated to study various issues in genetics, like gene function or gene therapy. It is of considerable interest to understand the events accompanying or following the insertion of foreign DNA into established mammalian genomes (39Doerfler W. Foreign DNA in Mamma"
https://openalex.org/W2036644684,"CD39-like ectoapyrases are involved in protein and lipid glycosylation in the Golgi lumen of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using a two-hybrid screen, we found that an activator subunit (Vma13p) of yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) binds to the cytoplasmic domain of Ynd1p, a yeast ectoapyrase. Interaction of Ynd1p with Vma13p was demonstrated by direct binding and co-immunoprecipitation. Surprisingly, the membrane-bound ADPase activity of Ynd1p in a vma13Delta mutant was drastically increased compared with that of Ynd1p in VMA13 cells. A similar increase in the apyrase activity of Ynd1p was found in a vma1Delta mutant, in which the catalytic subunit A of V-ATPase is missing, and the membrane peripheral subunits including Vma13p are dissociated from the membranes. However, the E286Q mutant of VMA1, which assembles inactive V-ATPase complex including Vma13p in the membrane, retained wild type levels of Ynd1p activity, demonstrating that the presence of Vma13p rather than the function of V-ATPase in the membrane represses Ynd1p activity. These results suggest that association of Vma13p with the cytoplasmic domain of Ynd1p regulates its apyrase activity in the Golgi lumen."

The substantial activity ofK NDP channels in millimolar MgATP suggested that KIR6.1, in contrast to KIR6.2, does not interact with inhibitory ATP (7Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol.

The activity of homomeric KIR6.1 channels has not been demonstrated, and SUR is apparently required to stimulate channel activity.The possible functional significance and even existence of hybrid (KIR6.1/KIR6.2)/SUR complexes is controversial. Although over-expression of KIR6.1 in Xenopusoocytes reduced surface expression of KIR6.2 lacking the RKR motif (2Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Analysis of these channels shows their conductivity is specified both by the ratio of KIR6.1 to KIR6.2 and by the subunit order. Unexpectedly, inclusion of one KIR6.2 subunit was sufficient to produce spontaneous bursting in the absence of ATP, and all of the possible hybrid channels exhibited a uniform sensitivity to inhibitory ATP that was indistinguishable from KIR6.2-2-2-2-based channels.RESULTSCo-expression of the parental KIR6.1GGGS and KIR6.2GGGS constructs with SUR1 produced channels that were indistinguishable from native, and recombinantK NDP and K ATP channels in terms of their nucleotide responsiveness and an ∼2-fold difference in their g values (Fig.1 A).K NDP channels were active in cell-attached patches, and the transition to a nucleotide-free intracellular solution in the inside-out configuration resulted in a transient increase in their activity before they closed. TheseK NDP channels remained in an operational state and could be activated by MgUDP, known to be an effective stimulator but a poor inhibitor of KIR6.2/SUR1 channels (15Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G.

The rapid wash-out of ATP applied in the presence of Mg2+resulted in a transient increase in K NDP channel activity similar to that observed upon transition to the inside-out configuration. By contrast, the spontaneous steady-state activity of KIR6.2/SUR1 channels in an inside-out patch was dramatically reduced by sub-millimolar MgATP and inhibited by ATP in Mg2+-free internal solution with an IC50(ATP)of 6.1 ± 0.4 μm (n = 5, not shown). This value was indistinguishable from that of wild type β-cellK ATP channels determined under similar conditions (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), verifying that there is no effect of theGGGS tail on ATP-inhibitory gating.On the basis of the different characteristics of the parental channels, we expected hybrid channels to have intermediate properties, and we determined g, ability to burst spontaneously, and ATP sensitivity of KIR6.X-X-X-X concatemers co-expressed with SUR1. Co-expression of KIR6.2-2-2-2 with SUR1, but not the concatemer alone, generated spontaneously active channels, which were inhibited by ATP with an IC50(ATP)∼10−5m (Fig. 1 B), verifying that linking the pore forming subunits did not compromise inhibitory nucleotide binding. Co-expression of KIR6.1-1-1-1 with SUR1 generated channels with negligible activity in nucleotide- and/or Mg2+-free internal solutions that were maximally activated by 10 mm MgUDP. Finally, co-expression of each KIR6.1-X-X-2 with SUR1 generated nucleotide-sensitive K+ channels. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, KIR6.1-1-1-2/SUR1 channels produced currents after wash-out of UDP and Mg2+, which were half-maximally inhibited by ∼10−5m ATP. To support the assertion that these currents were through hybrid pores and not through KIR6.24pores assembled from multiple concatemers, we collected first-level openings from records of multi-channel currents partially inhibited by ATP over a time interval sufficient to accumulate a statistically significant number of single-channel openings. Segments of the resulting traces for KIR6.1-1-1-2 versusKIR6.2-2-2-2-containing channels are shown to theright in Fig. 1 Ba. The all-points current amplitude histograms constructed from these traces (Fig. 1 Bb, right) revealed a single i peak corresponding to ag intermediate between that of KIR6.14 and KIR6.24pores. The uniform intermediate, g, was derived from a similar test with millimolar MgATP, which will maintain lowP o openings of channels with any KIRcomposition. The results illustrate the homogeneity of these hybrid channels and demonstrate that one KIR6.2/tetrameric pore is sufficient to ensure spontaneous bursting and confer classicalK ATP channel-like sensitivity to inhibitory ATP. Similar measurements on all of the other channels generated by co-expression of KIR6.1-2-1-2, KIR6.1-1-2-2, or KIR6.1-2-2-2 with SUR1 (3–5 independent transfections for each combination with >103 channels observed) led to the conclusion that each concatemer specified one hybrid channel type in which characteristics were determined uniquely by concatemer composition. This finding permitted determination of statistically representative values of relative g versus IC50(ATP) for all possible types of spontaneously bursting hybrid K ATP channels in Mg2+-free internal solution (Fig. 1 C). The results show four types of channels with distinguishable intermediateg values, consistent with the concatemers specifying subunit composition and order in tetrameric pores. Two KIR6.1 subunits reduce the conductivity more when they are “across the pore” than when they are adjacent to each other, consistent with observations in K V channels (17Zheng J. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 457-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast to the differences in g, the IC50(ATP) values are statistically indistinguishable, and we conclude that all of the hybrid KIR6.X-X-X-X/SUR4 channels are as highly sensitive to inhibitory ATP as KIR6.2-2-2-2/SUR4 channels.DISCUSSIONAlthough the existence of true hybrid KIR6.1/KIR6.2 channels is problematic (see (Refs. 2Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar and 12Seharaseyon J. Sasaki N. Ohler A. Sato T. Fraser H. Johns D.C. O'Rourke B. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17561-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), our results show that concatemerized subunits form functional, regulated, hybrid K ATP channels when co-expressed with SUR1, demonstrating that the interactions involved in gating are preserved. The characteristics of these hybrid channels are determined by the KIR6.1/KIR6.2 ratio and subunit position in the concatemers consistent with a single concatemer forming a pore. The results imply that a search for hybridK ATP channels in native cells is reasonable and that measurements of i and IC50(ATP) from the same single channel patch will allow verification of the KIR composition of these presumably rare KIR/SUR channels in mammalian cells.The different hybrid channels exhibit distinguishable intermediateg values, although the H5 regions of KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 are identical. Our results are in agreement with the report by Repunte et al. (5Repunte V.P. Nakamura H. Fujita A. Horio Y. Findlay I. Pott L. Kurachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that amino acids in the M1-H5 loop or “turret” (positions 123–125 and 113–115 for KIR6.1 and KIR6.2, respectively) and in the H5-M2 loop (position 148 and 138 for KIR6.1 and KIR6.2, respectively) specify the difference ing between KIR6.1- and KIR6.2-based channels. Hybrid pores containing greater numbers of KIR6.2 extracellular loops have higher g values. The result is consistent with the smaller volume of the amino acid side chain of Val138 versus Met148 in KIR6.2 versus KIR6.1. We see a positional effect of adjacent versus diagonal extracellular loops on g, which could be the result of limiting diffusion of K+ through the outer vestibule of the pore and/or from nonequivalent interactions between the different KIR6.X subunits affecting the molecular dynamics of the K+ selectivity filter. The first possibility is supported by a prediction from a KIR6.2 tetramer model (5Repunte V.P. Nakamura H. Fujita A. Horio Y. Findlay I. Pott L. Kurachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) based on the KcsA crystal structure (18Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5682) Google Scholar) that two Met148 side chains of KIR6.1 will restrict the diffusion of K+ through the external vestibule more than the less bulky Val138 side chain of KIR6.2 when they are across the pore rather than adjacent to each other. A similar idea, based on the hydrodynamic theory of Dwyer et al. (19Dwyer T.M. Adams D.J. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1980; 75: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), has been used to explain a qualitatively similar effect of subunit order on g of heteromeric cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (20Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 983-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). With regard to possible effects on the dynamics of the selectivity filter, we note that the potential intersubunit salt bridges between the conserved R andE following the K+ channel signature G(Y/F)G sequence are unlikely as pK A calculations, based on a homology model of the KIR6.2 tetramer embedded into a lipid bilayer (21Capener C.E.

J. 2000; 78: 2929-2942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), indicate that these E are protonated. Intersubunit H-bonds equivalent to those between Trp68 in the pore helix and Tyr78 in the signature motif of adjacent subunits in KcsA (22Berneche S. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2900-2917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) are also unlikely because phenylalanines occupy the corresponding positions in KIR6.X. We note, however, that Glu104 and Glu108, at the extracellular mouth of the KIR6.2 tetramer (21Capener C.E. Shrivastava I.H. Ranatunga K.M. Forrest L.R. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2929-2942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), are in the variable M1-H5 turret region of KIR6.X. Repunteet al. (5Repunte V.P. Nakamura H. Fujita A. Horio Y. Findlay I. Pott L. Kurachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have suggested that this region does not contribute to the g difference, but possible differential interactions between adjacent residues in KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 might result from the longer extracellular linker in KIR6.1 and contribute to the effects of subunit order ong. Molecular dynamics simulations of hybridK ATP channels may aid our understanding of the possible biophysical mechanisms behind the observed conductivity differences in KIR6.X4 hybrids that result from the asymmetrical contributions of subunits to the permeation properties of heteromultimeric KIR (23Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1330-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The substitution of one KIR6.2 into a KIR6.1-6.1-6.1-6.1 concatemer was sufficient to destabilize the permanently closed state of K NDP channels seen in the absence of Mg2+- and nucleotide-dependent stimulation by SUR1. This gain-of-function, spontaneous opening of KIR6.1-containing channels allowed determination of the ATP sensitivity of hybrid KIR in the absence of the magnesium nucleotides required to open KIR6.1/SUR channels. The IC50(ATP) values for hybrid channels were indistinguishable from the ∼10−5m value for KIR6.2-2-2-2/SUR14 channels. One interpretation of these results is consistent with the idea that KIR6.1 does not interact with inhibitory nucleotides (7Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1996; 494: 709-714Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in which case occupation of the cytoplasmic domain(s) of one KIR6.2 stabilizes the closed pore as strongly as occupation of four domains. However, this interpretation is in poor agreement with the differences in the ATP dose response observed for K ATPchannels with different numbers of KIR6.2 subunits with C-terminal mutations (our preliminary data 2A. P. Babenko, unpublished data. and the preliminary report of Li et al. (31Li L. Wang J. Drain P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (, (abstr.)): A77Google Scholar)). An alternative interpretation, that KIR6.1 has a low affinity inhibitory ATP binding site(s) similar to KIR6.2, is consistent with the fact that the C-terminal residues of KIR6.2 in which mutation produces the most dramatic increases in the IC50(ATP) forK ATP channels, i.e. the double mutant Arg50/Lys185 (24Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 255: 231-238Google Scholar), Ile182, and Gly334 (25Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) are conserved in KIR6.1. Moreover, the transient increases in K NDPchannel currents induced by rapid wash-out of MgATP in conventional patches with “fast” diffusion access (Fig. 1 Aa) provide semiquantitative evidence that the KIR6.1 tetramer is as sensitive to inhibitory ATP as the KIR6.2 tetramer assembled with the same SUR. We interpret this transient response as follows. During its application, millimolar MgATP binds to both SUR1 and KIR6.X. Nucleotide-bound SUR1 stimulates KIR6.1/SUR1 more efficiently than KIR6.2/SUR1 channels, thus better masking the inhibitory action of ATP on theK NDP channels (Fig. 1 Aa). Upon nucleotide removal, unbinding of nucleotide(s) from the low affinity inhibitory ATP site(s) on the KIR produces a quasi-sigmoidal rise in current, which can be resolved if nucleotide unbinding is not limited by its “desorption” (26Crank J. The Mathematics of Diffusion. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1975Google Scholar) (departure) from the cytoplasmic surface of the patch. This kinetic phenomenon can be resolved best in conventional “flat” patches by rapid solution exchange but not in “invaginated” macro-patches with solution exchange times of >10 ms. In parallel, but independently, a slower relaxation of the magnesium-nucleotide-activated KIR/SUR complex, due to nucleotide unbinding from SUR (upon or independently of ATP-hydrolysis), results in decay of channel activity. The observed <10−2 ratio of the mean NP o of K NDP channels at quasi-cytosolic [Mg-ATP] to the NP o during the transient peak after wash-out suggests a submillimolar IC50(ATP) for K NDP channels. If we assume there is a common mechanism coupling inhibitory ligand binding to closure of the M2 bundle, the postulated “inner gate” of KIR (15Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) based on the proposed function of this bundle in KcsA channels (18Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J.

Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), then the uniform IC50(ATP) hybrid channel values are a reflection of similar low affinity ATP binding loci in both KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 in which the K D for inhibitory ATP binding is decreased by SUR (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Validation of this hypothesis will require direct comparison of ATP binding to purified KIR6.1 and KIR6.2 in the presence ofversus absence of SUR and determination of ATP dose responses of KIR6.14-based channels. Combinations of KIR6.1 or KIR6.2 with SUR1,1 SUR2A, or SUR2B determine the classic subtypes of (KIR6.X/SUR)4channels (1Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The association of the KIR tetramer with four SURs masks endoplasmic reticulum retention signals on both subunits, permitting surface expression of tetradimericK ATP channels (2Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates the extracellular loops of KIR6.X specify an ∼2-fold difference in the unitary conductance, g, of KIR6.1 versusKIR6.2-based channels, whereas the KIRcytoplasmic domains determine the nucleotide and Mg2+requirements for channel opening (3Kondo C. Repunte V.P. Satoh E. Yamada M. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Pott L. Kurachi Y. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar, 4Takano M. Xie L.H. Otani H. Horie M. J. Physiol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). KIR6.1-based channels are closed in the absence of nucleotides, but are strongly activated by Mg2+-nucleotide-diphosphates (maximally by ∼10 mm MgUDP) and have been termedK NDP channels (6Beech D.J. Zhang H. Nakao K. Bolton T.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The substantial activity ofK NDP channels in millimolar MgATP suggested that KIR6.1, in contrast to KIR6.2, does not interact with inhibitory ATP (7Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1996; 494: 709-714Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Yamada M. Isomoto S. Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar), although the analysis of inhibition of these channels by ATP is complicated by a requirement for stimulatory Mg2+-nucleotides. UnlikeK NDP, KIR6.2-based channels burst continuously in nucleotide-free solutions, and homomeric KIR6.2 channels (9Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), lacking the RKR retention sequence, reach the surface in the absence of SUR exhibiting an open channel probability (P o) < 0.1 (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that is inhibited by low affinity Mg2+-independent ATP binding to an unidentified site(s) (9Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). SUR increases theP o of KIR6.2 channels in the absence of nucleotides and decreases the apparent K D for inhibitory ATP through separable interactions with the KIR(10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11587-11592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The activity of homomeric KIR6.1 channels has not been demonstrated, and SUR is apparently required to stimulate channel activity. The possible functional significance and even existence of hybrid (KIR6.1/KIR6.2)/SUR complexes is controversial. Although over-expression of KIR6.1 in Xenopusoocytes reduced surface expression of KIR6.2 lacking the RKR motif (2Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) indicating co-assembly, expression of a dominant negative KIR6.1 construct with KIR6.2 and SURs in A549 cells or in ventricular cardiomyocytes failed to provide evidence for heteromultimerization (12Seharaseyon J.

To determine the properties of hybrid channels, we generated KIR6.X-X-X-X concatemers that assemble functional channels with SUR1. Analysis of these channels shows their conductivity is specified both by the ratio of KIR6.1 to KIR6.2 and by the subunit order. Unexpectedly, inclusion of one KIR6.2 subunit was sufficient to produce spontaneous bursting in the absence of ATP, and all of the possible hybrid channels exhibited a uniform sensitivity to inhibitory ATP that was indistinguishable from KIR6.2-2-2-2-based channels. RESULTSCo-expression of the parental KIR6.1GGGS and KIR6.2GGGS constructs with SUR1 produced channels that were indistinguishable from native, and recombinantK NDP and K ATP channels in terms of their nucleotide responsiveness and an ∼2-fold difference in their g values (Fig.1 A).K NDP channels were active in cell-attached patches, and the transition to a nucleotide-free intracellular solution in the inside-out configuration resulted in a transient increase in their activity before they closed. TheseK NDP channels remained in an operational state and could be activated by MgUDP, known to be an effective stimulator but a poor inhibitor of KIR6.2/SUR1 channels (15Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which does not reactivate run-down channels like MgATP (16Furukawa T. Virag L. Furukawa N. Sawanobori T. Hiraoka M. J. Physiol. (Lond. ). 1994; 479: 95-107Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The rapid wash-out of ATP applied in the presence of Mg2+resulted in a transient increase in K NDP channel activity similar to that observed upon transition to the inside-out configuration. By contrast, the spontaneous steady-state activity of KIR6.2/SUR1 channels in an inside-out patch was dramatically reduced by sub-millimolar MgATP and inhibited by ATP in Mg2+-free internal solution with an IC50(ATP)of 6.1 ± 0.4 μm (n = 5, not shown). This value was indistinguishable from that of wild type β-cellK ATP channels determined under similar conditions (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J.

Co-expression of KIR6.2-2-2-2 with SUR1, but not the concatemer alone, generated spontaneously active channels, which were inhibited by ATP with an IC50(ATP)∼10−5m (Fig. 1 B), verifying that linking the pore forming subunits did not compromise inhibitory nucleotide binding.

Thus, RNA triphosphatase presents a remarkable case of complete divergence during the transition from fungal to metazoan species.The metazoan RNA triphosphatases are subdivided into two groups: (i) bifunctional enzymes composed of an N-terminal RNA triphosphatase domain and a C-terminal RNA guanylyltransferase domain (1Takagi T.

The bifunctional enzymes are ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes, where they are responsible for forming the 5′ cap structure of cellular mRNAs. The monofunctional enzymes perform RNA 5′ modification reactions uncoupled from or unrelated to cap formation, and their true role in RNA metabolism is not understood. The latter category includes BVP,1 a phosphatase encoded by the Autographa californica baculovirus (10Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takagi T.

Also in the latter category are the alternatively spliced forms of the cellular capping enzymes that retain the RNA triphosphatase domain but lack essential constituents of the guanylyltransferase active site (7Yamada-Okabe T.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins via a two-step pathway (21Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 22Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). First, a cysteine thiolate nucleophile of the enzyme attacks the phosphomonoester (R-O-PO3) to form a covalent protein-cysteinyl-S-phosphate intermediate and liberate R-OH (Fig. 1). Then, the covalent intermediate is hydrolyzed to liberate inorganic phosphate. The cysteine within the signature motif is the active site of phosphoryl transfer by protein phosphatases. The attack of cysteine on a phosphomonoester to form the phosphoenzyme is driven by two principal enzymic catalysts: (i) a conserved arginine in the phosphate-binding motif that makes a bidentate interaction with the nonbridging phosphate oxygens and thereby stabilizes the transition state, and (ii) a conserved aspartate, which is protonated in the ground state and acts as a general acid to expel the leaving group oxygen. The general acid is located within a flexible loop element that is distant from the active site pocket when the enzyme is in the unliganded state and moves into the active site upon binding of substrate or substrate analog (23Stuckey J.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), there is as yet no direct evidence for the formation of a phosphoenzyme during the RNA triphosphatase reaction.Here we probe the catalytic mechanism of the baculovirus RNA triphosphatase BVP. The 168-amino acid BVP protein displays extensive sequence similarity to the triphosphatase domains of metazoan and plant capping enzymes. The similarity embraces the cysteine-containing signature motif and a single conserved aspartic acid (Fig.1). Purified recombinant BVP hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of triphosphate-terminated poly(A) or the triphosphate-terminated trinucleotide pppApCpC (10Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takagi T. Hao L. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). BPV also hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and GTP to GDP (10Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remarkable feature of BVP is that it also catalyzes the hydrolysis of ADP to AMP and GDP to GMP (10Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7057-7063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the conversion of diphosphate-terminated RNA to monophosphate-terminated RNA (11Takagi T. Hao L. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, BVP is a triphosphataseand a diphosphatase. Kinetic analysis of the reaction of BVP with either triphosphate-terminated RNA or free nucleoside triphosphates shows that the γ phosphate is hydrolyzed prior to the β phosphate and that the enzyme acts distributively, i.e.that nucleoside monophosphate products do not begin to accumulate until the majority of the input nucleoside triphosphate has been first converted to nucleoside diphosphate. Human PIR1, like BVP, is also an RNA triphosphatase and diphosphatase (12Deshpande T. Takagi T. Hao L. Buratowski S. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16590-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, the metazoan capping enzymes hydrolyze only the γ phosphate of RNA. Thus, BVP and PIR1 comprise a functionally distinctive subfamily of cysteinyl phosphatases.We demonstrate here the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme adduct during the reaction of BVP with [γ-32P]ATP. Suboptimal reaction conditions, i.e. low temperature and mildly acidic pH, were required to detect the phosphoenzyme. The lability of the phosphoenzyme adduct to treatment with iodine was consistent with a cysteinyl-phosphate adduct. Alanine scanning mutational analysis of the signature phosphatase motif established essential roles for eight side chains in γ phosphate cleavage. Structure-activity relationships at the essential positions were then illuminated by conservative substitutions. A remarkable finding was that the conserved upstream aspartate was dispensable for the phosphohydrolase activity of BVP. Mechanistic implications of these results are discussed.DISCUSSIONHere we have initiated an analysis of the catalytic mechanism of BVP, which we regard as a prototype of the metazoan RNA triphosphatase enzyme family that includes the RNA triphosphatase component of the mRNA capping apparatus. We take advantage of the fact that BVP (unlike the metazoan capping enzymes) can use nucleoside triphosphates as substrates for γ phosphate cleavage. Thus, we could study BVP and mutated versions thereof using commercially available nucleoside triphosphates instead of triphosphate-terminated RNAs, which are tedious to prepare. The experiments presented here provide insights into BVP catalysis and reveal interesting mechanistic distinctions between the RNA triphosphatases and the protein phosphatase branches of the cysteinyl phosphatase superfamily.We demonstrate formation of a BVP phosphoenzyme and identify the linkage as a thiophosphate based on its chemical lability. Although we have not directly mapped the location of the phosphoamino acid, it is likely that the phosphate is linked to Cys119 because: (i) replacement of Cys119 by alanine or serine abrogates phosphoenzyme formation, (ii) of the five cysteines in BVP only Cys119 is conserved in all of the metazoan RNA triphosphatases, and (iii) there is definitive evidence that the equivalent cysteine in protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases acts as the reactive nucleophile (22Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,33Pannifer A.D.B. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10454-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The cysteine thiolate nucleophile is situated within the defining motif of the cysteine phosphatase superfamily HCXXGXXR(T/S)G. This motif comprises a phosphate-binding loop that facilitates catalysis by protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases in two ways. (i) The backbone amides of the loop interact with the cysteine side chain and stabilize it as the reactive thiolate in the ground state, and (ii) the backbone amides and the invariant arginine side chain interact with the phosphate oxygens to activate the bound substrate for nucleophilic attack and to stabilize the trigonal planar transition state. The replacement of the catalytic arginine in Yersiniaprotein-tyrosine phosphatase by alanine or lysine reducedk cat by nearly 4 orders of magnitude (34Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The failure of the conservative lysine substitution to appreciably restore catalytic power is interpreted as a stringent requirement for the bidentate interaction of two guanidinium nitrogens of this arginine with the equatorial phosphate oxygens in the transition state (22Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 33Pannifer A.D.B. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This model is in keeping with the 5000-fold decrement ink cat when the Arg residue of human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B was replaced by lysine (31Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). We find that Ala substitution of the BVP arginine reduced phosphohydrolase specific activity by at least 3 orders of magnitude, but, unlike the case of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases, the introduction of a lysine resulted in the recovery of at least 2 orders of magnitude of catalytic power to a level of 10% of wild-type activity. Clearly, the bidentate complex of arginine with the transition state is less critical for BVP catalysis than it is for protein-tyrosine phosphatase. It is possible that another side chain of BVP is in contact with the phosphate and compensates in the transition state for a ”second“ contact made by the catalytic arginine of protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Alternatively, it may simply be the case that BVP does not fully exploit the bidentate hydrogen-bonding capacity of arginine to accelerate phosphoryl transfer and therefore a monodentate contact of lysine suffices for 10% of the full activity.We find that the conserved histidine immediately preceding the cysteine nucleophile is essential for catalysis by BVP and that Asn did not function in lieu of His. Substitution of the equivalent histidine ofYersinia protein-tyrosine phosphatase by Asn and Ala reducedk cat by 2 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively (35Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Replacing the His side chain of human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B by alanine reducedk cat by 2 orders of magnitude (31Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The conserved histidine side chain participates in a hydrogen bonding network that serves to stabilize the cysteine thiolate of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (23Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Our mutational data are consistent with a similar essential function in BVP.Thr126 is essential for catalysis by BVP and is conserved as a threonine or serine on the protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases. The hydroxyl moiety of the side chain is necessary and sufficient for BVP function, insofar as activity is restored when serine in present. Replacing the Thr or Ser residues of protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases by alanine lowers k cat by at least 2 orders of magnitude (36Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 37Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E.

Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 13609-13617Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases reveal that the Oγ of serine or threonine donates a hydrogen bond to the active site cysteine, an interaction that may stabilize the cysteine thiolate leaving group during hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme. The hydrogen bond between Oγ and the Sγ of cysteine is visualized in the transition state and the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate (22Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10454-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported for protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases that elimination of Oγ selectively impedes the hydrolysis reaction of the cysteinyl-phosphate (36Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 37Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we did not detect formation of the covalent phosphoenzyme by the T126A mutant of BVP. Thus, the hydroxyl may play a relatively greater role the first step of BVP catalysis than it does in the case of protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases. BVP appears similar in its utilization of the catalytic threonine to the mammalian low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase, in which the equivalent serine is proposed to facilitate attack of the cysteine thiolate on the scissile phosphate (38Evans B. Tishmack P.A. Pokalsky C. Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 35: 13609-13617Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).A novel finding was that three other side chains within the conserved phosphate-binding motif of BVP (Thr120, His121, and Asn124) and one side chain immediately flanking the motif (Tyr128) are essential for phosphohydrolase activity. Structural studies have established that the backbone amide nitrogens of the phosphate-binding loop form hydrogen bonds to the phosphate oxygen atoms in the enzyme-substrate complex, the transition state and the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate (33Pannifer A.D.B. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10454-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but the roles of the side chains of the loop (other than those discussed above) have received little attention because they are not strictly conserved in the protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases. However, Thr120, His121, Asn124, and Tyr128 of BVP are tightly conserved in the other metazoan RNA triphosphatases (Fig. 1). We presume that these essential side chains either: (i) participate directly in substrate binding or catalysis (perhaps His121 or Asn124) or (ii) function indirectly by ensuring the proper conformation of the loop (Thr120 or Tyr128) in a manner that is specific to the RNA triphosphatase subfamily of cysteinyl phosphatases.A key finding of the present study was that the conserved aspartate of BVP is dispensable for phosphohydrolase activity and phosphoenzyme formation. This result is in stark contrast to the essential role of aspartate in catalysis by other cysteinyl phosphatases. For example, an alanine substitution of the conserved aspartic acid in human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B decreases k catby 5 orders of magnitude (31Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Replacing the aspartic acid by asparagine, which had no significant effect on BVP, reduced thek cat of Yersinia protein-tyrosine phosphatase by 3 orders of magnitude (30Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and slowed the activity of the human dual specificity protein phosphatase VHR by 2 orders of magnitude (22Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).A simple explanation for the benign effects of the D60A and D60N mutations of BVP is that the enzyme is cleaving a phosphoanhydride bond in which the pK a of ∼6.7 for the bridging oxygen of leaving group ADP is sufficiently low that it does not require facilitated expulsion by a proton donor. This is in contrast to the phosphomonoesterase reactions of protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases, where the serine leaving group has a pK a of 14 and the tyrosine leaving group has a pK a of 10. With protein-tyrosine phosphatases and dual specificity protein phosphatases, the leaving group pK a has little effect on catalysis because its expulsion is driven by proton donation from the aspartic acid (22Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26Fjeld C.C. Rice A. Kim Y. Gee K.R. Denu J.M. J.

However, when the Asp is replaced by Asn, thek cat of the mutant enzyme displays a significant dependence on leaving group pK a, with reactivity being enhanced when the pK a is low and impeded when pK a is high (22Denu J.M.

The implications of these findings for the structure of the α/β-type SASP·DNA complex and the physiology of α/β-type SASP degradation during spore germination are discussed. small acid-soluble spore protein(s) N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine base pair(s) of DNA Dormant spores of Bacillus and Clostridiumspecies are extremely resistant to a number of environmental insults compared with the corresponding vegetatively growing cells (1Marquis R.E. Sim J. Shin S.Y. Soc. Appl. Bacteriol. Sym. Ser. 1994; 76 (suppl.): 40S-48SGoogle Scholar, 2Gerhardt P. Marquis R.E. Smith I. Slepecky R.A. Setlow P. Regulation of Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 43-63Google Scholar, 3Setlow P. Soc. Appl. Bacteriol. Sym. Ser. 1994; (suppl.) 76: 49S-60SGoogle Scholar). A family of abundant spore proteins termed the α/β-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP)1 that saturates the dormant spore chromosome is primarily responsible for the resistance of spore DNA to lethal damage caused by heat, oxidizing agents, and UV radiation (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5Setlow B. Setlow P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3418-3423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Setlow B. Setlow P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2787-2790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Mason J.M. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 174-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, spores of Bacillus subtilis that lack the majority of their α/β-type SASP are much more sensitive to these treatments than are wild-type spores (4Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5Setlow B. Setlow P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3418-3423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mason J.M. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 174-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α/β-type SASP are small (6.2–7.6 kDa) nonspecific DNA-binding proteins that are synthesized only within the developing forespore compartment during sporulation (7Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of α/β-type SASP are highly conserved both within and between species (∼70% identity and ∼80% similarity, without gaps for Bacillus species); however, these proteins show no sequence similarity to any other protein family and do not contain any motifs characteristic of other DNA-binding proteins (7Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In all Bacillus species studied thus far, two major α/β-type SASP accumulate to high levels, whereas other minor α/β-type SASP are present at lower levels (7Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). During spore germination and outgrowth, α/β-type SASP are rapidly cleaved into two peptides by a sequence-specific endoprotease, the germination protease; and these oligopeptides are then degraded to amino acids by other spore peptidases (7Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that α/β-type SASP undergo a significant change in structure upon binding to DNA. First, α/β-type SASP are extremely sensitive to proteases, but become much more resistant to proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and germination protease when bound to DNA (9Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4149-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, α/β-type SASP are very susceptible to two forms of spontaneous covalent protein damage, asparagine residue deamidation and methionine residue oxidation (10Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hayes C.S. Illades-Aguiar B. Casillas-Martinez L. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the α/β-type SASP peptide backbone is flexible and accessible to solvent (12Wright H.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 13Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). However, the rates of asparagine residue deamidation and methionine residue oxidation in α/β-type SASP are substantially reduced when these proteins are bound to DNA (10Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hayes C.S. Illades-Aguiar B. Casillas-Martinez L. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased resistance to proteolysis, asparagine residue deamidation, and methionine residue oxidation is consistent with α/β-type SASP becoming structurally more compact upon binding to DNA. One established aspect of the structural change in α/β-type SASP is the oligomerization of these proteins upon binding to DNA. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies have demonstrated that α/β-type SASP are monomeric in solution (14Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, electron micrographs of α/β-type SASP·plasmid DNA complexes show clearly that these proteins bind in long clusters along the DNA backbone, indicating that DNA binding may be cooperative and that the cooperativity could be due to protein-protein interactions between adjacently bound α/β-type SASP (15Griffith J. Makhov A. Santiago-Lara L. Setlow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNase I protection studies also indicate that α/β-type SASP-DNA binding is cooperative (16Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-dependent protein-protein contacts between α/β-type SASP have been confirmed in other studies, and the interacting amino acid residues have been identified (17Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17326-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Clearly, there is considerable evidence that substantial conformational changes occur in α/β-type SASP upon binding to DNA. In this study, we report the use of CD spectroscopy to more directly detect and quantify these structural changes. Spectroscopic signals arising from these structural changes were used to obtain thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the α/β-type SASP-DNA interaction. The significance of these findings is discussed with respect to the role of α/β-type SASP in the mature spore and their degradation during spore germination and outgrowth. SspCTyr (L28Y variant of SspC from B. subtilis) (18Tovar-Rojo F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was overexpressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) (T7 RNA polymerase under the control of thelac promoter) (19Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) from the pET3d-derived plasmid pPS2896. The α/β-type SASP BceI from Bacillus cereus T (17Hayes C.S.

Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 168-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CbiC from Clostridium bifermentans (21Driks A. Setlow P. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L.J. Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 191-218Google Scholar) were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) from pET3-derived plasmids pPS2734 and pPS2315, respectively. SASP-A was purified from dormant spores of Bacillus megaterium strain QMB1551. SASP-α and SASP-β (22Cabrera-Martinez R.M. Mason J.M. Setlow B. Waites W.M. Setlow P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 52: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were purified from dormant spores ofC. bifermentans (a gift of W. M. Waites). E. coli strains were routinely grown in Terrific broth (24 g of yeast extract, 12 g of Tryptone, and 4 ml of glycerol per 900 ml plus 100 ml of 170 mm KH2PO4 and 720 mm K2HPO4) supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% glucose at 37 °C with shaking.E. coli strains containing plasmids pPS2734, pPS2315, and pPS2896 were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 2.5, and α/β-type SASP synthesis was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 2 h of further incubation, washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl, frozen, and lyophilized. B. megaterium was sporulated at 30 °C in supplemented nutrient broth, and spores were harvested, purified, and lyophilized as described previously (14Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8159-8167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized E. coli cells (100 mg at a time) were broken by dry rupture for 2 min in a dental amalgamator (Wig-L-Bug) with glass beads (150 mg) as the abrasive. Lyophilized B. megateriumspores (100 mg) were broken similarly, but by 8 min of dry rupture. All α/β-type SASP except SASP-A, SASP-α, and SASP-β were extracted twice with cold 3% acetic acid and 30 mm HCl from dry ruptured E. coli cells (10Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SASP-A, SASP-α, and SASP-β were extracted twice with 3% acetic acid from dry ruptured spores (14Setlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8168-8173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Cabrera-Martinez R.M. Mason J.M. Setlow B. Waites W.M. Setlow P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 52: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (20 min, 8000 × g), acid extracts (40–80 ml) were dialyzed in Spectrapor 3 tubing (molecular mass cutoff of 3500 Da) at 4 °C against 1% acetic acid (three changes of 4 liters), and the dialyzed extracts were passed over a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in 1% acetic acid. The flow-through was frozen and lyophilized, and the dry residue was dissolved in 8 m urea and 10 mm Tris maleate (pH 5.5). Dissolved protein was adsorbed to a CM-cellulose column pre-equilibrated in 10 mmTris maleate (pH 5.5) and eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris maleate (pH 5.5). Fractions containing pure α/β-type SASP were pooled, lyophilized, redissolved in distilled water, and dialyzed against 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.5). All proteins were >95% pure by Tris/Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All synthetic polynucleotides (poly(dG)·poly(dC), poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), poly(dG-dT)·poly(dA-dC), poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), and poly(dA)·poly(dT)) were obtained from Sigma. Plasmid DNA (pUC19) was purified by two rounds of CsCl equilibrium density centrifugation and linearized by digestion with EcoRI. All polynucleotides were dialyzed in Spectrapor 3 tubing at 4 °C against 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.5). Polynucleotides were quantitated (in base pairs) using the following molar extinction coefficients: poly(dG)·poly(dC) and poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), ε254 = 16.8 mm−1cm−1; poly(dG-dT)·poly(dA-dC) and pUC19, ε260 = 13.0 mm−1cm−1; and poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) and poly(dA)·poly(dT), ε262 = 13.2 mm−1 cm−1(24McAfee J.G. Edmondson S.P. Zegar I. Shriver J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and were dissolved at ∼1 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and annealed on ice for 30 min. Annealed oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gels in 90 mmTris borate and 2 mm EDTA. Oligonucleotide positions were identified by UV shadowing against an intensifying screen, and gel slices containing duplex oligonucleotides were removed with a clean razor blade. Oligonucleotides were eluted from gel slices into 50 mm ammonium acetate and 5 mm EDTA by gentle shaking at 4 °C for 15 h; eluted oligonucleotides were lyophilized; and the dry residue was dissolved in 50–100 μl of Milli-Q water and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 °C in a 1-kDa cutoff DispoBiodialyzer (Spectrapor). All purified oligonucleotides were >99% pure as judged by ethidium bromide staining of 20% polyacrylamide gels. Molar extinction coefficients for oligonucleotides of n base pairs were calculated as follows: for blunt end oligonucleotides, ε254 = n(16.8 mm−1cm−1), and for 3′-dA overhang-containing oligonucleotides of n base pairs, ε254 =n(16.8 mm−1cm−1) + 30.8 mm−1 cm−1(24McAfee J.G. Edmondson S.P. Zegar I. Shriver J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25). All CD experiments were conducted with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Far-UV spectra of α/β-type SASP, DNA, and α/β-type SASP/DNA mixtures were averages of three scans acquired at a rate of 20 nm/min, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 8 s, using a 1-mm path length cuvette. All equilibrium, kinetic, and thermal dissociation data were obtained with a 1.0-cm path length cuvette. Stoichiometric reverse titrations of SspCTyr and CbiC with poly(dG)·poly(dC) were conducted in 1.2 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 21 °C with stirring. Poly(dG)·poly(dC) was added sequentially, and the CD signals at 222 nm were measured for 3 min at 5-s intervals. The CD values at 222 nm for each titration point were averaged, and corrections were made for dilution and the contribution of DNA to the CD signals at 222 nm. Corrected CD values are expressed as mean residue ellipticity, [Θ]222. Secondary structure deconvolution was carried out using a web-based neural network algorithm, K2D (26Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding forward titrations to determine binding constants were carried out with 15–17 μm (in base pairs) DNA at 21 °C in 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) with 20, 40, or 80 mm NaCl or in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) without added NaCl. Each forward titration consisted of 15–20 separate solutions with increasing amounts of added α/β-type SASP, which were allowed to equilibrate for 15 h prior to CD measurements. The concentrations of all protein stock solutions were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The CD signal of each forward titration solution was measured at 222 nm for 3 min at 5-s intervals, and a spectrum from 300 to 250 nm was also obtained. The relative concentrations of DNA-bound and unbound SspCTyrwere calculated based on a two-state model of SspCTyr-DNA binding according to the following equation: [Θobs]222 = ƒb[Θb]222 + (1 − ƒb)[Θu]222, where [Θobs]222 is the observed mean residue ellipticity corrected for DNA and buffer contributions, ƒb is the fraction of DNA-bound protein, [Θb]222 is the mean residue ellipticity of DNA-bound SspCTyr (−18,400 degrees cm2dmol−1), and [Θu]222 is the mean residue ellipticity of unbound SspCTyr (−4000 degrees cm2dmol−1). Calculated proportions of DNA-bound and unbound SspCTyr were consistent with changes in the near-UV CD spectrum (300 to 250 nm) of the titrated polynucleotide. Therefore, fractional saturation of the titrated polynucleotide was determined from calculations of bound α/β-type SASP. McGhee-von Hippel binding densities (ν) were expressed as fractional DNA saturation divided by the site size of 4 bp as described (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and intrinsic binding constants (K) and cooperativity factors (ω) were determined by iterative nonlinear least-squares fitting of the McGhee-von Hippel model to experimental data. Forward titrations of poly(dG)·poly(dC), poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), and pUC19 with SspCTyr in 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 40 mm NaCl were performed twice each, from which an experimental error of approximately ±15% for Kω was estimated. CD-monitored thermal unfolding/dissociation experiments were performed on pre-equilibrated complexes of α/β-type SASP (5 μm) and DNA (25 μm in base pairs) in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) in a sealed cuvette with stirring. The heating rates were 25 and 50 °C/h, and the CD signal at 222 nm was measured at every 0.5 or 1 °C interval. The midpoint of each transition (defined as T m) was determined by taking the first derivative of ellipticity with respect to the inverse of the absolute temperature as described (28Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry: The Behavior of Biological Macromolecules , Part III. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1980Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments were performed by adding DNA to a stirring solution of α/β-type SASP and monitoring the CD signals at 222 nm as a function of time. This procedure entailed a dead time of ∼5 s, although no change in the CD signals at 222 nm (aside from the contribution from added DNA) was seen during the dead time. Initial rates of SspCTyr binding were determined by performing least-squares linear regression analysis on the linear portion of the curves. Rates were calculated using the same formula outlined above for equilibrium measurements. Binding rate constants (k b) were calculated according to the following binding reaction: Δ[SspCTyrb]/Δt =k b[SspCTyru]02[DNAu]0, where Δ[SspCTyrb]/Δt is the calculated initial SspCTyr-DNA binding rate in nanomolar bound SspCTyr per s, [SspCTyru]0 is the initial concentration of unbound SspCTyr, and [DNAu]0 is the initial concentration of unbound polynucleotide expressed as 8-bp binding sites (4 bp for each SspCTyr monomer). This model is useful for describing the initial binding reaction at low binding densities, but does not account for overlapping binding sites or potential anti-cooperativity at high α/β-type SASP binding densities (29Lohman T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 191-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Urbanke C. Schaper A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1744-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CD spectra of SspCTyr·oligonucleotide complexes were obtained from solutions containing 25 μm protein and 145 μm (in base pairs) oligonucleotide in 1.3 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 °C in a 1-mm path length cuvette. Each solution was allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C for at least 15 h prior to spectrum acquisition, and all spectra were the average of three scans. Several studies suggest that α/β-type SASP lack higher order structure in the absence of DNA, but become more compact upon binding to DNA (9Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4149-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hayes C.S. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hayes C.S. Illades-Aguiar B. Casillas-Martinez L. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies employed indirect methods and were therefore not able to determine which type or degree of structural changes occur in α/β-type SASP upon binding to DNA. To explore these issues more definitively, we have used CD spectroscopy to study the changes in α/β-type SASP secondary structure upon the binding of these proteins to DNA. As expected, the far-UV CD spectra of a number of α/β-type SASP from a variety of bacterial species (SspCTyr from B. subtilis, SASP-A from B. megaterium, BceI from B. cereus, and CbiC from C. bifermentans) were indicative of a largely random coil conformation in the absence of DNA (Fig.1 and data not shown) (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of α/β-type SASP are characterized by a large lobe of negative ellipticity at 200 nm and a less intense lobe of negative ellipticity at ∼225 nm (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The smaller lobe of negative ellipticity at ∼225 nm probably does not indicate nascent secondary structure, as the intensity of this band remained virtually unchanged at 90 °C (data not shown). The mean residue ellipticities ([Θ]) of SspC as a function of wavelength were identical at protein concentrations of 1–60 μm (data not shown), indicating that oligomerization does not occur over this concentration range. Based upon these data and preliminary NMR studies, 2C. S. Hayes, M. Maciejewski, G. P. Mullen, and P. Setlow, unpublished results. it appears that α/β-type SASP lack any significant amount of regular secondary or tertiary structure in the absence of DNA. However, in the presence of poly(dG)·poly(dC), a DNA that binds very tightly to α/β-type SASP (16Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the α/β-type SASP listed above acquired a significant amount of α-helical secondary structure (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Difference spectra in which the CD spectrum of free DNA is subtracted from the spectrum of the α/β-type SASP·DNA complex (32Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Patel L. Abate C. Curran T. Nature. 1990; 347: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) are characteristic of α-helical proteins, showing nearly equal lobes of negative ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm and a large lobe of positive ellipticity at 190 nm (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Ellipticity values (200–240 nm) from difference spectra were used to estimate the amount of secondary structure in DNA-bound α/β-type SASP; these values ranged from 56 to 69% α-helix, 4 to 8% β-sheet, and 27 to 35% random structure for the four α/β-type SASP studied. These calculations assume that only minor changes occur in the DNA component of the CD spectra compared with the changes that occur in the protein component (32Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 34Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the large changes in the CD spectra of α/β-type SASP upon addition of poly(dG)·poly(dC) are due to α/β-type SASP binding to DNA. To confirm this, the interactions between several α/β-type SASP and poly(dA)·poly(dT) were examined by CD spectroscopy. DNase I protection studies have shown that α/β-type SASP do not bind or bind extremely weakly to poly(dA)·poly(dT) (16Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous findings, the difference spectra of α/β-type SASP/poly(dA)·poly(dT) mixtures showed only minor differences when compared with the spectra of α/β-type SASP in the absence of DNA (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). These data support the conclusion that the changes in ellipticity upon mixing α/β-type SASP and poly(dG)·poly(dC) are due to α/β-type SASP-DNA binding, and not some other effect arising from the polyelectrolyte nature of nucleic acids. In addition, no CD spectral changes were seen in SspCTyr (25 μm) mixed with 145 μm (in base pairs or bases) single-stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, or double-stranded RNA (data not shown), consistent with previous results showing no interaction between α/β-type SASP and these nucleic acids (16Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the interaction between α/β-type SASP and DNA has been studied previously (16Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nicholson W.L. Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little quantitative data relating to the binding constants of these proteins for DNA have been obtained. Thermodynamic parameters for nonspecific protein-nucleic acid interactions are commonly determined by fluorescence quenching in which intrinsic tryptophan residue fluorescence is quenched as the protein binds to a nucleic acid (24McAfee J.G. Edmondson S.P. Zegar I. Shriver J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4034-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,27Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, α/β-type SASP lack tryptophan residues (7Setlow P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Driks A. Setlow P. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L.J. Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 191-218Google Scholar), and attempts to introduce tryptophan residues into α/β-type SASP have resulted in proteins that either have significantly reduced affinity for DNA (36Sanchez-Salas J.L. Sharon M. Setlow P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) or exhibit no change in fluorescence upon binding to DNA. 3C. S. Hayes, M. A. Ross, and P. Setlow, unpublished results. Therefore, we sought to exploit the large change in mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([Θ]222) as α/β-type SASP bind to DNA to extract thermodynamic parameters for the binding interaction between these two molecules. SspCTyr was used for most of the following experiments because it is the α/β-type SASP that has been characterizedin vitro and in vivo most extensively (16Setlow B. Sun D. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2312-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tovar-Rojo F. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Nicholson W.L. Setlow B. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6900-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial equilibrium titrations were performed as reverse titrations in which progressively more DNA was added to a constant amount of SspCTyr. Reverse titrations of SspCTyr with all polynucleotides displayed isodichroic points at ∼204.5 nm (Fig. 2 and data not shown), suggesting (although not proving) that SspCTyr-DNA binding can be described by a simple two-state model (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). An isodichroic point at this wavelength is also characteristic of random coil to α-helix peptide transitions (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Reverse titrations of SspCTyr with poly(dG)·poly(dC) under tight-binding (stoichiometric) conditions were undertaken to determine the SspCTyr-binding site size in base pairs and the [Θ]222 value for SspCTyr bound to DNA (Fig. 3). Knowledge of the site size and the [Θ]222 values for SspCTyr bound ([Θb]222) and not bound ([Θu]222) to DNA allows calculation of the concentrations of bound and unbound protein in forward titrations under non-stoichiometric conditions. Reverse titrations of SspCTyr (at 5 and 10 μm) with poly(dG)·poly(dC) displayed sharp break points at DNA concentrations corresponding to a site size of ∼4 bp (Fig. 3). The same 4-bp site size was determined by a forward titration of poly(dG)·poly(dC) with SspCTyr in which CD signals from both SspCTyrand poly(dG)·poly(dC) were monitored (data not shown). Forward and reverse titrations also gave the same corrected [Θ]222value of approximately −18,400 degrees cm2dmol−1 for SspCTyr bound"
https://openalex.org/W2003294736,"Oncoprotein 18 (Op18) is a microtubule regulator that forms a ternary complex with two tubulin heterodimers. Dispersed regions of Op18 are involved in two-site cooperative binding and subsequent modulation of tubulin GTPase activity. Here we have analyzed specific determinants of Op18 that govern both stoichiometry and positive cooperativity in tubulin binding and consequent stimulatory and inhibitory effects on tubulin GTPase activity. The data revealed that the central and C-terminal regions of Op18 contain overlapping binding-motifs contacting both tubulin heterodimers, suggesting that these regions of Op18 are wedged into the previously noted 1-nm gap between the two longitudinally arranged tubulin heterodimers. Both the N- and C-terminal flanks adjacent to the central region are involved in stabilizing the ternary complex, but only the C-terminal flank does so by imposing positive binding cooperativity. Within the C-terminal flank, deletion of a 7-amino acid region attenuated positive binding cooperativity and resulted in a switch from stimulation to inhibition of tubulin GTP hydrolysis. This switch can be explained by attenuated binding cooperativity, because Op18 under these conditions may block longitudinal contact surfaces of single tubulins with consequent interference of tubulin-tubulin interaction-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Together, our results suggest that Op18 links two tubulin heterodimers via longitudinal contact surfaces to form a ternary GTPase productive complex.

Op18 (also termed oncoprotein 18 or stathmin) is a cytosolic protein, which acts to destabilize the MT network. The activity of Op18 is turned off by phosphorylation at four Ser residues in response to multiple signal-transducing protein kinase systems during interphase and cell cycle-regulated protein kinases during mitosis (for review, see Ref. 1Lawler S. Current Biology. 1998; 8: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prevention of phosphorylation-inactivation by mutations of kinase target sites of Op18 results in destabilization of the mitotic spindle and a consequent block in cell division (2Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 3Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which argues against an active role of Op18 during mitosis. Rather, regulated phosphorylation inactivation of Op18 in response to receptor-stimulated kinase systems suggests that the primary role of Op18 is to modulate the MT system in response to external signals during the interphase of the cell cycle (4Gradin H.M. Marklund U. Larsson N. Chatila T.A. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 5Gradin H.M. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MTs are continuously rearranging, and most individual MTs are either growing or shrinking with transitions between the two states, a phenomena termed dynamic instability (for review, see Ref. 6Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). The β-tubulin subunit of the heterodimer contains an exchangeable GTP site (E-site), and MTs utilize polymerization-induced GTP hydrolysis to generate dynamic instability. The tip of a polymerizing MT is thought to contain a stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin, the loss of which results in depolymerization, i.e. a catastrophe. Two families of MT destabilizing proteins, represented by XKCM1 and Op18, have been shown to promote MT catastrophes (7Walczak C.E. Mitchison T.J. Desai A. Cell. 1996; 84: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 8Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E.

Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). XKCM1 acts by physically disrupting the GTP-tubulin cap in an ATP-dependent cycle, but the mechanism by which Op18 promotes catastrophes is still undefined. However, based on the findings of (i) MT plus-end specificity of Op18 catastrophe promotion, (ii) blocking of catastrophe promotion by capping of MTs ends with a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (10Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and (iii) the ability of Op18 to stimulate GTPase activity of Op18-tubulin complexes (11Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A prevalent view is that Op18 may promote catastrophes by stimulating GTP hydrolysis at the plus-end of MTs (for review, see Refs. 12Walczak C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Andersen S.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Op18 forms a ternary complex with two tubulins and this has been thought to be critical for the mechanism by which Op18 destabilizes MTs (9Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 14Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two recent reports have given important insights into the structure of the tubulin-Op18 complex. First, digital image analysis of electron micrographs showed that Op18 links two longitudinally arranged but slightly separated tubulin heterodimers in a protofilament-like fashion (15Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Second, mass spectroscopy analysis of chemically cross-linked Op18-tubulin peptides identified contact points between both the central and C-terminal part of Op18 and helix 10 on 32 α-tubulin, a helix located at the surface where longitudinal contacts are made in MTs (16Wallon G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In both reports it was proposed that Op18 is an extended α-helical protein with separated binding regions for each heterodimer; one in the N-terminal/central part and one in the C-terminal part of the protein. However, two mutually exclusive models of Op18 linkage of the two heterodimers were proposed. Thus, whereas Steinmetz et al. (15Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) proposed that Op18 linked the two longitudinally arranged heterodimers by extended binding along lateral surfaces, Wallon et al. (16Wallon G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) proposed that each one of two distinct tubulin binding regions of Op18 binds one α-tubulin of the heterodimers via longitudinal contact surfaces, thereby linking the two tubulin heterodimers in a “head-to-head” fashion. To understand the mechanisms by which Op18 destabilizes MTs, it is important to test these two models and to elucidate how Op18-tubulin complex formation stimulates GTP hydrolysis. Here we present evidence that essential contact points for each one of the two tubulin heterodimers in the ternary complex are overlapping within the central region of Op18, and that these contact points are in the vicinity of longitudinally interacting surfaces of tubulin. Our data suggest a third model for Op18-tubulin interactions where Op18 lies between the two longitudinally arranged heterodimers. This model is consistent with the experimental evidence from the two reports discussed above and resolves the mutual incompatibility between the two previously proposed models. Moreover, taken together with previous studies, we present evidence that clearly dissociate stimulation of GTPase activity, which occurs autonomously within the ternary Op18-tubulin complex, from the catastrophe-promoting activity of Op18, which is likely to involve interactions with tubulin surfaces exposed at the MT tip. Construction of C-terminal-truncated Op18 derivatives with sequences encoding amino acids 100–147 deleted (Op18-Δ(100–147)) and 90–147 deleted (Op18-Δ(90–147)) have previously been described (11Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Marklund U. Osterman O. Melander H. Bergh A. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30626-30635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Op18-Δ(139–147), Op18-Δ(130–147), Op18-Δ(116–147), and Op18-Δ(80–147) were constructed using an analogous PCR-based strategy and the unique primers: Δ(139–147), 5′-CCGCGGGCCTAGTCGGCTTCTTTGTTCTTCCGC-3′; Δ(130–147), 5′-CCGCGGGCCTAGTCGGCGTGCTTATCCTTCTCTCG-3′; Δ(116–147), 5′-CCGCGGGCCTAGTCGGCTTGTGCCTCTCGGTTCTC-3′; and Δ(80–147), 5′-CCGCGGGCCTAGTCGGC-3′. Each primer contains a silent bglI/SfiI site at the 5′-end and was used in conjunction with the T7 primer from pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Full-length Op18 cDNA carried on pBluescript was used as template to amplify PCR fragments corresponding to each of the truncated derivatives. The PCR products were then used to replace theHindIII-SfiI fragment of Op18 cDNA with a silent SfiI site introduced at a position overlapping the stop codon after Asp-149 of Op18 (17Marklund U. Osterman O. Melander H. Bergh A. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30626-30635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct stepwise C-terminal deletions starting from amino acid residues 116 to 130 of Op18, a SfiI site was introduced in Op18 at a position overlapping the Met-116 codon. This derivative, termed Op18-(SfiI116), was constructed by overlap-PCR using the primers 5′-GCCCAAGCGGCCGCCAAAGCGGAACGTGCTCGCGAGAAGG-3′and 5′-TTCCGCTTTGGCGGCCGCTTGGGCCTCGCGATTCTCTTTA-3′, together with the T7 and T3 primers of pBluescript. Op18-Δ(119–147), Op18-Δ(123–147), and Op18-Δ(127–147) were constructed by extending Op18-(SfiI116) from theSfiI site with annealed oligonucleotides encoding C-terminal amino acids followed by two consecutive stop codons: Δ(119–147), 5′-CGGCTGCCGCCGACTAATAGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTATTAGTCGGCGGCAGCCGCTT-3′; Δ(123–147), 5′-CGGCTGCCAAACTGGAACGTGCCGACTAATAGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTATTAGTCGGCACGTTCCAGTTTGGCAGCCGCTT-3′; Δ(127–147), 5′-CGGCTGCCAAACTGGAACGTTTGCGAGAGAAGGCCGACTAATAGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTATTAGTCGGCCTTCTCTCGCAAACGTTCCAGTTAGGCAGCCGCTT-3′. Coding regions of C-terminal-truncated Op18 derivatives were excised asNcoI to NotI fragments and used to replaced the corresponding fragment of Op18 cDNA in pGEX 4T-1 (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Construction of the N-terminal-truncated derivatives Op18-Δ(4–45) and Op18-Δ(5–55) have previously been described (10Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It should be noted that Op18-Δ(4–45) was termed Op18-Δ(5–46) in its original description, but these derivatives are identical because both residues 4 and 46 are serines. Op18-Δ(4–62) and Op18-Δ(5–72) were constructed by PCR using the primers Δ(4–62), 5′-TCCCGAGCTCACATGAAGCTGAGGTCTTG-3′ and Δ(5–72), 5′-TCCCGAGCTCAGCTGAGAAACGAGAGCACG-3′ with the T3 primer from pBluescript SK(+) as second primer and FLAG epitope-tagged Op18 as template (17Marklund U. Osterman O. Melander H. Bergh A. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30626-30635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primers introduce a silent SacI site in the 5′-end. The PCR fragments were excised as SacI toBamHI fragments and inserted into the corresponding sites of pET3d Op18-Δ(5–149) (10Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of PCR-generated fragments were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis using ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit from PE Biosystems. GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FLAG-tagged Op18 derivatives were expressed and purified as described previously (19Marklund U. Brattsand G. Shingler V. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15039-15047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant proteins were routinely analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm purity and to confirm that each truncated Op18 derivative migrated corresponding to the predicted molecular weight. Analysis of tubulin GTPase activity was performed in PEM buffer adjusted to pH 6.5 with KOH (80 mmpiperazine-N,N′-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid], 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm Mg2+) containing 5 mm AMP-PNP, to inhibit nonspecific ATPase activity as described (11Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, tubulin was incubated with [α-32P]GTP, tubulin-[α-32P]GTP complexes recovered by centrifugation through a desalting column (P-30 Micro Bio-Spin, Bio-Rad) and single-turnover GTP hydrolysis was followed at 37 °C. Control experiments showed that the Op18 preparations used neither bound nor hydrolyzed [α-32P]GTP. Nucleotide hydrolysis was quantitated by ascending chromatography as described (20Austin S. Dixon R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Op18-tubulin equilibrium binding experiments were in principle performed as previously reported (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but with modifications to increase detection of low-affinity binding. In brief, N-terminal GST-tagged or C-terminal FLAG-tagged Op18 derivatives (2 μm) and tubulin (0.8–42 μm) were mixed and allowed to associate for 15 min on ice. Op18-tubulin mixes (48 μl) were added to glutathione or anti-FLAG antibody coupled-Sepharose beads (12 μl) and incubated for 15 min at 8 °C to capture Op18-tubulin complexes. Rapid separation of Op18-tubulin complexes bound to glutathione or anti-FLAG antibody-coupled beads was obtained by applying the bead suspension into the caps of 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes prepared with a bottom layer of 150 μl of PEM complemented with 27% sucrose, 17% glycerol, pH 6.0 and a top layer of 100 μl of PEM with 17% glycerol, pH 6.0. Samples were centrifuged shortly (30 s, 21,000 × g) to separate bead-bound from -free material. The buffers, volumes, and centrifugation steps described above allowed increased detection of low-affinity binding between truncated Op18 and tubulin as compared with our previous protocol (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To allow simultaneous quantification of Op18 and tubulin in the same sample, tubulin was labeled with [α-32P]GTP and Op18 was labeled with 125I. There are two major benefits to this strategy. First, the amount of GST·Op18/Op18·F present in the fraction of free tubulin after separation from the beads (about 30% of total Op18) can be compensated for in each data point, and second, only biologically active (i.e. GTP-bound) tubulin was detected in the fraction of free tubulin. The contribution of nonspecific tubulin binding was around 5% of the amount of free tubulin and was subtracted from the data presented. To calculate Op18-tubulin binding parameters, data points from equilibrium binding experiments were fitted either to a one affinity binding model (hyperbola) or to a previously described model assuming two-site positive cooperativity in binding (21Koshland Jr D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Written in the form of a binding curve, a two-site positive cooperativity model has the form,B=Bmax2×11+2FKd­1+F2Kd­1×Kd­2×2FKd­11+FKd­2Equation 1 where K d-1 and K d-2 are the equilibrium dissociation constants for Op18 binding of the first and second tubulin heterodimer respectively, B is the Op18-tubulin molar ratio of complex-bound proteins, and F is the free tubulin concentration. Comparison of fits was performed using the F-test provided by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). To validate the ratio of tubulin bound to Op18, samples were separated by 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and scanning of protein bands using a personal densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This procedure and previous work by others (14Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) has established that the molar ratio of tubulin-wild-type Op18 complexes is 2:1 (i.e. B max = 2). This ratio is not altered by introduction of GST- or FLAG-epitope tags (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the specific activity of [α-32P]GTP-labeled tubulin could be corrected within each experiment by assuming aB max value of 2.0 tubulin per GST·Op18-wt or Op18-wt·F. This correction increased the confidence by which the specific tubulin-Op18 stoichiometry in complexes of low-affinity binding truncated Op18 derivatives could be determined. Recent visualization of the ternary tubulin2-Op18 complex by electron microscopy shows that the two heterodimers are arranged longitudinally, similar to that of a protofilament (15Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The images did not reveal how Op18 connected the two heterodimers; however, there appeared to be a 1-nm gap between the heterodimers, which corresponds to the approximate diameter of an α-helix. To determine whether Op18 links two tubulin heterodimers by independent or overlapping binding regions, we determined the stoichiometry of tubulin binding after consecutive truncations of Op18 from either the N or the C terminus. To facilitate quantitation of binding stoichiometry of truncated Op18 derivatives with impaired tubulin affinity, binding conditions were set to maximize affinity and to minimize dissociation during separation of bound complexes (see “Materials and Methods”). The truncation mutants generated for this purpose are outlined in Fig. 1 together with a secondary structure representation of Op18 according to Wallonet al. (16Wallon G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To avoid the fact that N- and C-terminal truncations indirectly obstruct binding by altering the position of the affinity tag used for separation of Op18-tubulin complexes, either the N-terminal GST-tag or the C-terminal FLAG-tag was introduced at opposite ends relative to truncations (see Fig. 1). Tubulin binding affinity and stoichiometry of full-length Op18 (Op18-wt) fused to either of these two affinity tags were essentially the same (Fig.2, insets in B andD). In agreement with our previous study (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Scatchard conversion of binding data showed that tubulin binding to Op18-wt is a complex process with nonlinear data-point distribution typical for positive cooperativity in binding. Analysis of C-terminal-truncated Op18 revealed that truncation up to residue 90 still allowed tubulin binding, albeit with poor affinity. Importantly, Scatchard analysis of binding data indicated that both Op18-Δ(90–147) and Op18-Δ(100–147) are still capable of binding two tubulin heterodimers, but the data-point distributions suggest non-cooperative binding (see Fig. 2 figure legend for B maxvalues). However, if C-terminal truncations extend into helix 1 (see Op18-Δ(80–147)), the binding affinity is too low for interpretable binding data. We conclude that all C-terminal-truncated Op18 derivatives that bind tubulin with estimable affinities are capable of binding two heterodimers.Figure 4The cooperativity imposing region of Op18 determines the switch from tubulin GTPase stimulatory to inhibitory activity.

When applicable, the maximum specific tubulin-Op18 stoichiometry was determined by fitting the data points either to a one affinity or to a two-site positive cooperativity model, depending on which equation provided the best fit according to the F-test. The calculated maximal stoichiometry for each Op18 truncation was: GST·Op18-wt, 2.0 ± 0.1; GST·Op18-Δ(100–147), 2.2 ± 0.1; GST·Op18-Δ(90–147), 2.3 ± 0.4; Op18-wt·F, 2.0 ± 0.1; Op18-Δ(4–45)·F, 1.8 ± 0.1; Op18-Δ(5–55)·F, 2.6 ± 0.3. Straight lines in the Scatchard plots imply best fit to a one affinity model and curved lines imply best fit to a two-site positive cooperativity model. As outlined under “Materials and Methods,” the specific activity of [α-32P]GTP-labeled tubulin was routinely corrected to give a binding stoichiometry of 2:1 for tubulin and wild-type derivatives of Op18.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The corresponding deletion analysis from the N terminus reveals that removal of more than 45 amino acids resulted in a major loss of tubulin binding affinity (compare Op18-Δ(4–45) and Op18-Δ(5–55) in Fig.2, C and D). However, the Op18-Δ(5–55) mutant, which has 10 amino acids of helix 1 deleted, was still capable of binding two tubulin heterodimers. Upon removal of an additional 7 or 17 amino acids from the N terminus, binding affinities became too low for interpretable binding data. Scatchard conversion of Op18-Δ(4–45) binding data revealed data-point distribution typical for positive cooperativity in binding, indicating that the N terminus is not important for the observed cooperativity in tubulin binding (Fig.2 D). The data above show that N- or C-terminal truncations that extend into helix 1 cause the most drastic drops in tubulin binding affinity. However, as shown in Fig. 2 C, helix 1 is clearly a very poor tubulin binder by itself as revealed by analysis of Op18-Δ(4–45), Δ(100–147)-F (termed H1-F). It seems unlikely that this result was biased by the use of the C-terminal FLAG-tag for separation of complexes, because the FLAG-tag can be efficiently used for separation of tubulin-Op18-Δ(100–147)·F complexes (data not shown and Ref.18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, our result is in line with a recent report demonstrating that truncation of both the N- and C-terminal flanks of Op18 abolishes tubulin binding as determined by size exclusion chromatography (23Redeker V. Lachkar S. Siavoshian S. Charbaut E. Rossier J. Sobel A. Curmi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6841-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together, because N- and C-terminal- truncated Op18 either bound two heterodimers of tubulin or was incapable of binding tubulin with an estimable affinity, the data demonstrate that essential parts of both tubulin binding sites of Op18 are overlapping within the central α-helical part of Op18. Given overlapping binding sites and the previously noted 1-nm gap between longitudinally arranged tubulin heterodimers in complex with Op18 (15Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the simplest interpretation of binding data is that at least helix 1 of Op18 is inserted between the heterodimers. We have recently shown that Op18 binds tubulin according to a two-site positive cooperative model, i.e. Op18 binding to the first tubulin creates a second tubulin binding site of much higher affinity (18Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The binding data above show that both the N- and C-terminal regions flanking helix 1 are important for stabilization of the ternary Op18-tubulin complex. Interestingly, whereas derivatives with N-terminal truncations retained positive cooperativity, C-terminal truncations appear to bind tubulin without appreciable cooperativity. It was therefore of interest to search for a specific region within the C terminus that may impose positive cooperativity. To determine positive cooperativity in a series of successive C-terminal truncation derivatives of Op18, we excluded glycerol from the binding buffer. This results in lower tubulin binding affinities as compared with the data shown in Fig. 2, but two-site positive co"

Deletion analysis indicated the glucose responsiveness was distributed across the region from −340 to −260 in promoter B.

There are numerous reports that the activity of the enzyme is decreased in the pancreatic islet, but not in other tissues, of genetic models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) (6Ostenson C.-G.

Sener A. Gomis R. Malaisse W.J. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, this decrease appears to be an acquired characteristic because it is present in experimentally induced models of NIDDM (7Giroix M-H. Rasschaert J. Bailbe D. Leclercq-Meyer V. Sener A.

In view of the various conditions that possibly influence the level of mGPD synthesis at the transcriptional or translational level, we cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the human mGPD gene to begin to better understand the transcriptional regulation of mGPD expression. The results indicate that the human mGPD gene possesses two promoters and that the downstream promoter is more active in beta cells than in non-beta cells. The downstream promoter is 10-fold more active than the upstream promoter in transient expression assays. Deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and gel shift assays identified at least two known cis-acting regulatory elements in the downstream promoter. In the present work we show that the mGPD enzyme activity and mGPD promoter activity is lowered in INS-1 cells by long term exposure to a high concentration of glucose. Activities of other enzymes studied as controls were not lowered. However, the mGPD promoter activity is lower in beta cells (INS-1 cells) but is not lower in non-beta cells, such as human HepG2 hepatoma cells and HeLa cells, after long term exposure to a high concentration of glucose. The results of the current study suggest that transcription of the mGPD gene in the beta cell differs from other cells and that the negative transcriptional response to high glucose at least in part explains the low level of mGPD in hyperglycemic states. INS-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm pyruvic acid, and 10 mm HEPES. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HepG2 cells were grown in minimum essential Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. H4-II-E cells were cultured in minimum essential Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10% calf serum, and 10% fetal calf serum. All media contained 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The 5′-end of the human mGPD cDNA was extended and amplified using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) according to the protocol provided (Life Technologies, Inc.). A mGPD gene-specific antisense primer 5′-GGTTGGCACGCTCATAGG-3′ (bases 593 to 575 in exon 3) was used for reverse transcription of HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the dC-tailed cDNA was carried out using the Abridged Anchor Primer (sense) provided by Life Technologies, Inc. and a nested antisense primer 5′-TCCCTGTTAACTCGTTCTGAAAT-3′ (bases 270 to 249 in exon 2 of the mGPD cDNA). The amplified products were subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced. A 3.4-kb fragment of exon 1A 5′-flanking sequence and a 1.3-kb fragment of exon 1B 5′-flanking sequence from genomic clones were cloned into the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) (Fig. 1 A). Progressive deletions from the 5′ end of the 3.4-kb or 1.3-kb DNA fragment were prepared by cutting at restriction sites or by digestion with exonuclease III. In the mGPD-400 to -160B, a 3′-end deletion construct was made by removing a StuI-SmaI fragment from the mGPD-400 construct that contains a 400-bp fragment of the 5′-flanking region of exon 1B (Fig. 1 A). The Altered Sitein vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega) was used to prepare the 25-bp and 9-bp internal deletion constructs as well as point mutations in the mGPD promoter B region. Each mutant was verified by DNA sequencing and subcloned into the pGL3 Basic vector. Some constructs in Fig. 6 C and D were made by Noaman Hasan.Figure 1A, structure of the 5′-flanking region of the human mGPD gene. The exons 1A and 1B are identified by shaded boxes (ex1A, ex1B).

A series of constructs containing 9-nucleotide internal deletions spanning −76 to −100 and −201 to −225 were prepared from the 400B construct and transfected into INS-1 or HeLa cells, and their luciferase activities were assayed. Results are the mean ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) INS-1, HeLa, H4-II-E, or HepG2 cells were seeded in 35-mm plates, and 20 h later 70% confluent cells were transfected with 10 μg of LipofectAMINE complexed with 1 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of the β-galactosidase reference plasmid (pBlue-CMV-β-galactosidase). The cells were exposed to lipid-DNA complexes for 5 h and cultured in growth medium for a further 42 h. Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase kit (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured with a β-galactosidase kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). β-Galactosidase activity was used to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between plates. Luciferase activity presented in each figure is the mean of two or three independent experiments, with each condition done in triplicate. To study the effect of chronically elevated glucose levels on promoter activity, the cells were cultured in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose for 4 days before transfection. Glucose concentrations were maintained through the 3-day transfection procedure. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells and INS-1 cells for mobility shift DNA-binding protein assays (16Wen L.-P. Koeiman N. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 30-mer wild type oligonucleotide 5′-AGCGGGAGGAGGAAGTCGGGAAGAGGGAAG-3′, which corresponds to the sequence from −110 to −81 in promoter B, and five oligonucleotides with single point mutations (G-100T, A-98C, G-96T, A-90C, and G-88T), which are indicated by bold letters in the wild type sequence, were synthesized. After end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase, the probe was annealed with an unlabeled complementary strand. Fifteen micrograms of crude nuclear extract was preincubated with poly(dI·dC) for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer (8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.8 mmEDTA, and 4% glycerol), and then 300 fmol of 32P end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was added. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel in electrophoresis buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA). The shifted DNA bands were visualized by autoradiography. Competition analyses were performed by mixing 32P end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe with 20- or 100-fold molar excess mutated double-stranded oligo before adding to nuclear extracts in binding buffer. INS-1 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes in medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose for 4 or 7 days. Then the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 400 μl of potassium-HEPES buffer (5 mm, pH 7.5) containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme activities were assayed under V max conditions by standard methods, as described previously (2MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18MacDonald M.J. Keysen J.H. Moran S.M. Pomije C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22392-22397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of all enzymes except mGPD was estimated in cytosol (20,000 ×g × 10 min supernatant fraction) in continuous spectrophotometric assays at 37 °C. mGPD activity was estimated in homogenates of whole cells in a timed and stopped assay as described previously (2MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8287-8290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first exon (exon 1B) of human HeLa cell cDNA reported by our laboratory (19Lehn D.A. Brown L.J. Simonson G.D. Moran S.M. MacDonald M.J. Gene. 1994; 150: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Brown L.J. Stoffel M. Moran S.M. Fernald A.A. Lehn D.A. LeBeau M.M. MacDonald M.J. Gene. 1996; 172: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) differs from an expressed sequence tag (EST clone R15742) from human brain that contains 358 nucleotides in front of exon 2 of the mGPD gene. This suggests alternative splicing of the first exon and the possibility of more than one promoter in the mGPD gene. To understand the origin of these heterogeneous mRNAs and to begin to study the regulation of the mGPD gene at the transcriptional level, the 5′-flanking region of the human mGPD gene was cloned, and its sequence was analyzed. Two first exons that we have named exon 1A and exon 1B were identified. The 1A region is located 605 nucleotides 5′ of the 1B region (Fig. 1 A). Sequencing of the 5′-flanking regions containing the two putative mGPD promoters indicated that promoter A (5′ flanking region of exon 1A) contains sequences homologous to human repetitive elements. Promoter B (5′-flanking region of exon 1B) is GC-rich and contains no TATA box but has several putative binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp1, AP1, AP2, E2F, and NRF-2, the human homologue of mouse GA-binding protein (GABP) (Fig. 1 B). We obtained information about the 5′ end of human mGPD cDNAs by analyzing clones we had isolated from a cDNA library and from the published sequence of EST clones R15742, T23788, and Z38279. Attempts at determining the transcriptional start sites of the mGPD gene by the primer extension method and RNase protection assay were not successful because of the low abundance of mGPD mRNAs. Therefore, we used 5′ RACE to determine the transcriptional start sites of the two transcripts. HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA was used as the template. Eighteen clones of various lengths were characterized. Seven of them contained sequences from exon 1A, and 11 of them contained sequences from exon 1B. Three transcriptional start sites were detected for exon 1A and four for 1B (Fig. 1 B). The longest clones containing the sequence from exon 1A correspond to the last 159 nucleotides of 358 bp of exon 1A of the EST clone R15742 from human brain. The difference in length between the transcripts from HeLa cells and the EST, which was from brain, may be due to a failure of reverse transcriptase to read through regions of secondary structure in the RNA due to its high G/C content, or this difference in length could be due to differences in transcription start sites between the two tissues. The 5′ end from four other clones containing the sequence of 1B corresponds to position of +1 of the previously published cDNA sequence by our laboratory (20Brown L.J. Stoffel M. Moran S.M. Fernald A.A. Lehn D.A. LeBeau M.M. MacDonald M.J. Gene. 1996; 172: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and we have designated this position as +1 (Fig. 1 B). The 5′ end of the longest clone-containing sequence from exon 1B corresponds to the position −48. In addition, we identified three clones with 5′ ends at position of +33 of exon 1B and one clone with a 5′ end at position of −29 of exon 1B. To map promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of exon 1A, various 5′ progressive deletions starting from −3400 were prepared, and their activities were measured. Fig. 2 A shows the relative luciferase activities of these constructs in INS-1 and HeLa cells. The activities of the constructs in the forward orientation were 7–15 times higher than the activity of the construct possessing the reverse orientation (R3400). The construct containing 460 nucleotides (460A) had the highest activity (Fig. 2 A). To map promoter B of the mGPD gene, progressive deletions from the 5′ end as well as a 3′ deletion were prepared, and their activities were measured. Fig.2 B shows the relative luciferase activities of these constructs after transient transfection into INS-1 cells or HeLa cells. All constructs contain 6 bp of the 5′ end of exon 1B and the promoter B region that lies immediately upstream of exon 1 B. The activity produced by the 600B construct, which contains the entire region of the promoter B, was comparable with that of the SV40/enhancer control vector when expressed in INS-1 cells. The mGPD promoter B inserted in the reverse orientation in the pGL3 vector was used as a control. Its activity was 9.6% and 3.2% that of the mGPD-600B construct in INS-1 cells and HeLa cells, respectively. The promoterless pGL3-Basic vector was also used as a control, and its activity was less than 5% of mGPD-600B in both INS-1 and HeLa cells. Progressive 5′ deletions from −600 to −400 (400B) still retained 85 and 80% activity in INS-1 and HeLa cells, respectively. Further deletions resulted in a sharp stepwise decrease in activity. Deleting bases +6 to −140 and retaining bases −141 to −400 (−400 to −140B) eliminated about 90% of promoter activity, indicating that the proximal 140 bases contains strong positive elements. The activities of two promoter A constructs (3400A and 460A) that have the highest activity were compared with the activities of two promoter B constructs that have the highest activity (600B and 400B). The promoter A constructs were 10% as active as the promoter B constructs in both INS-1 cells and HeLa cells (Fig. 3). Since the activity of promoter B is much higher than that of promoter A, we further characterized promoter B. First we compared promoter B activity in non-beta cells including human HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma, human HepG2 hepatoblastoma, and rat H4-II-E hepatoma cells to that in INS-1 cells. The last cell line was derived from a rat pancreatic insulinoma (15Asfarh M. Janlic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim G.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and expresses a high level of mGPD enzyme activity comparable with that of normal pancreatic islets. 2M. J. MacDonald, unpublished data. We compared the activity of pGL3-mGPD-400B with the activity of the pGL3 control vector, which contains the luciferase gene under control of the SV40 promoter in INS-1, HeLa, HepG2, and H4-II-E cells. Fig.4 A shows that the luciferase activity driven by mGPD-400B was 1.8-fold higher than that driven by the SV40 promoter in INS-1 cells, whereas the activities driven by mGPD-400B were 3, 5, and 43% that driven by SV40 in HeLa, HepG2, and H4-II-E cells, respectively. If the absolute light units of luciferase activity driven by mGPD-400B was normalized for the protein concentration of the cell lysates, the activity of the 400B construct expressed in INS-1 cells was 3- and 29-fold higher than that in HeLa and H4-II-E cells, respectively, and was slightly higher than in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4 B). Since the construct containing +1 to −400 nucleotides possesses 80% activity of the entire 600 bp of promoter B, a series of 25-nucleotide internal deletions from this region were prepared to attempt to identify important regulatory regions. Fig. 5shows that removal of nucleotides −76 to −100 eliminated 50 and 70% of the promoter activity in INS-1 and HeLa cells, respectively, and that removal of sequence −201 to −225 eliminated 47 and 46% of the promoter activity in INS-1 and HeLa cells, respectively, indicating that these regions contain strong positive regulatory elements. The region from −252 to −276 also might contain important element(s) because removal of the region resulted in a 35 and 55% decrease in activity in INS-1 and HeLa cells, respectively. Examination of the sequence in this region revealed the presence of a Sp1 binding site between −280 to −275, suggesting this Sp1 may also contribute to promoter B activity, especially in HeLa cells. To more explicitly identify potential regulatory elements in the region between −76 to −100 in promoter B, a series of 9-nucleotide internal deletions were prepared. The results suggest that the interval −94 to −102 contains an important regulatory element for the mGPD promoter B because removal of this sequence results in a 50% decrease in activity in INS-1 cells (Fig.6 A) and a 60% decrease in activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 6 B). A similar study was also performed with the region −201 to −225. The deletion from −204 to −221 led to a decrease in relative activity of about 50% in both INS-1 cells (Fig. 6 C) and HeLa cells (Fig. 6 D). These data indicated that both the −94 to −102 and −204 to −221 regions contain regulatory sequences that significantly contribute to the activity of mGPD promoter B. Examination of the DNA sequence of promoter B revealed the presence of a putative E2F (TTCCGCGT) binding site and a putative Sp1 (CCGCCC) binding site between −204 to −221 and a putative NRF-2 binding site (AGGAAG) between −94 and −102. To assess the contribution of these sites to promoter activity, the binding sites were altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and the activities of the mutant constructs were estimated. Fig. 7,A and B, shows that when the Sp1 site, CCGCCC, located at −220 to −225, was replaced by CAAACC, the promoter construct still retained 90 and 85% activity in INS-1 and HeLa cells, respectively. However, when the E2F site, TTCCGCGT, located at −208 to −215 was mutated to TTCAAAGT, the promoter activity was decreased by 48 and 43% in INS-1 and HeLa cells, respectively. To study the role of the NRF-2 binding site in the −94 to −102 region, two point mutations (G-96T and A-98C) were created, and their activities were measured (Fig. 7, C and D). Adjacent to this NRF-2 site there is an NRF-2 like sequence (GGGAAG) at −93 to −88 that differs from the consensus sequence only in the first nucleotide (G instead of A). Two point mutations (G-88T and A-90C) were created in this region to serve as a control for the −94 to −102 region. The G-96T mutation resulted in 47 and 60% decreases in activity of INS-1 cells and HeLa cells, respectively, whereas the A-98C mutation resulted in 32 and 42% decreases in activity in INS-1 cells and HeLa cells, respectively, as compared with the wild type (400B) construct. The mutations G-88T and A-90C did not dramatically alter the promoter activity. In fact the G-88T mutation increased the activity to twice that of the wild type construct. These results suggest that the E2F consensus sequences in the −204 to −221 region and NRF-2 in −94 to −102 region significantly contribute to the activity of promoter B, but the Sp1 and NRF-2-like sequences in these regions do not. To determine if the sequences at −102 to −94 and −93 to −88 are capable of binding proteins, we performed gel shift assays (Fig.8). The wild type and mutated DNA sequences covering region −81 to −110 were used as probes and competitors in mobility gel shift studies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 8, the wild type oligonucleotide caused retardation of two bands in INS-1 cells and three bands in HeLa cells, which were competed away by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotides that carried point mutations within the NRF-2 motif (G96T, A98C, and G100T) did not compete out the retarded bands in INS-1 or HeLa cell nuclear extracts. In contrast, the retarded bands were competed away by the oligonucleotides containing mutations G88T and A90C, which were at the NRF-2-like site. Taken together with the data from functional analysis of these point mutations in luciferase assays, these results suggest that the NRF-2 motif at −94 to −102 in mGPD promoter B plays an important role in the expression of the mGPD gene.

Degradation of membrane phospholipids yields water-soluble (e.g. eicosanoids, inositol trisphosphate) and lipophilic messenger molecules (such as diacylglycerol and ceramide), which initiate several signal transduction chains. Phospholipids are also essential for the biogenesis of caveolae, lateral domains of the cell membrane consisting of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific proteins (reviewed in Ref.1Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Specific phospholipids are also required for membrane fusion processes, in particular phosphatidylethanolamine (2Takei K. Haucke V. Slepnev V. Farsad K. Salazar M. Chen H. De Camilli P. Cell. 1998; 94: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The intramonolayer and intrabilayer distribution of the phospholipids can be rapidly changed in response to a particular physiological situation. During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is transferred to the outer leaflet of cell membranes, where it serves as a recognition signal for the clearance of apoptotic cells (3Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R.

J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). In view of their prominent roles in cellular functions, it is evident that the concentration and localization of the individual phospholipids within the membrane bilayer need to be carefully regulated. This is accomplished by enzymes involved in the remodeling and synthesis of the phospholipids (acyltransferases, sphingomyelin synthase, etc.) and by proteins transferring phospholipids between the different intracellular membrane systems (interbilayer transfer). Furthermore, a group of proteins catalyzes the intrabilayer movements of phospholipids between the leaflets of the cellular membrane bilayer (5Diaz C. Schroit A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Early work on human blood cells suggested that cells may also acquire phospholipids from extracellular sources (6Bruckdorfer K.R. Graham J.M. Chapman D. Wallach D.F. Biological Membranes. 3. Academic Press, London1976: 103-152Google Scholar). Among the phospholipid donors, low density lipoproteins (LDL)1 and other lipoprotein particles are considered to be of particular relevance. The lipoproteins are major phospholipid carriers within the plasma compartment. Their phospholipid contents are only slightly lower than their cholesterol concentrations. By means of the endocytosis of the LDL particles, among the multiple components of the lipoproteins, cells also take up phospholipids. Recent data point to the existence of a selective, endocytosis-independent phospholipid uptake pathway. Through this import, the phospholipid composition of the cells can be rapidly changed. This was shown to be relevant for the assembly of protein complexes on the platelet surface necessary for the synthesis of thrombin (7Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1999; 274: 23235-23241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The data thus indicated that specific proteins mediate the selective phospholipid import into the cells. Proteins catalyzing the transfer of phospholipids between the plasma lipoproteins (9Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) are apparently not involved in the cellular phospholipid uptake. We demonstrate in the present study that stimulated platelets release proteins that specifically exchange sphingomyelin between phospholipid vesicles in vitro. Among these proteins, connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), a cytokine belonging to the CXC-subfamily of chemokines, exerted the strongest stimulation of the cellular sphingomyelin uptake.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), represents an N-terminally extended precursor of the chemokine neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). The latter protein is generated from CTAP-III through the cleavage of a N-terminal peptide, which is mediated by proteases associated with monocytes and neutrophil granulocytes (12Walz A. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,13Brandt E. van Damme J. Flad H.-D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CTAP-III, which is devoid of the stimulatory functions on neutrophils characteristic for NAP-2 (14Walz A. Dewald B. von Tscharner V. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), has been reported to act as a weak growth factor for fibroblasts (15Castor C.W. Ritchie J.C. Scott M.E. Whitney S.L. Arthritis Rheum. 1977; 20: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological role of CTAP-III has not been clearly evident so far. The results of our study identify CTAP-III as a transcellular mediator of the cellular sphingomyelin import. Platelet basic protein (PBP) and CTAP-III were isolated from released supernatants of thrombin-activated platelets by sequential immunoaffinity chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and reversed phase chromatography (13Brandt E. van Damme J. Flad H.-D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Brandt E. Petersen F. Flad H.-D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1356-1364PubMed Google Scholar). NAP-2 was generated from CTAP-III by limited digestion with chymotrypsin and purified by reversed phase chromatography (17Ludwig A. Petersen F. Zahn S. Götze O. Schröder J.-M. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. Blood. 1997; 90: 4588-4597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant CTAP-III and IL-8 bearing a His tag at the N terminus were produced inEscherichia coli according to previously described methods (18Ehlert J.E. Gerdes J. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. Novel C-terminally truncated isoforms of the CXC chemokine β-thromboglobulin and their impact on neutrophil functions..J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4975-4982PubMed Google Scholar), the His tag being removed from IL-8 to yield the 72-amino acid form of the chemokine. All chemokine preparations exceeded 99% purity according to overloaded silver-stained SDS-PAGE and automated N-terminal sequence analysis. The peptide corresponding to the 15 N-terminal amino acids of CTAP-III was synthesized using solid phase methods and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified on a Poros R2/H column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany). The monoclonal antibody reactive to all variably truncated isoforms of β-TG Ag (monoclonal antibody C-24) was induced in mice, cloned, and purified as described (13Brandt E. van Damme J. Flad H.-D. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 1-Palmitoyl-2-pyrenedecanoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphorylcholine (py-phosphatidylcholine), 1-palmitoyl-2-pyrenedecanoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphorylethanolamine (py-phosphatidylethanolamine), and (N-pyrenedecanoyl)sphingomyelin (py-sphingomyelin) were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [14C]Choline-sphingomyelin, [14C]choline-phosphatidylcholine, and [3H]choline-phosphatidylcholine were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Homburg, Germany). [3H]Sphingomyelin, labeled in the ceramide moiety, was kindly donated by Dr. Thierry Levade (University of Toulouse, France).N-Oleoylethanolamine and heparin were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Human platelets were isolated as described previously (7Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To gain PBL and monocytes, a mononuclear cell suspension was prepared from human blood according to Fogelman et al. (19Fogelman A.M. Elahi F. Sykes K. van Lenten B.J. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes and PBL were separated from each other by the use of anti-CD14 antibodies conjugated to microbeads and passaged over a positive selection column (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Granulocytes were isolated using anti-CD15 antibodies conjugated to microbeads. Skin fibroblasts from a healthy individual (LDLR +/+), a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (LDLR −/−), and a patient with Niemann-Pick disease A lacking A-SMase activity were kind gifts of Dr. Joachim Thiery (University of Munich) and Dr. Erich Gulbins (University of Tübingen), respectively. The 70Z/3 pre-B cells with transfected 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R55) have been described previously (20Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Jurkat cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Hartmut Engelmann (University of Munich). A total of 45 buffy coat preparations (from about 350 ml of human blood each), obtained from the local blood bank (Gesundheitsamt, Stadt München), were used for the isolation of platelets. The platelets were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.5 unit of thrombin/ml in a suspension buffer (138 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm Hepes; pH 7.4). The suspensions were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were recovered. After concentration in Centriplus 10 tubes (Amicon, Witten), the supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. The supernatants thus obtained were dialyzed against the column buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazol, 2 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% sodium azide; pH 7.6). The dialysate was applied onto a Sephadex G-75SF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg). 3-ml fractions were analyzed for protein content by UV absorption at 280 nm. Aliquots of the fractions were tested for their effects on py-sphingomyelin transfer between donor and acceptor lipid vesicles (see below). The fractions showing the highest sphingomyelin exchange were pooled and dialyzed against an elution buffer (10 mm Tris, 2 mmmercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% sodium azide; pH 8.0). The dialysate was loaded onto an anion exchange Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with the elution buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl. Before analysis for the py-sphingomyelin exchange activity, the fractions were dialyzed against a Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.02% sodium azide; pH 7.2). The proteins of the fractions from both columns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the preparation of phospholipid donor vesicles, 250 μg of egg phosphatidylcholine were dissolved together with 45 μg of phosphatidic acid, and 7.5 μg of either py-sphingomyelin, py-phosphatidylcholine, or py-phosphatidylethanolamine in ethanol. The mixture was dispersed by very slow injection into 300 μl of Tris buffer. For the production of acceptor vesicles, 10 mg of egg phosphatidylcholine in ethanol was dispersed in 1 ml of Tris buffer. 50 μl of acceptor vesicle solution was mixed with 10 μl of donor vesicles and 40 μl of Tris buffer. To this suspension, 200 μl of either Tris buffer or column fractions was added. After 0 and 30 min, 100 μl of the suspensions was loaded onto a small anion exchange column (DEAE-Sepharose C6-LB), and the column was eluted with 1.5 ml of Tris buffer. The eluted acceptor vesicles were solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 at 37 °C, and their pyrene monomer contents were analyzed (see below). LDL and high density lipoprotein were labeled with fluorescent and radioactive phospholipids by incubation of fresh human plasma with py-phospholipids, [14C]- and [3H]phospholipids (present in lipid vesicles), and subsequent isolation of lipoprotein fractions by ultracentrifugation as described (21Engelmann B. Kögl C. Kulschar R. Schaipp B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The specific activities ranged between 1.0 and 9.4 × 104 cpm/nmol of phospholipid. Py-labeled phospholipids were present at 10–25 ng of pyrene/μg of LDL protein. In general, cells were suspended with lipoproteins or vesicles (labeled with14C-, 3H- and py-phospholipids) in the suspension buffer at 37 °C. In the case of py-phospholipid-containing donors, the fluorescence was monitored directly in the suspensions every 60 s under on-line conditions. Incorporation of py-labeled phospholipids into the cells was followed by the increase in monomer intensity after addition of the cells to the donors. In all experiments shown under “Results,” the increase in monomer intensity was accompanied by a decrease of the excimer to monomer ratio of py-fluorescence intensity. These changes in the py-fluorescence monomer and excimer intensities specifically indicate the selective (endocytosis-independent) phospholipid transfer into the cells. Monomer and excimer fluorescence of the suspensions were determined at emission wavelengths of 380 nm and 480 nm, respectively, with excitation at 340 nm (excitation and emission slits of 5 and 10 nm). Following incubation with radioactively labeled lipoproteins, the cells were separated from the donors by centrifugation and washed once, and the cell associated radioactivity was determined. After incubation with the [14C]sphingomyelin-labeled lipoproteins, the cell suspensions were separated into aqueous and organic phases by the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 912-917Crossref Scopus (42620) Google Scholar). The upper phase was analyzed for its amount of 14C reflecting the quantity of [14C]phosphocholine liberated from [14C]sphingomyelin. Concomitantly, the quantity of cell-associated [14C]sphingomyelin was estimated by separating the phospholipids of the lower phase by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography using the solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/NH3/H2O (45/37/12/8, v/v). In the case of incubation with [3H]sphingomyelin-LDL, following the Bligh and Dyer separation procedure, the lower phase was subjected to one-dimensional thin layer chromatography using the solvent CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60/35/8, v/v) to separate the sphingolipids ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingomyelin. The area corresponding to standards of these sphingolipids was scraped off, and the radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were measured according to the Bradford procedure by means of a kit using α-globulin as a standard (Bio-Rad, Munich). The concentrations of β-TG Ag and related proteins in platelet releasates were determined according to a previously described sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (23Petersen F. Ludwig A. Flad H.-D. Brandt E. TNF-α renders human neutrophils responsive to platelet factor 4..J. Immunol. 1996; 615: 1954-1962Google Scholar). The mean values under “Results” are given ± S.D. The extracellular media recovered from suspensions of thrombin-activated platelets were shown to contain proteinaceous factors that enhance the transfer of ethanolamine phospholipids between lipid vesicles in vitro (7Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed whether the media would influence the exchange of the choline phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Supernatants obtained from suspensions of thrombin-activated platelets were added to a mixture consisting of donor vesicles, containing py-labeled phospholipids, and acceptor vesicles. Extracellular media from suspensions of untreated platelets did not affect the transfer of the py-labeled choline phospholipids between the two types of vesicles (TableI). The supernatants recovered from thrombin-activated platelets stimulated the exchange of py-sphingomyelin by 3.4-fold compared with the one obtained from untreated platelets. The exchange of py-phosphatidylcholine was unaffected. The acceleration of py-sphingomyelin transfer was enhanced after dialysis of the supernatants from activated platelets, suggesting that low molecular weight components partially suppress the sphingomyelin transfer (Table I). Briefly boiling the supernatant and precipitation of its proteins with ammonium sulfate strongly reduced the exchange of py-sphingomyelin (not shown). Transfer of py-sphingomyelin from lipid vesicles to the PBL was also stimulated by the presence of the extracellular media gained from thrombin-activated platelet suspensions (Table I). Again, the transfer of py-phosphatidylcholine was not affected. The results suggested that platelet releasates contained proteins mediating the sphingomyelin exchange.Table IReleasates of activated platelets stimulate sphingomyelin exchangepy-SMpy-PC% of pyrene in donor vesiclesVesicle-vesicle transfer Control2.1 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.4 Supernatant from untreated platelets1.9 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.7 Supernatant from thrombin-activated platelets + dialysis6.5 ± 1.12.7 ± 0.88.6 ± 1.82.4 ± 0.5ng of pyrene/10 6 PBLVesicle-cell transfer Supernatant from untreated platelets0.5 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.1 Supernatant from thrombin-activated platelets2.9 ± 0.60.4 ± 0.2Platelets were activated with thrombin (0.5 unit/ml), and the platelet free supernatants were recovered and added to a mixture of donor vesicles (enriched with either py-sphingomyelin (py-SM) or py-phosphatidylcholine (py-PC)) and acceptor vesicles. After a 30-min incubation, the acceptor vesicles were isolated and their pyrene contents were determined. In other experiments, the transfer of the py-labeled choline phospholipids between lipid vesicles (3.8 μg of egg phosphatidylcholine and 0.08 μg of py-phospholipid) and PBLs was assessed within an 8-min incubation period in the presence of the supernatants obtained from platelet suspensions. Mean values are shown from four to six experiments. Open table in a new tab Platelets were activated with thrombin (0.5 unit/ml), and the platelet free supernatants were recovered and added to a mixture of donor vesicles (enriched with either py-sphingomyelin (py-SM) or py-phosphatidylcholine (py-PC)) and acceptor vesicles. After a 30-min incubation, the acceptor vesicles were isolated and their pyrene contents were determined. In other experiments, the transfer of the py-labeled choline phospholipids between lipid vesicles (3.8 μg of egg phosphatidylcholine and 0.08 μg of py-phospholipid) and PBLs was assessed within an 8-min incubation period in the presence of the supernatants obtained from platelet suspensions. Mean values are shown from four to six experiments. To isolate and identify these proteins, supernatants from thrombin-stimulated platelet suspensions were fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex column. The fractions eluted from the column were tested for their capacity to affect the py-sphingomyelin exchangein vitro. The sphingomyelin exchange activity was mostly present in a broad peak between fractions 28 and 31 (Fig.1 A). The fractions were pooled and their proteins separated by gel electrophoresis. Several bands were observed. A prominent band was noted in the 8-kDa range (Fig. 1 A, right-hand side). To further purify the proteins catalyzing sphingomyelin exchange, the combined fractions 28–31 were applied onto an anion exchange column. The proteins were eluted from this latter column with a linear NaCl gradient. The highest sphingomyelin transfer activity was found in fraction 5 (Fig.1 B). Gel electrophoretic separation of fraction 5 revealed a single band, which was again in the 8-kDa range (Fig. 1 B,right-hand side). Amino acid analysis of tryptic peptides obtained after enzymatic digestion of the material contained in fraction 5 identified a peptide fragment that corresponded to amino acid positions 69–79 of a protein known as platelet basic protein (PBP (11Holt J.C. Harris M.E. Holt A.M. Lange E. Henschen A. Niewiarowski S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). PBP (94 amino acids) is a precursor protein of several N-terminally truncated derivatives such as the connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III; 85 residues) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2; 70 residues). Together, these proteins are termed β-thromboglobulin antigen (β-TG Ag). We measured the concentration of total β-TG Ag in the extracellular media recovered from suspensions of thrombin-activated platelets. By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, the concentration was determined to be 4.2 μm. The majority of β-TG Ag (up to 90%) contained in the platelets consists of CTAP-III, the rest being almost exclusively PBP (24Holt J.C. Rabellino E.M. Gewirtz A.M. Gunkel L.M. Rucinski B. Niewiarowski S. Exp. Hematol. 1988; 16: 303-306Google Scholar). Following addition of the purified CTAP-III to the in vitrosystem of donor and acceptor vesicles, the transfer of py-sphingomyelin was dose dependently enhanced (Fig.2 A). The concentration dependence of the stimulation indicated a steep increase between 0 and 4.4 μm. At the latter concentration, at which an apparent saturation was reached, the transfer of py-sphingomyelin was enhanced by 6.5-fold. The exchange of py-labeled phosphatidylcholine and of py-phosphatidylethanolamine were unaffected (Fig. 2 A). Addition of NAP-2 (4.4 μm) stimulated the py-sphingomyelin transfer by 2.9-fold (Fig. 2 B). Equimolar concentrations of PBP were nearly equally effective as native and recombinant CTAP-III. A synthetic 15-amino acid peptide encompassing the residues that are cleaved off during the degradation of CTAP-III to NAP-2, as well as the structurally unrelated chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), did not influence the movements of py-sphingomyelin to the acceptor vesicles (Fig. 2 B). Accordingly, CTAP-III selectively stimulated the exchange of sphingomyelin. We next evaluated the effect of CTAP-III on the selective cellular uptake of sphingomyelin. LDL particles, the lipoprotein fraction with the highest amount of sphingomyelin in human plasma, were employed as donors for the sphingolipid. Blood cells and fibroblasts, which could be targets for the proteins secreted by the activated platelets underin vivo conditions, were analyzed for their capacity to incorporate sphingomyelin in a CTAP-III-dependent way. The specific transfer of sphingomyelin was assessed by following the changes in the py-fluorescence characteristics under on-line conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). CTAP-III (3.3 μm) rapidly stimulated the translocation of LDL derived py-sphingomyelin into the PBL and skin fibroblasts (Fig.3 A). After 10 min, 2–3% of the sphingomyelin initially present in the donor vesicles had been transferred to the cells in the absence of the chemokine. With CTAP-III, the amount taken up by the cells was increased by 4- to 5-fold. The concentration dependence of the stimulation of sphingomyelin uptake by CTAP-III showed a sharp increase between 0 and 3.3 μm, an apparent saturation being observed at higher concentrations (Fig. 3 B). At 3.3 μm, CTAP-III did not affect the transfer of py-phosphatidylcholine and py-phosphatidylethanolamine from the LDL particles into the PBL within a 10-min interval (data not shown). The enhancement of the py-sphingomyelin incorporation by CTAP-III was comparable in LDL receptor-positive (LDLR +/+) and LDL receptor-negative (LDLR −/−) fibroblasts, as well as in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 C). In the presence of the anti-β-TG Ag antibody, the increase in the sphingomyelin import into the LDLR +/+ fibroblasts and Jurkat cells as induced by CTAP-III was diminished by 93% and 86%, respectively. The presence of an irrelevant mouse IgG antibody did not affect the CTAP-III-mediated sphingomyelin uptake into the PBL (not shown). CTAP-III barely augmented the py-sphingomyelin incorporation into the platelets (Fig. 3 C). Equimolar concentrations of PBP and CTAP-III elicited a comparable increase of the py-sphingomyelin transfer from the LDL particles to the PBL (TableII). The stimulation by CTAP-III was completely prevented by the anti-β-TG Ag antibody. NAP-2 enhanced the py-sphingomyelin uptake by 4-fold, whereas IL-8 was ineffective (TableII). IL-8 differed from the β-TG Ag proteins in the electrostatic properties of the C-terminal, positively charged, and neutral amino acids prevailing in the β-TG Ag proteins, whereas more residues with negative charges were present in IL-8. The basic, water-soluble lysozyme did not promote the uptake of py-sphingomyelin (Table II). This excludes the notion that the presence of the positive charges per se was sufficient for the phospholipid transfer function of CTAP-III (and related peptides). When lipid vesicles were employed as phospholipid donors instead of the lipoproteins, the transfer of py-sphingomyelin into the cells was accelerated by 7-fold (Table II). Thus, CTAP-III promoted the cellular uptake of py-sphingomyelin.Table IICellular py-sphingomyelin uptake is differentially stimulated by chemokinespy-sphingomyelin uptake-fold elevation against controlLDL PBP5.9 ± 1.3 CTAP-III6.4 ± 0.6 CTAP-III + anti-β-TG1.1 ± 0.4 NAP-24.4 ± 0.8 IL-80.6 ± 0.4 Lysozyme1.0 ± 0.1Lipid vesicles CTAP-III6.8 ± 1.3The effect of the indicated proteins (all at 2–3 μm) on the transfer of py-sphingomyelin from LDL (1 μg of protein/ml) or lipid vesicles (3.8 μg of egg phosphatidylcholine and 0.08 μg of py-sphingomyelin) to PBL (106) was analyzed within an 8-min incubation period.

Parkinson's disease (PD)1 results from selective degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. The etiology of this process is not known, but one explanation may be enhanced oxidative stress which, in the substantia nigra, could stem from reactive oxygen species generated during normal metabolism of dopamine (DA) (5Spina M.B. Cohen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Indeed, auto and enzymatic oxidation of DA, the endogenous nigrostriatal neurotransmitter synthesized and stored in the nigrostriatal neurons, generates a variety of cytotoxic oxygen radical species (6Olanow C.W. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 439-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In support of this concept, we recently showed that DA can induce apoptosis in cultured neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells, including chick embryo sympathetic neurons, mouse thymocytes, and rat pherochromacytoma cells (PC12) (7Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E.

Based on these findings we hypothesized that neuronal degeneration in PD may be caused at least in part by DA-mediated induction of apoptosis in the nigrostriatal neurons. Dysregulation of the cellular control mechanisms of apoptosis, which may be inherited or acquired, can lead to failure to restrain the lethal potential of DA and its potentially toxic oxidation products (11Graham D.G.

To understand the molecular events associated with neuronal degeneration, we focused on the early stages of the DA-triggered death process in cultured neuronal cells.

This “non-hypothesis bound” approach, applied to cultured chick embryo sympathetic neurons, enabled us to isolate several “DA-responsive” genes, i.e. genes undergoing up- or down-regulation in response to exposure to DA (or its oxidative metabolites). Some of these genes may have a functional role in mediating the apoptosis process (17Shirvan A. Ziv I. Barzilai A. Djaldeti R. Zilkha-Falb R. Michlin T. Melamed E. J. Neural Transm.

(a) Similar to dopaminergic neurons, sympathetic neurons synthesize, store, and secrete catecholamines. (b) The requirement of large numbers of neurons precluded studies on the subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons, which comprise only 3% of the total neuronal population of the substantia nigra. (c) Since all the cells we investigated (several types of neurons, PC12 cells, thymocytes including dopaminergic neurons (7Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A.

(d) Since dopaminergic neurons synthesize, store, and secrete DA, it is feasible that under certain conditions the secreted and/or accumulated DA becomes toxic and induces apoptotic neuronal death, making it an important mediator of PD. We report here that during DA-induced apoptosis, one of the up-regulated genes identified by DD methodology was the chick homologue of the T-complex protein-1δ (TCP-1δ) subunit. Chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) is a large multisubunit complex of 800–900 kDa, a protein complex considered to be the cytosolic homologue of mitochondrial HSP60. These two complexes have a characteristic oligomeric structure consisting of two heptameric rings stacked one on top of the other to form a large double-ring complex. The complexes recognize proteins in non-native conformation, thereby preventing premature folding and aggregation, and mediates the acquisition of the native structure (21Horwich A.L. Willison K.R. Philos Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1993; 339: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cytosolic CCT is a highly conserved protein that interacts with only a limited number of substrates such as actin, tubulin, luciferase, and cyclin B (22Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Melki R. Batelier G. Soulti S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We report the cloning, sequencing, and transcript analysis of TCP-1δ and show that it is up-regulated as a result of DA-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that overexpression of TCP-1δ protein accelerates DA-induced apoptosis and that down-regulation of TCP-1δ by antisense treatment reduced the rate of DA-induced neuronal death. Fertilized eggs were obtained from the Tel Aviv University animal care facility. Paravertebral sympathetic ganglia at embryonic day 9 (8Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Greene L.A. Dev. Biol. 1977; 58: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were dissected out, and the cells were dissociated by trypsinization (0.25% in EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C). Cells were then plated on 24 poly-l-lysine-coated wells (4 × 105cells/well) or 35-mm tissue culture plates (106 cells/well) (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and grown in serum-free medium DCCM-1 (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 2% chick embryo extract, 0.5% horse serum, 20 μg/ml fluorodeoxyuridine, and 20 μg/ml uridine (to kill the non-neuronal cells), 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericine B, and 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). DA (3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride, No. CH8502, Sigma) was dissolved directly in the appropriate culture medium. Sympathetic neurons (days 2–3 in culture in the presence of NGF) were treated for a given time with 300 μm DA (previously found to be the potent concentration following detailed dose response studies (7Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). Plates maintained in identical conditions but without exposure to DA served as controls. Neuronal viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay, as described by Zilkha-Falb et al.(8Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During the first 3 days of culture, neurons were grown in serum-free medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml NGF. To induce apoptosis, the culture medium was replaced on day 4 after plating, and the neurons were grown in the absence of NGF and in the presence of 0.01% anti-NGF antibodies. Total RNA was prepared from 106 sympathetic neurons using triazol kit from Life Technologies, Inc. Chromosomal DNA contamination was removed by DNase I treatment (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate water, and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. RNA samples were run on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to assess concentration and integrity. Reactions were carried out essentially as described by Liang and Pardee (15Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar) and Bauer et al. (16Bauer D. Muller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthop P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). 50–100 ng of total RNA were used in each reverse transcription reaction in a volume of 20 μl. 3′ end primers were used at a concentration of 2.5 μm (see list of primers below), and dNTP concentration was 20 μm. Reactions were incubated at 42 °C for 90 min and at 95 °C for another 5 min and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Control reactions were performed in the absences of enzyme. To validate the reproducibility of the altered expression, three different RNA preparations were rescreened by identical DD protocols. 0.5–1 μg of total RNA was primed with 1 μm sequence specific primer using conditions similar to those described for DD, with the exception that dNTP concentration was 1 mm, and no RNase inhibitor was added. 2 μl of each reverse transcription reaction volume were used as a template for PCR in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were as described previously (15Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar, 16Bauer D. Muller H. Reich J. Riedel H. Ahrenkiel V. Warthop P. Strauss M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), except that a single arbitrary primer of 10-mer was used to tag both ends of amplified molecules. Under these conditions, the mRNA population representing the coding region was selected. Reactions, which were carried out in triplicate, were run on 6% denaturing sequencing gel within 24 h. To confirm the reproducibility of the amplification for selected bands, each reaction was repeated at least three times with different preparations of RNA. The whole volume (20 μl) of reverse transcription reaction was taken for PCR. In a final volume of 100 μl, dNTP concentration was 200 μm, and specific primer concentration was 0.5 μm. Taq polymerase was from Bioprobe Systems, France. Cycling conditions varied according to specific primers. The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by subcloning into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequencing the cloned insert. These inserts served as probes for Northern blot analysis. cDNA bands that consistently showed different expression patterns were chosen for further characterization. Precise orientation between x-ray film and the dried film was achieved by fluorescent markers (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Bands were cut out through the film, and the gel was re-exposed to x-ray film to ensure the appropriate band had been excised. DNA was extracted from the piece of gel with 30 μl of water for 60 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase was taken immediately for reamplification, and the conditions of the first 20 cycles were as in the DD reaction. Another 20 cycles were added after primer and dNTP concentration were changed to 10 and 100 μm, respectively, and one more aliquot of the enzyme was added. Reamplified cDNA bands were recovered from the 4% agarose gels using the GETsorb kit (Genomed, Triangle Park, NC). Extracted DNA was further purified by Qiaquick kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid kit. Sequencing was carried out with the sequenase II kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech using pUCM13 forward or reverse sequencing primers. Analysis of sequences was carried out on the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBankTM data base (BLASTN algorithm) (25Benson D. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2963-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or by searching the GenBankTM and EMBL data base with Fasta program (GCG Software, Madison, WI). RP3 (DD antisense): dT12GC P2 (DD sense): GGTACTAAGC 18 S rRNA: ACGGTATCTGATCGTCCTTCGAACC Total RNA was prepared from DA-treated or untreated cells for Northern blot analysis. Each lane was loaded with 5–10 μg of RNA corresponding to 106 cells. RNA was separated on 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde in 1× MOPS buffer. Gels were blotted onto Qiagen nylon membrane, and ultraviolet cross-linking was performed. Probes were prepared by random priming using Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were washed at room temperature for short probes and at 65 °C for long probes with 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film. For RNA quantification, the intensity of bands was measured by both soft laser-scanning densitometer (Biomed Instruments Inc. Fullerton, CA) and 202D gel documentation system (Dinco and Rhenium, Jerusalem, Israel). As a control for gel loading and transfer, membranes were stripped and re-hybridized to an oligonucleotide of 18 S rRNA (see list of primers above), phosphorylated as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.59-10.61Google Scholar). RNA quantities in each lane were normalized against rRNA levels. Band intensities were normalized against glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The mRNA expression of GAPDH, which served as the control, showed no change in response to dopamine exposure for 24 h despite GAPDH levels having been monitored as a function of the apoptotic process in some models of apoptosis (27Chuang D.M. Ishitani R. Nat. Med. 1996; 6: 609-610Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The expression of GAPDH was monitored by re-hybridization of the same blot with a probe of rat GAPDH, consisting of a 1500-bp fragment of its coding region (obtained from Dr. Lazar). To construct the library, 5 μg of poly(A)+mRNA were extracted from DA-treated (1–12 h) chick embryo sympathetic neurons, reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers containing restriction site for XhoI, and ligated withEcoRI adapters. The XhoI-digested cDNA was size-selected (0.5–6 kbp) and ligated into ZAP Express vector arms (Stratagene) in sense orientation. After packaging, the vector was inserted into Escherichia coli (XL1-Blue MRF′). The cDNA library contained 6 × 105 independent clones and was amplified once. To screen the library, colonies were plated on 150-mm NZY agar plates (50,000 plaque-forming units/plate), duplicated on nitrocellulose filters, and lysed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The colonies were pre-hybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 2 × 1.4 PIPES buffer, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The filters were then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same buffer containing 107 cpm/filter of 32P-labeled probe, washed at 65 °C in a solution containing 0.1× SSC buffer and 0.1% SDS, and exposed overnight at −80 °C to Fuji RX x-ray film. Positive clones were converted to bacterial clones by excising the pKB-CMV from the ZAP Express vector using the “Exassist” helper phage. DNA sequence of both strands of positive clones was analyzed by the chain termination method described previously by Sanger et al. (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52244) Google Scholar). The sequence was determined by the Tel Aviv University Faculty of Life Sciences sequencing units (Applied Biosystems, Inc. DNA sequencer 377) beginning with T3 and T7 primers and then with inner primers according to the already known sequences. The neurons were scraped off the substratum with hypothonic buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.5) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals No. 1836145) and subjected to 5 cycles of freeze-thawing. Intracellular organelles and membranes were removed by centrifuging the cell lysate for 30 min/100,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic soluble proteins was collected. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Harlow and Lane (30Harlow E. Lane D. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490-492Google Scholar) using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Each lane was loaded with an equal amount of cytoplasmic protein (30 μg), which, following electrophoresis, was transferred to an Immobilon polyvinyldiene disulfide membrane for 2 h. Blots were stained with Ponceau to verify that an equal amount of protein was loaded and blotted in each lane. Membranes were then probed with the antibodies as indicated at dilutions recommended by the supplier. The intensity of the signal was determined by ECL assay reagents. Polyclonal antibody raised against TCP-1δ subunit was purchased from StressGene, Victoria, Canada. 21-mer oligonucleotide targeted against TCP-1δ mRNA was purchased from Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland. Antisense, 5′-GTCCCGCGTTCTCCGGCATCG-3′, and sense, 5′-CGATGCCGGAGAACGCGGGAC-3′, were phosphorothioated at the last three bases at the 3′ end and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein at the 5′ end. The oligonucleotides were dissolved (10 mm stock) in distilled water prior to use and diluted to concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 μm in serum-free medium, and tested for 17 h for their effect on TCP-1δ. Sympathetic neurons were prepared as described previously in density of 2.5 × 105 cells in 24-well plates. Neurons were treated with oligonucleotides 24 h after plating. The role of TCP-1δ in DA-induced apoptosis was assessed by examining whether its down-regulation can affect neuronal viability after DA exposure. Using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide, we found that most of the neurons in the cultures absorbed the oligonucleotide. Neuronal viability was monitored at the end of the time period. Chick embryo sympathetic neurons were prepared as previously by Zilkha-Falb et al. (8Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and plated in density of 4 × 105 cells in 35-mm plates. Cells were transfected 24 h after plating in the presence of serum using FuGENE kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The neurons were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the empty vector (pBK-CMV) or with TCP-1δ gene (pBK-CMV-TCP-1δ). Transfections were carried out at a 1:10 ratio in favor of the TCP-1δ plasmid. Cultured sympathetic neurons treated with 300 μm DA for 12 h showed cell viability to be ∼80% (8Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Nardi N. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This concentration of DA is within the estimated range (0.1–1 mm) of its normal levels in dopaminergic neurons (31Lichtensteiger R.M. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1970; 1: 185-276Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Jonsson G. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1971; 2: 299-344Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Michel P.P. Hefti F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 428-435Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Subjecting treated and untreated neurons to DD yielded a large number of reproducible, differentially expressed genes that were either up- or down-regulated in response to DA treatment (Fig. 1 A). As deduced from the sequence shown in Fig. 1 B, the isolated gene is the chicken homologue of the mouse TCP-1δ subunit protein. Since homology of this fragment to TCP-1 is 78% on the DNA level and 91% on the protein level, we refer to this molecule as part of the chicken heat shock protein, or chicken chaperonin. Sequence comparison of the chick TCP-1δ subunit to other CCT subunits revealed a high degree of identity (30%). Computer analysis of the chick δ subunit (Fig. 2) disclosed five conserved regions that are shared by other subunits of TCP-1. The GDGTT sequence in the third region was previously recognized by Lewis et al. (34Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) to be homologous to a nucleotide phosphate binding domain of cAMP-dependent kinase and other members of this family. Another motif shared by numerous ATP/GTP-binding proteins is (G/A)XXXXGK(T/S). This sequence motif, LIKITGCTNPGKT, in the chick TCP-1δ subunit (amino acids 370–382) is generally referred to as the A consensus sequence or the P loop (35Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 36Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). It is thought to form a flexible loop between a β strand and an α helix that interacts with one phosphate group of the ATP/GTP. The sequence motif,RTSLGPKGMDKMI, which is found in the amino terminus of the chick TCP-1 protein (amino acid 46–58), is shared by other CCT-1 subunits (β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, and θ) and is referred to as the chaperonin TCP-1 signature. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the chick δ subunit to δ subunits of other species (human, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, and yeast) revealed a high degree of conservation (Fig. 3). The alignment of the peptide sequences from the different species shows that the above motifs (motifs 1 to 5) are highly conserved. The cloned TCP-1δ shows 94% similarity and 92% identity to the human TCP-1δ on the protein level. In addition, comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of our clone to HSP60 revealed that the above five motifs have homologous regions in the HSP60; the underlined amino acids in the legend to Fig. 2 are identical in the two proteins (TCP-1δ and HSP60), whereas the adjacent amino acids are conserved with similar properties (polarity and charge). The two proteins share overall 30% homology, especially at the carboxyl terminus. Alignment of the TCP-1δ subunit with HSP70 shows these proteins share no significant homology in the conserved regions.Figure 3Protein sequence alignment of chick TCP-1δ homologue with other species.Protein sequence alignment of the chick TCP-1δ homologue compared with human, mouse, C. elegans, and yeast proteins. Theboxes represent identical amino acids, and the gray areas show the conserved amino acids. The alignment was performed by SeqVu Software, Sydney, Australia. The GenBankTMaccession number of the organisms are as follows: human TCP-1 (P50991); mouse (P80315); C. elegans (P47208), and yeast (P39078) (see text for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The DD experiment and the subsequent Northern blot analysis with the DD fragment indicated that the δ subunit was up-regulated after 12 h of DA exposure (data not shown and Fig. 1). Exposure of sympathetic neurons to DA for different time periods revealed a single band of 1.9 kbp that showed elevated expression as a function of DA treatment (Fig.4 A). The level of TCP-1 transcript was elevated 3-fold after 1 h of DA treatment, 9-fold after 4 h, and fell to ∼7-fold after 6–12 h (Fig. 4 B). The levels of TCP-1δ subunit rose 3.6-fold after 1 h of DA treatment (Fig. 5,A and B), peaked at 7-fold from 4–6 h, and dropped to a 3-fold increase at 24 h. A similar set of experiments (data not shown) using total cellular rather than cytoplasmic proteins yielded similar induction in TCP-1δ levels, ruling out the possibility that DA causes changes in protein localization rather than up-regulation of TCP-1δ. A similar mode of induction in TCP-1δ levels was obtained after NGF deprivation (Fig. 5 C); the protein levels of TCP-1δ increased 2-fold after 24 h of NGF deprivation and fell slightly to 1.6-fold increase after 48 h. 0.5 to 2 μm TCP-1δ antisense did not reduce the TCP-1δ protein level, whereas 3 and 5 μm significantly reduced its level (Fig. 6 A). Identical concentrations of TCP-1δ sense had no effect on TCP-1δ levels. TCP-1δ level was reduced during the first 24 h after the addition of the antisense and rose slightly at 40 h. The same experiment conducted with the sense sequence (Fig.6 B) had n"
