https://openalex.org/W2084889756,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of heritable mental retardation and the leading identified cause of autism. FXS is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene that encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), but the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. According to one proposal, many psychiatric and neurological symptoms of FXS result from unchecked activation of mGluR5, a metabotropic glutamate receptor. To test this idea we generated Fmr1 mutant mice with a 50% reduction in mGluR5 expression and studied a range of phenotypes with relevance to the human disorder. Our results demonstrate that mGluR5 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease, a finding that has significant therapeutic implications for fragile X and related developmental disorders."

Syllabic rate corresponds to natural jaw-associated oscillatory rhythms, and phonemic length could reflect endogenous oscillatory auditory cortical properties. Hemispheric lateralization for speech could result from an asymmetry of cortical tuning, with left and right auditory areas differentially sensitive to spectro-temporal features of speech. Using simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from humans, we show that spontaneous EEG power variations within the gamma range (phonemic rate) correlate best with left auditory cortical synaptic activity, while fluctuations within the theta range correlate best with that in the right. Power fluctuations in both ranges correlate with activity in the mouth premotor region, indicating coupling between temporal properties of speech perception and production. These data show that endogenous cortical rhythms provide temporal and spatial constraints on the neuronal mechanisms underlying speech perception and production.

These data show that endogenous cortical rhythms provide temporal and spatial constraints on the neuronal mechanisms underlying speech perception and production. The evolution of spoken communication must have been constrained by neural mechanisms that were available for both perception and production (Liberman and Whalen, 2000Liberman A.M. Whalen D.H.

From manual gesture to speech: A gradual transition.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). As speaking and understanding must be compatible with the performance limits of both auditory and motor systems, several theories have linked functional properties of perceptual and motor systems to speech capability. On the motor side, Frame/Content (F/C) theory (MacNeilage and Davis, 2000MacNeilage P.F. Davis B.L. On the origin of internal structure of word forms.Science. 2000; 288: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, MacNeilage and Davis, 2001MacNeilage P.F. Davis B.L. Motor mechanisms in speech ontogeny: phylogenetic, neurobiological and linguistic implications.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) proposes that the features of elementary production units, i.e., syllables, are determined by mechanical properties of the speech apparatus, e.g., natural oscillatory rhythms. On the perceptual side, the Asymmetric Sampling in Time theory (AST; Poeppel, 2003Poeppel D. The analysis of speech in different temporal integration windows: cerebral lateralization as ‘asymmetric sampling in time’.Speech Commun. 2003; 41: 245-255Crossref Scopus (785) Google Scholar) proposes that auditory cortices preferentially sample at rates tuned to fundamental speech units. While the left auditory cortex would integrate auditory signals preferentially into ∼20–50 ms segments that correspond roughly to the phoneme length, the right auditory cortex would preferentially integrate over ∼100–300 ms and thus optimize sensitivity to slower acoustic modulations, e.g., voice and musical instrument periodicity, speech prosody, and musical rhythms (Schneider et al., 2005Schneider P.

Psychol. 2005; 56: 89-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Common to both theories is that they link speech processing to neural oscillations. Such oscillations could emerge in the context of input processing or output generation, in which case the associated neural activities would reflect the structure of speech. However, neural oscillations are abundant in ongoing spontaneous brain activity patterns that are unrelated to any specific input or output context. It therefore appears conceivable that oscillations at speech-relevant frequencies could constitute intrinsic properties of specialized brain structures, thus accounting for the fact that speech sounds the way it does. In this case, a hypothesis emerges that the strength or power of oscillations in speech-relevant frequency bands is linked to regional activity in areas specialized for speech perception and production, even in the absence of explicit speech perception and production. We tested the prediction of intrinsic coupling by studying the association between spontaneous modulations of power in appropriate frequency bands, as recorded by EEG, with local synaptic activity, as registered by simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We extracted the temporal modulation of spectral EEG information in a priori specified bands of interest (Laufs et al., 2003Laufs H. Krakow K. Sterzer P. Eger E. Beyerle A. Salek-Haddadi A. Kleinschmidt A. Electroencephalographic signatures of attentional and cognitive default modes in spontaneous brain activity fluctuations at rest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11053-11058Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, Laufs et al., 2006Laufs H. Kleinschmidt A. Beyerle A. Eger E. Salek-Haddadi A. Preibisch C. Krakow K. EEG-correlated fMRI of human alpha activity.Neuroimage. 2006; 31: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We convolved the power time courses in these bands with hemodynamic response properties and used the resulting regressors (see Figure S1 available online) to interrogate spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations for correlated local brain activity changes over time. Crucially, this approach involved no experimental modulation of auditory input, no perceptual task, and no speech output, thus revealing purely intrinsic coupling between specific spontaneous brain oscillatory frequencies and local brain activity levels. We determined the topographical distribution of spontaneous cortical activity modulations associated with each of the two temporal domains of interest for speech perception. The two integration windows correspond to (1) chunking into ∼20–50 ms segments—the narrower integration window—approximating 20–50 Hz EEG activity, and (2) chunking into ∼150–300 ms segments—the larger integration window—approximating 3–6 Hz EEG activity (Figure 1A). If different intrinsic cortical oscillation frequencies are associated with differential temporal analysis by right and left auditory cortices, long-term (measured over 40 min) fluctuations of EEG power in each band should correlate with auditory cortex activity changes, and the patterns should reflect hemispheric specialization even in the absence of speech input. Across the brain the most significant correlation of fMRI signal with 3–6 Hz power fluctuations occurred in superior temporal cortices. In keeping with AST, this effect is located in Heschl's gyrus in the right hemisphere (spatial coordinates in MNI standard space: 37 −28 14, Z = 11.2, Figure 1B), overlapping primary auditory cortex. In contrast, on the left, the effect occurs more rostrally/ventrally and thus not in colocalization with Heschl's gyrus. In both lateral and medial Heschl's gyri, we observed a significant right hemispheric advantage across subjects. In the next step, we tested the second central tenet of AST theory—that left auditory cortex, overlapping with Heschl's gyrus, is preferentially tuned to short acoustic segments. We analyzed fMRI signal fluctuations related to EEG power in the 28–40 Hz band. This band corresponds to 25–35 ms segments, and was chosen because of previous reports that left auditory cortex does not respond to acoustic segments shorter than 25 ms (Boemio et al., 2005Boemio A. Fromm S. Braun A. Poeppel D. Hierarchical and asymmetric temporal sensitivity in human auditory cortices.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). As predicted, we detected a significant correlation between EEG power fluctuation in this frequency band and synaptic activity, indexed by fMRI, in superior temporal cortices at the lateral/rostral edge of primary auditory cortex (Figure 2A), with a left/right asymmetry trend that was not significant across subjects. In keeping with the prediction of AST, we observed a double dissociation profile in lateral Heschl's gyrus with right hemisphere dominance for the 3–6 Hz band and a left hemisphere advantage for 28–40 Hz. Direct comparisons between bands indicated that 3–6 Hz EEG power correlated significantly more with activity in right Heschl's gyrus than did the 28–40 Hz band (48 −20 14, Z = 3.76). Because EEG power was overall greater in the 3–6 Hz than the 28–40 Hz band, the opposite contrast (28–40 Hz versus 3–6 Hz) resulted in no significant effects. However, correlation nearly reached significance just posterior to Heschl's gyrus in the left planum temporale (−48 −28 10, Z = 2.11). Analysis over five discontinuous frequency bands (3–6 Hz, 9–12 Hz, 15–18 Hz, 20–25 Hz, and 28–40 Hz) (Experiment 1) established the spectral specificity of the effects (Figure 2B). In lateral Heschl's gyrus, we found that positive correlations were restricted to our two bands of interest, with the exception of a right-lateralized effect at 9–12 Hz. This effect suggests that the slow window of integration may be a little larger than postulated, i.e., 100–300 ms instead of 150–300 ms as hypothesized. This difference is coherent with previous psychophysical and physiological observations, e.g., that speech becomes unintelligible when syllables become shorter than 100 ms. In other bands, and even for 9–12 Hz in left lateral Heschl's gyrus, neural activity correlated negatively with EEG fluctuations. Over the entire brain, we found a significant negative correlation between the 20–25 Hz band and neural activity in right auditory cortex, indicating greater activity whenever 20–25 Hz band power decreased (Laufs et al., 2003Laufs H. Krakow K. Sterzer P. Eger E. Beyerle A. Salek-Haddadi A. Kleinschmidt A.

EEG-correlated fMRI of human alpha activity.Neuroimage. 2006; 31: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This negative correlation at 20–25 Hz EEG may be due to desynchronization in frequencies below the 28–40 Hz band (Ross et al., 2005Ross B. Herdman A.T. Pantev C. Stimulus induced desynchronization of human auditory 40-Hz steady-state responses.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These control results emphasize the spectral selectivity of the correlations found and their congruence with the frequency bands hypothesized by AST. A second experiment (Experiment 2) performed in eight male subjects confirmed that correlation with 3–6 Hz spontaneous activity was more pronounced in right than left Heschl's gyrus, with the opposite profile for 28–40 Hz band activity. The topography was similar in both experiments (Figure 2C). Because we used a more conservative random-effects analysis for replication in this second experiment, activity in Heschl's gyrus was associated with lower Z scores than in the first (left Heschl Z = 2.99 [p < 0.05], right Heschl Z = 2.17 [p < 0.05] for 28–40 Hz; left Heschl Z = 1.90, right Heschl Z = 3.06 [p < 0.001] for 3–6 Hz). These statistical levels are acceptable for a hypothesis-driven volume of interest replication analysis. We extracted individual values within two cytoarchitectonic maps of auditory cortex, TE 1.1 and TE 1.2, which correspond to the medial and lateral parts of Heschl's gyrus, respectively. We confirmed global asymmetric profiles. Asymmetry was present in medial Heschl for 28–40 Hz (as a trend) and in lateral Heschl for 3–6 Hz (p = 0.051, Figure 2D). These quantitative results indicate that both rhythms are correlated with activity on both sides, with a trend for better correlation with the slower rhythm in right Heschl's gyrus and correlation with the faster rhythm in left. Finally, we address the hypothesis derived from the F/C theory of speech production (MacNeilage and Davis, 2000MacNeilage P.F. Davis B.L. On the origin of internal structure of word forms.Science. 2000; 288: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, MacNeilage and Davis, 2001MacNeilage P.F. Davis B.L.

Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that syllabic rhythms, i.e., those around 4 Hz, are related to intrinsic motor properties of the vocal apparatus. We found that power in the 3–6 Hz band was significantly correlated with synaptic activity in the inferior motor region, overlapping an area involved in generating mouth movements (Figure 3, left panel). We also found correlations between neural activity and EEG fluctuations in the 28–40 Hz band in an adjacent region located more ventrally, overlapping a region implicated in preparation of tongue movements. We detected no asymmetries in motor cortical activity in any EEG rhythm domain (Figure 4). The relative location of 3–6 Hz versus 28–40 Hz along the motor strip, with a slightly more dorsal location for syllabic (−56 −8 40, Z = 3.16) as compared with phonemic (−50 −6 36, Z = 4.02) rhythms, was replicated in Experiment 2 (Figure 3, right panel).Figure 4Correlations between EEG and Hemodynamic (fMRI) Fluctuations over the Whole BrainShow full captionHemodynamic correlates of 3–6 Hz (yellow, thresholded at Z = 7) and 28–40 Hz (blue, thresholded at Z = 3.5) band modulation of surface EEG during fMRI scanning. Different thresholds were used for each band as the energy in the 28–40 Hz band was lower than that in the 3–6 Hz band. This yielded a higher interindividual variability for the 28–40 Hz compared with the 3–6 Hz band (hence, lower overall statistical thresholds in group correlations).

Mean levels of EEG/fMRI correlations are indicated in middle row panels in three key regions for speech perception and production: (A) the anterior temporal cortex; (B) the mouth premotor region. In addition to the correlation of 3–6 Hz oscillations with right Heschl's gyrus activity, we found a relationship to neural activity in a more anterior and ventral region of the left temporal lobe. The effect was greater in the 3–6 Hz band than at higher frequency, and was more pronounced in the right cortex than the left cortex (Figure 4, plot A). This contrasts with the profile in auditory cortex near Heschl's gyrus, which showed a right dominance for that same 3–6 Hz band. Finally, both 3–6 Hz and 28–40 Hz rhythms correlated with neural activity in regions outside those directly related to speech comprehension and production. Both rhythms correlated with visual cortex activity and more dorsal/frontal parts of the premotor region. In the second experiment, 3–6 Hz rhythm was associated with significant activity of the left hippocampal gyrus (−40 −40 −12, Z = 3.35), which is consistent with many previous studies describing the hippocampus as a source of theta oscillations (Vertes, 2005Vertes H.P. Hippocampal theta rhythm: a tag for short-term memory.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In this study we tested whether functional brain asymmetries in speech processing could be accounted for by differential intrinsic sampling properties in each auditory cortex, as predicted by AST and earlier related models (Zatorre and Belin, 2001Zatorre R.J. Belin P. Spectral and temporal processing in human auditory cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). AST suggests that both primary auditory cortices sample with fine grain, but surrounding auditory areas chunk the initial input with different temporal windows, a narrow one in the left hemisphere and a broader one in the right. On the left, integration of auditory signals into ∼20–50 ms segments optimally resolves the fine acoustic structure critical for phonetic contrast perception in speech (Rosen, 1992Rosen S. Temporal information in speech: acoustic, auditory and linguistic aspects.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 336: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Such differential functionality could underpin left hemispheric phonemic-level speech processing (Scott and Johnsrude, 2003Scott S.K. Johnsrude I.S. The neuroanatomical and functional organization of speech perception.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, Friederici and Alter, 2004Friederici A.D. Alter K. Lateralization of auditory language functions: a dynamic dual pathway model.Brain Lang. 2004; 89: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Integration into ∼100–300 ms segments in right auditory cortex optimizes extraction of slow information, thus promoting processing of periodicity, voice, prosody, and music (Schneider et al., 2005Schneider P. Sluming V. Roberts N. Scherg M. Goebel R. Specht H.J. Dosch H.G. Bleeck S. Stippich C. Rupp A. Structural and functional asymmetry of lateral Heschl's gyrus reflects pitch perception preference.Nat.

Psychol. 2005; 56: 89-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In agreement with the AST, slow fluctuations in 3–6 Hz EEG rhythms correlated most strongly with spontaneous neural activity in the right auditory region, while higher-frequency fluctuations in the 28–40 Hz range showed left hemispheric predominance. In both experiments, EEG power was not equal in the two bands of interest; power was higher for theta than gamma in the first and higher for gamma than theta in the second experiment. Despite such differential sensitivity, which prevents direct comparisons across bands, we replicated a double dissociation profile with higher 3–6 Hz-associated brain activity in right than left auditory cortex and higher 28–40 Hz-associated activity in left than right auditory cortex. Our results agree with previous fMRI data showing that the right superior temporal region responds more than the left to 100–300 ms acoustic segments (Boemio et al., 2005Boemio A. Fromm S. Braun A. Poeppel D. Hierarchical and asymmetric temporal sensitivity in human auditory cortices.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This latter finding in itself can be accounted for by stimulus- or task-related auditory functional asymmetries. Such an account would not hold for our findings here because our results relate functional asymmetries to local intrinsic neuronal properties. We explicitly avoided stimulus- and task-driven confounds by assessing spontaneous activity fluctuations during 40 min. of continuous acoustic input uncorrelated with the target phonemic and syllable-related frequencies (see Experimental Procedures). This refinement is critical as in this setting our results indicate asymmetric implementation of auditory sampling via distinct intrinsic oscillation rates in separate neuronal populations. The inference is that there are hard primary physiological constraints at the level of temporal integration of auditory signals. Thus, we reinterpret previous results (including those of Boemio et al., 2005Boemio A. Fromm S. Braun A. Poeppel D. Hierarchical and asymmetric temporal sensitivity in human auditory cortices.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) by relating stimulus-associated tuning to the temporal structure of spontaneous activity in speech-processing brain regions. Our findings are in accord with micro-anatomical descriptions of lateralized features of the auditory cortices. Left auditory and language-associated regions contain a greater number of large pyramidal cells (Hutsler and Galuske, 2003Hutsler J. Galuske R.A. Hemispheric asymmetries in cerebral cortical networks.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) that typically display fast rhythmic bursting at gamma rates (Gray and McCormick, 1996Gray C.M. McCormick D.A. Chattering cells: superficial pyramidal neurons contributing to the generation of synchronous oscillations in the visual cortex.Science. 1996; 274: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, Traub et al., 2003Traub R.D. Buhl E.H. Gloveli T. Whittington M.A. Fast rhythmic bursting can be induced in layer 2/3 cortical neurons by enhancing persistent Na+ conductance or by blocking BK channels.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 909-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Conversely, there are a greater proportion of smaller pyramidal cells in the right auditory cortex. Both macro-anatomical (Dorsaint-Pierre et al., 2006Dorsaint-Pierre R. Penhune V.B. Watkins K.E. Neelin P. Lerch J.P. Bouffard M. Zatorre R.J.

Our results speak to a neural implementation of two discontinuous auditory integration windows, each tuned to critical temporal units of speech. Across five discontinuous frequency bands, used as multiple regressors to interrogate the fMRI time series, only power in the two bands of interest showed a positive correlation with neural activity in auditory cortices. An essential aspect of a sensory analysis scheme involving multiple timescales is discontinuity in structural properties. Our results therefore indicate that multiple timescale auditory analysis is implemented by a spatial right-left dissociation and a structural high-frequency/low-frequency dissociation operating in a single cortical site, as predicted by AST theory (Figure 2D). The frequency bands posited by AST overlap common EEG band boundary definitions, i.e., theta (4–7 Hz) and gamma (30–50 Hz), but are not identical to them, despite previous suggestions to the contrary (Boemio et al., 2005Boemio A. Fromm S. Braun A. Poeppel D. Hierarchical and asymmetric temporal sensitivity in human auditory cortices.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Our results do not relate to classical auditory evoked events (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K. Fries P. Singer W. Dynamic predictions: oscillations and synchrony in top-down processing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar), as they are grounded in an analysis of spontaneous EEG fluctuations measured continuously on a long timescale (two 20 min sessions) that describe long-range activity relationships between distant neuronal populations (Mukamel et al., 2005Mukamel R. Gelbard H. Arieli A. Hasson U. Fried I. Malach R. Coupling between neuronal firing, field potentials, and FMRI in human auditory cortex.Science. 2005; 309: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). This intrinsic functional design remains compatible with an additional influence from stimulus-driven adaptive mechanisms, e.g., gliding integration mechanisms, that tune or reset integration windows via sensory input within the two frequency domains we identify (White and Plack, 1998White L.J.

Poeppel D. Phase patterns of neuronal responses reliably discriminate speech in human auditory cortex.Neuron. 2007; 54: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Activity in the left anterior temporal cortex also correlated positively with 3–6 Hz EEG fluctuations. However, unlike the 3–6 Hz activity in auditory cortex near Heschl's gyrus, this more anterior effect had a left dominance (Figure 4, plot A). The location and physiological profile of this effect was not predicated by AST theory but may be relevant to it. While 3–6 Hz is the preferred primary sampling frequency of right auditory cortex, the same band might also function as a higher-order temporal integrator of shorter auditory segments in left temporal cortex. In support of this idea is the fact that speech remains intelligible if segmented into reversed chunks of up to 100 ms in duration (Saberi and Perrott, 1999Saberi K. Perrott D.R. Cognitive restoration of reversed speech.Nature. 1999; 398: 760Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggesting that a large temporal window plays a supra-segmental integrative role in speech comprehension. Our hypothesis that 3–6 Hz activity reflects a second-order left temporal cortical mechanism (Freeman and Holmes, 2005Freeman W.J. Holmes M.D. Metastability, instability, and state transition in neocortex.Neural Netw. 2005; 18: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Canolty et al., 2006Canolty R.T. Edwards E.

High gamma power is phase-locked to theta oscillations in human neocortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1626-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) is supported by the finding of a (primary) left-sided sampling mechanism at higher frequency overlapping with Heschl's gyrus, i.e., in a region closer to primary auditory cortex. Thus, in addition to a right-left dissociation for the two frequency windows, we find a posterior/anterior spatial distribution of the two frequency bands in left temporal cortex, with a primary fast sampling mechanism in or near left primary auditory cortex and a slower integrative mechanism in a more anterior region. This latter mechanism may function to concatenate the segmented output from left auditory cortex, transforming it into symbolic speech units. In accord with this formulation, the anterior temporal region contains topographically organized maps of vowels and syllables (Rauschecker and Tian, 2000Rauschecker J.P. Tian B.

In support of this notion, we observe that both 3–6 Hz and 28–40 Hz frequency domains correlate with neural activity in both auditory and premotor cortices. The 3–6 Hz band power in the lower part of the motor cortex offers a direct neural underpinning for the F/C theory of speech that assumes syllables are phylogenetically and ontogenetically determined by natural mandibular cycles occurring at about 4 Hz. We show that spontaneous neural oscillations at this frequency, i.e., the dominant syllabic rate, are associated with cortical activity in regions underpinning both speech perception and production. Furthermore, we find in two independent data sets that the 28–40 Hz band correlates with a peak of activation in a slightly more ventral location than the 3–6 Hz band, in a region that controls movements of the tongue (Figure 3). As tongue positioning is critical to articulation and discriminates between consonant families in speech production, it is conceivable that the auditory system has adapted its sensitivity to natural constraints imposed by the articulatory motor system. In keeping with symmetrical speech motor commands, we found no consistent right/left asymmetries in motor regions (Figure 4), although the distribution of 3–6 Hz band activity was more rostral in the left hemisphere and colocalized in part with Broca's area. Selective rhythmic activity in the premotor region is compatible with the view that articulatory movements may be the primary promotors of language (Liberman and Whalen, 2000Liberman A.M. Whalen D.H. On the relation of speech to language.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2000; 4: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Together, our findings support, refine, and extend theories linking speech regularities to spontaneous oscillatory properties of brain systems for speech perception and production. In relation to AST theory, we show that (1) spontaneous power fluctuations of 3–6 Hz and 28–40 Hz intrinsic oscillations are paralleled by specific modulations of neural activity in auditory/temporal cortices; and (2) auditory activity in regions overlapping Heschl's gyrus is more prominently associated with the 3–6 Hz band in the right hemisphere and the 28–40 Hz band in the left. With respect to F/C theory, we show that ventral premotor cortex activity is correlated with spontaneous neural oscillations at the syllabic rate of natural speech. These results suggest that basic neuronal constraints on auditory processing and motor output, including hemispheric specialization, parallel major acoustic temporal characteristics of speech. They emphasize the role of common cortical oscillatory frequency bands for speech production and perception and thus provide a brain-based account for the phylogenetic emergence and shaping of speech from available neural substrates. Twenty healthy subjects underwent simultaneous EEG and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during eyes-closed rest. All subjects wore ear defenders to attenuate scanner noise, and were requested to stay awake and avoid movement. Twelve of them (six male and six female subjects, age range 26–35, median 31.5 years) participated in a first experiment consisting of, in two successive 20 min sessions, EEG (BrainAmp MR, Brainproducts, Munich, Germany) recorded using a 32 channel EEG cap (Falk Minow Services, Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany) including an ECG electrode. In each session, 300 echoplanar fMRI image volumes were acquired on a 1.5 T Magnetom Vision (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) consisting of 19 contiguous transverse slices covering almost the entire cerebrum (echo time 50 ms, voxel size 3.44 × 3.44 × 4 mm3, 1 mm interslice gap). Time of acquisition for a single volume was 2.8 s followed by a 1.2 s gap before acquisition of the next, yielding a 4 s TR. Session data were discarded if wakefulness could not be maintained, which resulted in 18 sessions available for analysis. A replication experiment was run on eight male subjects (age range 25–35, median 29.6 years) on a 3T Siemens Trio (1000 EPI volumes each, TR/TE = 2 s/30 ms, 64 × 64, FOV 192 mm, 33 slices of 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 plus 1 mm interslice gap, no pause between volumes). EEG was recorded simultaneously as described above, with wires guided in the z axis to the digitizer inside the bore, which operated time-locked with the scanner clock and hence improved artifact reduction and resulted in higher EEG quality (Mandelkow et al., 2006Mandelkow H. Halder P. Boesiger P. Brandeis D. Synchronization facilitates removal of MRI artefacts from concurrent EEG recordings and increases usable bandwidth.Neuroimage. 2006; 32: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Acoustic input was analyzed by spectro-temporal analysis of MRI scanner noise. The scanner produced a constant auditory input during data acquisition corresponding roughly to white noise (0 to 6 kHz) modulated at TR rate, with a second major modulation corresponding to the number of slices per volume (Figure S2 for scanner noise-detailed analysis in Experiment 2). None of the temporal modulations present in the scanner noise spectrally overlapped with our bands of interests (3–6 Hz, 28–40 Hz), ruling out possible interference between input (noise in delta and alpha bands), output (cortical oscillations in theta and gamma bands), and rhythmic activity driven by scanner noise. Both data sets were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) for spatial preprocessing, including realignment, normalization, and smoothing (10 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian Kernel) to facilitate a group analysis. After imaging and pulse artifact subtraction (Vision Analyzer, Brainproducts), we used a short time Fourier Transform (frequency/temporal resolution of 1 Hz/s, moving average with 33% overlap, MATLAB, Mathworks, Inc., Sherborn, MA) to calculate power time courses for 3–6, 9–12, 15–18, 20–25, and 28–40 Hz for the fronto-central electrode (equidistant to the temporal lobes) referenced to the mean of the two occipital electrodes (i.e., most distant position). Although this setting is not optimal for measuring responses in auditory cortices, it was considered essential to avoid any lateralizing bias in the EEG signal used to analyze the fMRI data. The effects observed in auditory cortices with this choice of electrode were separately confirmed using independent signals from temporal electrodes. Time courses of power in the aforementioned EEG bands were convolved with the hemodynamic response function (Figure S1), downsampled to the middle of each image volume acquisition, and then used as regressors in a general linear model (using SPM). Parameters obtained from realignment were modeled as confounds to account for subject motion effects. Statistical inferences were performed via group t tests for the bands of interest. Modeling the 9–12 and 15–18 Hz frequency bands of no interest (in this study) served to control for non-band-specific power changes (e.g., those caused by artifacts) and to explain variance in the data associated with other brain processes (Laufs et al., 2006Laufs H.

We report fixed-effects statistics for the first study (for exploratory purposes). The second data set was analyzed using second-level random-effects statistics based on the individuals' contrast images, and performed by means of a voxel-wise t test (Friston et al., 1999Friston K.J.

Now we demonstrate that KCC2, independently of its Cl− transport function, is a key factor in the maturation of dendritic spines. This morphogenic role of KCC2 in the development of excitatory synapses is mediated by structural interactions between KCC2 and the spine cytoskeleton. Here, the binding of KCC2 C-terminal domain to the cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1N may play an important role. A more general conclusion based on our data is that KCC2 acts as a synchronizing factor in the functional development of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in cortical neurons and networks."

Individual hippocampal neurons exhibit intrinsic membrane potential oscillations and intrinsic resonance in the theta frequency range. We found that the subthreshold resonance frequency of CA1 pyramidal neurons was location dependent, varying more than 3-fold between the soma and the distal dendrites. Furthermore, activity- and NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term plasticity increased this resonance frequency through changes in h channel properties. The increase in resonance frequency and an associated reduction in excitability were nearly identical in the soma and the first 300 μm of the apical dendrites. These spatially widespread changes accompanying long-term synaptic potentiation also reduced the neuron's ability to elicit spikes evoked through a nonpotentiated synaptic pathway. Our results suggest that the frequency response of these neurons depends on the dendritic location of their inputs and that activity can regulate their response dynamics within an oscillating neural network.

NMDA-type glutamate receptors and persistent sodium (NaP) channels have been suggested to act as amplifying conductances, while the M-type K+ and hyperpolarization-activated h conductances act as resonating conductances (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J.

Yu H.W. Theta-frequency resonance in hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro demonstrated by sinusoidal current injection.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1592-1596PubMed Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, MPOs during the waking state are in the theta frequency range of 3–10 Hz (Buzsaki, 2002Buzsaki G.

While theta oscillations in hippocampus are due to network interactions among pyramidal and interneurons, it is also clear that individual neurons are capable of sustaining intrinsic oscillations and that the intrinsic properties of these neurons play a prominent role in the network behavior (Buzsaki, 2002Buzsaki G. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2002; 33: 325-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, Leung and Yim, 1991Leung L.W. Yim C.Y.

Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (Leung and Yu, 1998Leung L.S. Yu H.W.

Yim C.Y. Intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in hippocampal neurons in vitro.Brain Res. 1991; 553: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These neurons are endowed with the two resonating currents, Ih and IM, mediating resonance at hyperpolarized and depolarized voltages, respectively, with INaP acting as a putative amplifying current (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J.

Intrinsic membrane potential oscillations in hippocampal neurons in vitro.Brain Res. 1991; 553: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the intrinsic subthreshold membrane resonance of CA1 pyramidal neurons and found that it was not a fixed property but instead was highly variable depending on the membrane potential, spatial location in the dendrites, and activity. The frequency of the intrinsic resonance varied more than 3-fold between the soma and distal regions of the dendrites and was in accordance with the reported change in h-channel density (Lorincz et al., 2002Lorincz A. Notomi T. Tamas G. Shigemoto R. Nusser Z. Polarized and compartment-dependent distribution of HCN1 in pyramidal cell dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of activity-dependent, long-term plasticity increased the resonant frequency and reduced input resistance by similar amounts in the dendrites on the apical trunk within stratum radiatum. Surprisingly, in striking contrast to the localized nature of changes in the A-type potassium current (Frick et al., 2004Frick A. Magee J. Johnston D. LTP is accompanied by an enhanced local excitability of pyramidal neuron dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we found that this plasticity is spatially widespread even when it accompanies pathway-specific long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Employing computational analyses, we argue that such spatially widespread changes in resonance frequency and input resistance cannot be realized through locally confined changes in Ih, but require changes in h-channel properties to span a broad region of the dendritic tree. Our results suggest that these neurons can act as stimulus-dependent matched filters for spatially separated inputs, regulated by prior history of activity converging onto the neuron. Further, this spatially widespread expression of plasticity supports the role for Ih as a homeostatic mechanism counterbalancing the positive feedback associated with Hebbian plasticity (Bienenstock et al., 1982Bienenstock E.L. Cooper L.N. Munro P.W. Theory for the development of neuron selectivity: orientation specificity and binocular interaction in visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 32-48PubMed Google Scholar, Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Hebb and homeostasis in neuronal plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Resonance is the increase in the amplitude of oscillations of a system exposed to a periodic force whose frequency is equal to or very close to the natural frequency of the system. In neurons, this natural frequency corresponds to that of membrane potential oscillations (MPOs) and can be measured as the frequency at which the neuron elicits the maximal voltage response to sinusoidal current injections of various frequencies. Alternately, a sinusoidal current stimulus of constant amplitude, with frequency linearly spanning a given range over time, can be used as a tool to measure resonance properties of a neuron. Such a sinusoid has been termed a ZAP stimulus, which stands as an acronym for impedance amplitude profile (see Figure S1 available online) (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000Hutcheon B. Yarom Y. Resonance, oscillation and the intrinsic frequency preferences of neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 216-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In this study, we use the ZAP stimulus to characterize and assess plasticity in intrinsic membrane resonance of soma and dendrites in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Subthreshold resonance depends on h channels (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 783-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and h-channel density in apical dendrites increases with distance from the soma (Lorincz et al., 2002Lorincz A. Notomi T. Tamas G. Shigemoto R. Nusser Z. Polarized and compartment-dependent distribution of HCN1 in pyramidal cell dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether this translates to location-dependence of resonance properties in the dendrites. We obtained responses of the soma and the dendrites to the ZAP20 current stimulus (Figure S1A). Our results, binned into six different distances and measured at five different subthreshold voltages, show that, irrespective of distance from the soma, resonance frequency, fR (in the voltage range −75 mV to −55 mV), increased monotonically with hyperpolarization (Figure 1B; e.g., Soma: 1.78 ± 0.21 Hz at −55mV to 4.92 ± 0.44 Hz at −75 mV; 300 μm: 3.63 ± 1.28 Hz at −55 mV to 11.10 ± 0.1 Hz at −75 mV). However, fR in the dendrites increased considerably with increasing distance from the soma (Figure 1C). fR at −65 mV varied from about 3 Hz in the soma to 9 Hz in a dendrite 300 μm from the soma. A single exponential was used to fit the experimental fR versus distance curves with a τ of about 75 μm, although sigmoidal functions could also be used (Figure S2A), especially because, at rest, dendritic fR does not change much up to around 250 μm from the soma, while displaying a steep increase beyond that (Figures S2A and S2B). Resonance strength (Q) also increased with hyperpolarization (Figure 1D) and with distance from the soma (Figure 1E). Consistent with previous studies (Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), input resistance (R¯in) decreased with hyperpolarization (Figure 1F) and with distance from soma (Figure 1G). Although the density of h channels (Lorincz et al., 2002Lorincz A. Notomi T. Tamas G. Shigemoto R. Nusser Z. Polarized and compartment-dependent distribution of HCN1 in pyramidal cell dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resonance properties increase with distance from the soma, we tested directly whether fR, in fact, depended on Ih. We pretreated slices for 5 min with 100 μM ZD7288 and assessed resonance properties (Figure S3) at various locations along the somato-apical trunk (Figure 2A), without adding ZD7288 to the recording solutions. We found that fR, along the entire measured range of voltages and distances, was below 1 Hz (Figures 2B and 2C), suggesting that blocking Ih abolished resonance in the subthreshold voltage range. This was corroborated by measurements of Q, all of which were just above the theoretical minimum of unity across the measured voltage range (Figure 2D) and distance (Figure 2E). There was a reduction in R¯in with hyperpolarization (Figure 2F), although it remained almost constant as a function of distance (Figure 2G). Pretreatment with 20 μM ZD7288 led to identical results with respect to all parameters (data not shown). Resonance observed at more depolarized voltages has been reported to be mediated by IM (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 783-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We thus tested the effects of carbachol on membrane resonance and found that it blocked resonance at depolarized potentials but had little effect on resonance at hyperpolarized potentials (Figure S4), consistent with CA1 neurons exhibiting two forms of resonance (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K. Storm J.F. Two forms of electrical resonance at theta frequencies, generated by M-current, h-current and persistent Na+ current in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 783-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated in CA1 pyramidal neurons that theta-burst firing (TBF) results in a reduction of excitability through increases in Ih (Fan et al., 2005Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Activity-dependent decrease of excitability in rat hippocampal neurons through increases in Ih.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Based on the results shown above, we postulated that an activity-dependent increase in Ih should also lead to increases in both fR and Q. To test this directly, we induced activity-dependent plasticity in Ih using the TBF protocol (Fan et al., 2005Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Activity-dependent decrease of excitability in rat hippocampal neurons through increases in Ih.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and measured resonance properties through the course of the experiment (Figure 3). Typical somatic responses to the ZAP15 stimulus (Figure S5B) before and 40 min after TBF illustrate an increase in fR (Figures 3B and 3C). When the experiment was repeated over a number of cells, there was a significant increase in fR (Figure 3D) accompanied by a significant reduction in Rin (Figure S5). Consistent with earlier observations (Fan et al., 2005Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Activity-dependent decrease of excitability in rat hippocampal neurons through increases in Ih.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), there was also a significant 3.25 mV depolarizing shift in resting membrane potential (RMP, p < 0.001). Because previous results demonstrate that the TBF-induced plasticity in excitability is dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors (Fan et al., 2005Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Activity-dependent decrease of excitability in rat hippocampal neurons through increases in Ih.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we tested whether the plasticity in resonance properties was also dependent on these receptors. We found that bath application of the NMDAR antagonists suppressed all TBF-induced changes, which were depolarization of the RMP, increases in fR (Figures 3E and 3H), percentage sag, and Q (Figure 3I), and reductions in R¯in (Figure 3F) and firing frequency (Figure S5). Changes in fR and R¯in were strongly correlated (Figure 3G), suggesting a common mechanism underlying changes in both the parameters; in contrast, changes during the experiments with NMDAR antagonists hovered around their respective baselines (Figure 3G). Although TBF induced plasticity in excitability and resonance as measured at the soma (Figure 3), it is not known whether this extends to plasticity in dendrites. A direct way to address this is to measure changes in excitability and resonance across the dendritic tree, using plasticity induced through TBF of axo-somatically initiated action potentials driven by antidromic stimulation (Frick et al., 2004Frick A. Magee J. Johnston D. LTP is accompanied by an enhanced local excitability of pyramidal neuron dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We refer to this form of theta-burst firing through antidromic stimulation as antidromic TBF, or ATBF (Figure S6B). Following ATBF, there was a significant depolarizing shift in the RMP of ∼3 mV at all locations measured. The time courses of reduction in R¯in (Figure 4B) and increase in fR (Figure 4C) were nearly identical at all three locations along the somato-apical trunk. The changes in fR and R¯in were strongly correlated for all three locations (Figure 4D), again suggesting a possible common mechanism underlying changes in both the parameters across the dendritic tree. Further, the percentage of changes in all measured parameters were nearly identical for all locations in the dendrites (Figure 4E). Finally, the reduction in Rin also translated into a reduction in firing frequency of action potentials elicited in response to a range of local current injections and was observed in all three locations (Figures 4F–4I). Together, these suggest that activity-dependent plasticity in excitability and resonance were nearly identical across the somato-apical trunk. Because there have been reports of localized changes in certain ion channels accompanying LTP (Frick et al., 2004Frick A. Magee J. Johnston D. LTP is accompanied by an enhanced local excitability of pyramidal neuron dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2007Kim J. Jung S.C. Clemens A.M. Petralia R.S. Hoffman D.A. Regulation of dendritic excitability by activity-dependent trafficking of the A-type K+ channel subunit Kv4.2 in hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2007; 54: 933-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we asked whether plasticity evoked by theta-burst firing pattern would remain spatially widespread (Figure 4) if this pattern is paired with orthodromic stimulation to induce LTP. A direct way to address this is to measure changes in excitability and resonance across the dendritic tree, using plasticity induced through pairing of antidromic stimulation with orthodromic stimulation (Frick et al., 2004Frick A. Magee J. Johnston D. LTP is accompanied by an enhanced local excitability of pyramidal neuron dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We refer to this form of theta-burst pairing (TBP) involving antidromic stimulation as antidromic TBP, or ATBP (Figure S7B). ATBP led to robust LTP as measured across the somato-apical trunk (Figure 5B). Further, all the changes that were observed with ATBF (Figure 4) were also obtained with ATBP (Figure 5). Specifically, across the somato-apical trunk, an ∼3 mV shift in RMP, a near-identical reduction in R¯in (Figure 5C), a near-identical increase in fR (Figure 5D), correlated time courses of R¯in and fR (Figure 5E), increases in Q and sag (Figure 5F), and a reduction in action potential firing frequency (Figures 5G–5I) were observed with ATBP as well. Thus, LTP-associated plasticity in resonance and excitability were spatially widespread. We next performed experiments to test whether temporal summation, a physiological measurement modulated by Ih (Magee, 1998Magee J.C. Dendritic hyperpolarization-activated currents modify the integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also undergoes nonlocal plasticity with LTP. First, we found that temporal summation was reduced across the dendritic tree by recording α-EPSP summation at various locations along the somato-apical trunk before and after ATBP (Figures 6A–6C). Second, we performed two-pathway LTP experiments (Figures 6D–6F) and showed that, while LTP was pathway specific (Frick et al., 2004Frick A. Magee J. Johnston D. LTP is accompanied by an enhanced local excitability of pyramidal neuron dendrites.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), temporal summation of evoked EPSPs on the non-LTP pathway reduced after TBP (Figures 6G and 6H). We also showed that the number of spikes evoked through temporal summation was reduced after TBP (Figures 6I and 6J), confirming with α-EPSP summation that these changes in evoked summation were due to changes in postsynaptic components (Figures 6G–6J). Thus, even though LTP induced through TBP was local and input specific, the associated reduction in temporal summation and evoked action potentials was not local. Although the results described above strongly support a role for Ih in subthreshold resonance, the data did not address whether there is a direct, graded relationship between h conductance and resonance properties. To assess this, we constructed a simple, single-compartment model with Ih as the only active current (Figure S11). When the maximal density of h conductance, g¯h, was set to zero, the response of the model (Figure 7A; g¯h = 0 μS/cm2) to the ZAP20 stimulus (Figure S1A) resembled that obtained experimentally with ZD7288 (Figure 2 and Figure S3A). The corresponding impedance amplitude profile (Figure 7B; g¯h = 0 μS/cm2), with its peak around zero frequency, also was similar to the one obtained with ZD7288 (Figure S3B). This is to be expected, because without Ih, the model acts as a passive, parallel resistor-capacitor circuit. When g¯h was increased (Figure 7A), the impedance amplitude peak shifted toward nonzero frequency values (Figure 7B), confirming that Ih is a resonating conductance (Hu et al., 2002Hu H. Vervaeke K.

https://openalex.org/W2078738195,"Background To replicate, lentiviruses such as HIV must integrate DNA copies of their RNA genomes into host cell chromosomes. Lentiviral integration is favored in active transcription units, which allows efficient viral gene expression after integration, but the mechanisms directing integration targeting are incompletely understood. A cellular protein, PSIP1/LEDGF/p75, binds tightly to the lentiviral-encoded integrase protein (IN), and has been reported to be important for HIV infectivity and integration targeting. Methodology Here we report studies of lentiviral integration targeting in 1) human cells with intensified RNAi knockdowns of PSIP1/LEDGF/p75, and 2) murine cells with homozygous gene trap mutations in the PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 locus. Infections with vectors derived from equine infections anemia virus (EIAV) and HIV were compared. Integration acceptor sites were analyzed by DNA bar coding and pyrosequencing. Conclusions/Significance In both PSIP1/LEDGF/p75-depleted cell lines, reductions were seen in lentiviral infectivity compared to controls. For the human cells, integration was reduced in transcription units in the knockdowns, and this reduction was greater than in our previous studies of human cells less completely depleted for PSIP1/LEDGF/p75. For the homozygous mutant mouse cells, similar reductions in integration in transcription units were seen, paralleling a previous study of a different mutant mouse line. Integration did not become random, however–integration in transcription units in both cell types was still favored, though to a reduced degree. New trends also appeared, including favored integration near CpG islands. In addition, we carried out a bioinformatic study of 15 HIV integration site data sets in different cell types, which showed that the frequency of integration in transcription units was correlated with the cell-type specific levels of PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1992965882,"HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated cation channels act as an inhibitory constraint of both spatial learning and synaptic integration and long-term plasticity in the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, as HCN1 channels provide an excitatory current, the mechanism of their inhibitory action remains unclear. Here we report that HCN1 channels also constrain CA1 distal dendritic Ca2+ spikes, which have been implicated in the induction of LTP at distal excitatory synapses. Our experimental and computational results indicate that HCN1 channels provide both an active shunt conductance that decreases the temporal integration of distal EPSPs and a tonic depolarizing current that increases resting inactivation of T-type and N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which contribute to the Ca2+ spikes. This dual mechanism may provide a general means by which HCN channels regulate dendritic excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2018883072,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death worldwide due to an infectious agent. Data have accumulated over decades suggesting that variability in human susceptibility to TB disease has a genetic component. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in initiating the innate immune response to many pathogens in mouse models, but little is known about their role in human infections. Human TLRs have been reported to recognize mycobacterial antigens and initiate an immune response. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid-altering polymorphisms in five TLRs were associated with susceptibility to TB disease using a population-based case-control study with 1,312 adult TB patients and controls. Full-coding region sequencing of the five TLR genes in all 1,312 subjects yielded a data set in excess of 16 Mb. Rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms in TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 were significantly overrepresented among African-American TB cases compared with ethnically-matched control subjects. Common nonsynonymous polymorphisms in TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 also were significantly associated with TB disease in certain ethnic groups. Among African Americans, homozygotes for the common-variant haplotype TLR1-248S, TLR1-602I, and TLR6-249S had a significantly increased TB disease risk. A transmission/disequilibrium test on an independent sample found that the TLR1-248S variant was preferentially transmitted to diseased children, thereby confirming disease association. These results are consistent with recent reports implicating TLR1 variants, including TLR1-602, in significantly altered innate immune responses. Also consistent with disease association, rare TLR6 variants were defective in their ability to mediate NF-kappaB signal transduction in transfected human cells. Taken together, the data suggest that variant TLRs contribute to human susceptibility to TB disease. Extensive full-exon resequencing was critical for revealing new information about the role of TLRs in human-pathogen interactions and the genetic basis of innate immune function."

Our results provide molecular insights for understanding the role of cell-adhesion proteins in synapse function. Synapses are asymmetric cell-cell junctions that mediate communication between neurons. The formation of an initial synaptic contact is followed either by the maturation or by the elimination of the synapse, depending on the synaptic activity it experiences. Synapse specification and validation is critical for normal functioning of the brain, and impairments in synapse development are thought to be a major cause of brain disorders such as autism and mental retardation (Garber, 2007Garber K. Neuroscience. Autism's cause may reside in abnormalities at the synapse.Science. 2007; 317: 190-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neuroligins (NLs) are transmembrane proteins on the postsynaptic cell surface (Ichtchenko et al., 1995Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C.

They were discovered as ligands (or receptors) for neurexins (Nrxs), which are synaptic cell adhesion proteins on the presynaptic cell surface (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G.

The extracellular domains of NLs and neurexins interact in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Nguyen and Sudhof, 1997Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C.

These observations led to the hypothesis that NL and Nrx act as transneuronal signals for the recruitment of synaptic components and might be involved in initial synapse formation in vivo (Dean and Dresbach, 2006Dean C.

However, results from knockout (KO) mice revealed that neither NLs nor Nrxs are required for the initial synapse formation in vivo as no defects in the synapse numbers were observed in the KO mice (Missler et al., 2003Missler M.

On the other hand, NL and Nrx were found to be critical for synapse function and mouse survival. Further studies showed that NLs do not establish, but specify and validate, synapses via an activity-dependent mechanism, probably by determining whether a synapse will be excitatory or inhibitory, stable or transient, facilitating or depressing (Chubykin et al., 2007Chubykin A.A.

Indeed, physiological experiments with NL1 and neuroligin-2 (NL2) KO mice in combination with overexpression experiments showed that NL1 and NL2 selectively act on excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively, to validate synapses (Chubykin et al., 2007Chubykin A.A.

The identification of autistic patients with either NL or Nrx mutations suggested that the NL/Nrx interaction and its downstream signaling pathways might be disrupted in autism disorders. Consistent with this notion, mutations in Shank3, a postsynaptic scaffolding molecule that indirectly interacts with NLs, were also found in autism spectrum disorders (Durand et al., 2007Durand C.M.

NLs are type-I membrane proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa, predicted to have a single transmembrane helix. Their extracellular region consists of a single esterase domain that is enzymatically inactive. Although the NL-esterase domain has 34% sequence identity to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Sussman et al., 1991Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I.

Three Nrx genes are present in humans and rodents, with each gene producing longer α- and shorter β-neurexins (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Neurexins: synaptic cell surface proteins related to the alpha-latrotoxin receptor and laminin.Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The extracellular sequences of β-Nrxs are largely composed of a single laminin/neurexin/sex hormone binding globulin (LNS) domain, whereas the extracellular sequences of α-Nrxs contains six LNS domains and additionally include three epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains (Missler et al., 1998Missler M. Fernandez-Chacon R. Sudhof T.C. The making of neurexins.J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The LNS domain of β-Nrxs corresponds to the sixth LNS domain of α-Nrxs, and its structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.6 Å resolution (Rudenko et al., 1999Rudenko G. Nguyen T. Chelliah Y. Sudhof T.C. Deisenhofer J.

The extracellular esterase domains of NLs interact with α- and β-Nrxs in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Alternative splicing of site A and site B in NLs strongly modulates their affinity for α- and β-Nrxs (Comoletti et al., 2003Comoletti D. Flynn R. Jennings L.L. Chubykin A. Matsumura T. Hasegawa H.

Likewise, extensive alternative splicing occurs in neurexins as well, and insertion of an insert into splice site 4 (SS4) of α- and β-Nrxs greatly decreases their affinity for NLs (Ichtchenko et al., 1996Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. Structures, alternative splicing, and neurexin binding of multiple neuroligins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Low-resolution X-ray and neutron scattering experiments in combination with mutagenesis studies suggested that the binding interface is near SSB of NLs and SS4 of Nrxs, although these experiments lack molecular detail about the interaction (Comoletti et al., 2007Comoletti D. Grishaev A. Whitten A.E. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. Trewhella J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4256-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NLs validate and specify synapses is unknown. It is the extracellular domain of NLs that is critical for this activity rather than its cytoplasmic region (Chubykin et al., 2007Chubykin A.A. Atasoy D. Etherton M.R. Brose N. Kavalali E.T. Gibson J.R. Sudhof T.C. Activity-dependent validation of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses by neuroligin-1 versus neuroligin-2.Neuron. 2007; 54: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The only known ligands for the extracellular esterase domain of NLs are α- and β-Nrxs. The high affinity of their interaction, their similar synaptic functions, and their common involvement in autism spectrum disorders strongly suggest that NLs and Nrxs function by binding to each other. However, the lack of a high-resolution structure of the NL/Nrx complex hinders the understanding of how these proteins act in synapse function. We determined the three-dimensional structures of NL1 in isolation and in a complex with Nrx1β by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the complex reveals a binding interface that includes two Ca2+-binding sites and explains the role of alternatively spliced sites in the regulation of binding. We then designed multiple mutations on the Nrx-binding surface of NL1 to disrupt the interaction of NL1 with Nrx1β. We confirmed the stability and wild-type-like folding of the mutant NLs. The mutations disrupt the NL1/Nrx1β interaction by reducing the affinity by up to three orders of magnitude. These mutants confirm the binding interface revealed by the NL1/Nrx1β complex structure and could be used as molecular tools to dissect the NL1/Nrx1β interaction in vivo. The extracellular esterase domain of NL1 (residues 46–638, without inserts in splice sites A and B) was produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (residue numbering includes signal peptide and splice sites even when they are absent, see Figure S1 available online). The purified NL1 was analyzed by multiangle laser light scattering (data not shown), which indicated that NL1 forms a dimer of approximately 150 kDa as reported previously (Comoletti et al., 2006Comoletti D. Flynn R.E. Boucard A.A. Demeler B. Schirf V. Shi J. Jennings L.L. Newlin H.R. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Gene selection, alternative splicing, and post-translational processing regulate neuroligin selectivity for beta-neurexins.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12816-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Crystals of NL1 were obtained in space group P32 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to dmin = 1.8 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with an approximate homology model of NL1 (Table 1; a simulated annealing omit map is shown in Figure 1C).Table 1X-ray Data Collection and RefinementCrystallographic DataNL1NL1/Nrx1βBeamlineALS 8.2.1ALS 8.2.2Wavelength (Å)1.00001.0000a, b, c (Å)173.7, 173.7, 108.0229.8, 148.8, 123.6Resolution (Å)45–1.850–3.5Unique reflections337,07850,575Redundancy2.8 (2.4)3.0 (2.3)Completeness (%)99.6 (99.1)94.6 (86.9)I/σ17.0 (1.45)11.1 (1.65)RsymaRsym = ∑h∑iIi(h) − <I(h)>/∑h∑iIi(h), where Ii(h) is the ith measurement and <I(h)> is the mean of all measurements of I(h) for Miller indices h.

NL1 has an ellipsoid shape with dimensions ∼68 Å × 66 Å × 48 Å (Figure 1A, location of the SSA and SSB splice sites are indicated by arrows). It belongs to the class of α/β-hydrolases together with acetylcholinesterases, butyrylcholinesterases, and cholesterol esterases, consisting of a twisted β sheet surrounded by multiple helices. N-glycosylation is observed at two of the three potential glycosylation sites (N109 and N343), and a disulfide bond (C512-C546) is seen that is unique to NLs (Figure 1A). The NL1 homodimer is formed by protomers that are related by a two-fold axis, similar to what is observed in the AChE structure. The dimer interface comprises a four-helix bundle composed of two helices from each protomer, with a buried surface area of approximately 1100 Å2 (Figure 1B). The interaction primarily involves hydrophobic residues L636, L633, L629, V451, F458, W463, and M459, flanked on one side by two hydrogen bonds (R466-Q600, H467-K601). The structure explains the dimer disrupting effect of the E628A/L629A mutation studied by Dean et al., 2003Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Neurexin mediates the assembly of presynaptic terminals.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar since it alters residues at the dimerization interface; the K622A/V623A mutation presumably changes the packing of the dimerization helices since the mutated residues face into the protein core (mutations correspond to E584A/L585A and K578A/V579A mutations in Dean et al. who used a different numbering). The esterase domains of NLs have 34% sequence identity with those of AChEs. Superposition of the structures of NL1 and AChE from torpedo californica (PDB ID 2ACE) using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993Holm L. Sander C. Protein structure comparison by alignment of distance matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar) yielded a root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 2.2 Å for 504 equivalent α carbon atoms (Figure 2A). Superposition of NL1 with other esterase domains, such as butyrylcholinesterase or cholesterol esterase, produced rms deviations in the range of 2.2–2.4 Å. Despite the similar overall fold of NL1 and esterases, there are major differences in the esterase active site region (Figure 2B). The catalytic residues of AChEs are located in a deeply buried cavity that is surface accessible through an entrance. Both sequence identity and structural similarity between NL1 and AChE are very low in the active site region (Figures 2B and S1). In addition, the active site residues of AChE are solvent accessible, whereas the homologous residues in NL1 are inaccessible to solvent due to an occluded entrance. There are two short helices in NL1 instead of one in AChE, which occlude the entrance. Different loop lengths cause major structural differences in NL1 compared to AChEs (there are eight extra residues 132–139, indicated by “1” in Figure 2B, and there is a shorter loop in the region indicated by “2” in Figure 2B). The C-terminal subdomain containing the EF hand motif (Tsigelny et al., 2000Tsigelny I. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Common EF-hand motifs in cholinesterases and neuroligins suggest a role for Ca2+ binding in cell surface associations.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is in a different position in NL1 than in AChEs, and the helices of the EF hand motif are packing differently (indicated by “3” in Figure 2B). No electron density was observed at the putative Ca2+-binding sites of the EF hand motif for NL1 crystals that included Ca2+ (data not shown), as well as in the Ca2+ containing crystal structure of the NL1/Nrx1β complex (discussed below), indicating that the EF hand motif of NL1 does not bind Ca2+, at least not in isolation or in a complex with Nrx1β. To determine the structure of the complex, the esterase domain of NL1 without SSA and SSB was coexpressed with Nrx1β (residues 47–299; without an insert in SS4) in insect cells, and the complex was formed in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. Crystals of the complex were obtained in space group C2 with four NL1/Nrx1β complexes in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to dmin = 3.5 Å (Table 1 and a simulated annealing omit map is shown in Figure 3D). The crystal structure of the NL1/Nrx1β complex comprises a heterotetramer in which two Nrx1β protomers bind to equivalent sites on opposite sides of the long axis of the NL1 dimer (Figure 3A). The NL1 dimer within the complex is identical to the NL1 dimer observed in the isolated NL1 structure, and the two Nrx1β molecules that bind to the NL dimer are not interacting with each other. The observed oligomeric state is consistent with solution sedimentation velocity experiments that revealed a 2:2 stoichiometry (Comoletti et al., 2006Comoletti D. Flynn R.E. Boucard A.A. Demeler B. Schirf V. Shi J. Jennings L.L. Newlin H.R. Sudhof T.C. Taylor P. Gene selection, alternative splicing, and post-translational processing regulate neuroligin selectivity for beta-neurexins.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12816-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Electron density is observed for two Ca2+ at the binding interface. Apart from side-chain rotamer changes, no major conformational changes are observed when the complex structure is compared with the individual structures of NL1 and Nrx1β (rms deviation for Cα atoms is 0.4 Å for both NL1 and Nrx1β). The Nrx1β-binding site on NL1 is located next to SSB and on the opposite side of the molecule relative to the “active site” entrance (Figure 3B). The structure reveals that the presence of the eight-residue SSB on NL1 would partially occlude the interaction surface, leading to a decrease in binding affinity, which is in agreement with the observations that the presence of the SSB insert abolishes α-Nrx binding and reduces β-Nrx binding (Boucard et al., 2005Boucard A.A. Chubykin A.A. Comoletti D. Taylor P. Sudhof T.C.

The NL1-binding region on Nrx1β is located at the rim of the β sheet that is opposite to its N and C termini. The 30 residue insert of SS4 in Nrx1β would be located next to the binding region, explaining why its presence impairs binding to NLs (Ichtchenko et al., 1996Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Sudhof T.C. Structures, alternative splicing, and neurexin binding of multiple neuroligins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The SSB of NL1 and the SS4 of Nrx1β are located on approximately opposite sides across the binding interface. This arrangement of the splice sites could induce an additive effect upon introduction of both splice sites and would thus allow complex regulation of the stre"
https://openalex.org/W1973232667,"In a complex nervous system, neuronal functional diversity is reflected in the wide variety of dendritic arbor shapes. Different neuronal classes are defined by class-specific transcription factor combinatorial codes. We show that the combination of the transcription factors Knot and Cut is particular to Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons. Knot and Cut control different aspects of the dendrite cytoskeleton, promoting microtubule- and actin-based dendritic arbors, respectively. Knot delineates class IV arbor morphology by simultaneously synergizing with Cut to promote complexity and repressing Cut-mediated promotion of dendritic filopodia/spikes. Knot increases dendritic arbor outgrowth through promoting the expression of Spastin, a microtubule-severing protein disrupted in autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP). Knot and Cut may modulate cellular mechanisms that are conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates. Hence, this study gives significant general insight into how multiple transcription factors combine to control class-specific dendritic arbor morphology through controlling different aspects of the cytoskeleton."

One such enzyme is synaptojanin1, a multifunctional protein conserved from yeast to humans, which contains two phosphoinositol phosphatase domains and a proline-rich domain. Genetic ablation of synaptojanin1 leads to pleiotropic defects in presynaptic function, including accumulation of free clathrin-coated vesicles and delayed vesicle reavailability, implicating this enzyme in postendocytic uncoating of vesicles. To further elucidate the role of synaptojanin1 at nerve terminals, we performed quantitative synaptic vesicle recycling assays in synj1−/− neurons. Our studies show that synaptojanin1 is also required for normal vesicle endocytosis. Defects in both endocytosis and postendocytic vesicle reavailability can be fully restored upon reintroduction of synaptojanin1. However, expression of synaptojanin1 with mutations abolishing catalytic activity of each phosphatase domain reveals that the dual action of both domains is required for normal synaptic vesicle internalization and reavailability.

Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (phosphoinositides) have been implicated in many aspects of cell physiology, including signal transduction, organelle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and the regulation of membrane permeability. More specifically, phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] has been shown to be critically implicated in endocytosis (Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Phosphoinositides in cell regulation and membrane dynamics.Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 has been shown to be essential for the recruitment of a variety of endocytic proteins and endocytic clathrin adaptors, including AP-2 and AP180, to the plasma membrane (Haucke, 2005Haucke V.

The biosynthesis and dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 have been implicated in the recycling of vesicles at the presynaptic terminal, where phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ (PIPKIγ) and synaptojanin 1 account for the majority of these two activities, respectively (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O.

However, the consequences of inadequate synaptojanin 1-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides on the synaptic vesicle cycle are less clear. Synaptojanin was first identified as an interactor for dynamin-binding proteins and thus proposed to be a functional neighbor of dynamin (McPherson et al., 1994aMcPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L.

While both isoforms are expressed in different tissues, the Synj1-145 (hereafter simply referred to as Synj1) is expressed at very high levels in the nervous system, where its concentration increases in parallel with synapse development and maturation (McPherson et al., 1996McPherson P.S.

Synj2 is expressed at much lower concentrations in the nervous system, where its function may partially overlap with that of Synj1 (Nemoto et al., 2001Nemoto Y. Wenk M.R. Watanabe M. Daniell L.

In mice, deletion of the synj1 gene causes early postnatal lethality, elevation of steady-state PI(4,5)P2 in cortical cultures, accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at nerve terminals, greater synaptic depression (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O.

These observations suggested that the role of Synj1 in dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides such as PI(4,5)P2, which would allow shedding of clathrin coat components after disruption of the clathrin lattice following fission, may underlie the pleiotropic defects in the Synj1 KO. The critical role of synaptojanin in synapse function was further corroborated by the isolation of synj mutants with related phenotypes in forward genetic screens for synaptic transmission in C. elegans (Harris et al., 2000Harris T.W.

Although the importance of synaptojanin in the process of synaptic vesicle recycling is well recognized, the extent to which Synj1 is involved at distinct steps of the vesicle cycle, such as exocytosis, endocytosis, and postendocytic vesicle reavailability, is unclear. It is also not known what role each of the functional domains of synaptojanin1 plays in the vesicle cycle or how their absence may contribute to the various defects observed in mice and other species. Here, using a combination of synapto-pHluorin (spH; Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A.

Our results indicate that in addition to its previously described role in uncoating (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B.

USA. 2002; 99: 17143-17148Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) of newly internalized vesicles, Synj1 is critical for the endocytic step itself, over a broad range of stimuli. Our findings also reveal that the 5-phosphatase activity of Synj1 is required in endocytosis for both brief and prolonged stimuli. The Sac1-like activity and the Synj1-endophilin interaction are important for endocytosis of brief stimuli and prolonged stimuli, respectively. Thus, our findings identify a role for synaptojanin1 in vesicle internalization and indicate how different Synj1 domains enable its participation in endocytosis. Finally, our findings also indicate that both the Sac1-like and 5-phosphatase activities of Synj1 are required for normal postendocytic reavailability of vesicles. We used spH to measure endocytic rates during action potential firing at 10 Hz. spH is a fusion protein consisting of a pH-sensitive mutant of GFP (pKa ∼7.1; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000Sankaranarayanan S. De Angelis D. Rothman J.E. Ryan T.A. The use of pHluorins for optical measurements of presynaptic activity.Biophys.

De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). spH fluorescence is quenched when exposed to the internal vesicle pH (∼5.5), but undergoes an ∼25-fold increase upon exocytosis and exposure to the external buffer (pH 7.4). The fluorescence is quenched again upon endocytosis and reacidification (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Real-time measurements of vesicle-SNARE recycling in synapses of the central nervous system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). During repetitive stimulation, when vesicles concurrently undergo fusion and retrieval, the fluorescence trace represents the net accumulation of spH on the synaptic surface, arising from the difference between exocytosis, and endocytosis and reacidification. The rate of exocytosis can be resolved by blocking vesicle reacidification with bafilomycin A1 (Baf), a v-type ATPase blocker (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Calcium accelerates endocytosis of vSNAREs at hippocampal synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference between the spH response in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 indicates the extent of endocytosis (Schweizer and Ryan, 2006Schweizer F.E. Ryan T.A. The synaptic vesicle: cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), provided there is only a negligible contribution to fluorescence from internalized, nonreacidified vesicles. This was verified using acid quenching (see Figure S1 available online). Using this approach, we found that endocytosis occurring during repetitive stimulation at 10 Hz for 30 s was reduced ∼2-fold in synj1−/− neurons as compared to WT (Figures 1A1, 1A2, and 1B). Similar results were also obtained in heterozygous synj1+/− neurons (Figure S6A and S6B), where the Synj1 expression level is ∼50% of WT levels (G.D.P., unpublished data). We confirmed the presence of an endocytic defect in synj1−/− neurons using an alternate approach with FM4-64 labeling (Figures 1C and 1D). Here, the FM dye was applied during the 30 s stimulus and then rapidly washed using an FM dye chelator, so as to only label vesicles internalized during the stimulus period (Figure 1C). The amount of dye internalization is defined as the amount of dye rereleased with a further round of maximal stimulation. Thus, synj1−/− neurons demonstrate a specific defect in vesicle endocytosis during repetitive stimulation. For periods of prolonged stimulation, the endocytic recovery time grows with increasing accumulation of synaptic vesicles on the synaptic surface (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Real-time measurements of vesicle-SNARE recycling in synapses of the central nervous system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Endocytosis following brief stimuli, however, appears to occur with an invariant time constant (Granseth et al., 2006Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), indicating that endocytosis behaves differently in different stimulus regimes. We therefore investigated whether the absence of Synj1 also affected endocytosis for smaller numbers of stimuli (50–100 AP at 10 Hz). The endocytic rate during activity cannot be accurately measured for these stimuli using the bafilomycin technique, since the stimulus duration of 5–10 s is not significantly greater than the ∼4 s time constant for vesicle reacidification (Atluri and Ryan, 2006Atluri P.P. Ryan T.A. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle reacidification at hippocampal nerve terminals.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the decay in fluorescence after short stimuli and obtained the time constant (τ) for endocytosis by fitting the traces to an equation derived from a two-step sequential model for endocytosis and reacidification (Granseth et al., 2006Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, and Experimental Procedures). Over the 50–100 AP range, we found the time constant in WT mouse cortical neurons to be invariant (average 23.0 ± 2.0 s; Figures 2A1–2A4 and 2B), modestly greater than the τ previously reported for rat hippocampal neurons (∼17 s; Granseth et al., 2006Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This difference may reflect biological differences between the species and cell types or be due to differences in the reporter molecules used. Nevertheless, the τ in synj1−/− neurons was also invariant but elevated ∼1.6-fold (average 36.7 ± 3.0 s; Figures 2A1–2A4 and 2B). Furthermore, while spH accumulated on the surface due to the stimulus is completely retrieved in WT neurons, ∼25% of the accumulated surface spH is not immediately recovered in synj1−/− neurons (Figures 2A4 and 2C). Instead, this fraction is slowly retrieved over several minutes, with spH fluorescence eventually recovering to prestimulus levels. Accordingly, the steady-state surface fraction of spH is not significantly different between genotypes (18.5% ± 3.8% in WT and 21.0% ± 6.3% in synj1−/− neurons, n = 5 each). These findings indicate that the endocytic defect in synj1−/− neurons is prevalent for both short stimuli and persistent activity. The defect after a short stimulus was not evident in a previous FM dye assay for vesicle endocytosis in synj1−/− neurons (Kim et al., 2002Kim W.T. Chang S. Daniell L. Cremona O. Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Delayed reentry of recycling vesicles into the fusion-competent synaptic vesicle pool in synaptojanin 1 knockout mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 17143-17148Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), probably because of limited time resolution (time points spaced by 15 s, as opposed to 0.5–3 s in the spH measurements), and due to dye uptake unrelated to the stimulus: in the previous study (Kim et al., 2002Kim W.T. Chang S. Daniell L. Cremona O. Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Delayed reentry of recycling vesicles into the fusion-competent synaptic vesicle pool in synaptojanin 1 knockout mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 17143-17148Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), approximately 30% of the total dye uptake occurred 80–170 s after a 100 AP stimulus in WT neurons, even though stimulus-related endocytosis is nearly complete by that time (Figure 2A3). Interestingly, we did not find any significant defect in endocytosis following brief stimulation in synj1+/− neurons (Figures S6C–S6E), suggesting that unlike for prolonged stimulation, the ∼50% Synj1 protein remaining in these neurons is sufficient for normal handling of small endocytic loads. We next wanted to determine whether the slower endocytic rate was related to a perturbation in exocytosis. The size of the readily releasable vesicle pool was shown to scale with PI(4,5)P2 levels in chromaffin cells (Gong et al., 2005Gong L.W. Di Paolo G. Diaz E. Cestra G. Diaz M.E. Lindau M. De Camilli P. Toomre D. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type I gamma regulates dynamics of large dense-core vesicle fusion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5204-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Milosevic et al., 2005Milosevic I. Sorensen J.B. Lang T. Krauss M. Nagy G. Haucke V. Jahn R. Neher E. Plasmalemmal phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate level regulates the releasable vesicle pool size in chromaffin cells.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Higher plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 levels in synj1−/− neurons could in principle cause more efficient exocytosis, leading to an increased load on the endocytic machinery and therefore a slower endocytic rate. To investigate this possibility, we determined the rate of exocytosis from the spH response in the presence of bafilomycin. The normalized response to a stimulus that turns over the entire recycling pool (10 Hz, 120 s) did not differ significantly between WT and synj1−/− neurons (Figure 3A). The exocytic time constants obtained by first-order exponential fits to the traces were accordingly similar (Figure 3B). Thus, slowed endocytosis during persistent activity in synj1−/− neurons was not due to an alteration in exocytosis. We also measured the size of the recycling pool of vesicles, using maximal FM dye loading and prolonged poststimulus dye exposure to ensure labeling of all vesicles despite slower endocytic rates (Figure 3C). The amount of dye internalized was quantified by rereleasing it with a maximal stimulus (120 s at 10 Hz). These experiments indicate that the recycling pool size in synj1−/− and WT nerve terminals are similar (Figure 3D), in agreement with ultrastructural observations (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. et al.Essential role of phosphoinositide metabolism in synaptic vesicle recycling.Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Previous measurements in synj1−/− synapses indicated a reduction in the recycling vesicle pool size (Kim et al., 2002Kim W.T. Chang S. Daniell L. Cremona O. Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Delayed reentry of recycling vesicles into the fusion-competent synaptic vesicle pool in synaptojanin 1 knockout mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 17143-17148Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); we surmise that the dye loading periods in those experiments were too short to escape complications due to incomplete endocytosis. We examined whether postnatal expression of wild-type Synj1 (WT-Synj1) in synj1−/− neurons could correct the observed endocytic defects despite prolonged absence of the protein during embryonic development in these animals. We found that Flag or HA-tagged WT-Synj1 expressed in synj1−/− neurons was transported to presynaptic terminals (Figure S3) and completely restored the endocytic rate to WT levels during persistent activity (Figures 4A and 4B). The time constant for endocytosis after brief 50–100 AP stimuli (average 23.3 ± 2.2 s, Figures 4C1–4C4 and 4D) and the extent of spH retrieval (Figure 4E) were also found to be restored to WT levels in these experiments. Exocytosis kinetics remained unaltered under these conditions (Figure S2), indicating that the rescue of endocytosis was not due to an additional perturbation of the exocytic pathway. These findings indicate that the endocytic defects in synj1−/− neurons can be fully restored by expression of WT-Synj1. We used the ability to rescue the endocytic defect in synj1−/− synapses with exogenously expressed protein to investigate the potential roles of different domains of Synj1 in the vesicle cycle. We first tested the ability of a 5-phosphatase activity-deficient point mutant form of Synj1 to rescue the endocytic defects in synj1−/− neurons. All known inositol-5-phosphatases contain the consensus sequence of the form XWXGDXN(F/Y)R, wherein the aspartate residue is known to be important for catalysis (Jefferson and Majerus, 1996Jefferson A.B.

Although previous animal experiments on impulsivity have suggested a role of serotonin in behaviors requiring prediction of delayed rewards, the underlying neural mechanism is unclear.To elucidate the role of serotonin in the evaluation of delayed rewards, we performed a functional brain imaging experiment in which subjects chose small-immediate or large-delayed liquid rewards under dietary regulation of tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin. A model-based analysis revealed that the activity of the ventral part of the striatum was correlated with reward prediction at shorter time scales, and this correlated activity was stronger at low serotonin levels. By contrast, the activity of the dorsal part of the striatum was correlated with reward prediction at longer time scales, and this correlated activity was stronger at high serotonin levels.Our results suggest that serotonin controls the time scale of reward prediction by differentially regulating activities within the striatum."

The GABAA receptor, resistance to dieldrin (Rdl), is highly expressed in the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs), a group of neurons playing essential roles in insect olfactory learning. Flies with increased or decreased expression of Rdl in the MBs were generated. Olfactory associative learning tests showed that Rdl overexpression impaired memory acquisition but not memory stability. This learning defect was due to disrupting the physiological state of the adult MB neurons rather than causing developmental abnormalities. Remarkably, Rdl knockdown enhanced memory acquisition but not memory stability. Functional cellular imaging experiments showed that Rdl overexpression abolished the normal calcium responses of the MBs to odors while Rdl knockdown increased these responses. Together, these data suggest that RDL negatively modulates olfactory associative learning, possibly by gating the input of olfactory information into the MBs."

Because of its clinical importance, APAP-induced acute toxicity has become an indispensable model for studying drug-induced liver and kidney injury. Over the past 40 years, numerous efforts have been undertaken to understand the molecular mechanism of this toxicological event. Results from those studies indicated that the toxicity is initiated by P450-mediated reactions that convert APAP to the reactive electrophile, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), causing glutathione depletion and covalent binding (3Dahlin D.C. Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y. Nelson S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent damage to mitochondria, cell membranes, and nuclei, as well as the disruption of cell death- and survival-related signaling pathways, lead to massive necrosis and apoptosis (4Cohen S.D. Hoivik D.J. Khairallah E.A. Plaa G.L. Hewitt W.R. Second Ed. in: Toxicology of the Liver. Taylor & Francis, Washington, DC1998: 159-186Google Scholar). Besides the P450-catalyzed oxidation reactions, detoxicating reactions including sulfation, glucuronidation, and glutathione conjugation also significantly contribute to the biotransformation of APAP and NAPQI. The balance between these activation and detoxication routes can largely determine the consequences of APAP treatment. Several P450s, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A, have been identified as APAP-metabolizing enzymes. Among them, CYP2E1 was widely accepted as the major isoform responsible for the bioactivation of APAP based on several convincing pieces of evidence. Firstly, in vitro enzyme kinetic assays showed that purified CYP2E1 enzyme possessed low Km and high Vmax values for the formation of NAPQI and the bioactivation of APAP by liver microsomes was largely inhibited by CYP2E1 antibody (5Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Lieber C.S. Black M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6Patten C.J. Thomas P.E. Guy R.L. Lee M. Gonzalez F.J. Guengerich F.P. Yang C.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Secondly, there is a clear link between enhanced sensitivity to APAP hepatotoxicity and chronic alcoholism, which significantly increases the CYP2E1 levels in liver (7Lieber C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Thirdly, APAP-induced hepatic necrosis mainly occurs in the centrilobular region, where CYP2E1 is highly expressed (8Hart S.G. Cartun R.W. Wyand D.S. Khairallah E.A. Cohen S.D. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1995; 24: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, Cyp2e1-null mice are highly resistant to APAP, compared with wild-type mice (9Lee S.S. Buters J.T. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12063-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), whereas reintroduction of the human CYP2E1 gene into Cyp2e1-null mice reestablished the toxic response to APAP (10Cheung C. Yu A.M. Ward J.M. Krausz K.W. Akiyama T.E. Feigenbaum L. Gonzalez F.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Cyp2e1-null mouse line is an ideal model as the negative control for investigating the mechanism and biomarkers of the APAP-induced toxicity.Metabolomics, a methodology for measuring small-molecule metabolite profiles and fluxes in biological matrices, following genetic modification or exogenous challenges, has become an important component of systems biology, complementing genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics (11Nicholson J.K. Wilson I.D. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 12Fernie A.R. Trethewey R.N. Krotzky A.J. Willmitzer L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Combining advanced analytical instrumentation for comprehensive metabolite measurement with robust chemometric computation for detecting subtle changes in a large dataset, metabolomics techniques have been utilized to identify biomarkers and unravel pathophysiological mechanisms in many scientific fields, including xenobiotic metabolism (13Chen C. Gonzalez F.J. Idle J.R. Drug Metab. Rev. 2007; 39: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and toxicology (14Nicholson J.K. Connelly J. Lindon J.C. Holmes E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Recently, APAP-induced toxicity has also been investigated using metabolomics approaches. Two NMR-based studies have depicted the general changes caused by the APAP-elicited disruption of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (15Coen M. Ruepp S.U. Lindon J.C. Nicholson J.K. Pognan F. Lenz E.M. Wilson I.D. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2004; 35: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Coen M. Lenz E.M. Nicholson J.K. Wilson I.D. Pognan F. Lindon J.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and a capillary electrophoresis-MS-based study identified ophthalmic acid as a general biomarker of oxidative stress following glutathione depletion (17Soga T. Baran R. Suematsu M. Ueno Y. Ikeda S. Sakurakawa T. Kakazu Y. Ishikawa T. Robert M. Nishioka T. Tomita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16768-16776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar).To obtain more insights into the underlying mechanism of APAP-induced toxicity and the role of CYP2E1, metabolite profiling and metabolomics of APAP-treated wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were conducted in this study. Profiling of major known APAP metabolites as well as glutathione and hydrogen peroxide assays revealed the potential role of CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress in APAP-induced toxicity. Metabolomic analysis resulted in the identification of four toxicity-associated APAP metabolites that should find utility in monitoring the emergence of acetaminophen toxicity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents–APAP, APAP-glucuronide, p-aminophenol, α-ketoglutarate, hydrogen peroxide, horseradish peroxidase, high-performance liquid chromatography-grade water, acetonitrile, and formic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [Acetyl-2H3]APAP and 3-methoxy-APAP were purchased from Syn-Fine Research (Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada). 2,3,5,6-[2H4]APAP and Cys-APAP were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada). GS-APAP and NAC-APAP standards were kindly provided by Professor Bernhard Lauterburg, University of Bern, Switzerland.Animal Treatments and Sample Collection–The Cyp2e1-null mouse line (Cyp2e1–/–) was described previously (9Lee S.S. Buters J.T. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12063-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Female wild-type (Cyp2e1+/+) and Cyp2e1-null mice on the 129/Sv strain background, from 2 to 3 months of age, were used in this study. All animals were maintained in an NCI, National Institutes of Health animal facility under a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. Handling and treatment procedures were in accordance with animal study protocols approved by the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee. APAP was dissolved in saline solution at doses ranging from 10 to 400 mg/kg and administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice. Control mice were treated with blank saline solution. Serum samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding. 24-h urine samples were collected by housing mice in glass metabolic bowls (Jencons, Leighton Buzzard, UK), 1-, 2-, and 4-h urine samples were collected by combining urine in a metabolic bowel, and urine was harvested from bladder emptying during retro-orbital bleeding. After CO2 euthanization, liver and other tissue samples were harvested. All samples were stored at –80 °C before analysis.Assessment of APAP-induced Toxicity–APAP-induced liver injury was evaluated by measuring the catalytic activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum. Briefly, 1 μl of serum was mixed with 200 μl of AST or ALT assay buffer (Catachem, Bridgeport, CT) in a 96-well microplate, and the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ was monitored at 340 nm for 5 min.APAP-induced kidney injury was evaluated by measuring the blood urea nitrogen in serum. Briefly, 2 μl of serum was mixed with 200 μl of urea assay buffer (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA) in a 96-well microplate, and the reaction was monitored at 520 nm after a 30-min incubation at room temperature.LC-MS Analysis of Glutathione–The levels of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in liver and GSH in mitochondria were measured by LC-MS/MS. Samples for total GSH and GSGS measurement were prepared by homogenizing liver in 10 volumes of 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was diluted by deionized water prior to LC-MS analysis. Samples for mitochondrial GSH measurement was prepared by homogenizing liver in 10 volumes of Mito buffer (0.2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). Cytosol fraction was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in Mito buffer. Nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial fraction was precipitated by spinning supernatant at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial GSH was extracted by mixing the mitochondrial pellet with 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. After removing protein by centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with deionized water and transferred to a sample vial for LC-MS analysis. Samples from whole liver homogenate or mitochondrial fraction were injected into a high-performance liquid chromatography system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Synergi Polar-RP column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, 50 × 2.1 mm inner diameter). The flow rate through the column at ambient temperature was 0.2 ml/min with a gradient (methanol:water:acetonitrile, containing 0.1% formic acid) from 5:85:10 to 5:40:55 in a 5-min run. The column was equilibrated for 1.5 min before each injection. API 2000™ mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was operated in the turbo ion spray mode with positive ion detection. The turbo ion spray temperature was maintained at 350 °C, and a voltage of 5.5 kV was applied to the sprayer needle. Nitrogen was used as the turbo ion spray and nebulizing gas. Detection and quantification were performed using the multiple reactions monitoring mode, with m/z 308.0/75.9 for GSH and m/z 613.1/355.1 for GSSG.Hydrogen Peroxide Assay–Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level in liver was determined by the ferrous thiocyanate assay (18Palumbo A. Astarita G. d'Ischia M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 105-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were prepared by homogenizing liver in 10 volumes of 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The H2O2 level in supernatant was determined by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm after reacting with 3.2 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 180 mm potassium thiocyanate.UPLC-QTOFMS Analysis of Urine and Serum–A 5-μl aliquot of diluted urine and serum samples was injected into a Waters UPLC-QTOFMS system (Milford, MA). An Acquity UPLC™ BEH C18 column (Waters) was used to separate chemical components, including APAP and its metabolites at 35 °C. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.5 ml/min with an aqueous acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% formic acid over a 10-min run. The QTOF Premier™ mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode. Capillary voltage and cone voltage were maintained at 3 kV and 20 V, respectively. Source temperature and desolvation temperature were set at 120 °C and 350 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as both cone gas (50 liters/h) and desolvation gas (600 liters/h), and argon was used as collision gas. For accurate mass measurement, the QTOFMS was calibrated with sodium formate solution (range m/z 100–1000) and monitored by the intermittent injection of the lock mass sulfadimethoxine ([M+H]+ = 311.0814 m/z) in real-time. Mass chromatograms and mass spectral data were acquired and processed by MassLynx software (Waters) in centroid format.Determination of APAP Metabolite Profile in Urine–Urine samples were collected for 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of 10, 200, and 400 mg/kg APAP to wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice. Samples for LC-MS analysis were prepared by mixing 50 μl of urine with 200 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile and centrifuging at 18,000 × g for 10 min to remove protein and particulates. Supernatants were injected into the UPLC and metabolites separated by a gradient ranging from water to 95% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over a 10-min run. After data acquisition in QTOFMS, chromatograms and spectra of urine samples were processed by MetaboLynx software (Waters). APAP and its four major metabolites (Cys-APAP, NAC-APAP, APAP-G, and APAP-S) were identified through accurate mass measurement, comparison with authentic standards, and analysis of the MS2 fragmentation pattern, and their peak areas were quantified to represent the signal intensities. Urinary metabolite profiles of APAP in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were compared based on relative peak area in the total peak area of APAP and its four major urinary metabolites.Quantitation of APAP and Determination of APAP Metabolite Profiles in Serum–Serum samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after intraperitoneal injection of 400 mg/kg APAP. One volume of serum was deproteinated by 20 volumes of 66% aqueous acetonitrile. After 10-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g, supernatant was injected into UPLC-QTOFMS for quantitation with a gradient of mobile phase ranging from water to 99% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid over a 10-min run. To prepare the calibration curve, an APAP standard was mixed with blank serum and diluted 20 times by 66% aqueous acetonitrile. A linear range from 0.1 μm to 50 μm of APAP (r = 0.99) was achieved by using dynamic range enhancement function of QTOF Premier. Serum APAP concentrations were determined by the integration of peak area and fitting with a calibration curve using QuantLynx software (Waters).To examine the metabolite profile of APAP in serum of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice, chromatograms and spectra of 1-, 2-, and 4-h serum samples acquired by UPLC-QTOFMS were processed by MarkerLynx software (Waters). APAP and its major serum metabolites (GS-APAP, Cys-APAP, NAC-APAP, APAP-G, and APAP-S) were identified through accurate mass measurement, comparison with authentic standards, and analysis of MS2 fragmentation pattern. Relative abundances of APAP and its metabolites were determined by normalizing the single ion counts of each metabolite versus the total ion counts of each serum sample.Principal Components Analysis (PCA)–Chromatographic and spectral data of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were deconvoluted by MarkerLynx software. A multivariate data matrix containing information on sample identity, ion identity (retention time and m/z) and ion abundance was generated through centroiding, deisotoping, filtering, peak recognition, and integration. The intensity of each ion was calculated by normalizing the single ion counts versus the total ion counts in the whole chromatogram. The data matrix was further exported into SIMCA-p™ software (Umetrics, Kinnelon, NJ) and transformed by mean-centering and Pareto scaling, a technique that increases the importance of low abundance ions without significant amplification of noise. Principal components were generated by PCA analysis to represent the major latent variables in the data matrix and were described in a scores scatter plot. Potential APAP metabolites were identified by analyzing ions contributing to the principal components and to the separation of sample groups in the loadings scatter plot.Mass Isotopomer Analysis of Novel APAP Metabolites and Structural Elucidation–24-h urine samples were collected after treating wild-type mice with 400 mg/kg [acetyl-2H3]APAP or 400 mg/kg 2,3,5,6-[2H4]APAP by intraperitoneal injection, and then analyzed by UPLC-QTOFMS. Data from [acetyl-2H3]APAP treatment were compared with those from unlabeled APAP treatment through a PCA-based metabolomic analysis. The identity of individual ion as APAP metabolite was validated by comparing extracted ion chromatograms from three treatments. The structure of each APAP metabolite was elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) fragmentation with collision energy ramping from 15 to 35 eV.In Vitro Transamination Reaction of Cys-APAP–Liver and kidney were homogenized in microsomal buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm pyridoxal-5-phosphate (1:10, w/v). The S9 fraction was prepared by centrifuging tissue homogenate at 9,000 × g for 10 min. The transamination reaction was conducted by incubating tissue homogenate or S9 supernatant with 5 mm α-ketoglutarate and 1 mm Cys-APAP in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding equal volumes of acetonitrile and the reaction products were further analyzed by LC-MS.Peroxidase-mediated Metabolism of APAP and Cys-APAP–Analytical reactions were performed according to Potter's method (19Potter D.W. Miller D.W. Hinson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12174-12180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm APAP or Cys-APAP, and 2.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase were preincubated at 25 °C for 2 min before adding 1 mm H2O2. The reaction mix was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding equal volume of ice-cold 90% aqueous methanol containing 2 mm ascorbate. Reaction products were further analyzed by LC-MS.Statistics–Experimental values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed with two-tailed Student's t-tests for unpaired data, and a p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.RESULTSAPAP Metabolite Profiles in Wild-type and Cyp2e1-null Mice–Elevation of serum aminotransferase activities is a reliable indicator of hepatic injury (20Amacher D.E. Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol. 1998; 27: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). 24 h after 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg APAP treatments, the activities of serum ALT and AST in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were examined. Consistent with a previous report (9Lee S.S. Buters J.T. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12063-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), serum ALT and AST activities in wild-type mice were dramatically increased by both treatments but their activities in Cyp2e1-null mice were unaffected by 200 mg/kg and slightly increased by 400 mg/kg treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the effect of APAP treatment on kidney function of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice was determined by measuring blood urea nitrogen levels. After a 400 mg/kg treatment, the blood urea nitrogen level in wild-type mice was much higher than its level in Cyp2e1-null mice and wild-type controls. These results indicated that not only does CYP2E1 play an important role in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity but it also contributes to the APAP-induced nephrotoxicity.Major urinary metabolites of APAP (I) have been identified previously as 3-cysteinyl-APAP (Cys-APAP: II), N-acetylcysteinyl-APAP (NAC-APAP: III), APAP-O-glucuronide (APAP-G: IV), and APAP-O-sulfate (APAP-S: V) (21Bales J.R. Sadler P.J. Nicholson J.K. Timbrell J.A. Clin. Chem. 1984; 30: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although APAP-G and APAP-S are formed by direct conjugation to facilitate the elimination and excretion of APAP, Cys-APAP and NAC-APAP are the products of multiple reactions, including P450-mediated metabolic bioactivation and subsequent glutathione conjugation. Because CYP2E1 is one of the major enzymes capable of converting APAP to NAPQI, the metabolite profiles of APAP in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were compared by LC-MS profiling of APAP and four major metabolites in urine. Chemical identities of urinary ions corresponding to APAP, Cys-APAP, NAC-APAP, and APAP-G were confirmed by use of authentic standards. The ion corresponding to APAP-S was identified by accurate mass measurement and analysis of the MS2 fragmentation pattern (data not shown). The urinary metabolite profile of APAP was defined by calculating the relative abundances of APAP and four major metabolites in the whole APAP metabolite cluster (22Chen C. Meng L. Ma X. Krausz K.W. Pommier Y. Idle J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 318: 1330-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, with the 400 mg/kg treatment, which is the LD50 for wild-type but a nontoxic dose for Cyp2e1-null mice (9Lee S.S. Buters J.T. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12063-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), the urinary metabolite profiles of APAP in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were quite comparable except for a slightly higher abundance of Cys-APAP in wild-type mice and slightly lower abundances of APAP-G and APAP-S in Cyp2e1-null mice (Fig. 2A). This marginal difference in APAP metabolism was in clear contrast to the dramatic differences in the toxic response to 400 mg/kg APAP treatment between wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice (Fig. 1). To clarify this observation, urinary metabolite profiles of APAP in 200 mg/kg (a low toxic dose for wild-type) and 10 mg/kg (a non-toxic dose comparable to the therapeutic dose in human) treatments were further examined. Distinct from 400 mg/kg treatment, a 200 mg/kg dose led to significantly higher abundance of urinary Cys-APAP and lower abundance of APAP in wild-type mice than those in Cyp2e1-null mice (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, following 10 mg/kg APAP treatment, the differences between wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice in APAP metabolism became even more apparent with a much higher abundance of Cys-APAP in wild-type mice and much higher abundances of APAP, APAP-G, and APAP-S in Cyp2e1-null mice (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Distribution of APAP and its major metabolites in urine and serum of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice. Metabolite profiles of APAP in 24-h urine samples of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were examined by LC-MS analysis of APAP and four major metabolites (Cys-APAP, NAC-APAP, APAP-G, and APAP-S), and defined by their relative abundances (area % ± S.D.) that were calculated by normalizing individual peak area with total peak area of APAP and four metabolites (n = 8; *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01). A, urinary metabolite profile of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice after 400 mg/kg APAP treatment. B, urinary metabolite profile after 200 mg/kg APAP treatment. C, urinary metabolite profile after 10 mg/kg APAP treatment. D, serum concentrations of APAP in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after 400 mg/kg APAP treatment (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the results from urinary metabolite profiling, the distribution of APAP and its major metabolites in serum during the first 8 h after 400 mg/kg treatment was examined. Comparison of APAP pharmacokinetics in wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice indicated that significant difference in serum concentrations of APAP did not occur until 4 h of treatment (Fig. 2D). Subsequent analysis of the LC-MS signal abundances of APAP metabolites in serum revealed that at 1 h after dosing, serum metabolite profiles of wild-type and Cyp2e1-null mice were comparable while at 2 h and 4 h, higher abundances of 3-glutathionyl-APAP (GS-APAP) and Cys-APAP in wild-type mice were observed (supplemental Table S1). Overall, these results suggested that, when exposed to high concentrations of APAP, wild-type mice only have a slightly higher APAP-oxidizing capacity than Cyp2e1-null mice.APAP-induced Oxidative Stress in Wild-type and Cyp2e1-null Mice–GSH is an essential thiol antioxidant for protecting cells from oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2148092387,"Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus picocyanobacteria are dominant contributors to marine primary production over large areas of the ocean. Phytoplankton cells are entrained in the water column and are thus often exposed to rapid changes in irradiance within the upper mixed layer of the ocean. An upward fluctuation in irradiance can result in photosystem II photoinactivation exceeding counteracting repair rates through protein turnover, thereby leading to net photoinhibition of primary productivity, and potentially cell death. Here we show that the effective cross-section for photosystem II photoinactivation is conserved across the picocyanobacteria, but that their photosystem II repair capacity and protein-specific photosystem II light capture are negatively correlated and vary widely across the strains. The differences in repair rate correspond to the light and nutrient conditions that characterize the site of origin of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus isolates, and determine the upward fluctuation in irradiance they can tolerate, indicating that photoinhibition due to transient high-light exposure influences their distribution in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2139191939,"Recent data have revealed that epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and chromatin structure changes, are among the earliest molecular abnormalities to occur during tumorigenesis. The inherent thermodynamic stability of cytosine methylation and the apparent high specificity of the alterations for disease may accelerate the development of powerful molecular diagnostics for cancer. We report a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation alterations in breast cancer. The approach efficiently identified a large collection of novel differentially DNA methylated loci (∼200), a subset of which was independently validated across a panel of over 230 clinical samples. The differential cytosine methylation events were independent of patient age, tumor stage, estrogen receptor status or family history of breast cancer. The power of the global approach for discovery is underscored by the identification of a single differentially methylated locus, associated with the GHSR gene, capable of distinguishing infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma from normal and benign breast tissues with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 96%, respectively. Notably, the frequency of these molecular abnormalities in breast tumors substantially exceeds the frequency of any other single genetic or epigenetic change reported to date. The discovery of over 50 novel DNA methylation-based biomarkers of breast cancer may provide new routes for development of DNA methylation-based diagnostics and prognostics, as well as reveal epigenetically regulated mechanism involved in breast tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2125861112,"Human Cox17 is a key mitochondrial copper chaperone responsible for supplying copper ions, through the assistance of Sco1, Sco2, and Cox11, to cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial energy transducing respiratory chain. A structural and dynamical characterization of human Cox17 in its various functional metallated and redox states is presented here. The NMR solution structure of the partially oxidized Cox17 (Cox172S-S) consists of a coiled coil-helix-coiled coil-helix domain stabilized by two disulfide bonds involving Cys25-Cys54 and Cys35-Cys44, preceded by a flexible and completely unstructured N-terminal tail. In human Cu(I)Cox172S-S the copper(I) ion is coordinated by the sulfurs of Cys22 and Cys23, and this is the first example of a Cys-Cys binding motif in copper proteins. Copper(I) binding as well as the formation of a third disulfide involving Cys22 and Cys23 cause structural and dynamical changes only restricted to the metal-binding region. Redox properties of the disulfides of human Cox17, here investigated, strongly support the current hypothesis that the unstructured fully reduced Cox17 protein is present in the cytoplasm and enters the intermembrane space (IMS) where is then oxidized by Mia40 to Cox172S-S, thus becoming partially structured and trapped into the IMS. Cox172S-S is the functional species in the IMS, it can bind only one copper(I) ion and is then ready to enter the pathway of copper delivery to cytochrome c oxidase.

Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Subunit 1 (Cox1) contains two heme a cofactors, one of which interacts with a mononuclear copper site (designated CuB) forming a heterobimetallic active site (heme a3-CuB), whereas subunit 2 (Cox2) contains two copper ions in a binuclear center (designated CuA) (1Tsukihara T.

Over 30 accessory proteins are necessary for the proper assembly of the enzyme (4Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The functional role of these accessory factors in the assembly of CcO concerns the formation and insertion of heme a, the delivery and insertion of metal ions to corresponding binding sites, and the final maturation of this multi-subunit enzyme. Six proteins (Cox11, Cox17, Cox19, Cox23, Sco2, and Sco1) have been identified to be implicated in the delivery and insertion of copper ions into CcO (3Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cox17 is the copper metallochaperone within the IMS acting as the donor of Cu(I) to both Sco1 and Cox11 (6Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cox17, which contains six conserved cysteines, can in principle exist in the IMS in three different oxidation states: from the fully oxidized protein with three disulfide bonds to a partially oxidized form with two disulfide bonds or to a fully reduced state where no disulfide bonds are present (7Palumaa P. Kangur L. Voronova A. Sillard R. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Voronova A. Kazantseva J. Tuuling M. Sokolova N. Sillard R. Palumaa P. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 53: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These forms vary in terms of structural features and of metal binding ability. The partially oxidized state can bind one Cu(I) ion (Cu1(I)Cox172S-S hereafter), whereas the fully oxidized state is not able to bind copper (7Palumaa P. Kangur L. Voronova A. Sillard R. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The structure of Cox17 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was recently determined (9Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Abajian C. Yatsunyk L.A. Ramirez B.E. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53584-53592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). From this characterization it results that Cox17 has a structural organization with an α-helical hairpin domain preceded by an unstructured N-terminal segment (9Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The fully reduced form is on the contrary present in a molten globule state where the six free cysteines cooperatively bind four Cu(I) ions forming a tetracopper-thiolate cluster (Cu(I)4Cox17 hereafter) (7Palumaa P. Kangur L. Voronova A. Sillard R. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R.

Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found in yeast that Cox17 import into the IMS is catalyzed by a disulfide relay system involving Mia40 and Erv1 proteins, which favor the formation of the partially oxidized Cox172S-S state (12Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It has been also found in vitro that Cu(I)1Cox172S-S and not Cu(I)4Cox17 transfers Cu(I) to apoWT-HSco1 (13Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Leontari I. Martinelli M. Palumaa P. Sillard R. Wang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the Cox172S-S form is the active state in the copper transfer within the IMS. In this paper we report the structural characterization of human Cox17 in the partially (HCox172S-S hereafter) and fully oxidized (HCox173S-S hereafter) states. The effect of reducing agents on HCox173S-S was also investigated. Finally, the structure and backbone dynamics of Cu(I)1HCox172S-S are reported and compared with those of apoHCox172S-S. Two consecutive cysteines binds copper(I) ion, and this is the first example of a Cys-Cys binding motif in copper proteins. Until now, the structure of the partially oxidized form (i.e. with two disulfides) is available only for the demetallated form of the yeast homologue (9Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Protein Production and Copper Binding—The hcox17 gene was amplified by PCR from a pET-11c expression vector already containing the human Cox17 cDNA (8Voronova A. Kazantseva J. Tuuling M. Sokolova N. Sillard R. Palumaa P. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 53: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The hcox17 gene was cloned into the Gateway Entry vector pENTR/tobacco etch virus/d-topoisomerase (Invitrogen), and subcloned into pETG-30A (European Molecular Biology Laboratory Protein Expression and Purification Facility) by Gateway LR reaction to generate an N-terminal, His-GST fused protein. The protein is expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Origami(DE3) cells (Stratagene), which were grown in Luria-Bertani and minimal medium ((15NH4)2SO4 and/or [13C]glucose) for the production of labeled samples. Protein expression was induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 298 K. Purification was performed by using a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Zn(II) ions. His-GST tag was cleaved with AcTEV proteases. The digested protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded in a 16/60 Superdex 75 chromatographic column (Amersham Biosciences) to separate HCox17 from the N-terminal His-GST domain. The fractions showing a single component by SDS/PAGE were collected, and the protein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay (14Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). The pure protein was obtained in the apo form as checked by inductively coupled plasma MS and ESI-MS. HCox17 protein expressed following the above mentioned procedure contains four additional amino acids (GSFT), corresponding to the TEV protease recognition site, at the N terminus. Recombinant native human Cox17, where the first Met is processed away posttranslationally, was used for ESI MS/MS analysis and was produced as already described (8Voronova A. Kazantseva J. Tuuling M. Sokolova N. Sillard R. Palumaa P. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 53: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The numbering of both HCox17 constructs follows the isolated, functional mammalian Cox17 sequences (15Chen Z.W. Bergman T. Ostenson C.G. Efendic S. Mutt V. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Takenouchi T. Fujimoto M. Shimamoto A. Munekata E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1472: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) where the first Met is processed away posttranslationally. Therefore, the HCox17 sequence numbering starts proline 1. The reduction of disulfide formed by the two consecutive cysteines, Cys22 and Cys23, is almost instantaneous upon addition of 1 mm DTT under nitrogen atmosphere. The apoHCox172S-S protein was then exchanged under anaeroboic conditions into 50 mm phosphate, 1 mm DTT buffer at pH 7.2 using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and then concentrated by ultrafiltration to produce the final NMR sample. The Cu(I) form was obtained under anaeroboic conditions by addition of a slight excess of (Cu(I)(CH3CN)4)PF6 directly to the final NMR apoHCox172S-S sample (0.5-1 mm). Copper excess was then removed dialyzing the sample against NMR buffer or through PD-10 desalting column. The NMR sample of the HCox173S-S form was obtained by air oxidation in about 2 days after the removal of 1 mm DTT, through PD-10 desalting column, from the final apoHCox172S-S sample. Far-UV CD spectra (190-260 nm) on the various forms of HCox17 were recorded on JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Each spectrum was obtained as the average of four scans and corrected by subtracting the contributions from the buffer. A 0.6 mm apoHCox172S-S sample was divided in different fraction and each one was incubated for 1 h under anaerobic atmosphere with different DTT concentrations (0, 15, and 20 mm). Each sample was then diluted in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, to obtain a 15-30 μm final protein concentration, and CD spectra were recorded. All of the steps were performed under nitrogen atmosphere using a degassed buffer. Quantitative estimate of the secondary structure contents was made by using the DICROPROT software package (17Deleage G. Geourjon C. Comp. Appl. Biosc. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar). ESI MS/MS Analysis of Disulfide Pattern in HCox17—Recombinant human Cox173S-S (35 μm) was reduced with 1 mm DTT in 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.5, for 1 min at 25 °C, and the resultant Cox172S-S was alkylated with 5 mm iodoacetamide (1 h at 25 °C in dark). Carboxamidomethylated Cox172S-S was desalted using HiTRAP™ desalting column (5 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) into 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.5, and two stable disulfides were reduced with 2 mm DTT at 55 °C (incubation time, 120 min). Resultant Cox170S-S with two covalently attached carboxamidomethyl groups was digested with trypsin (using ratio 1:20) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were separated on a reverse phase HPLC column Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.6 × 150 mm; bead size, 5 μm) by using a gradient from 5-40% of buffer B over 5 column volumes. Buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and buffer B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile. The fraction containing Cox17 peptide of 1530.73 Da (KPLKPCCACPETK, residues 17-29 with two covalently attached carboxamidomethyl groups) was injected at 5 μl/min into ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS instrument QSTAR Elite from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) and analyzed in TOF MS and Q-TOF MS/MS mode. In MS/MS experiment a doubly protonated peak at 766.38 Da was selected for fragmentation, and collision energy between 40 and 60 CE was applied. Obtained MS/MS data were analyzed by program Bioanalyst 2.0 from Applied Biosystems. Cu(I)1HCox172S-S was produced by adding two equivalents of Cu(I)DTT complex to 40 μm HCox172S-S, which was obtained by reduction of HCox173S-S as described above. Resultant Cu(I)1HCox172S-S was alkylated with 5 mm iodoacetamide after 120 min of incubation with copper ions. Carboxamidomethylated Cox172S-S was desalted, reduced, and trypsinolyzed as described above. Reaction products were separated by reverse phase HPLC as described above, and fraction containing Cox17 peptide of 3178.49-Da (PGLVD-SNPAPPESQEKKPLKPCCACPETK; residues 1-29 with two covalently attached carboxamidomethyl groups) was injected at 5 μl/min into ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS instrument QSTAR Elite from Applied Biosystems and analyzed in TOF MS and Q-TOF MS/MS mode. In MS/MS experiment a triply protonated peak at 1060.55 Da was selected for fragmentation, and collision energy between 40 and 60 CE was applied. Obtained MS/MS data were analyzed as described above. NMR Spectroscopy—All of the NMR experiments used for resonance assignment and structure calculations were performed on 0.5-1 mm 13C, 15N labeled HCox172S-S and HCox173S-S samples in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% D2O (plus 1 mm DTT for HCox172S-S) and are summarized in supplemental Table S1. All of the NMR spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR), and analyzed through CARA program (18Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. CANTINA Verlag, Goldau2004Google Scholar). The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of apoHCox172S-S, Cu1(I)HCox172S-S, and apoHCox173S-S are reported in supplemental Tables S2-S4. In particular, in both apo and Cu(I)1HCox172S-S forms, four cysteine residues, i.e. Cys25, Cys35, Cys44, and Cys54, have Cβ chemical shift values typical of cysteines engaged in disulfide bonds (Cβ25 = 40.6 (apo), 40.8 (Cu(I)), Cβ35 = 36.6 (apo), 36.6 (Cu(I)), Cβ44 = 39.5 (apo), 39.6 (Cu(I)), and Cβ54 = 38.8 (apo), 39.0 (Cu(I)) ppm) (19Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The two vicinal cysteines Cys22 and Cys23 are instead reduced (Cβ22 = 28.7 (Cu(I)) and Cβ23 = 25.7 (apo), 30.0 (Cu(I)) ppm). In HCox173S-S form, all of the cysteines have Cβ chemical shift values typical of cysteines engaged in disulfide bonds (Cβ22 = 46.5, Cβ23 = 46.0, Cβ25 = 40.7, Cβ35 = 36.6, Cβ44 = 39.5, and Cβ54 = 38.8 ppm). Structure calculations were performed with the software package ATNOS/CANDID/CYANA (20Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 21Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 22Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), using as input the amino acid sequence, the chemical shift lists, and three 1H, 1H NOE experiments: two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 13C-resolved NOESY, and three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY recorded at 800 and 900 MHz with a mixing time of 100 ms. The standard protocol with seven cycles of peak picking using ATNOS, NOE assignment with CANDID, and structure calculation with CYANA-2.1 (22Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) was applied. φ and ψ dihedral angle constraints were derived from the chemical shift index (23Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) and TALOS analysis (24Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). In each ATNOS/CANDID cycle, the angle constraints were combined with the updated NOE upper distance constraints in the input for the subsequent CYANA-2.1 structure calculation cycle. In the seventh ATNOS/CANDID/CYANA cycle, a total of 2366 or 2203 NOE cross-peaks were assigned from 2825 or 2555 peaks picked in the spectra of apoHCox172S-S and Cu1(I)HCox172S-S, respectively, which yielded 939 or 834 meaningful NOE upper distance limits. In addition, two disulfide bonds between Cys35 and Cys44 and between Cys25 and Cys54 were imposed, as resulted from their 13C chemical shift analysis, by adding two lower and two upper distance constraints of 2.0 and 2.1 Å, respectively, between the Sγ atoms. The copper(I) ion was finally included in the calculations of the copper-loaded form by adding a new residue in the amino acid sequence. This residue is formed from a chain of dummy atoms with zero van der Waals' radii, so that they can freely penetrate into the protein, and by one atom with a radius of 1.4 Å, which mimics the copper ion. The sulfur atoms of Cys ligands were linked to the metal ion through upper distance limits of 2.3 Å, according to the yeast Cox17 Sγ-Cu(I) distance (25Srinivasan C. Posewitz M.C. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7572-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This approach does not impose any fixed orientation of the ligands with respect to the copper ion. The 20 conformers with the lowest residual target function values were subjected to restrained energy minimization in explicit water with AMBER 8.0 (26Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Mertz K.M. Wang B. Pearlman D.A. Crowley M. Brozell S. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Mongan J. Hornak V. Cui G. Beroza P. Schafmeister C. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Kollman P.A. AMBER 8, Version 8. University of California, San Francisco, CA2004Google Scholar). NOE and torsion angle constraints were applied with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 32 kcal mol-1 rad-2, respectively. The force field parameters for the copper(I) ion and the ligands were adapted from those already reported for similar copper(I) sites in copper proteins (27Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Poger D. Fuchs H.J.R. Nedev H. Ferrand M. Crouzy S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The quality of the structures was evaluated using the programs PROCHECK, PROCHECK-NMR (29Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar), and WHATIF (30Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviation to the mean structure for the structured region of the protein (residues 24-61) is 0.32 ± 0.07 Å for the backbone and 0.74 ± 0.07 Å for all heavy atoms for apoHCox172S-S and 0.31 ± 0.09 Å for the backbone and 0.72 ± 0.11 Å for all heavy atoms for Cu1(I)HCox172S-S. The conformational and energetic analysis of both structures are reported in supplemental Tables S5 and S6. The atomic coordinates, structural restraints, and resonance assignments of apoHCox172S-S and Cu1(I)HCox172S-S have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank Resonance (PDB ID 2RN9 and 2RN8) and BioMagResBank (BRMB codes 11019 and 11020). Relaxation experiments were performed on 15N-labeled samples at 500 MHz. The 15N backbone longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates as well as heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs were measured as previously described (31Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar, 32Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). 15N relaxation parameters were then analyzed following the standard Tensor2 protocol (33Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Disulfide reduction of HCox172S-S and HCox173S-S forms was followed by NMR. To a 1:1 mixture of apo and Cu1(I)HCox172S-S or to HCox173S-S, both in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% D2O, up to 20 mm or 1 mm DTT was added stepwise in anaerobic conditions, respectively, and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired. Human Cox17 in the fully oxidized and partially oxidized states, i.e. with three or two disulfide bonds, shows 1H-15N HSQC spectra with good signal spreading in both the apo and Cu(I) bound forms but also with a number of signals clustered in the central region of the spectrum, which is typical of unfolded polypeptides (amide proton resonances clustered between 8 and 8.5 ppm) (Fig. 1). This suggests that the protein contains both structured and unstructured regions. From the chemical shift index (23Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) and 3J-coupling analysis, it appears indeed that all three protein forms have two helices (segments 26-38 and 45-57), whereas the rest of the protein is not in any secondary structure element. The NH signals clustered in the central region of 1H-15N HSQC spectra, which belong to the first 17 amino acids of the protein, experience negative 15N{1H} NOE values indicating that they are highly flexible (see below). The partially oxidized form of HCox17 has features similar to those of the yeast homologue (9Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The 13C resonances of all six cysteines have been assigned for the three Cox17 forms, with the exception of Cys22 in the apoHCox172S-S state. In both apo and Cu(I)1HCox172S-S, the chemical shifts of the Cβ atoms of Cys25, Cys35, Cys44, and Cys54 are typical of cysteines engaged in disulfide bonds (19Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas those of Cys22 and Cys23 in the Cu(I) form and of Cys23 in the apo form (Cys22 is not detected) are typical of cysteines in the reduced state. On the contrary, in the HCox173S-S state, the chemical shifts of the Cβ atoms of all Cys indicate that all the cysteines are engaged in disulfide bonds. Few NH signals of HCox172S-S exhibit significant spectral variations upon Cu(I) addition (Fig. 2), the most dramatic ones being for residues 20-24, which comprise the metal binding motif Cys22-Cys23. These residues indeed experience, upon metal addition, either large chemical shift variations (Lys20 and Ala24) (Fig. 2) or the appearance of their NH signals (Cys22 and Cys23), which are not observed in the apo state (Fig. 1). A similar trend is observed going from the partially oxidized HCox172S-S state toward fully oxidized HCox173S-S one. Significant spectral changes are indeed observed only in the vicinity of the two Cys involved in the formation of the third disulfide bond, where either chemical shift variations (A24) (Fig. 2) or the appearance of the NH signal of Cys23 are occurring (Fig. 1). These data suggest that both copper(I) binding to HCox172S-S as well as the formation of the third disulfide essentially determines local structural changes restricted to the Cys22-Cys23-Ala24 region. However, at variance with the HCox172S-S state, in HCox173S-S some NHs (Gly59, Leu58, Met55, Lys30, Glu27, and Cys25) located in the vicinity of the Cys22-Cys23-Ala24 motif display two conformations as detected in the 1H-15N HSQC map (Fig. 1), indicating that the disulfide bond formation determines a structural heterogeneity in the surrounding of this region. Double conformations have been reported to occur for disulfide bonds as a result of their isomerization (34Otting G. Liepinsh E. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3571-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The structures of apoHCox172S-S, Cu1(I)HCox172S-S, and apoHCox173S-S have the coiled coil-helix-coiled coil-helix structural motif (CHCH) (Fig. 3) as observed in the yeast homologue (9Arnesano F.

This structural motif is predicted to be common to several mitochondrial proteins like Cox19 (35Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Identification of NCR ligands and their level of expression on normal and neoplastic cells has important implications for the rational design of immunotherapy strategies for cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we analyze the expression of NKp30 ligand and NKp44 ligand on 30 transformed or non-transformed cell lines of different origin. We find intracellular and surface expression of these two ligands on almost all cell lines tested. Expression of NKp30 and NKp44 ligands was variable and did not correlate with the origin of the cell line. Expression of NKp30 and NKp44 ligand correlated with NKp30 and NKp44-mediated NK cell lysis of tumor cells, respectively. The surface expression of NKp30 ligand and NKp44 ligand was sensitive to trypsin treatment and was reduced in cells arrested in G2/M phase. Conclusion/Significance These data demonstrate the ubiquitous expression of the ligands for NKp30 and NKp44 and give an important insight into the regulation of these ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2128521182,"Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans that resides commensally on epithelial surfaces, but can cause inflammation when pathogenic. Resolvins are a class of anti-inflammatory lipids derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that attenuate neutrophil migration during the resolution phase of inflammation. In this report we demonstrate that C. albicans biosynthesizes resolvins that are chemically identical to those produced by human cells. In contrast to the trans-cellular biosynthesis of human Resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvE1 biosynthesis in C. albicans occurs in the absence of other cellular partners. C. albicans biosynthesis of RvE1 is sensitive to lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 monoxygenase inhibitors. We show that 10nM RvE1 reduces neutrophil chemotaxis in response to IL-8; 1nM RvE1 enhanced phagocytosis of Candida by human neutrophils, as well as intracellular ROS generation and killing, while having no direct affect on neutrophil motility. In a mouse model of systemic candidiasis, RvE1 stimulated clearance of the fungus from circulating blood. These results reveal an inter-species chemical signaling system that modulates host immune functions and may play a role in balancing host carriage of commensal and pathogenic C. albicans."
https://openalex.org/W2018304918,"Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a member of the nuclear protein kinase family, which induces both p53- and CtBP-mediated apoptosis. Levels of HIPK2 were increased by UV irradiation and cisplatin treatment, thereby implying the degradation of HIPK2 in cells under normal conditions. Here, we indicate that HIPK2 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the WD40-repeat/SOCS box protein WSB-1, a process that is blocked under DNA damage conditions. Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted to identify the proteins that interact with HIPK2. WSB-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was characterized as an HIPK2-interacting protein. The coexpression of WSB-1 resulted in the degradation of HIPK2 via its C-terminal region. Domain analysis of WSB-1 showed that WD40-repeats and the SOCS box were required for its interaction with and degradation of HIPK2, respectively. In support of the degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1, HIPK2 was polyubiquitinated by WSB-1 in vitro and in vivo. The knockdown of endogenous WSB-1 with the expression of short hairpin RNA against WSB-1 increases the stability of endogenous HIPK2 and resulted in the accumulation of HIPK2.

UV-induced apoptosis is understood via the action of HIPK2 at the molecular level. HIPK2 is activated and stabilized by UV irradiation and selectively phosphorylates p53 at Ser-46. Thus, the kinase function of HIPK2 increases the expression of p53-target genes and enhances UV-induced apoptosis (7D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M.

Additionally, HIPK2 phosphorylates the Ser-422 of CtBP, and phosphorylated CtBP is degraded via the 26 S proteasome pathway, resulting in apoptosis in p53-deficient cells (19Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Endogenous HIPK2 protein is barely detected and is induced by UV irradiation or treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, whereas the levels of HIPK2 mRNA remained unchanged under identical conditions (20Di Stefano V.

However, it remains to be determined whether HIPK2 is degraded at the protein level, nor is it understood which molecule is responsible for the tight control of HIPK2 levels in cells under normal conditions. homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 Skp1-Cullin-F-box ElonginB/C-Cul2/5-SOCS suppressor of cytokine signaling box green fluorescent protein Myc epitope tag glutathione S-transferase ubiquitin ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin ligase amino acid(s) hemagglutinin short hairpin RNA. homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 Skp1-Cullin-F-box ElonginB/C-Cul2/5-SOCS suppressor of cytokine signaling box green fluorescent protein Myc epitope tag glutathione S-transferase ubiquitin ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin ligase amino acid(s) hemagglutinin short hairpin RNA. The highly controlled degradation of proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway represents a key mechanism for a variety of cellular activities, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The ubiquitination of proteins requires three enzymes: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; and E3, ubiquitin ligase (22Ciechanover A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 23Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). Among them, the ubiquitin ligase has specificity and recognizes the target protein. The majority of eukaryotes harbor a single E1 enzyme, several E2 enzymes, and a large and more diverse class of E3 enzymes. Several domains have been associated with E3 enzyme activity. The best known examples are the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) and the ECS (ElonginB/C-Cul2/5-SOCS) ubiquitin ligase complexes. The SCF ubiquitin ligases are a family of multisubunit RING finger E3 enzymes in which an F-box protein is responsible for substrate recognition. F-box proteins interact with the core SCF complexes via their common N-terminal F-box motif and harbor a C-terminal protein-protein interaction motif, typically WD40 repeats or leucine-rich repeats (24Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 25Vodermaier H.C. Curr.

The SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) box-containing proteins function as adaptors that link substrates to the ElonginB/C-Cullin complex (26Heuze M.L. Guibal F.C. Banks C.A. Conaway J.W.

In addition to the SOCS box, SOCS box proteins harbor a variety of protein-protein interaction domains, including the β-domain, WD40 repeats, and ankyrin motifs that bind to substrates. Thus far, at least twenty proteins have been determined to harbor a C-terminal SOCS box. These proteins fall into five classes based on the protein motifs found in the N-terminal region of the SOCS box (28Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S.

WSB-1 and WSB-2 have been classified as part of a new family; members of this family harbor seven WD40 repeats and an SOCS box in the N terminus and C terminus of a protein, respectively. Although the domain organization and the interactions of WSB-1 with ElonginB/C are very well understood, investigators have only recently undertaken studies to determine whether WSB-1 can function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and to investigate the potential target molecules of WSB-1 (29Dentice M.

In this study, we show that WSB-1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets HIPK2 for degradation via the 26 S proteasome pathway. We determined that WSB-1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of HIPK2, a process in which both WD40 repeats and the SOCS box are required for the recognition and degradation of HIPK2. WSB-1-mediated degradation of HIPK2 was blocked in DNA-damaged cells, which provide regulatory mechanisms by which the HIPK2 levels are tightly controlled in cells under normal conditions, and DNA damage stresses overcome the degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1. Cell Culture and Transfection–U2OS, RKO, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For immunoblot analysis, HEK293 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates, and DNA transfection was carried out using the N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline version of the calcium phosphate procedure. U2OS and RKO cells were transfected with Fugene6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described above, on 6-well plates. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis–The full-length human WSB-1 EST clone was purchased from Invitrogen (clone ID 4865448). The full open-reading frames of WSB-1 were PCR-amplified from human WSB-1 with specific primers, and the DNA fragment was inserted into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pEntr3C. Various WSB-1 deletion mutants were constructed by insertion of each PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pEntr3C. Various HIPK2 deletion constructs and GFP-HIPK2 plasmid have been described previously (5Kim E.A. Noh Y.T. Ryu M.J. Kim H.T. Lee S.E. Kim C.H. Lee C. Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. J. Biol.

The Myc-WSB-1, GFP-WSB-1, His-WSB-1, and GST-WSB-1 plasmids were constructed by Gateway Technology (Invitrogen) with pEntr-WSB-1. The point mutant of WSB-1 for the WD40 domain was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutagenesis was conducted on the pEntr-derived WSB-1 plasmid, and GST-WSB-1 mutant expression plasmid was generated using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). WSB-1 shRNA plasmid was constructed by inserting double-stranded oligonucleotides, which harbor the WSB-1 sequence (5′-GCTGTAAAGTGCAAGGAAATT-3′), into the BglII and HindIII sites of pSUPER (OligoEngine), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening–For bait construction, a DNA fragment encoding amino acids 503–1189 of HIPK2 was subcloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech) and transformed into the yeast strain, AH109, followed by mating with yeast Y187 cells pretransformed with mouse embryonic day 11 cDNA library (Clontech). Approximately 107 transformants were screened, and the positive colonies were confirmed with β-galactosidase colony lift assays. The yeast plasmids were isolated and transformed into Escherichia coli, DH5α. The isolated yeast DNA was co-transformed with a bait plasmid into AH109 to verify the interactions between HIPK2 and the interacting proteins. The specific interaction and binding strengths of the two fusion proteins were verified by the streaking of several colonies onto synthetic drop-out agar plates lacking TL (tryptophan and leucine) or TLH (tryptophan, leucine, and histidine). In Vitro Ubiquitination–For the in vitro ubiquitination assay, affinity-purified GST-WSB-1 was mixed with in vitro translated Myc-HIPK2 as a substrate, and mixtures were added to the ubiquitin ligation reaction (final volume, 30 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 8 μg of purified ubiquitin (Sigma), 0.5 μg of E1 (Boston Biochem), and 1 μg of His-Ubc5c. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and were terminated by boiling for 7 min in SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The ubiquitinated HIPK2 proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. In Vitro Pull-down Assays–The GST-fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli. BL21(DE3) cells, and were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The domains of Myc-HIPK2 proteins were synthesized by using the coupled TnT in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Synthesized proteins were incubated with GST-WSB-1 (aa 284–421) at 4 °C for 1 h in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting–The co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins was performed after the lysis of 2 × 107 cells in high salt lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). After incubation on ice for 10 min and centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, equal volumes of protein were diluted with lysis buffer lacking NaCl (dilution buffer), then incubated overnight with antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Myc (Invitrogen), anti-HA (Invitrogen), anti-WSB-1 (Abnova, Taiwan), and anti-HIPK2 antibody (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA). After the priming antibodies were washed, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), followed by detection with ECL Western blotting detection solutions (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry–Immunostaining of RKO cells was performed as described previously (5Kim E.A. Noh Y.T. Ryu M.J. Kim H.T. Lee S.E. Kim C.H. Lee C. Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. J. Biol.

In brief, U2OS cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 0.05 μg of EGFP-C2 plasmid and 1.5 μg of the WSB-1 shRNA expression plasmid. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min at –20 °C and incubated with anti-HIPK2 antibody after the blocking of cells with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope, using excitation wavelengths of 543 nm (rhodamine red) and 488 nm (GFP). The acquired images were processed with Adobe Photoshop. Identification of WSB-1 as HIPK2-interacting Protein–It is known that the levels of HIPK2 protein are increased as the result of UV irradiation and cisplatin treatment, both of which are genotoxic stresses that induce DNA damage (7D'Orazi G.

However, it remains to be determined whether HIPK2 is stabilized in protein levels by escaping from proteolysis, and which molecule is involved in this process. In an effort to ascertain the degradation of HIPK2 in cells under normal conditions, the cells expressing GFP-HIPK2 were exposed to UV, and the levels of HIPK2 were observed by GFP fluorescence. The intensity of GFP fluorescence from GFP-HIPK2 was increased via UV irradiation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The administration of DNA damage reagents, such as Adriamycin or cisplatin, to cells also resulted in induction of the endogenous HIPK2 protein level (Fig. 1, A (middle panel) and B, lanes 1–4). Furthermore, the treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, resulted in the accumulation of HIPK2 (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Taken together, our results show that HIPK2 may be degraded by proteolysis in cells under normal conditions. A yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted in an effort to identify potential cellular proteins that target HIPK2 for degradation. First, HIPK2 domains for proteolytic degradation were determined to construct a bait plasmid for yeast two-hybrid screening. Expression plasmids for either wild-type HIPK2, N-terminal HIPK2, or C-terminal HIPK2 were transfected into the HEK293 cells, and the protein levels were determined either prior to or after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. The protein levels of wild-type HIPK2 and C-terminal HIPK2, but not N-terminal HIPK2, were increased as the result of MG132 treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 6). This result indicates that HIPK2 is degraded by proteasome via its C terminus. Therefore, the C terminus of HIPK2-(503–1189) was utilized as bait for the screening of mouse embryonic match-maker cDNA libraries. Among the several cellular proteins that were identified and sequenced, a clone showed identity to WSB-1, a subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 2B). The isolated WSB-1 clone harbored a C-terminal domain (aa 284–421) that included two WD40 repeats and a SOCS box. The specific interactions between WSB-1 and HIPK2 were verified in the yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays in cultured cells (Fig. 2, B and C). GST pull-down analysis showed that WSB-1 interacted physically with HIPK2 (Fig. 2D). The association of endogenous HIPK2 with WSB-1 was also verified via co-immunoprecipitation with anti-HIPK2 antibody followed by Western blotting using anti-WSB-1 antibody (Fig. 2E). Collectively, our results show that WSB-1 is an HIPK2-interacting protein in vitro and in vivo and is associated with HIPK2 in cultured cells. Ubiquitination and Degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1–In an effort to determine whether WSB-1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase against HIPK2, Myc-HIPK2 expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells either with or without the WSB-1 expression plasmid. Transfected cells were chased with cycloheximide to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. At the indicated times after the addition of cycloheximide, the levels of the HIPK2 proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The stability of HIPK2 was markedly reduced by the coexpression of WSB-1 (Fig. 3A). Because the C terminus of HIPK2 was utilized as bait for yeast two-hybrid screening for the identification of WSB-1, HIPK2 domain for degradation by WSB-1 was determined. As had been expected, the C terminus (aa 503–1189) of HIPK2, but not the N terminus, was degraded by the coexpression of WSB-1 (Fig. 3B, lane 6). To ascertain the functional interaction of WSB-1 with HIPK2, ubiquitinations of HIPK2 by WSB-1 were explored under in vitro and in vivo conditions. HIPK2 was efficiently polyubiquitinated when HA-WSB-1 was expressed in cells along with HA-Ub (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Consistent with the above observations, affinity-purified GST-WSB-1 ubiquitinated Myc-HIPK2 only when all of E1, E2, ubiquitin, and WSB-1 were contained in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3D, lane 5). These results indicate that WSB-1 could function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase against HIPK2. Knockdown of Endogenous WSB-1 Increases HIPK2 Stability–Next, we assessed the effects of WSB-1 knockdown on the stability of HIPK2. RKO cells were transfected with increasing quantities of expression plasmids for shRNA against WSB-1, and WSB-1 levels were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-WSB-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, endogenous WSB-1 was silenced efficiently by the expression of shRNA against WSB-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The knockdown of endogenous WSB-1 concomitantly resulted in the elevation of endogenous HIPK2 levels (Fig. 4B, middle panel). Furthermore, HIPK2 stabilization was assessed in a single cell. To this end, U2OS cells were transfected with WSB-1 shRNA expression plasmids coupled with the GFP expression plasmid, and the expression levels of endogenous HIPK2 were observed by immunostaining using anti-HIPK2 antibody. The WSB-1 shRNA-expressing cells could be monitored indirectly by co-transfection of the GFP expression plasmid at a high ratio, of 1.5 μg (WSB-1 shRNA) to 0.05 μg (EGFP-C2). As shown in Fig. 4C, the GFP-positive cells expressed endogenous HIPK2 at a high level (middle panel, arrows), whereas the cells expressing either control shRNA (upper panel) or no GFP/shWSB-1 (middle panel, arrowhead) displayed relatively low HIPK2 levels. The administration, however, of MG132 to the cells resulted in a high level of endogenous HIPK2 expression, regardless of WSB-1 shRNA expression (lower panel). Taken together, these results showed that WSB-1 could degrade HIPK2 constantly in the cells under normal conditions. WSB-1 Interacts with HIPK2 through WD40 Repeats–WSB-1 is composed of seven WD40 repeats and an SOCS box in the C terminus (Fig. 5A). WD40 repeats have been shown to participate in diverse cellular functions, and the SOCS box is known to be involved in the protein degradation in the ECS ubiquitin ligase complex (34Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 35Chen G. Courey A.J.

To determine whether the WD40 domain and/or SOCS box of WSB-1 are required for its interaction with and degradation of HIPK2, a series of WSB-1 deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 5A) and utilized for the domain analysis of WSB-1. GST pulldown analysis with GST-HIPK2-(503–860) and Myc-tagged WSB-1 mutants showed that all of the deletion mutants of WSB-1 containing the WD40 repeat interacted with HIPK2 (Fig. 5B). The binding of WSB-1 was specific to GST-HIPK2, as we noted no binding of WSB-1 to the GST protein (middle panel). Consistently, both N-terminal WSB-1 (aa 1–279, 1–5th WD40 repeats) and C-terminal WSB-1 (aa 200–421, 4–7th WD40 repeats and SOCS box) were associated with full-length HIPK2 in cultured cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 5–8). However, the SOCS box of WSB-1 did not bind to HIPK2 in vitro (Fig. 5B, lower panel, lane 5) and yeast two-hybrid analysis (data not shown). These results indicate that WD40 repeats are responsible for the interaction of WSB-1 with HIPK2. WSB-1 harbors seven WD40 repeats, spanning majority of the protein (Fig. 5A). Six of the WD40 repeats (second to seventh WD40) contain a few mismatches from the consensus sequence (37Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F.

https://openalex.org/W2094842273,"When learning to perform a novel sensorimotor task, humans integrate multi-modal sensory feedback such as vision and proprioception in order to make the appropriate adjustments to successfully complete the task. Sensory feedback is used both during movement to control and correct the current movement, and to update the feed-forward motor command for subsequent movements. Previous work has shown that adaptation to stable dynamics is possible without visual feedback. However, it is not clear to what degree visual information during movement contributes to this learning or whether it is essential to the development of an internal model or impedance controller.We examined the effects of the removal of visual feedback during movement on the learning of both stable and unstable dynamics in comparison with the case when both vision and proprioception are available. Subjects were able to learn to make smooth movements in both types of novel dynamics after learning with or without visual feedback. By examining the endpoint stiffness and force after learning it could be shown that subjects adapted to both types of dynamics in the same way whether they were provided with visual feedback of their trajectory or not. The main effects of visual feedback were to increase the success rate of movements, slightly straighten the path, and significantly reduce variability near the end of the movement.These findings suggest that visual feedback of the hand during movement is not necessary for the adaptation to either stable or unstable novel dynamics. Instead vision appears to be used to fine-tune corrections of hand trajectory at the end of reaching movements."
https://openalex.org/W2001389812,"Endocannabinoids are well established as inhibitors of chemical synaptic transmission via presynaptic activation of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R). Contrasting this notion, we show that dendritic release of endocannabinoids mediates potentiation of synaptic transmission at mixed (electrical and chemical) synaptic contacts on the goldfish Mauthner cell. Remarkably, the observed enhancement was not restricted to the glutamatergic component of the synaptic response but also included a parallel increase in electrical transmission. This effect involved the activation of CB1 receptors and was indirectly mediated via the release of dopamine from nearby varicosities, which in turn led to potentiation of the synaptic response via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated postsynaptic mechanism. Thus, endocannabinoid release can potentiate synaptic transmission, and its functional roles include the regulation of gap junction-mediated electrical synapses. Similar interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may be widespread and potentially relevant for the motor and rewarding effects of cannabis derivatives.

Similar interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may be widespread and potentially relevant for the motor and rewarding effects of cannabis derivatives. Endocannabinoids, diffusible retrograde lipidic messengers, regulate the strength of chemical synapses (reviewed in Chevaleyre et al., 2006Chevaleyre V. Takahashi K.A. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CNS.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 37-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The central actions of both endogenous (typically anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol) and exogenous (i.e., derivatives of marijuana products) cannabinoids are generally mediated by activation of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) (Freund et al., 2003Freund T.F. Katona I. Piomelli D. Role of endogenous cannabinoids in synaptic signaling.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1017-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). This receptor constitutes one of the most abundant G protein-coupled receptors in the mammalian brain and, although widespread, is heavily expressed in basal ganglia and prefrontal cortices, where dopamine regulation is believed to be essential for both motor control and reward mechanisms (Van der Stelt and Di Marzo, 2003Van der Stelt M.

Regardless of the nature of the synapse (excitatory or inhibitory), the involved brain structure, or the duration of the effect (short or long term), endocannabinoids have been mostly reported to promote depression of synaptic transmission via a presynaptic mechanism (Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001Kreitzer A.C.

Thus, release of endocannabinoids and/or activation of CB1Rs are expected to trigger synaptic depression, suggesting a general role in downregulating chemical synaptic transmission within neural circuits across the nervous system. In contrast, no effects of the CB1 signaling system on gap junction-mediated electrical synapses have been reported. Because of their accessibility to in vivo experimentation, identifiable auditory afferents terminating as mixed synaptic contacts on the lateral dendrite of the goldfish Mauthner (M) cell known as Large Myelinated Club endings (“Club endings”) constitute a valuable model for the study of basic mechanisms of electrical and chemical transmission in vertebrates (reviewed in Pereda et al., 2004Pereda A.E.

The M cells are a pair of unusually large reticulospinal neurons located in the medulla of teleosts and are essential for the organization of sensory-evoked escape responses (Korn and Faber, 2005Korn H. Faber D.S. The Mauthner cell half a century later: a neurobiological model for decision-making?.Neuron. 2005; 47: 13-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). While excitatory chemical transmission at Club endings is mediated by glutamate (Wolszon et al., 1997Wolszon L.R. Pereda A.E. Faber D.S. A fast synaptic potential mediated by NMDA and non-NMDA receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 2693-2706PubMed Google Scholar), electrical transmission is mediated via homotypic connexin 35 (Cx35) gap junction channels (Pereda et al., 2003Pereda A. O'Brien J. Nagy J.I. Bukauskas F. Davidson K.G. Kamasawa N. Yasumura T. Rash J.E. Connexin35 mediates electrical transmission at mixed synapses on Mauthner cells.J.

Remarkably, synapses at these terminals are highly modifiable and undergo activity-dependent potentiation of both the electrical and chemical components of their postsynaptic response (Yang et al., 1990Yang X.D.

Chemical synaptic activity modulates nearby electrical synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 4849-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This potentiation is triggered by brief bursts of afferent activity and requires the activation of NMDA receptors and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (Pereda et al., 1998Pereda A.E. Bell T.D.

Neurochem. 2005; 95: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we asked whether endocannabinoids and CB1Rs were involved in promoting depression at these synapses, an essential requirement for the bidirectional control of the synaptic strength at these auditory afferents. Unexpectedly, we found that dendritic endocannabinoid release leads to potentiation of both electrical and chemical transmission at Club endings. This potentiating effect requires activation of CB1Rs and is indirectly mediated by dopamine release from nearby varicosities, which in turn leads to potentiation of the synaptic response. Electrical stimulation of the posterior branch of the VIIIth nerve (where auditory afferents that terminate as Club endings run) evokes a distinct excitatory synaptic potential (“mixed EPSP”; Figure 1A) composed of an early, brief gap junction-mediated electrical component (representing the electrical coupling of the presynaptic action potentials) and a delayed, longer-lasting glutamatergic response. These two components of the synaptic potential can be unambiguously identified and reliably measured during intracellular dendritic recordings due to the brief membrane time constant of the postsynaptic M cell, estimated as ∼400 μs (Fukami et al., 1965Fukami Y. Furukawa T. Asada Y. Excitability changes of the Mauthner cell during collateral inhibition.J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 48: 581-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Endocannabinoids mediate their central regulatory actions via CB1Rs, and their activation is expected to depress chemical synaptic transmission (Chevaleyre et al., 2006Chevaleyre V. Takahashi K.A. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CNS.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 37-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that CB1R activation would lead to depression of the chemical component of the mixed EPSP. Instead, we found that bath application of WIN 55,212-2, a CB1R agonist, led to a long-lasting enhancement of both components (Figures 1B and 1C), averaging 136.4% ± 9.9%, p < 0.01, and 149.8% ± 13.0%, p < 0.01, of control values for the electrical and chemical components, respectively (n = 8). The parallel changes in both modalities of transmission cannot be ascribed to increased input resistance of the M cell lateral dendrite, as the amplitude of the antidromically evoked M cell spike (a reliable estimate of this cell's resistance due to the lack of active electrogenesis in soma-dendritic membrane) remained unchanged, averaging 102.6% ± 4.0% of its control value (n = 8). In addition, the observed percent increases for each synaptic component were consistently different across experiments (ANOVA, F 54.85, F crit 3.93, p < 0.001), indicating that both forms of transmission were, although simultaneously affected, differentially modified by CB1R activation. The enhancements were blocked by pretreatment with a combination of the CB1R antagonists AM251 (AM; 4 μM) and SR141716 (SR; 4 μM), confirming that the observed effects were mediated via CB1R activation (Figure 1D; electrical: 106.2% ± 5.7%, p > 0.1; chemical: 111.7% ± 7.3%, p > 0.1; n = 8). As with previous studies in this preparation (Pereda and Faber, 1996Pereda A.E. Faber D.S. Activity-dependent short-term enhancement of intercellular coupling.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 983-992PubMed Google Scholar, Wolszon et al., 1997Wolszon L.R. Pereda A.E. Faber D.S. A fast synaptic potential mediated by NMDA and non-NMDA receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 2693-2706PubMed Google Scholar), we chose to use a combination of blockers to overcome possible differences in drug potency related to structural differences between the mammalian CB1R and its teleost orthologs, which share homology of 59% to 72% (Yamaguchi et al., 1996Yamaguchi F. Macrae A.D. Brenner S. Molecular cloning of two cannabinoid type 1-like receptor genes from the puffer fish Fugu rubripes.Genomics. 1996; 35: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, McPartland et al., 2007McPartland J.M.

Genomics. 2007; 277: 555-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, application of CB1R antagonists (Figure 1E) did not evoke changes in the amplitude of either component of the mixed EPSP (electrical: 98.4% ± 7.5%, p > 0.5; chemical: 110.0% ± 13.2%, p > 0.1; n = 8), indicating that endocannabinoids are not tonically released in this system. The effects of bath application of WIN could result from activation of CB1Rs expressed on remotely located neurons, so we asked whether local extracellular application to the surrounding area of the M cell dendrite could evoke similar enhancements of the synaptic response. For this purpose, a second recording pipette with a solution containing WIN was positioned in the vicinity of these terminals in the distal portion of the lateral dendrite (Figure 2A). Brief local application of WIN was sufficient to trigger a long-lasting enhancement of the mixed EPSP (Figure 2A; electrical: 146.5% ± 10.5%, p < 0.01; chemical: 148.0% ± 13.0%, p < 0.05; n = 6). These increases did not result from continued activation of CB1Rs, a possibility raised by the lipophilic nature of WIN, because they were not modified by subsequent bath application of the CB1R antagonists AM and SR (n = 3; data not shown). Local WIN application suggested that endocannabinoids could mediate their actions via activation of CB1Rs located in the proximity of these terminals. Immunohistochemical studies with polyclonal antibodies raised against either the first 14 (anti-CB1 1–14), the first 77 amino acids (anti-CB1 1–77), or the carboxy terminus (anti-CB1-CT) of the rat CB1R showed distinct punctate labeling near the distal portion of the lateral dendrite (Figures 2 and 7A) in the immediate vicinity of Club endings. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 2B, where the position of Club endings along the membrane of the M cell lateral dendrite is revealed by an antibody against Cx35 (anti-Cx35/36). Interestingly, CB1-labeled puncta (anti-CB1 1–77), although very close, do not appear to be on either the Club ending or the M cell membranes (Figure 2C), a distribution more clearly observed in side views of these terminals (Figure 2D). The distribution of CB1-labeled puncta resembles the dopaminergic varicosities that surround Club endings at the distal portion of the M cell lateral dendrite (Figure 3A). Previous studies revealed that dopaminergic varicosities lie in close proximity (within a few microns) to the M cell and Club ending membranes and that brief local dopamine application evokes long-lasting enhancements of both components of the synaptic response (Pereda et al., 1992Pereda A. Triller A. Korn H. Faber D.S. Dopamine enhances both electrotonic coupling and chemical excitatory postsynaptic potentials at mixed synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 12088-12092Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These enhancements require activation of dopamine D1/5 receptors (D1/5Rs) that act via a postsynaptic PKA phosphorylation pathway (Pereda et al., 1994Pereda A.E. Nairn A.C. Wolszon L.R. Faber D.S. Postsynaptic modulation of synaptic efficacy at mixed synapses on the Mauthner cell.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3704-3712PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the synaptic enhancements evoked by WIN application are mediated via dopamine release from nearby varicosities. Pretreatment with the D1/5R antagonist SCH-23390 (50 μM) prevented WIN-evoked enhancements of the mixed EPSP (Figure 3B; electrical: 94.4% ± 7.4%, p > 0.1; chemical: 98.2% ± 10.4%, p > 0.5; n = 8). Consistent with this hypothesis, WIN-evoked enhancements of the mixed EPSP were also blocked by intracellular application of PKI 5-24 (PKI), a specific PKA inhibitory peptide (Figure 3C; electrical: 89.4%, ± 6.6%, p > 0.1; chemical: 88.4% ± 6.0%, p > 0.1; n = 5). Furthermore, the synaptic enhancement evoked by bath application of WIN occluded the effects of locally applied dopamine (Figure 3D; n = 3), suggesting that both forms of potentiation share common mechanisms. In contrast, WIN-evoked enhancements did not occlude the long-term potentiation triggered by stimulating the posterior VIIIth nerve with brief (10 ms) high-frequency (500 Hz) trains (Figure 3D), which is known to follow a different, Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling pathway (Pereda et al., 1998Pereda A.E.

USA. 1998; 95: 13272-13277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because endocannabinoids have limited diffusion properties, estimated to be ∼10–20 μm in rodent hippocampus at 20°C–22°C (Wilson and Nicoll, 2001Wilson R.I. Nicoll R.A. Endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signalling at hippocampal synapses.Nature. 2001; 410: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003Chevaleyre V.

Furthermore, because the synthesis and release of endocannabinoids usually takes place at postsynaptic cells, often following activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (Maejima et al., 2001Maejima T.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4865-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that endocannabinoids are released from the M cell dendrite. Accordingly, immunochemical analysis with confocal microscopy and an mGluR1α antibody (anti-mGluR1) revealed strong labeling at Club ending synapses (Figure 4A). Interestingly, labeling was not restricted to the periphery of these mixed contacts, where chemical synapses are located (Pereda et al., 2003Pereda A. O'Brien J. Nagy J.I. Bukauskas F. Davidson K.G. Kamasawa N. Yasumura T. Rash J.E. Connexin35 mediates electrical transmission at mixed synapses on Mauthner cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7489-7503PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an extrasynaptic distribution of mGluR1 receptors (i.e., beyond the limits of chemical synaptic domains but within the boundaries of the contact; Figures 4B and 4C). Despite the presence of mGluR1 receptors, local application of (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; 1 mM), a group I mGluR receptor agonist, did not result in an enhancement of the mixed EPSP (Figure 4D; electrical: 90.8% ± 10.4%, p > 0.1; chemical: 87.8% ± 11.1%, p > 0.1; n = 6). Endocannabinoids are also known to be released following postsynaptic depolarizations (Ohno-Shosaku et al., 2001Ohno-Shosaku T. Maejima T. Kano M.

However, as with DHPG applications, strong dendritic depolarizations (five pulses of 5 s duration and 90 nA of intensity) expected to bring the membrane potential to about 0 mV (Experimental Procedures) did not elicit changes in the amplitude of either component (Figure 4E; electrical: 108.0% ± 8.9%, p > 0.1; chemical: 92.9% ± 6.3%, p > 0.1; n = 6). However, recent evidence shows that these manipulations can cooperate for the release of endocannabinoids (Ohno-Shosaku et al., 2002Ohno-Shosaku T. Shosaku J. Tsubokawa H. Kano M. Cooperative endocannabinoid production by neuronal depolarization and group I metabotropic glutamate receptor activation.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We found that when local application of DHPG was followed by dendritic depolarization, it successfully triggered lasting potentiations of the mixed EPSP (Figure 4F; electrical: 151.1% ± 11.5%, p < 0.01; chemical: 148.1% ± 15.0%, p < 0.05; n = 6). This protocol was more efficient (occurring in 100% of the trials) when dendritic depolarizations were applied 10 min after local application of DHPG (Figure 4F). This is likely due to the diffusion time required for this agonist to reach a significant number of the synaptic contacts, which are distributed along an ∼250 μm length of the M cell lateral dendrite. Consistent with this potentiation being mediated by endocannabinoid release, the observed effects were blocked by pretreatment with the CB1R antagonists AM and SR (Figure 4G; electrical: 108.7% ± 4.6%, p > 0.1; chemical: 105.6% ± 6.1%, p > 0.1; n = 6). Given the properties of the mixed synaptic responses, the combined requirement of mGluR activation and dendritic depolarization suggested that patterns of activity of Club endings could be responsible for endocannabinoid release under natural conditions. Club endings represent the overwhelming majority of the excitatory inputs in this portion of the M cell lateral dendrite, and the electrical component of their mixed EPSP evokes a large dendritic depolarization that is immediately followed by a glutamatergic response (the depolarization produced by the electrical component is generally four to five times bigger than that of the glutamatergic response; Figure 5A). Therefore, we asked whether patterns of stimulation of the posterior VIIIth nerve could trigger long-term enhancement of the synaptic response. We found that repetitive activity at 100 Hz, a frequency known to promote endocannabinoid release in other systems (Maejima et al., 2001Maejima T. Hashimoto K. Yoshida T. Aiba A. Kano M.

Associative short-term synaptic plasticity mediated by endocannabinoids.Neuron. 2005; 45: 419-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), evoked long-term potentiation of the mixed EPSP (Figure 5B; electrical: 161.1% ± 14.0%, p < 0.05; chemical: 178.6% ± 18.2%, p < 0.05; n = 5; antidromic spike was unchanged: 97.7% ± 8.0%). This prolonged pattern of activity resembled the conditions found for endocannabinoid release (Figure 4F) and was radically different from that used for the induction of a distinct “long-term potentiation,” which required brief bursts of 10 ms duration at 500 Hz over several minutes (Yang et al., 1990Yang X.D. Korn H. Faber D.S. Long-term potentiation of electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses.Nature. 1990; 348: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the potentiation triggered by this stimulating paradigm involved endocannabinoid release, as the observed effects were blocked by pretreatment with AM and SR (Figure 5C; electrical: 112.2% ± 17.7%, p > 0.5; chemical: 114.0% ± 16.3%, p > 0.1; n = 5). Thus, our results indicate that endocannabinoids are produced and released on demand from the M cell lateral dendrite as a result of the activity of Club endings, leading to long-term potentiation of both components of the synaptic response via CB1R activation. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) has been implicated in several forms of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian nervous system (Chevaleyre et al., 2006Chevaleyre V. Takahashi K.A. Castillo P.E. Endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity in the CNS.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 37-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether this endocannabinoid was also responsible for the observed potentiations at goldfish mixed synapses. To explore this possibility we tested the effects of tetrahydrolipstatin (THL; 100 μM), an inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase (DGL), which converts diacylglycerol into 2-AG, on the ability of the 100 Hz pattern of stimulation to evoke long-term changes in the synaptic strength. Intradendritic injections of THL prevented potentiation of the mixed EPSP (Figure 5D; electrical: 107.3% ± 6.6%, p > 0.1; chemical: 102.9% ± 7.0%, p > 0.5; n = 5). Our data suggest that the CB1R mediates its effects via dopamine release from nearby varicosities. To confirm this, we tested the effects of pretreatment with the D1/5R antagonist SCH-23390 (50 μM) on the ability of the 100 Hz stimulation protocol to evoke long-term changes in the synaptic strength at these terminals. As illustrated in Figure 5E, SCH-23390 prevented the potentiation of the mixed EPSP (electrical: 92.3% ± 3.7%, p > 0.1; chemical: 92.3% ± 4.3%, p > 0.1; n = 5). Thus, activity-dependent production of the endocannabinoid 2-AG at the M cell lateral dendrite is sufficient to trigger local dopamine release, which in turn evokes a long-term potentiation of the mixed synaptic response. Endocannabinoids are expected to suppress transmitter release by acting on presynaptic CB1Rs. In contrast, our data strongly suggest that activation of these receptors leads to increased dopamine release. A mechanism compatible with the well-establish"

SMN was recently proposed to have specific functions in mRNA transport and translation regulation in neuronal processes. The defective protein in Fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FMRP) also plays a role in transport of mRNPs and in their translation. Therefore, we examined possible relationships of SMN with FMRP. We observed granules containing both transiently expressed red fluorescent protein(RFP)-tagged SMN and green fluorescent protein(GFP)-tagged FMRP in cell bodies and processes of rat primary neurons of hypothalamus in culture. By immunoprecipitation experiments, we detected an association of FMRP with the SMN complex in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in murine motor neuron MN-1 cells. Then, by in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that the SMN protein is essential for this association. We showed that the COOH-terminal region of FMRP, as well as the conserved YG box and the region encoded by exon 7 of SMN, are required for the interaction.

The SMN complex is thought to function in multiple cellular pathways related to RNA metabolism. More precisely, the SMN complex may play a central role in the assembly and metabolism of various RNPs in cells (reviewed in Refs. 23Gubitz A.K. Feng W. Dreyfuss G. Exp.

Only a subset of these SMN granules also contains the Gemin proteins, indicating the presence of diverse SMN-containing multiprotein complexes in axons and dendrites (47Jablonka S. Bandilla M. Wiese S. Buhler D. Wirth B. Sendtner M. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Sharma A. Lambrechts A. Hao le T. Le T.T. Sewry C.A. Ampe C. Burghes A.H.

Local protein synthesis in axons and dendrites is crucial for axonal growth, pathfinding, and regeneration, as well as synapse formation and plasticity (reviewed in Refs. 54Job C. Eberwine J. Nat.

It was shown that SMN-deficient motor neurons have reduced axon outgrowth and pathfinding, as well as synapse dysfunction (2Monani U.R.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SMN protein was shown to interact with the RNA-binding protein hnRNP R (49Rossoll W. Kroning A.K. Ohndorf U.M. Steegborn C. Jablonka S. Sendtner M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Mourelatos Z. Abel L. Yong J. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5443-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and this interaction may be necessary for hnRNP R association with the 3′ untranslated region of β-actin mRNA and for efficient transport of this mRNA to growth cones (49Rossoll W. Kroning A.K. Ohndorf U.M. Steegborn C. Jablonka S. Sendtner M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Rossoll W. Jablonka S. Andreassi C. Kroning A.K. Karle K. Monani U.R. Sendtner M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations point out a possible function of the SMN protein, and perhaps of the SMN complex, in the assembly, translation regulation, and/or transport of localized mRNP complexes (reviewed in Refs. 2Monani U.R. Neuron. 2005; 48: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 43Briese M. Esmaeili B. Sattelle D.B.

One way to get additional insights into SMN function in transport and translation of mRNAs in dendrites and axons is to identify SMN protein partners that are known to be involved in these neuronal mechanisms. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is defective in the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome, has been shown to be a regulator of translation (Refs. 61Laggerbauer B. Ostareck D. Keidel E.M. Ostareck-Lederer A. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62Li Z. Zhang Y. Ku L. Wilkinson K.D. Warren S.T. Feng Y.

Med. 2006; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This RNA-binding protein shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that it may also be involved in RNA trafficking (66Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5408-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 67Eberhart D.E. Malter H.E. Feng Y. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 68Bardoni B. Sittler A. Shen Y. Mandel J.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite this shuttling property, FMRP is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, and is associated in an RNA-dependent manner with polyribosomes. In neurons, FMRP has been proposed to play a role in dendritic transport of some specific mRNAs and to regulate local protein synthesis in synapses in response to synaptic stimulation signals (for reviews, see Refs. 65Bardoni B. Davidovic L. Bensaid M. Khandjian E.W. Exp. Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar and 69Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In particular, exaggerated activation of protein synthesis by metabotropic glutamate receptors could be responsible for long term depression defects observed in the hippocampal neurons lacking FMRP (reviewed in Ref. 70Bear M.F. Huber K.M. Warren S.T. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). FMRP is also localized to growth cones of developing axons, and is proposed to be important for growth cone morphology and motility and for synapse formation (71Antar L.N. Li C. Zhang H. Carroll R.C. Bassell G.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 72Ferrari F. Mercaldo V. Piccoli G. Sala C. Cannata S. Achsel T. Bagni C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 34: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide experimental evidences for a physical association of the SMN complex with FMRP in neuronal cell extracts. The SMN and FMRP protein domains required for this association are identified by site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro assays. The biological significance of these data is supported by analysis of the respective localizations of the SMN and FMRP proteins in rat primary neurons of hypothalamus in culture. DNA Constructs and Antibodies—Plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged FMRP (pTL1 iso7 Flag-FMRP), His-tagged FMRP, His-tagged FMRP I304N, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged FMRP were described previously (73Sittler A.

Deletion into the pTL1 iso7 Flag-FMRP vector was generated by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides to produce pTL1 iso7 Flag-FMRPΔ470–485 vector, expressing FLAG-tagged FMRPΔ470–485 (deleted of amino acids 470 to 485), and iso7 Flag-FMRPΔ1–134 vector, expressing FLAG-tagged FMRPΔ1–134 (FMRPΔNDF) (deleted of the amino-terminal 134 amino acids). DNA fragments coding for FMRPΔ527–632 (FMRPΔRGG) (deleted of the carboxyl-terminal 106 amino acids) and FMRPΔ470–632 (deleted of the carboxyl-terminal 162 amino acids) were subcloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter into a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing an in-frame FLAG tag sequence at the amino terminus (FLAG-pcDNA3) (75Friesen W.J.

The GFP-FMRP and SMN-RFP constructs were generated with Gateway technology (Invitrogen). The plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged SMN WT (pcDNA3-Flag-SMN), GST-tagged SMN WT, SMNΔYG (deleted of the carboxyl-terminal 26 amino acids), SMNΔEx7 (deleted of amino acids encoded by exon 7), SMNΔTudor (deleted of amino acids encoded by exon 3), and SMNΔEx2B (deleted of amino acids encoded by exon 2B) were kind gifts from Gideon Dreyfuss (9Liu Q.

These constructs produce two bands, likely because translation starts at both the ATG tag and the native SMN ATG. The DNA fragment coding for SMNΔN27 (deleted of the amino-terminal 27 amino acids) was generated by PCR amplification using specific primers from the pcDNA3-Flag-SMN plasmid.

For production of GST-tagged Snurportin1 in bacteria, a DNA fragment corresponding to the open reading frame of Snurportin1 was generated by PCR amplification using specific primers, and cloned into the pGEX-6P-2 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). DNA fragments corresponding to the open reading frame of Gemin6 and Gemin7 were generated by PCR amplification using specific primers and genomic cDNA, and cloned downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter into the FLAG-pcDNA3 vector. For the generation of the stable cell line that expresses FLAG-tagged Gemin2, a DNA fragment coding for FLAG-tagged Gemin2 was generated by PCR amplification using specific primers from pcDNA3-Flag-Gemin2 plasmid and cloned into the pTRE2 plasmid downstream of a promoter containing the tetracycline-responsive element (BD Biosciences).

To elucidate its physiological function, we generated Isx-deficient mice by knocking in the β-galactosidase gene (LacZ) in the Isx locus (IsxLacZ/LacZ mice). LacZ staining of heterozygous (IsxLacZ/+) mice revealed that Isx was expressed abundantly in intestinal epithelial cells from duodenum to proximal colon. Quantitative mRNA expression profiling of duodenum and jejunum showed that β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase (EC1.14.99.36 Bcmo1) and the class B type I scavenger receptor, which are involved in vitamin A synthesis and carotenoid uptake, respectively, were drastically increased in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice. Although mild vitamin A deficiency decreased Isx expression in duodenum of wild-type (Isx+/+) mice, severe vitamin A deficiency decreased Isx mRNA expression in both duodenum and jejunum of Isx+/+ mice. On the other hand, vitamin A deficiency increased Bcmo1 expression in both duodenum and jejunum of Isx+/+ mice. However, Bcmo1 expression was not increased in duodenum of IsxLacZ/LacZ mice by mild vitamin A deficiency.

The epithelium of the small intestine comprises four types of cells: absorptive epithelial cells that absorb nutrients in the intestine, goblet cells that secrete mucus, Paneth cells that secrete antibacterial lysozyme, and gut endocrine cells that secrete various intestinal hormones (1Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. Dec. 1974; 141: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). All of these cells are known to differentiate from common stem cells located at the lower half of crypts. Regulation of various gene expression by transcription factors is essential in the process of differentiation of progenitor cells into functionally matured cells (2Bach S.P. Renehan A.G. Potten C.S.

We previously identified an HD transcription factor Dmbx1, which is expressed specifically in the brain during development (11Zhang Y. Miki T. Iwanaga T. Koseki Y. Okuno M. Sunaga Y. Ozaki N. Yano H. Koseki H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28065-28069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis (12Fujimoto W.

To identify an HD transcription factor resembling Dmbx-1, we screened the entire murine genomic data base and identified a genomic sequence encoding a novel HD transcription factor. This transcription factor was found to be specifically expressed in midgut-derived intestine and so was initially named midgut homeobox transcriptional factor 1. However, midgut homeobox transcriptional factor 1 was later shown to be identical to Isx (intestine-specific homeobox) by Choi et al. (13Choi M.Y. Romer A.I. Hu M. Lepourcelet M. Mechoor A. Yesilaltay A. Krieger M. Gray P.A. Shivdasani R.A. Development. 2006; 133: 4119-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). They reported that transgenic mice expressing Cdx2 in the stomach exhibited ectopic Isx expression in stomach and that homozygous Isx knock-out mice showed increased expression of SR-BI in duodenum and ileum. To clarify the physiological role of Isx, we generated Isx-deficient mice by knocking in LacZ in the Isx locus (IsxLacZ/LacZ mice) and found that expression of Bcmo1, a carotinoid cleavage enzyme that converts β-carotene to retinal (precursor of retinol and retinoic acid) (14Olson J.A. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1364-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 15Goodman D.S. Huang H.S. Science. 1965; 20: 879-880Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was drastically induced in duodenum and jejunum. We also found that although Bcmo1 expression was markedly induced in duodenum and jejunum of Isx+/+ mice by vitamin A deficiency, it was not increased in duodenum of IsxLacZ/LacZ mice. Thus, Isx participates in the maintenance of vitamin A metabolism by regulating Bcmo1 expression in the intestine. Generation of IsxLacZ/LacZ Mice and Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Isx–Isx knock-out (IsxLacZ/LacZ) mice (accession number CDB0475K, Center for Developmental Biology, RIKEN, Kobe, Japan) were generated by replacing the amino acid coding sequences in exon 1 of Isx with LacZ as described (supplemental Fig. S1). Embryonic stem cells used to generate germline chimera were TT2 (16Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Furuta Y. Nada S. Yoshida M. Tsukada T. Saga Y. Takeda N. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 68-76Google Scholar), and the mutant mice were backcrossed to mouse strain C57BL/6. All of the animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committees of Kobe University and the Center for Developmental Biology. The details of IsxLacZ/LacZ mice production will be provided upon request. Transgenic mice overexpressing Isx were generated by cross-breeding CAG-Cre mice (ubiquitously expressing Cre recombinase) (17Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In Situ Hybridization–Two nonoverlapping antisense oligonucleotide probes (45-mer in length) were designed for each mRNA of mouse Isx, Bcmo1, and SR-BI. The antisense probes used were complementary to the following sequences: 631–675 and 1031–1075 of mouse Isx (GenBank™ accession number AB219123); 427–471 and 1520–1564 of mouse Bcmo1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_021486); and 329–373 and 953–997 of mouse SR-BI (GenBank™ accession number NM_016741). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 10 h with a hybridization buffer containing 10,000 cpm/μl 33P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Sections were exposed by dipping in auroradiographic emulsion (NTB-2; Kodak) at 4 °C for 8–12 weeks. The specificity of the hybridization was confirmed by identical leveling of two nonoverlapping probes and by the disappearance of the signals upon the addition of an excess of unlabeled antisense probe. Southern Blot Analysis and Northern Blot Analysis–Southern blot analysis of mouse tail genomic DNA and Northern blot analysis of the tissues were performed by standardized procedures. The probe used for Southern blotting was a genomic DNA fragment as shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The probes for Northern blotting were the cDNA fragments of mouse Isx (corresponding to nucleotides +1 to +369 of GenBank™ accession number AB219123), mouse Cdx1 (corresponding to nucleotides +950 to +1283 of GenBank™ accession number NM_009880), and mouse Cdx2 (corresponding to nucleotides +487 to +891 of GenBank™ accession number NM_007673). Real Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis–Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed by TaqMan probes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a PE ABI PRIZM 7000 apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (12Fujimoto W. Shiuchi T. Miki T. Minokoshi Y. Takahashi Y. Takeuchi A. Kimura K. Saito M. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 15514-15519Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amount of mRNA of the gene of interest was normalized by that of β-actin mRNA and expressed relative to that of wild-type (Isx+/+) mice. Samples for Real Time RT-PCR–Duodenum was sampled from the proximal end of duodenum, and ileum was sampled from the region adjacent to cecum. Jejunum corresponds to the middle part of proximal duodenum and distal ileum. PCR Analysis of Whole Embryo–PCR analysis was applied to assess the expression of Isx. As an internal control for RT, amplification of a fragment of mouse hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) was carried out in parallel in each sample. RT-PCR experiment was performed under standardized conditions. PCR primers for mouse Hprt and Isx were; Isx, 5′-CACTTCACCCATTACCCTGAC-3′ and 5′-CTATGTTGAAGTTGCACAGAT-3′, and Hprt, 5′-TCTTTGCTGACCTGCTGGATT-3′ and 5′-GGCTTTGTATTTGGCTTTTCC-3′. Denaturation was at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing was at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension was at 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles with hot start at 94 °C for 5 min. LacZ Staining–For X-gal histochemistry, tissues were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with buffer containing X-gal solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2) for 3–6 h. Vitamin A-deficient Conditions–The vitamin A-sufficient (VAS) diet (containing 27 IU in reduced value of retinol/g) and the vitamin A-deficient (VAD) diet (less than 1 IU in reduced value of retinol/g) were from CLEA, Japan, Inc. The mice had free access to food and water. Isx+/+ (n = 4–9) and IsxLacZ/LacZ (n = 4–8) adult mice were fed a VAS diet for more than 4 weeks and then placed on a diet with marginal or sufficient vitamin A content for 18 days. Female mice on the VAD diet were placed in a mating cage. After getting pregnant, these female mice were housed individually and maintained on the VAD diet. After 49 days including the lactation period, the mice were euthanized, and the duodenum and jejunum were sampled. Statistical Analysis–The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Comparisons were made using Student's t test. A probability level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Isolation of Isx from Different Species–Mouse Isx cDNA encodes 240 amino acids, with one HD in the middle and glutamine at the 50th position in the HD. Isx is structurally a paired-like HD transcription factor. We also cloned the human, rat, and bovine homologs of this transcription factor (supplemental Fig. S3). Spatial and Temporal Expression Patterns of Isx–Northern blot analysis showed expression of Isx in the small intestine, but none at all in the esophagus and stomach (Fig. 1A). To further examine expression sites in the intestine, 0.5-cm-thick samples collected each 2 cm from the duodenum to the rectum were subjected to Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Isx was expressed at very high levels from the ileum to the proximal colon and at low levels in the proximal duodenum. Expression patterns of Isx closely resembled those of Cdx2, except that Cdx2 was expressed in the distal colon, whereas Isx was not. Furthermore, to investigate expression of Isx in the crypt-villus axis of the intestine, the adult intestinal tract (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) was subjected to in situ hybridization. mRNA expression of Isx in the small intestine was detected from the upper crypt to the villus along the axis, but in each villus, expression weakened toward the tip (Fig. 1C). Analysis by RT-PCR of the temporal profile of Isx expression during embryogenesis indicated that Isx was clearly expressed after E9.5 (Fig. 1D). To investigate the expression and physiological role of Isx, we generated mice in which LacZ was knocked in the Isx locus (supplemental Fig. S1). First, adult IsxLacZ/+ (heterozygous) mice were analyzed by X-gal staining to identify the location of Isx expression (Fig. 1E). In adults, the major part of the intestine was intensely labeled, but the proximal end of duodenum was weakly stained, and the distal half of the large intestine was mostly unstained, a finding consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis for Isx. In addition, expression of Isx during the prenatal period (E15.5) and 2 days after birth (P2) was examined in IsxLacZ/+ fetuses and neonates (Fig. 1F). At E15.5, Isx was expressed throughout the intestine, including the lower half of the large intestine, but at P2, the expression in the lower half of large intestine was markedly reduced, indicating that the Isx expression pattern in neonates resembles that in adults. This suggests that Isx expression in the intestine becomes restricted to the midgut region with fetal development. Increased Expression of SR-BI in IsxLacZ/LacZ Mice–To comprehensively analyze the effects of Isx on gene expression, we performed microarray analysis of duodenal samples from both Isx+/+ and IsxLacZ/LacZ mice. We focused on genes expressed at relatively high levels in the duodenum of Isx+/+ mice. We found that expression of the SR-BI transcript (18Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Rhainds D. Brissette L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 39-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was elevated in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice. mRNA expression of SR-BI was then analyzed by real time RT-PCR. Compared with Isx+/+ mice, mRNA expression of SR-BI for IsxLacZ/LacZ mice was significantly increased in duodenum, jejunum, and terminal ileum (Fig. 2A). These data were confirmed morphologically by in situ hybridization (Fig. 2B). Previous studies showing that expression of SR-BI is strong in duodenum but weak in jejunum and ileum (20Cai S.F.

Compared with Isx+/+ mice, no significant increase in SR-BI was detected in IsxLacZ/+ mice (data not shown).

Interestingly, we found that expression of Bcmo1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from β-carotene to retinal (14Olson J.A. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1965; 20: 879-880Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), was higher in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice than in Isx+/+ mice. To ascertain changes in Bcmo1 in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice, real time RT-PCR was performed (Fig. 3A). In IsxLacZ/LacZ mice, expression of Bcmo1 was increased markedly in duodenum and jejunum and somewhat in terminal ileum. Expression of Bcmo1 in IsxLacZ/+ mice was significantly higher in duodenum and jejunum compared with Isx+/+ mice. In situ hybridization confirmed that Bcmo1 expression was drastically induced in the epithelium of duodenum and jejunum of IsxLacZ/LacZ mice (Fig. 3B). Changes in Expression of SR-BI and Bcmo1 in IsxLacZ/+ and IsxLacZ/LacZ Fetuses–Expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI was examined in the intestines of E17.5 Isx+/+, IsxLacZ/+, and IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses (Tables 1 and 2). As in adult, expression of Bcmo1 in IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses was markedly increased in duodenum and jejunum (Tables 1 and 2). Expression of Bcmo1 in IsxLacZ/+ fetuses also was significantly higher in duodenum and in jejunum compared with Isx+/+ fetuses (Tables 1 and 2). Expression of SR-BI in IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses was moderately but significantly higher in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compared with Isx+/+ fetuses (Tables 1 and 2). The degree of increase in SR-BI in fetuses was less than in adults.TABLE 1Expression of Bcmo1 mRNA in IsxLacZ/+ and IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses at E17.5 Expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI mRNA in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was assessed by real time RT-PCR. mRNA expression of Bcmo1 (normalized by β-actin) in IsxLacZ/+ (n = 10, LacZ/+) and IsxLacZ/LacZ (n = 8, LacZ/LacZ) fetuses is expressed relative to those in Isx+/+ fetuses (n = 11, +/+).+/+LacZ/+LacZ/LacZDuodenum1.0 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 vs. +/+97.2 ± 18.1bp < 0.001 vs. +/+Jejunum1.0 ± 0.16.7 ± 1.1bp < 0.001 vs. +/+106.1 ± 17.4bp < 0.001 vs. +/+a p < 0.05 vs. +/+b p < 0.001 vs. +/+ Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Expression of SR-BI mRNA in IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses at E17.5 Expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI mRNA in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was assessed by real time RT-PCR. mRNA expression of SR-BI (normalized by β-actin) in and IsxLacZ/LacZ (n = 8, LacZ/LacZ) fetuses is expressed relative to those in Isx+/+ fetuses (n = 11, +/+).+/+LacZ/LacZDuodenum1.00 ± 0.071.44 ± 0.10ap < 0.01 vs. +/+Jejunum1.00 ± 0.022.63 ± 0.38ap < 0.01 vs. +/+Ileum1.00 ± 0.072.81 ± 0.42ap < 0.01 vs. +/+a p < 0.01 vs. +/+ Open table in a new tab Effects of Overexpression of Isx on Transcriptional Regulation of Bcmo1 and SR-BI–The effect of overexpression of Isx was further studied in mouse intestine using a transgenic approach. We generated CAG-stop-Isx mice, in which Isx expression is induced only after genomic recombination by Cre recombinase (supplemental Fig. S2A). Expression of Isx was then induced by crossing the mice with CAG-Cre mice (17Sakai K. Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The double mutant (CAG-stop-Isx::CAG-Cre) mice exhibited a high mortality rate at birth (the relative number of the double mutants at postnatal day 1 (P1) was approximately one-tenth that expected from Mendelian law), but the surviving individuals had no apparent gross abnormality in adults. The expression of Isx in intestine was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2B), and mRNA expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and liver was examined by real time RT-PCR. Interestingly, the transgenic expression of Isx significantly decreased Bcmo1 expression in the ileum (the relative expression of Bcmo1 (Bcmo1/β-actin) in CAG-stop-Isx::CAG-Cre mice was 0.46-fold lower compared with control (CAG-Cre) mice) (Table 3). Bcmo1 expression in the duodenum and jejunum of CAG-stop-Isx::CAG-Cre mice seemed to show a similar tendency, but there was no statistical significance because of a large variation among the samples. By contrast, the expression of SR-BI did not change in duodenum, jejunum, or ileum.TABLE 3Effect of Isx overexpression on expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI in mice mRNA expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI (normalized by β -actin) in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and liver of transgenic mice overexpressing Isx (CAG-stop-Isx::CAG-Cre) mice (n = 4–6) is expressed relative to those of control (CAG-Cre) mice (n = 4–6).Bcmo1SR-BICAG-CreCAG-IsxCAG-CreCAG-IsxDuodenum1.00 ± 0.220.84 ± 0.111.00 ± 0.060.87 ± 0.15Jejunum1.00 ± 0.510.44 ± 0.131.00 ± 0.080.80 ± 0.02Ileum1.00 ± 0.130.46 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 vs. CAG-Cre1.00 ± 0.180.81 ± 0.10Liver1.00 ± 0.361.18 ± 0.201.00 ± 0.180.91 ± 0.13a p < 0.01 vs. CAG-Cre Open table in a new tab Changes in Expression of Isx, Bcmo1, and SR-BI by Vitamin A Deficiency–The effects of vitamin A deficiency in the intestine on the expression of Isx were first examined in Isx+/+ mice. Expression of Bcmo1 in Isx+/+ mice fed a VAD diet for 18 days was significantly elevated in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compared with Isx+/+ mice fed a VAS diet (Fig. 4A). Although no differences in expression of SR-BI in duodenum and ileum between the two groups were found, its expression in jejunum of mice fed a VAD diet was higher than in mice fed a VAS diet (Fig. 4A). Isx expression in duodenum of mice fed a VAD diet was significantly decreased compared with that in mice fed a VAS diet (Fig. 4A). Compared with Isx+/+ female mice fed the VAS diet, the expression of Isx in Isx+/+ female mice fed the VAD diet for 49 days including the pregnancy and lactation period was markedly decreased in both duodenum and jejunum (Fig. 4B). Changes in expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI in duodenum and jejunum also were examined in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice fed the VAD diet for 18 days (Fig. 4C). Compared with IsxLacZ/LacZ mice fed the VAS diet, the expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI in jejunum of IsxLacZ/LacZ mice fed the VAD diet was significantly higher (Fig. 4C). However, unlike Isx+/+ mice, the expression of Bcmo1 in duodenum of IsxLacZ/LacZ mice was not increased by the VAD diet for 18 days (Fig. 4C). HD transcription factors play critical roles in cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. Because Isx, an HD transcription factor, is expressed in crypts, the Isx gene likely is involved in intestinal differentiation and function, but no abnormalities in length or morphology of villi of small intestine and upper colon were apparent in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice. In addition, bromodeoxyuridine labeling showed no differences in proliferation of intestinal epithelium between Isx+/+ and IsxLacZ/LacZ mice (data not shown), indicating that Isx is not essential for proliferation of intestinal epithelium. Microarray analysis and subsequent real time RT-PCR for quantification revealed that SR-BI mRNA expression was elevated in IsxLacZ/LacZ mouse intestine. SR-BI is a molecule originally identified as a member of the CD36 protein family (28Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Acton S.L.

Because SR-BI is known to have low specificity for substrates and to transport various molecules in addition to cholesterols (22van Bennekum A. Werder M. Thuahnai S.T. Han C.H. Duong P. Williams D.L.

J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), Isx may regulate SR-BI transcription to control the absorption of molecules other than cholesterols. Accordingly, we reanalyzed the microarray data to determine whether any genes involved in transport or metabolism of substrates of SR-BI were expressed differently in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice. The expression of Bcmo1 in duodenum was found to be markedly elevated. It has been shown that the ninaB and ninaD mutations of the Bcmo1 and SR-BI gene, respectively, are responsible for visual abnormalities in Drosophila (30Kiefer C. Sumser E. Wernet M.F. Von Lintig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because Bcmo1 controls the synthesis of vitamin A from β-carotene, and SR-BI participates in β-carotene absorption (22van Bennekum A. Werder M. Thuahnai S.T. Han C.H. Duong P. Williams D.L. Wettstein P. Schulthess G. Phillips M.C. Hauser H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23During A. Dawson H.D. Harrison E.H. J.

A. 2002; 99: 10581-10586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), Isx may well be involved in β-carotene absorption and/or vitamin A production and metabolism. The drastically increased mRNA expression of Bcmo1 in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice might be secondary to insufficient β-carotene absorption or impaired retinol production in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice or to removal of the suppressive effect of Isx on Bcmo1 by Isx deficiency. In fetuses, vitamin A is supplied through blood flow via the placenta (31Clagett-Dame M. DeLuca H.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 347-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus, in adult IsxLacZ/LacZ mice, whereas insufficient intestinal β-carotene absorption or impaired intestinal vitamin A synthesis might induce compensatory increases in Bcmo1 expression, the expression of intestinal Bcmo1 in E17.5 IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses should not be increased. However, the expression of Bcmo1 in duodenum and jejunum in E17.5 IsxLacZ/LacZ fetuses was found to be markedly increased, as in adults. This suggests that Isx suppresses the expression of Bcmo1 directly. The finding that expression of Bcmo1 in duodenum and jejunum of IsxLacZ/+ fetuses is significantly higher than that of Isx+/+ fetuses also suggests Isx suppression of transcription of Bcmo1. To further investigate Isx regulation of the expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI, we investigated changes in mRNA expression using the intestinal cell line CaCo2 and transgenic mice. Although overexpression of Isx did not alter the expression of Bcmo1 and SR-BI in CaCo2 cells (data not shown), the lack of effect could be due to the fact that the CaCo2 cell line was originally established from adenocarcinoma in colon, in which Bcmo1 is expressed very little, and the role of Isx on transcriptional regulation of Bcmo1 and SR-BI could not be determined. We then generated transgenic mice overexpressing Isx to assess the effect of Isx on Bcmo1 and SR-BI expression. Contradicting the results of the experiment using CaCo2 cells, overexpression of Isx in the ileum inhibited Bcmo1 expression, indicating that Isx directly suppresses Bcmo1 transcription. Bcmo1 also is expressed in liver (32Wyss A. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 246S-250SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of Bcmo1 in liver was not altered by overexpression of Isx, suggesting that the effect of Isx on Bcmo1 expression differs among cell types. Unlike Bcmo1, SR-BI expression in ileum and jejunum was not affected by Isx overexpression, suggesting that increased Isx does not have a suppressive effect on SR-BI expression in these regions. In IsxLacZ/LacZ mice, expression of Bcmo1, a key enzyme for vitamin A synthesis, was markedly increased in both duodenum and jejunum. Vitamin A deficiency has been clearly shown to increase gene expression of Bcmo1 (33Bachmann H. Desbarats A. Pattison P. Sedgewick M. Riss G. Wyss A. Cardinault N. Duszka C. Goralczyk R. Grolier P. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3616-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, mild vitamin A deficiency (VAD diet for 18 days) increased expression of Bcmo1 in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum but significantly increased expression of SR-BI only in jejunum. Interestingly, mild vitamin A deficiency significantly decreased expression of Isx in duodenum of Isx+/+ mice, whereas expression of Bcmo1 in duodenum was not increased by mild vitamin A deficiency in IsxLacZ/LacZ mice, indicating that, at least in duodenum, a decrease in expression of Isx is required for increased expression of Bcmo1 in a vitamin A-deficient state. By contrast, in jejunum, the expression of Isx in Isx+/+ mice was not decreased by mild vitamin A deficiency, whereas the expression of Bcmo1 was significantly increased. In addition, the expression of Bcmo1 in jejunum was significantly increased in both Isx+/+ and IsxLacZ/LacZ mice by mild vitamin A deficiency, suggesting that the increase in Bcmo1 expression in jejunum by mild vitamin A deficiency is mediated through an Isx-independent mechanism. We also found that expression of Isx mRNA was markedly decreased in duodenum and jejunum of Isx+/+ mice by severe vitamin A deficiency (VAD diet for 49 days including pregnancy and lactation periods). Because vitamin A is required for mothers, especially over a period from the latter half of gestation to lactation, a VAD diet might well lead to decreased Isx expression in both duodenum and jejunum to maintain vitamin A metabolism in these mice. Vitamin A is an essential vitamin for light perception and formation of bones and brain in mammals. Thus, it is not surprising that expression of factors controlling vitamin A metabolism such as Bcmo1 is tightly regulated by vitamin A and/or carotenoids (33Bachmann H. Desbarats A. Pattison P.

It has been shown that binding of retinoic acid (RA) to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) represses Bcmo1 expression (33Bachmann H. Desbarats A. Pattison P. Sedgewick M. Riss G. Wyss A. Cardinault N.

In addition, it has been reported that formation of a heterodimer with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and retinoid X receptors is involved in the expression of Bcmo1 (34Boulanger A.

Although the possibility cannot be excluded that Isx interacts directly with retinoid X receptors or RARs, Isx most probably regulates transcription of Bcmo1 in jejunum through a mechanism distinct from that mediated by RARs (Fig. 5). Isx is the first homeodomain transcription factor reported that controls vitamin A metabolism and the expression of which is controlled by vitamin A abundance.

https://openalex.org/W2168276787,"Background Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) is one of the most bioactive components of Salvia miltiorrhiza, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been commonly used for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disorders. However, the mechanism responsible for such protective effects remains largely unknown. It has been considered that cerebral endothelium apoptosis caused by reactive oxygen species including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disorders. Methodology and Principal Findings By examining the effect of Sal B on H2O2-induced apoptosis in rat cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (rCMECs), we found that Sal B pretreatment significantly attenuated H2O2-induced apoptosis in rCMECs. We next examined the signaling cascade(s) involved in Sal B-mediated anti-apoptotic effects. We showed that H2O2 induces rCMECs apoptosis mainly through the PI3K/ERK pathway, since a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) blocked ERK activation caused by H2O2 and a specific inhibitor of MEK (U0126) protected cells from apoptosis. On the other hand, blockage of the PI3K/Akt pathway abrogated the protective effect conferred by Sal B and potentated H2O2-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Sal B prevents H2O2-induced apoptosis predominantly through the PI3K/Akt (upstream of ERK) pathway. Significance Our findings provide the first evidence that H2O2 induces rCMECs apoptosis via the PI3K/MEK/ERK pathway and that Sal B protects rCMECs against H2O2-induced apoptosis through the PI3K/Akt/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2082123775,"Ionic-complementary peptides are novel nano-biomaterials with a variety of biomedical applications including potential biosurface engineering. This study presents evidence that a model ionic-complementary peptide EAK16-II is capable of assembling/coating on hydrophilic mica as well as hydrophobic highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces with different nano-patterns. EAK16-II forms randomly oriented nanofibers or nanofiber networks on mica, while ordered nanofibers parallel or oriented 60° or 120° to each other on HOPG, reflecting the crystallographic symmetry of graphite (0001). The density of coated nanofibers on both surfaces can be controlled by adjusting the peptide concentration and the contact time of the peptide solution with the surface. The coated EAK16-II nanofibers alter the wettability of the two surfaces differently: the water contact angle of bare mica surface is measured to be <10°, while it increases to 20.3±2.9° upon 2 h modification of the surface using a 29 µM EAK16-II solution. In contrast, the water contact angle decreases significantly from 71.2±11.1° to 39.4±4.3° after the HOPG surface is coated with a 29 µM peptide solution for 2 h. The stability of the EAK16-II nanofibers on both surfaces is further evaluated by immersing the surface into acidic and basic solutions and analyzing the changes in the nanofiber surface coverage. The EAK16-II nanofibers on mica remain stable in acidic solution but not in alkaline solution, while they are stable on the HOPG surface regardless of the solution pH. This work demonstrates the possibility of using self-assembling peptides for surface modification applications."
https://openalex.org/W2106344985,"Is there a neural representation of speech that transcends its sensory properties? Using fMRI, we investigated whether there are brain areas where neural activity during observation of sublexical audiovisual input corresponds to a listener's speech percept (what is “heard”) independent of the sensory properties of the input. A target audiovisual stimulus was preceded by stimuli that (1) shared the target's auditory features (auditory overlap), (2) shared the target's visual features (visual overlap), or (3) shared neither the target's auditory or visual features but were perceived as the target (perceptual overlap). In two left-hemisphere regions (pars opercularis, planum polare), the target invoked less activity when it was preceded by the perceptually overlapping stimulus than when preceded by stimuli that shared one of its sensory components. This pattern of neural facilitation indicates that these regions code sublexical speech at an abstract level corresponding to that of the speech percept. Is there a neural representation of speech that transcends its sensory properties? Using fMRI, we investigated whether there are brain areas where neural activity during observation of sublexical audiovisual input corresponds to a listener's speech percept (what is “heard”) independent of the sensory properties of the input. A target audiovisual stimulus was preceded by stimuli that (1) shared the target's auditory features (auditory overlap), (2) shared the target's visual features (visual overlap), or (3) shared neither the target's auditory or visual features but were perceived as the target (perceptual overlap). In two left-hemisphere regions (pars opercularis, planum polare), the target invoked less activity when it was preceded by the perceptually overlapping stimulus than when preceded by stimuli that shared one of its sensory components. This pattern of neural facilitation indicates that these regions code sublexical speech at an abstract level corresponding to that of the speech percept. Understanding the relationship between neural activity and the phenomenological perception of speech is one of the main challenges in the cognitive neuroscience of speech perception. A central question in this domain is whether there exists a level of representation in which speech is coded as abstract perceptual units that are distinct from the sensory cues from which they are derived. Decades of experimental research have argued for this possibility by showing that (1) different acoustic cues can be experienced as the same percept and (2) the same acoustic cue can be perceived differently in different contexts. However, whether there exists a neural layer that codes for speech at such an abstract level (sometimes referred to as a “half-mythical” level; Nelken and Ahissar, 2006Nelken I. Ahissar M. High-level and low-level processing in the auditory system: the role of primary auditory cortex.in: Divenyi P.L. Greenberg S. Meyer G. Dynamics of Speech Production and Perception. IOS Press, Amsterdam2006Google Scholar), is an empirical question that is the objective of the research we report here. We examined whether there are cortical regions in which neural activity tracks the perceived speech rather than its sensory properties. Specifically, such regions would code similarly two speech stimuli that differ in their sensory cues but that are experienced as the same percept. Consider the following two stimuli that exemplify this phenomenon: (1) an audiovisual video of a person saying “ta” and (2) a silent video of a person articulating /ka/ dubbed with an acoustic track of a person uttering /pa/ (/PK/). Both of these stimuli are perceived as “ta” (McGurk and MacDonald, 1976McGurk H. MacDonald J. Hearing lips and seeing voices.Nature. 1976; 264: 746-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Yet, this does not imply that the two stimuli are similarly coded at any neural level. For example, the experienced percept of /PK/ as “ta” may just be a result of simultaneous sensory coding for auditory /pa/ and visual /ka/, resulting in a “ta” percept. Testing whether two different audiovisual stimuli are similarly coded at a certain neural level cannot be accomplished by directly contrasting the neural activity patterns evoked by these stimuli, because cortical regions in which the stimuli are coded similarly are predicted to show no reliable differences in activity, and such “null effects” are uninterpretable. Furthermore, even regions in which neural activity differentiates between the stimuli could be involved in abstract coding; they could mediate active interpretation of the stimulus (akin to a hypothesis testing process; Nusbaum and Schwab, 1986Nusbaum H.C. Schwab E.C. The role of attention and active processing in speech perception.in: Nusbaum H.C. Schwab E.C. Pattern Recognition by Humans and Machines, Volume 1, Speech Perception. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 113-158Crossref Google Scholar) in which the same percept is arrived at but via different computations. To circumvent these difficulties, we employed a method based on the logic that repeated processing of a stimulus is associated with decreased neural activity in regions involved in the processing of the stimulus (repetition suppression; Grill-Spector et al., 2006Grill-Spector K. Henson R. Martin A. Repetition and the brain: neural models of stimulus-specific effects.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10: 14-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, Krekelberg et al., 2006Krekelberg B. Boynton G.M. van Wezel R.J. Adaptation: from single cells to BOLD signals.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 250-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We made use of the audiovisual stimulus described above (/PK/; PAAudKAVid; often perceived as “ta”). During an fMRI study, this target stimulus (/PK/) was intermittently preceded by one of the following:(1)an audiovisual /PA/ (PAAudPAVid; auditory overlap with /PK/),(2)an audiovisual /KA/ (KAAudKAVid; visual overlap with /PK/),(3)an audiovisual /TA/ (TAAudTAVid; the same speech percept as /PK/, but nonoverlapping auditory and visual tracks).This design enabled us to assess the relative facilitation for the target /PK/ as a function of the preceding stimulus (see Table 1 for summary of design).Table 1Overlap of Target Stimulus (/PK/) with Four Sorts of Preceding StimulusDimension of Overlap with Target /PK/Preceding StimulusAuditoryVisualPerceptual/PA/ (PAAudPAVid)✓✗✗/KA/ (KAAudKAVid)✗✓✗/TA/ (TAAudTAVid)✗✗✓/PK/ (PAAudKAVid)✓✓✓ Open table in a new tab A straightforward prediction was that regions known to be involved in processing relatively low-level auditory properties of the input would show less activity for the target /PK/ when it is preceded by /PA/ than when preceded by /TA/ or /KA/, since only in the first case does the preceding stimulus overlap with the target's auditory component (a low-level auditory-repetition pattern). Crucially, if there exist brain regions that represent the target stimulus in terms of the perceived speech category (i.e., what is “heard”), then these regions should show a very different pattern of activity. They should show less activity for the target /PK/ when it is preceded by /TA/ than when preceded by either /PA/ or /KA/. This finding would indicate that these regions code the utterance at an abstract level corresponding to perception, because the target stimulus /PK/ is equivalent to /TA/ in terms of the speech percept, but does not overlap with it either auditorily or visually (an abstract-repetition pattern). Our test for identifying regions involved in abstract coding is stringent because it entails a reversal of the intuitive hypothesis on which processing an audiovisual stimulus should be associated with less neural activity when it shares an auditory or visual aspect with a preceding stimulus than when it shares neither. To validate the method, we also included a fourth (control) condition where the target stimulus was preceded by itself; this condition was expected to be associated with the least amount of neural activity as it constitutes a full repetition of the target's sensory and perceptual dimensions (see Table 1). The design we employed borrows its logic from a number of studies of the visual system that examined coding of abstract and low-level properties of visually presented objects. In such studies, a cortical region is said to code for abstract properties of a stimulus (i.e., its type) if it shows reduced activity for a perceptually novel item that is drawn from the same category as a previously presented item. In contrast, a region is said to code for low-level sensory properties of a stimulus (i.e., a specific token) if it shows reduced activity for a given item only when it is identical to a previously presented item. Studies employing this logic have been pivotal in identifying cortical regions coding for view-invariant versus view-specific representations of faces (Grill-Spector et al., 1999Grill-Spector K.

Multiple levels of visual object constancy revealed by event-related fMRI of repetition priming.Nat.

We considered several cortical regions as candidates for abstract coding of speech. These included the auditory association cortex, inferior parietal regions, and ventrolateral prefrontal regions. Neuroimaging studies have shown that sublexical speech sounds like the ones used here evoke greater neural activity than nonspeech sounds (matched for spectral or temporal properties) in temporal and inferior parietal regions (e.g., Belin et al., 2000Belin P.

Neurosci. 2001; 13: 994-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The interpretation of these results is a matter of debate. As noted by Belin et al., 2004Belin P. Fecteau S. Bedard C. Thinking the voice: neural correlates of voice perception.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, finding regions that show differential responses to speech versus nonspeech inputs does not address what sort of processing is indexed by this activity or the nature of the constructed representations. For instance, some have suggested that these cortical regions perform general auditory functions that support speech, such as representing fine spectral and temporal features of the stimulus, and that the increased activity for speech in these regions owes to the fact that it relies particularly strongly on these functions (e.g., Binder et al., 2000Binder J.R. Frost J.A. Hammeke T.A. Bellgowan P.S.F. Springer J.A. Kaufman J.N. Possing E.T. Human temporal lobe activation by speech and nonspeech sounds.Cereb.

Phonetic perception and the temporal cortex.Neuroimage. 2002; 15: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Others have linked this activity to a more active process, involving “discriminations and categorization between highly similar exemplars of a sound category” (Belin et al., 2004Belin P. Fecteau S. Bedard C. Thinking the voice: neural correlates of voice perception.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Yet, despite the difference in interpretation, such explanations have in common the notion that activity in temporal and inferior parietal regions during speech has to do with constructing an accurate representation of the sensory properties of speech. Thus, these explanations differ in a fundamental way from the putative model we are examining, on which these regions may code for properties that are independent of the sensory cues in the input. Speaking more directly to the idea of abstract coding are findings showing that acoustic transitions are associated with increased activity in the left superior temporal and surpramarginal gyri (STG, SMG) when perceived as a categorical phonetic change than when perceived as an acoustic change (Jacquemot et al., 2003Jacquemot C. Pallier C. LeBihan D. Dehaene S. Dupoux E. Phonological grammar shapes the auditory cortex: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9541-9546PubMed Google Scholar). Activity in left SMG has also been associated with acquiring a new phonetic category (Golestani and Zatorre, 2004Golestani N. Zatorre R.J. Learning new sounds of speech: reallocation of neural substrates.Neuroimage. 2004; 21: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). More generally, these regions have been associated with a “speech mode” of auditory processing, in that neural activity in these regions varies when artificial nonspeech stimuli are perceived as speech (Benson et al., 2006Benson R.R. Richardson M. Whalen D.H. Lai S. Phonetic processing areas revealed by sinewave speech and acoustically similar non-speech.Neuroimage. 2006; 31: 342-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2005Dehaene-Lambertz G.

Jancke L. Turk A. Spectro-temporal processing during speech perception involves left posterior auditory cortex.Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 1985-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Studies of multisensory perception suggest that temporal regions, but also ventrolateral prefrontal regions (VLPFC), are well positioned to take advantage of multisensory speech cues in constructing an abstract representation. Primate studies examining spiking activity, lateral field potentials, and the BOLD response have shown that temporal and prefrontal regions are sensitive to both auditory and visual information (Kayser et al., 2007Kayser C.

Some of these studies have also reported unique responses in these regions for multimodal stimuli that include faces (Ghazanfar et al., 2005Ghazanfar A.A. Maier J.X. Hoffman K.L. Logothetis N.K.

Perceptual fusion and stimulus coincidence in the cross-modal integration of speech.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5884-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar found that temporal regions (left Heschl's gyrus, bilateral STS) and the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) show differential activity to audiovisual stimuli when these are perceived as “fused”; i.e., as having temporally synchronized audiovisual cues, independent of the actual synchrony of these cues. Finally, the notion that certain regions code speech stimuli at an abstract level is suggested by the finding that the population codes in prefrontal regions show greater similarity in BOLD response patterns for two stimuli when those are perceived similarly (/PK/ and /TA/; Pearson's r ∼0.3) than when they are not perceived similarly (/PK/ versus /PA/ or /KA/; Skipper et al., 2007Skipper J.I. van Wassenhove V. Nusbaum H.C. Small S.L. Hearing lips and seeing voices: how cortical areas supporting speech production mediate audiovisual speech perception.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; (in press. Published online January 19, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhl147Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our experiment, capitalizing on the well-established neural repetition suppression effect enabled us to investigate in a controlled manner whether activity in these regions tracks the perceived speech percept. If so, this would indicate that the neural coding of speech involves a departure from coding its sensory properties per se, in favor of a more abstract representation. We conducted four analyses. First, as a validity check we determined if neural activity for the target /PK/ (collapsing over the preceding stimulus) was similar to previously reported findings (e.g., Ojanen et al., 2005Ojanen V. Mottonen R. Pekkola J. Jaaskelainen I.P. Joensuu R. Autti T. Sams M. Processing of audiovisual speech in Broca's area.Neuroimage. 2005; 25: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Pekkola et al., 2005aPekkola J. Laasonen M. Ojanen V. Autti T.

Perception of matching and conflicting audiovisual speech in dyslexic and fluent readers: an fMRI study at 3 T.Neuroimage. 2005; 29: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found that activation patterns closely matched that literature (see Figure S1 available online). The second analysis was a prerequisite for the main region of interest (ROI) analysis, and established whether the stimulus that preceded the target /PK/ affected the relative delay (i.e., phase shift) of the target's hemodynamic response function (HRF; cf., Formisano and Goebel, 2003Formisano E. Goebel R. Tracking cognitive processes with functional MRI mental chronometry.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Taylor and Worsley, 2006Taylor J.E.

Demand on verbal working memory delays haemodynamic response in the inferior prefrontal cortex.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2003; 19: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such delays could result in systematic over- or under-estimation of the hemodynamic response (see Experimental Procedures), and would therefore need to be quantified so that they could be accounted for in the ROI analysis proper. The third analysis was the central analysis of the study, in which we identified regions coding for auditory- and abstract-level properties. This was a ROI analysis in which we tested for these repetition patterns in cerebral cortical regions associated with (1) early auditory processing: primary auditory cortex, located at the transverse temporal gyrus and sulcus (TTG bilaterally, cf., Hackett et al., 2001Hackett T.A.

Warren J.D. The planum temporale as a computational hub.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar); and (3) regions associated with sublexical speech processing: the pars opercularis of the IFG (IFGOp), STS, STG, and SMG. Anatomical regions were delineated on the surface representation of each participant's cortex using automatic parcellation tools whose accuracy has been shown to be similar to that of manual parcellation (Fischl et al., 2004Fischl B. van der Kouwe A. Destrieux C. Halgren E. Ségonne F. Salat D.H. Busa E. Seidman L.J. Goldstein J. Kennedy D. Automatically parcellating the human cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar; Figure 1 presents the ROIs delineated on the cortical surface of a single participant). Within each anatomically defined ROI, we examined the repetition effect in brain regions identified in two independent functional localizer scans that identified regions sensitive to auditory and visual stimuli (cf. Miller and D'Esposito, 2005Miller L.M. D'Esposito M. Perceptual fusion and stimulus coincidence in the cross-modal integration of speech.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5884-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These functional subdivisions within each ROI served as the unit of analysis, and we only probed for abstract-level facilitation effects in those subdivisions showing sensitivity to prior context as determined by an analysis of variance with participants modeled as a random factor (see Experimental Procedures). We expected that TTG, which is involved in early auditory processing, would demonstrate an auditory-repetition pattern. Our main question was whether an abstract-repetition pattern would be found in the other ROIs. As a prerequisite for the ROI analysis, we employed a procedure that established the relative lag of the HRF of the target /PK/ in each of the four experimental conditions, for each reliably active vertex (unit of surface area). This whole-brain analysis, while not being the main focus of the study, revealed that the phase of the HRF in voxels active for /PK/ was affected by preceding context (see Figure S2). In particular, it is important to note three patterns in these data. First, observation of /PK/ was generally associated with less neural activity when preceded by /TA/ or /PK/. Second, when /PK/ was preceded by either /PA/, /KA/, or /TA/, then activity in primary auditory regions was associated with a HRF peaking within ∼4.5 s, but activity in secondary auditory cortices tended to be delayed by an additional 1.5 s. Finally, when /PK/ was preceded by /PK/, most HRFs were delayed by 1.5 s. These results are consistent with a small body of imaging studies showing that the delay of HRF may be modulated by factors such as working memory demands (Thierry et al., 2003Thierry G. Ibarrola D. Demonet J.F. Cardebat D. Demand on verbal working memory delays haemodynamic response in the inferior prefrontal cortex.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2003; 19: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or the degree of habituation to a stimulus (Taylor and Worsley, 2006Taylor J.E. Worsley K.J. Inference for magnitudes and delays of responses in the FIAC data using BRAINSTAT/FMRISTAT.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2006; 27: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, currently there is not a clear model of the neurophysiological processes associated with such variations (Formisano and Goebel, 2003Formisano E. Goebel R. Tracking cognitive processes with functional MRI mental chronometry.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The procedure highlights the importance of identifying differences in HRF lags when quantifying signal-change in experimental conditions. All ROIs demonstrated lower neural activity for the target stimulus /PK/ when preceded by itself than when preceded by /PA/ or /KA/ (i.e., no ROI demonstrated “repetition enhancement,” cf. Henson, 2003Henson R.N.A. Neuroimaging studies of priming.Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 70: 53-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As expected, TTG (bilaterally) showed an auditory-repetition pattern, indicating processing of the target's acoustic component (Figure 2A). Most importantly, two brain regions in the left hemisphere demonstrated an abstract-repetition pattern: both regions demonstrated reliably lower neural activity for the target syllable when preceded by /TA/ than when preceded by either /PA/ or /KA/. These regions were the pars opercularis in the posterior portion of left IFG (IFGOp, ∼BA 44), and the left PP, an auditory association cortex (Figure 2B). To determine if this pattern was prevalent in cortical regions for which we had no a priori hypotheses, we examined the remaining 75 brain regions in the anatomical parcellation scheme we utilized (Fischl et al., 2004Fischl B. van der Kouwe A. Destrieux C. Halgren E. Ségonne F. Salat D.H. Busa E. Seidman L.J. Goldstein J. Kennedy D. Automatically parcellating the human cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar). If we were to find an abstract-repetition pattern in brain regions not typically implicated in speech comprehension, this would suggest that the two regions identified here are a subset of a larger network. However, no other brain region demonstrated an abstract repetition pattern, suggesting that such effects may be relatively limited to brain regions previously implicated in speech processing. For IFGOp and PP, we also conducted post-hoc analyses to determine whether preceding /PK/ by /PK/ or /TA/ resulted in different magnitudes of the BOLD response. In IFGOp, preceding /PK/ by /TA/ or /PK/ did not result in reliably different patterns of activity (p > 0.3), however, in PP, preceding /PK/ by /TA/ resulted in less neural activity for the target than when it was preceded by /PK/ t(19) = 2.34, p < 0.05. In IFGOp, the abstract repetition pattern was found in cortical areas identified by the visual-only localizer, and in PP it was found in areas identified by the auditory-only localizer. To determine to what extent the areas identified in IFGOp by the visual localizer were sensitive to auditory information, we calculated the proportion of visually sensitive areas in IFGOp that were also sensitive to auditory input. We found that in this region, only a relatively small fraction of cortical areas active in the visual localizer were active during the auditory localizer (mean = 19%, median = 3%). This was the case even though the auditory localizer resulted in greater activity in IFGOp (mean proportion of active vertices = 10% [SEM = 2] versus 6% [SEM = 2] in the auditory and visual localizers, respectively; p > 0.17). In general, PP was not sensitive to visual information, with only 5 of the 22 participants showing responses to the visual-only localizer in this region. If the abstract-level repetition patterns found for IFGOp and PP on the group level are a result of the target stimulus being neurally coded as TA, then these effects should be stronger for individuals for which the /PK/ utterance is perceived as “ta” more often. That is, though the target /PK/ is usually perceived as “ta,” some individuals perceive /PK/ as “ta” more often than others. To examine this prediction, we employed an independent behavioral procedure, carried out under identical scanner noise conditions, to partition the participants"
https://openalex.org/W2047522679,"Homeostatic regulation of energy balance in rodents changes dramatically during the first 3 postnatal weeks. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and melanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus, a primary energy homeostatic center in adults, do not fully innervate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) until the third postnatal week. We have identified two classes of PVN neurons responsive to these neuropeptides, tonically firing neurosecretory (NS) and burst-firing preautonomic (PA) cells. In neonates, NPY could inhibit GABAergic inputs to nearly all NS and PA neurons, while melanocortin regulation was minimal. However, there was a dramatic, age-dependent decrease in NPY responses specifically in the PA neurons, and a 3-fold increase in melanocortin responses in NS cells. These age-dependent changes were accompanied by changes in spontaneous GABAergic currents onto these neurons. This primarily NPYergic regulation in the neonates likely promotes the positive energy balance necessary for growth, while the developmental switch correlates with maturation of homeostatic regulation of energy balance."

The mechanisms through which mammalian developing tissues maintain adequate retinoid levels in the face of suboptimal or excessive maternal dietary vitamin A intake have not been established. We investigated the role of retinyl ester formation catalyzed by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) in regulating retinoid homeostasis during embryogenesis. Dams lacking both LRAT and retinol-binding protein (RBP), the sole specific carrier for retinol in serum, were maintained on diets containing different amounts of vitamin A during pregnancy. We hypothesized that the lack of both proteins would make the embryo more vulnerable to changes in maternal dietary vitamin A intake. Our data demonstrate that maternal dietary vitamin A deprivation during pregnancy generates a severe retinoid-deficient phenotype of the embryo due to the severe retinoid-deficient status of the double mutant dams rather than to the lack of LRAT in the developing tissues. Moreover, in the case of excessive maternal dietary vitamin A intake, LRAT acts together with Cyp26A1, one of the enzymes that catalyze the degradation of retinoic acid, and possibly with STRA6, the recently identified cell surface receptor for retinol-RBP, in maintaining adequate levels of retinoids in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues.

Vitamin A exerts its functions through retinoic acid, a lipid-soluble hormone that regulates the expression of many target genes through receptor-mediated events (6Balmer J.E. Blomhoff R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1773-1808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid is generated from retinol (vitamin A alcohol) through two oxidative enzymatic reactions via retinaldehyde (7Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 139. Springer Verlag Publishing, Heidelberg, Germany1999: 31-96Google Scholar). When retinoid signaling needs to be turned off, retinoic acid is enzymatically catabolized into more polar products such as 4-hydroxy retinoic acid or 4-oxo retinoic acid. This oxidation is achieved by the action of several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including Cyp26A1, Cyp26B1, and Cyp26C1 (8White J.A. Guo Y.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilworth F.J.

Whether the absence of LRAT in mammalian developing tissues also induces embryonic retinoid deficiency has not been investigated to date. Isken et al. (22Isken A. Holzschuh J. Lampert J.M. Fischer L.

Although mammals and zebrafish are very different in the way they provide vitamin A and other nutrients to their developing embryos, these findings raise the question of whether the tight regulation of retinol levels observed for embryonic zebrafish is conserved during mammalian development. In the present study, we show that LRAT is expressed in developing mouse tissues, even at very early stages of embryogenesis. Furthermore, by analyzing the embryonic development of mice lacking both LRAT and RBP (LRAT-/-RBP-/-) under different dietary conditions, we show that a severe embryonic retinoid deficiency is rapidly achieved in this strain by removing maternal dietary vitamin A during pregnancy. The developmental defects we observe are due to the lack of LRAT in maternal tissues that, together with RBP ablation and the dietary vitamin A deprivation, generates a severe retinoid deficiency status in the dams. Our study also reveals that, as in adult mammalian tissues, embryonic and extraembryonic LRAT can divert retinol away from oxidative activation, thus contributing along with Cyp26A1 activity, to maintaining retinoic acid homeostasis in developing tissues. We also provide some evidence for a possible role of STRA6, the recently identified cell surface receptor for retinol-RBP (23Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), in this process. This homeostatic mechanism may be very important for maintaining normal embryogenesis in the face of excessive maternal dietary vitamin A intake. Finally, we show that, in contrast to zebrafish development, the retinoic acid-synthesizing pathway contributes significantly to maintaining retinoid homeostasis during mammalian development only under conditions of vitamin A deficiency.

Nutritional Manipulation—Female mice were maintained on a standard nutritionally complete vitamin A-sufficient chow diet (25–28 IU of vitamin A/g of diet) up to approximately 3 months of age, when they were mated. At the time of vaginal plug detection (set as 0.5 days post coitum (dpc), the onset of gestation), females were randomly assigned to one of three different diets: 1) vitamin A-sufficient diet (25–28 IU of vitamin A/g of diet), 2) vitamin A-deficient diet (<0.22 IU of vitamin A/g of diet), or 3) vitamin A-excess diet (220 IU of vitamin A/g of diet) until the day of sacrifice (14.5 dpc). Diets were prepared based on the AIN-93 formulation (27Reeves P.G. Nielsen F.H. Fahey J.G.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (6561) Google Scholar) (Test Diet, W. F. Fisher and Son, Inc.). Their nutrient composition was identical except for the concentration of vitamin A. The vitamin A-excess diet contained 10-fold the concentration of retinoids in the vitamin A-sufficient diet. This range was chosen based on guidelines of the World Health Organization for a range of recommended daily allowances for vitamin A during pregnancy that would avoid possible teratogenic effects during embryogenesis. The World Health Organization indeed recommends an intake of 900 IU/day and a maximum of 8000 IU/day (almost a 10-fold range) for pregnant women (28World Health Organization (1998) Safe Vitamin A Dosage During Pregnancy and Lactation.

Diet and water were available to all animals on an ad libitum basis until the time of sacrifice, except as otherwise reported. Mice were maintained on a 12-h dark-light cycle between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. All animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. when maternal serum, liver, adipose tissue, placenta, and embryos were collected. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (29National Research Council (1996) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 7th Ed., National Academy Press, Washington, DCGoogle Scholar) and were approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Committee on Animal Care. HPLC Analysis of Retinoids—Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of retinol and retinyl ester was performed as described (24Quadro L. Blaner W.S. Salchow D.J. Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Gouras P. Freeman S.

Tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline using a PRO200 homogenizer (Oxford, CT). Retinoids present in the homogenates were extracted into hexane and separated on a 4.6 × 250 mm Ultrasphere C18 column (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) preceded by a C18 guard column (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA), with 70% acetonitrile, 15% methanol, and 15% methylene chloride used as the running solvent flowing at 1.8 ml/min. Retinol and retinyl esters (retinyl palmitate, oleate, linoleate, and stearate) were separated and identified by comparing retention times and spectral data of experimental compounds with those of authentic standards. Examples of chromatograms are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters in the tissues were quantified by comparing peak integrated areas for unknowns against those of known amounts of purified standards. Loss during extraction was accounted for by adjusting for the recovery of retinyl acetate, the internal standard added immediately following homogenization of the tissues. Serum and tissue retinoic acid determinations were carried out as previously described (21O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. J. Biol.

Whole Mount Detection of β-Galactosidase Activity—Embryos were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline to avoid any potential outside source of retinoids. Subsequently, they were pre-fixed in a freshly made solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 60 min on ice. Embryos were rinsed twice with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 for different periods (5 min and 20 min) and then with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet-P40 twice for 5 min and stained at 37 °C overnight in a solution containing this buffer and 1 mg/ml X-gal, 1 mm spermidine HCL, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6-6H2O. The next day, embryos were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 10–20 min and stored in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Total RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA from embryos, yolk sac, and placenta was extracted using RNA Bee (Tel-Test, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were measured by spectrophotometer and treated with DNase (Roche Applied Science). Three micrograms of total RNA was used for the synthesis of cDNA using methods and reagents from Stratagene, Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix, 2-step (Stratagene). The expression of the LRAT gene in developing tissues during different stages of gestation was assessed by RT-PCR. The primers sequences used for RT-PCR were as follows: LRAT: Fw 5′-ATGAAGAACCCAATGCTGGAA-3′; Rev 5′-CTAATCCCAAGACAGCCGAAG-3′; β-actin: Fw 5′-CGGAGGGAAAGATTCCTCTGGC-3′; Rev 5′-AGGGCCGGCACATTGAAGGTCT-3′. A final concentration of 200 nm per primer was used in a 25-μl reaction volume. The PCR reaction was performed on a MyCycler Thermal Cycler System (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s (1 cycle); 94 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 1 min (35 cycles for LRAT; 30 cycles for β-actin); followed by 72 °C for 7 min (1 cycle). The PCR product was run on a 1.5% agarose gel, and signals were detected by using a Chemidoc XRS Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR Analysis—For the Real-time PCR, we used a Bio-Rad MyIQ cycler (Bio-Rad) and reagents from Stratagene, Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix, 2-step (Stratagene). Primer sequences were as follows: RALDH2: Fw 5′-TTGCAGATGCTGACTTGGAC-3′; Rev 5′-TCTGAGGACCCTGCTCAGTT-3′; Cyp26A1:Fw5′-GAACCTTATACACGCGCGCAT-3′; Rev 5′-TCTGAGGACCCTGCTCAGTT-3′; STRA6:Fw5′-AGCCAAGTCAGACTCCAAGAG-3′; Rev 5′-CAGAGAGCACACTAACTTCTTTCA-3′; β-actin: Fw 5′-CGGAGGGAAAGATTCCTCTGGC-3′; Rev 5′-AGGGCCGGCACATTGAAGGTCT-3′. Primer concentrations, optimal sample dilution concentrations, and relative efficiency tests were previously determined. PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 2× Master Mix, 500 nm Fw primer, 500 nm Rev primer, and 1:500 reference dye. cDNA, non-template controls, and non-reverse transcription preparations were amplified using the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Each sample was run in triplicate. Both the gene of interest and the housekeeping gene, β-actin, were run on the same plate for each sample. A dissociation curve was generated to determine the presence of primer dimers. Comparative CT calculations for the expression of RALDH2, Cyp26A1, and STRA6 were all relative to a chosen calibrator (wild type). CT values of β-actin were subtracted from sample CT values to obtain ΔCT values. ΔΔCT values were obtained by subtracting the average ΔCT of the calibrator from each sample ΔCT value. The expression of each gene relative to the calibrator was calculated using the expression 2-ΔΔCT. Statistical Analyses—The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for normality of a particular variable. For HPLC analysis, when HPLC retinol levels were not normally distributed, statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney test. When retinyl esters were not normally distributed, values were logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analysis and reported as geometric means, i.e. the antilogarithms of the means of the log transforms. Normally distributed values were statistically analyzed by t test or analysis of variance with correction for multiple comparisons using the Fisher's least significant difference test. For the real-time PCR analysis, normality of 2-ΔΔCT values for each sample was confirmed by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For each gene the data were subject to an analysis of variance test followed by Fisher's least significant difference test to determine significant differences of gene expression from the calibrator. Analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software (SPSS 10, Release 10.0.7a, SPSS Inc.). A p value of <0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. Temporal Expression of LRAT during Mouse Development—RT-PCR analysis was performed on wild-type embryos, placenta, and yolk sac, collected from 6.5 to 14.5 dpc. Although from 6.5 to 9.5 dpc we analyzed the whole embryo containing maternal, intraembryonic, and extraembryonic tissues, our data indicate that LRAT was expressed at very early stages (by 6.5 dpc) of development (Fig. 1). From 10.5 to 14.5 dpc, LRAT mRNA was detected in embryo, placenta, and yolk sac with varying levels depending on developmental stage (Fig. 1). Because the only known function of LRAT is to synthesize retinyl ester, these data suggest an important role for this retinoid form in mouse embryogenesis. Effects of Both RBP and LRAT Absence on Mammalian Embryonic Development—To further investigate the role of retinyl ester formation during mammalian embryonic development, we generated mutant mice lacking both LRAT and RBP (LRAT-/-RBP-/-) and analyzed the effects of the absence of these proteins on embryogenesis. Our initial studies suggested that LRAT-/-RBP-/- mice were viable and fertile when maintained on a vitamin A-sufficient regular chow diet, because progeny from the crosses of these mutant animals were obtained. However, to investigate further the viability and fertility of this strain under different maternal dietary regimes of vitamin A intake, groups of LRAT-/-RBP-/- females were maintained on a vitamin A-sufficient diet until approximately 3 months of age, when they were mated with LRAT-/-RBP-/- males. From 0.5 dpc, the females were then maintained either on the same vitamin A-sufficient diet, on a vitamin A-deficient diet, or on a vitamin A-excess diet throughout gestation. Pregnant age-matched RBP knock-out (RBP-/-) and wild-type females as well as non-pregnant females for each of the three genotypes were maintained on the same dietary regimens and used as controls. Dams were sacrificed at 14.5 dpc, and embryos were dissected, genotyped, and analyzed for external gross morphology. LRAT-/-RBP-/- embryos developing from LRAT-/-RBP-/- dams maintained on the vitamin A-sufficient diet were grossly normal (Table 1 and Fig. 2G). However, an increased number of resorptions was observed for the double knock-out strain (36%) as compared with wild-type (16%) and RBP-/- (10%) strains (Table 1). A further increase in the percentage of resorptions (60%) occurred when LRAT-/-RBP-/- dams were maintained on the vitamin A-deficient diet. This percentage of resorptions also was elevated compared with those observed in wild-type (17%) and RBP-/- (44%) dams maintained on the same dietary regimen (Table 1). Moreover, LRAT-/-RBP-/- embryos developing from LRAT-/-RBP-/- dams maintained on the vitamin A-deficient diet were malformed (Fig. 2H), and the severity of these malformations was greater than those shown by RBP-/- embryos (Fig. 2E). In addition to malformed eyes and peripheral edema shown by RBP-/- embryos from RBP-/- dams maintained on the vitamin A-deficient diet (Fig. 2E and Ref. 25Quadro L. Hamberger L. Gottesman M.E. Wang F. Colantuoni V. Blaner W.S. Mendelsohn C.L. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), LRAT-/-RBP-/- embryos displayed severe malformations of the mid-facial region (cleft face and palate) and forelimbs (Fig. 2H). These are typical signs of mammalian embryonic retinoid deficiency (5Clagett-Dame M. DeLuca H.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 347-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 31Wolbach B. J.

https://openalex.org/W2024545310,"Loss of Id1 in the bone marrow (BM) severely impairs tumor angiogenesis resulting in significant inhibition of tumor growth. This phenotype has been associated with the absence of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the peripheral blood of Id1 mutant mice. However, the manner in which Id1 loss in the BM controls EPC generation or mobilization is largely unknown. Using genetically modified mouse models we demonstrate here that the generation of EPCs in the BM depends on the ability of Id1 to restrain the expression of its target gene p21. Through a series of cellular and functional studies we show that the increased myeloid commitment of BM stem cells and the absence of EPCs in Id1 knockout mice are associated with elevated p21 expression. Genetic ablation of p21 rescues the EPC population in the Id1 null animals, re-establishing functional BM-derived angiogenesis and restoring normal tumor growth. These results demonstrate that the restraint of p21 expression by Id1 is one key element of its activity in facilitating the generation of EPCs in the BM and highlight the critical role these cells play in tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061600887,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP hydrolysis driven multidrug efflux pump, which, when overexpressed in the plasma membrane of certain cancers, can lead to the failure of chemotherapy. Previously, we have presented a projection structure of nucleotide-free mouse Pgp from electron microscopic images of lipid monolayer-generated two-dimensional crystals ( Lee, J. Y., Urbatsch, I. L., Senior, A. E., and Wilkens, S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 40125-40131). Here we have analyzed the structure of cysteine-free human Pgp from two-dimensional crystals that were generated with the same lipid-monolayer technique in the absence and presence of various nucleotides. The images show that human Pgp has a similar structure to the mouse protein. Furthermore, the analysis of projection structures obtained under different nucleotide conditions suggests that Pgp can exist in at least two major conformations, one of which shows a central cavity between the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule and another in which the two halves have moved sideways, thereby closing the central cavity. Intermediate conformations were observed for some nucleotide/vanadate combinations. A low-resolution, three-dimensional model of human Pgp was calculated from tilted specimen crystallized in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analog, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). The structural analysis presented here adds to the emerging picture that multidrug ABC transporters function by switching between two major conformations in a nucleotide-dependent manner. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP hydrolysis driven multidrug efflux pump, which, when overexpressed in the plasma membrane of certain cancers, can lead to the failure of chemotherapy.

Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4636) Google Scholar, 2Gottesman M.M. Ling V. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Pgp expression in cancer cells can result in multidrug resistance and subsequent failure of cancer chemotherapy by preventing the mostly hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs from reaching their targets in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Thus, circumvention of Pgp activity could lead to improved cancer treatments. Pgp, a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of membrane transporters, is expressed as an ∼1280 amino acid containing single polypeptide chain that is folded in two transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) in the order N-TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD-C. Each TMD is predicted to contain six membrane-spanning α helices and there is evidence that the two TMDs together constitute the drug transport pore (3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 206: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Each NBD contains nucleotide binding motifs including a Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B sequence and the ABC signature motif (LSGGQ). Both NBDs of Pgp can bind and hydrolyze ATP. There is ample evidence that for efficient ATP hydrolysis to occur, the two NBDs have to interact by forming a sandwich dimer so that the ABC signature motif (LSGGQ) of one NBD comes in contact with the P-loop of the other NBD to form the nucleotide-binding pocket (4Oswald C. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2006; 372: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Higgins C.F. Nature. 2007; 446: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). A model for the catalytic mechanism of cooperative ATP hydrolysis has been proposed in which the two NBDs hydrolyze MgATP in an alternating fashion with each net hydrolysis step being coupled to drug translocation across the lipid bilayer (6Tombline G. Senior A.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein ATP binding cassette nucleotide-binding domain transmembrane domain inorganic orthovanadate transmission electron microscopy charge coupled device cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. The mechanism, however, by which ATP hydrolysis taking place on the NBDs is coupled to drug transport across the TMDs is much less well understood. This lack of understanding is largely due to the fact that there is no atomic resolution structural information available for Pgp or any other related mammalian multidrug transporter. Low-resolution topology information for Pgp from human, mouse, and Chinese hamster ovary has been reported from cysteine-mediated chemical cross-linking (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments (8Sharom F.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 979-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and electron microscopy (9Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2857-2862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These studies point to a pseudo dimeric front-to-front arrangement of the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule, much like as is seen in recent crystallographic structures of bacterial members of the ABC transporter family including BtuCD (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), HI1470/1 (12Pinkett H.W. Lee A.T. Lum P. Locher K.P. Rees D.C. Science. 2007; 315: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), Sav1866 (13Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), and ModBC (14Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, whereas BtuCD and HI1470/1 show two loosely interacting TMD/NBD pairs, in Sav1866 and ModBC, the TMDs and NBDs are seen arranged in an intertwined fashion, indicating that the arrangement of the functional domains of ABC proteins depends on the nature of the substrate they transport. Sav1866 is currently the closest homolog of Pgp for which high-resolution structural information is available. It shows considerable sequence similarity to Pgp for the NBDs (around 50% identity), however, the homology in the TMDs is much less prominent (around 15% identity). In the nucleotide-bound Sav1866 structure, the TMDs are seen in what appears to represent an outward facing conformation, leading the authors of that study to propose that the TMDs alternate between an outward and an inward facing conformation (15Dawson R.J. Hollenstein K. Locher K.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) similar to what has been proposed for secondary transporters from the major facilitator superfamily (16van Veen H.W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, whereas the energy consuming conformational switch in members of the major facilitator superfamily is driven by syn- or antiport along a transmembrane chemical gradient, in ABC transporters, binding of MgATP and/or subsequent hydrolysis in the NBDs is tightly coupled to structural changes in the TMDs that are thought to be associated with drug efflux. Interestingly, the first ADP-containing structure of Sav1866 (13Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) did not change much when ADP was replaced by AMPPNP (17Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ATP- and ADP-bound conformations are very similar at the current level of resolution. The authors further suggested that major structural changes occur upon ATP binding and NBD dimerization (17Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Indeed, in other ATPases, such as mitochondrial F-ATPase, the biggest structural change is seen between the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound (ADP or ATP) states (18Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). On the other hand, efficient ATP hydrolysis in detergent-solubilized, delipidated mouse and human Pgp requires the addition of lipid, suggesting that some of the structural changes occurring during the catalytic cycle are dependent on a proper membrane environment (19Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate the structure of Pgp and the conformational changes the drug transporter is undergoing during the catalytic cycle by electron microscopy of lipid bilayer reconstituted protein. We have recently reported the first electron microscopic images of lipid bilayer bound Pgp (mouse Mdr3) obtained from two-dimensional crystals of the protein (9Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The projection structure showed two protein densities, which we interpreted as the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecule arranged around a pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis. These crystals were obtained in the absence of nucleotide. In the present study, we have analyzed two-dimensional crystals of lipid bilayer bound human Pgp (MDR1) incubated with various nucleotides with or without vanadate. Furthermore, we have calculated a three-dimensional structural model of the transporter incubated with the non-hydrolysable ATP analog, ATPγS in the presence of the drug verapamil. Overall, the data are consistent with Pgp existing in two major conformations, a nucleotide-free and a nucleotide-bound form, interconversion of which involves a sliding motion of the two halves of the transporter. Egg phosphatidylcholine, Escherichia coli total lipids, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[[N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid]succinyl] (nickel salt) (Ni-NTA-DOGS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was obtained from Anatrace Inc. Bio-Beads SM-2 were obtained from Bio-Rad. ATP, ADP, AMPPNP, ATPγS, and other biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. Electron microscopy supplies were from Ted Pella. Cysteine-free (Cys-free) human Pgp (MDR1) that had all seven natural cysteines replaced by alanines and that contained a C-terminal deca-histidine tag (His10) was used throughout this study (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The Cys-free Pgp was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity as described (19Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purity and ATPase activity of the preparations used for two-dimensional crystallization were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and ATPase assays, respectively. The ATPase activity was stimulated by verapamil (∼10-fold) to a maximum of ∼0.4 ± 0.2 μmol/min/mg in the presence of a 2-fold excess (w/w) of E. coli lipids. This activity is about 40% of our previous reported value likely due to a lipid/protein ratio of 2:1 rather than 100:1 used in Ref. 21Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. Two-dimensional crystallization was performed by the lipid-monolayer technique as described previously (9Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Pgp was premixed with E. coli lipids at a protein-lipid ratio of 2:1 or 4:1 (w/w) at 4 °C for 6-12 h. After injecting the protein/lipid mixture underneath the lipid monolayer, 1 unit of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was added during protein binding to the lipid monolayer at 4 °C for 6-12 h. The Teflon block was transferred to room temperature (instead of 37 °C), and then 10 Bio-Beads were added into the crystallization solution followed by a second addition of 10 Bio-Beads after 6 h. After incubating the drop for 24 h, 5 mm nucleotides and 9 mm MgCl2 were added and allowed to bind to the preformed Pgp two-dimensional crystals between 10 min and 48 h. The monolayers with the attached two-dimensional crystals were transferred to EM grids by touching the surface of the drops with the carbon side of holey- or plain carbon grids and stained with 0.5 or 1% uranyl acetate. Grids were then examined in a Philips CM300- or FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 or 120 kV, respectively. Electron micrographs were recorded in low-dose mode with a 1024 × 1024-(CM300) or a 2048 × 2048 (Tecnai12) pixel CCD camera (both from Gatan, Inc.). Images were recorded at an electron optical magnification of ×30,000 or 42,000 at a defocus setting of between -400 and -700 nm, placing the first zero of the contrast transfer function at around 0.05-0.04 Å-1. The tilt series was recorded on the 2048 × 2048 pixel camera at a magnification of ×30,000 and at tilt angles between -40 and +40° in 5° increments. The pixel size on the specimen level was calibrated using two-dimensional crystals of bacteriorhodopsin. Correlation Averaging—Two-dimensional crystal images were analyzed by correlation averaging as described (9Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, crystalline patches, which showed a power spectrum consistent with a single crystalline layer, were band-pass filtered to remove low (<0.01 Å-1) and high (>0.1 Å-1) spatial frequencies. The contrast transfer function was corrected by inverting the phases between the first and second zero as implemented in IMAGIC 5. Correlation averaging was started with a reference 256 × 256-pixel image excised from the 2048 × 2048-pixel CCD images or 128 × 128-pixel images from the 1024 × 1024-pixel CCD image. Correlation averaging starting from the first reference was iterated 2-4 times using an average of the best sub-images from the previous round until no further improvement was seen in the averages of the crystal patches. At this point, the motif was centered and the size of the reference was reduced to cover 16 (and later 9) unit cells, and correlation averaging was continued until stable results were obtained. Occasionally, crystalline patches were observed that produced two similar but rotated power spectra, indicating the presence of double layered crystals. In cases where the two layers were rotated sufficiently, the two layers could be processed individually, resulting in projection maps with opposite handedness. Depending on the quality of the starting image (crystal size, crystalline order), final averages were calculated from 1000 to 2000 images. To estimate the resolution in the final averages, the I- and S-image criteria with a 3-σ cutoff was used as implemented in IMAGIC5 (22Kessel M. Radermacher M. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1985; 139: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Sherman M.B. Soejima T. Chiu W. van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1998; 74: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Prior to calculating the resolution, the extracted images were treated with a circular mask (radius 0.7) with a soft Gaussian fall-off of 5 pixels to avoid high frequency correlation from the edges of the images and the mask. Crystallographic Approach—Electron micrographs were first examined by using fast Fourier transform (FFT) as implemented in XIMDISP to identify well ordered areas (24Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Images were corrected for lattice distortions, effects of the contrast transfer function, and astigmatism using the MRC Image Processing Package (MRC package) (25Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). One pass of unbending was performed with a reference area of 10% of the total pixel area, and the initial phases and amplitudes for each image were obtained by MMBOX. Two images were merged and the phase origins were refined without assuming any symmetry (plane group p1), using ORIGTILT. Averages of amplitudes and phases were calculated by AVRGAMPHS, and FOMSTAT was used to calculate the phase errors for the different resolution bins (26Unger V.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1259-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An inverse temperature factor B =-3500 Å-2 was found sufficient to compensate for the resolution-dependent attenuation in the amplitudes (27Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The final projection density map was contoured to ×0.222 the standard deviation of the density histogram by using CCP4 (29Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). For calculating a first three-dimensional model of lipid bilayer bound human Pgp, a well ordered crystal incubated with 5 mm MgATPγS and 150 μm verapamil was used. The individual images of the tilt series were first examined by fast Fourier transform, and the +40° image was discarded due to insufficient information in the power spectrum. Lattice distortion, contrast transfer function effects, and the astigmatism were then corrected as described above. Following one round of unbending, images of two independent untilted crystals were merged in plane group p2. After adding the data from the tilt series (14 images), lattice lines were fitted with LATLINE as implemented in the MRC package. Weighted amplitudes and phases were then used for the three-dimensional reconstruction, and the three-dimensional density map was plotted to 1 σ above standard deviation of the density map by using CCP4. An inverse temperature factor B =-2000 Å-2 was imposed to compensate for the resolution dependent attenuation in the amplitudes. Two-dimensional Crystallization of Cys-free Human Pgp—Previously, we have employed the lipid monolayer technique to generate two-dimensional crystals of lipid bilayer-bound mouse P-glycoprotein (Mdr3/Abcb1), crystallized in the absence of nucleotides (9Lee J.Y. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Wilkens S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40125-40131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional crystals were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and projection images obtained by correlation averaging showed individual Pgp molecules with closely interacting N- and C-terminal nucleotide binding domains. In the current study we expanded our analysis to human Pgp and to the analysis of structural changes Pgp is undergoing in response to binding of nucleotides. We decided to conduct the analysis with Cys-free Pgp to avoid cysteine oxidation and inactivation due to the formation of intra- and/or intermolecular disulfide bonds (21Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By optimizing the crystallization conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), we were able to obtain crystals more reproducibly and with improved long-range order. During crystallization, we observed that Pgp molecules were reconstituted into small proteoliposomes, which over time grew into larger, often tubular vesicles below the lipid monolayer. As shown in Fig. 1A, we routinely obtained large vesicular (or tubular) two-dimensional crystals with a size ranging from 0.5 to 2 μm wide and 1 to 10 μm long. Fig. 1B shows part of the edge from the longer tube in Fig. 1A, revealing uniformly packed and oriented protein molecules (circled area and inset). Such periodical appearance is typical for collapsed negatively stained two-dimensional crystal vesicles. Fig. 1C shows the power spectrum of a representative two-dimensional crystalline area, with reflections clearly visible to the third order, e.g. the 3,2 reflection, indicating structural information to a resolution of better than 28 Å. Image Analysis by Correlation Averaging and Crystallographic Methods—Electron micrographs of two-dimensional crystals were further analyzed by correlation averaging as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1D shows a signal-improved image obtained by averaging 1000 raw images excised from the crystalline area shown in Fig. 1B. This image shows 4 unit cells with a regular grid-like arrangement of Pgp molecules (white density) and interfaces (black density). The calculated power spectrum in Fig. 1E reveals reflections up to the fifth order (black arrow). The resolution in the average image shown in Fig. 1D was estimated by S- and I-image methods as implemented in IMAGIC 5, and both algorithms indicate that the final average contains structural information to ∼20-Å resolution (data not shown). A comparison between the image analysis by correlation averaging and the MRC programs is shown in Fig. 2 for a two-dimensional crystal of human Pgp, incubated with MgADP before preparation for electron microscopy. Fig. 2A shows a contour plot obtained by correlation averaging, whereas in Fig. 2C the same crystalline area was processed by crystallographic methods with the MRC package of programs. As can be seen, both methods lead to similar results in terms of the appearance of the two Pgp molecules in the unit cell and the overall resolution as indicated by reflections visible out to the fifth order in the power spectrum (Fig. 2B) or IQ plot (Fig. 2D), respectively. This corresponds to a resolution of about 20 Å, a value not untypical for negatively stained specimen. The similar appearance of the final images suggests that both crystallographic methods can be used for the analysis of Pgp two-dimensional crystals and give comparable results. Projection Structures of Nucleotide-free and Nucleotide-bound P-glycoprotein—To monitor some of the structural rearrangements Pgp is assumed to undergo as part of the catalytic cycle, various nucleotides in the presence or absence of vanadate were added to preformed two-dimensional crystals. We used the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs MgAMPPNP and MgATPγS as well as MgADP to produce pre- and post-hydrolysis forms of Pgp two-dimensional crystals. In addition, orthovanadate was included in conjunction with MgATP or MgADP to produce the vanadate-trapped state (30Urbatsch I.L. Tyndall G.A. Tombline G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23171-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To grow crystals of nucleotide-bound Pgp, we initially tried to co-crystallize protein and nucleotide, but this approach did not result in ordered arrays, possibly due to heterogeneity in nucleotide occupancy as a consequence from the relatively modest affinity of Pgp for nucleotides (31Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Delannoy S. Urbatsch I.L. Tombline G. Senior A.E. Vogel P.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14010-14019Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Crystallization was therefore started in the absence of nucleotide and once crystals were formed, nucleotide was added for various amounts of time before preparation of the crystals for electron microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). Electron microscopic images of the resulting Pgp two-dimensional crystals were analyzed by correlation averaging, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the overall appearance of the crystal lattice of the nucleotide-bound protein is very similar to the nucleotide-free protein (Fig. 3A) in that they contain two molecules per unit cell in a square P1 lattice with a pseudo 2-fold axis in the center of each molecule. However, close inspection of the averages revealed subtle but reproducible differences between nucleotide-free and nucleotide-containing Pgp. The projection image of nucleotide-free Pgp (Fig. 3A) has an overall rectangular appearance with a large stain-filled cavity in the center. Compared with the projection of nucleotide-free Pgp (Fig. 3A), all the nucleotide-bound forms in Fig. 3, B-F, appear to have less density at the interface of the two halves of the molecule. In addition, all nucleotide-bound forms show a more or less distinct left-handed kink in the two peripheral high-density domains (white arrowheads). This is most apparent in the AMPPNP- and ATPγS-bound forms marked with solid ovals in B and C, but also in all of the vanadate-trapped nucleotide-bound Pgp molecules in D and E (solid and dashed ovals). The two-dimensional crystal analyzed in Fig. 3C was incubated with both MgATPγS and vanadate (a projection of Pgp bound with ATPγS without vanadate is shown in supplemental Fig. S2D). From the comparison of the two images it can be seen that addition of vanadate together with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS did not alter the appearance of the projections obtained with the nucleotide analog alone, consistent with the observation that vanadate binding requires the presence of nucleotide diphosphate. The crystal analyzed in Fig. 3F was incubated with MgADP and vanadate for 10 min before EM preparation. We consider this condition as MgADP alone because much longer incubation times are required to obtain a fully vanadate-inhibited Pgp species with this nucleotide (30Urbatsch I.L. Tyndall G.A. Tombline G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23171-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For reasons unknown, we were not able to obtain well ordered arrays with MgADP alone (no vanadate). We consistently observed changes in the unit cell parameters between nucleotide-free crystals (a = b = 102 ± 2Å, γ = 90 ± 1°) and nucleotide conditions for ATPγS (a = b ∼ 100 Å, γ ∼ 86°), AMPPNP (a ∼ 98 Å, b ∼ 93 Å, γ ∼ 86°), ATP/Vi (a ∼ 102 Å, b ∼ 90 Å, γ ∼ 90°), and ADP/Vi (a ∼ 96 Å, b ∼ 88 Å, γ ∼ 90°). All these observations suggest that the most pronounced conformational change occurs when Pgp transitions from the nucleotide-free to a nucleotide-bound form, whereas structural differences induced by binding of different nucleotides (e.g. ADP versus AMPPNP) appear rather subtle and cannot be clearly differentiated at the current resolution. Interestingly, two populations of molecules with slightly different shapes can be distinguished in the AMPPNP- and ATPγS-bound Pgp forms: whereas one form appears more compact and slimmer in the middle (Fig. 3, B and C, solid ovals), the other population retains a small low density area in the center and the left-handed kink is less pronounced (Fig. 3, B and C, dashed ovals; see also supplemental Fig. S2). Such two population appearance was observed consistently with incubation periods from 1 to 24 h (data not shown). Of all the arrays of nucleotide-bound Pgp analyzed, the ADP-bound form (Fig. 3F) most closely resembles projections of nucleotide-free Pgp (Fig. 3A) with respect to two features: the unit cell parameters (a = b = 102 ± 2Å, γ = 90 ± 1°) are similar to the ones of nucleotide-free Pgp and both molecules in the asymmetric unit are similar to ea"

We show here that the synaptic latency at monosynaptically connected pairs of L5 and CA3 pyramidal neurons is determined by the presynaptic release probability (Pr): synaptic latency being inversely correlated with the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and sensitive to manipulations of Pr. Changes in synaptic latency were also observed when Pr was physiologically regulated in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Paired-pulse depression and facilitation were respectively associated with increased and decreased synaptic latencies. Similarly, latencies were prolonged following induction of presynaptic LTD and reduced after LTP induction. We show using the dynamic-clamp technique that the observed covariation in latency and synaptic strength is a synergistic combination that significantly affects postsynaptic spiking. In conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks.

In conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks. Nerve cells transmit information not only by their firing rate but also by the temporal organization of their discharge (Rieke et al., 1997Rieke F. Warland D. de Ruyter van Steveninck R. Bialek W. Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1997Google Scholar). Temporally organized spiking in cortical networks is crucial for coding sensory information (Singer, 1999Singer W.

In simple neuronal circuits, the timing of neuronal activity is determined by the interplay between geometrical factors and synaptic and voltage-gated currents. At the postsynaptic side, timing of spike generation is controlled by intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms (Fricker and Miles, 2000Fricker D. Miles R.

The timing between connected neurons is usually described by the synaptic latency, which is the sum of the axonal conduction time, determined by the axonal length and the conduction velocity, and the synaptic delay (Sabatini and Regher, 1999Sabatini B.L. Regher W.G. Timing of synaptic transmission.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 521-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Synaptic latencies in the cortex range between 0.2 and 6 ms (Markram et al., 1997Markram H. Lübke J. Frotscher M. Roth A. Sakmann B.

Polychronization: computation with spikes.Neural Comput. 2006; 18: 245-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Axonal conduction is temporally very precise but can be affected by the presence of branch points and swellings on the axon and by local voltage-gated currents (review in Debanne, 2004Debanne D. Information processing in the axon.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The synaptic delay is the consequence of a cascade of molecular events linking the depolarization of the presynaptic terminal by the sodium spike to the release of neurotransmitter (review in Meinrenken et al., 2003Meinrenken C.J. Borst J.G.G. Sakmann B. Local routes revisited: the space and time dependence of the Ca2+ signal for transmitter release at the rat calyx of Held.J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 665-689PubMed Google Scholar). In giant synapses, synaptic delay is largely determined by presynaptic Ca2+ influx (Bollmann et al., 2000Bollmann J.H. Sakmann B. Borst J.G.G.

Calcium entry and transmitter release at voltage-clamped nerve terminals of squid.J. Physiol. 1985; 369: 163-181Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar), but how synaptic timing is controlled at cortical synapses has yet to be determined. In cortical circuits, the synaptic latency at monosynaptic connections varies within ∼1–2 ms (Miles and Wong, 1986Miles R. Wong R.K.S. Excitatory synaptic interactions between CA3 neurones in the guinea-pig hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1986; 373: 397-418PubMed Google Scholar, Debanne et al., 1995Debanne D. Guérineau N.C. Gähwiler B.H.

Physiology and anatomy of synaptic connections between thick tufted pyramidal neurones in the developing rat neocortex.J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 409-440PubMed Google Scholar). These small variations are generally considered to be functionally negligible, and therefore synaptic latency is often considered to be a constant parameter. We show here that latency at connected pairs of L5 cortical pyramidal neurons is not fixed but rather is determined by the presynaptic release probability (Pr). Our data provide evidence for a direct relationship between synaptic strength and synaptic timing in physiological conditions. This release-dependent process constitutes a putative temporal code for the efficacy of cortical synaptic strength. Monosynaptic connections were observed in 151 of 426 pairs of adjacent L5 pyramidal neurons (probability of 35%). The analysis was restricted to 50 connections with a mean amplitude larger than 10 pA. The latency of individual EPSCs was measured from the peak of the presynaptic AP measured in the cell body to 5% of the EPSC amplitude (Figure S1 available online). The mean EPSC latency was near 1 ms (1.21 ± 0.07 ms; n = 50; range: 0.2/4 ms), but this value is underestimated when the reference is the presynaptic AP measured in the cell body. Simultaneous somatic and axonal recordings showed that the conduction time from the site of initiation in the axon (5–60 μm) to the soma was ∼0.4 ms (Figure S2). In individual L5-L5 pairs (Figure 1A), EPSC latency was found to fluctuate from trial to trial in a stationary way, whereas synaptic latency was inversely related to EPSC amplitude. Large EPSCs had a short latency, whereas small EPSCs had a longer latency (Figure 1B). The variation in latency was in the millisecond range. To eliminate the potential impact of recording noise, individual EPSCs were averaged according to their amplitudes into three main groups. In the same connection, the latency of small averaged EPSCs was clearly longer than that of large averaged EPSCs (Figure 1C). A similar inverse correlation was observed across the whole set of connections (Figure 1D). In these experiments, the presynaptic spike jitter was not considered. However, presynaptic spike latency may fluctuate from trial to trial, thus eventually blurring the latency versus amplitude relation. To test this hypothesis, L5 pyramidal neurons were recorded in cell-attached configuration, and postsynaptic APs were triggered by EPSPs evoked by stimulating layer II/III. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a spike in 50% of cases (Figure 2A). The standard deviation of the spike latency evoked in these conditions was 0.58 ± 0.05 ms (Figure 2B), confirming previous observations in the hippocampus (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F. Scanziani M. Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Next, the relation between this presynaptic jitter and the latency versus amplitude correlation was evaluated in six pairs. Although the introduction of a jitter of 0.58 ms by convolution of a random Gaussian distribution with the latency population decreased the coefficient of correlation (Figure 2C), among 105 random draws (see Experimental Procedures), the probability of observing a significant inverse correlation between latency and amplitude (p < 0.05 or p < 0.005) remained very high (96% ± 2%, n = 6 for p < 0.05 and 84% ± 7%, n = 6 for p < 0.005, Figure 2D). The differential timing of small and large EPSCs could be due to the fact that these synaptic responses result from activation of synapses located at different dendritic regions. The most distal synapses would produce responses attenuated by postsynaptic dendritic filtering. In this case, small EPSCs should have slower kinetics, hence longer latencies. However, no significant difference in the time-to-peak could be detected between maximal (100%) and small EPSCs (10%–90% of the maximal EPSC amplitude; 91% ± 2%, n = 50, Mann-Whitney p > 0.1, Figure 3A). Thus, the observed difference in latency between large and small EPSCs cannot be explained by differential dendritic filtering on the postsynaptic side. Alternatively, the long latencies measured for small EPSCs could correspond to an error in latency measurement because the signal-to-noise ratio is lower for small signals. To test this hypothesis, the amplitude of EPSCs was reduced to half of the control (48% ± 14%, n = 3) by partial blockade of postsynaptic AMPA receptors with 0.4 μM NBQX. Synaptic latency was, however, not significantly affected (from 1.10 ± 0.16 to 1.12 ± 0.17 ms, n = 3; paired t test p > 0.1; Figure 3B), indicating that the measurement of long latencies for small EPSCs is not due to poor signal detection. Furthermore, when the impact of noise on the synaptic latency was estimated with EPSCs simulated with Igor Pro (WaveMetrics), the latencies in our experiments were not significantly affected when the signal-to-noise ratio was greater than 3 (a condition always respected in our experiments). In fact, even large Gaussian noise of 10 pA had virtually no effect on the latency of EPSCs greater than 20/30 pA (Figure S3). We also tested the effect on latency of changing the driving force for AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Moving the holding potential from −70 mV to −50 mV reduced the EPSC amplitude (67% ± 5% of the control amplitude, n = 6) but did not change the latency (1.31 ± 0.22 ms versus 1.31 ± 0.22 ms, n = 6, paired t test, p > 0.5; data not shown). If postsynaptic filtering and detection of small synaptic responses are not responsible for the dependence we observed, presynaptic glutamate release may underlie the variation in latency. Pr was manipulated via modification of the extracellular [Ca2+] to [Mg2+] ratio or by application of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. Increasing the extracellular [Ca2+] to [Mg2+] ratio (from 3 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Mg2+ to 5 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+) enhanced synaptic transmission (173% ± 14% of the control EPSC amplitude, n = 18) and decreased synaptic latency (83% ± 2% of the control latency, n = 18, Figure 3C; from 1.32 ± 0.10 to 1.09 ± 0.09 ms, n = 18, paired t test p < 0.05). Conversely, when this ratio was decreased (from 3 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Mg2+ to 1 mM Ca2+ and 3 mM Mg2+) synaptic transmission was reduced (35% ± 8% of the control EPSC amplitude, n = 6), and synaptic latency was increased by about 0.5 ms (from 0.99 ± 0.08 to 1.45 ± 0.09 ms, n = 6, paired t test p < 0.01; 145% ± 14% of the control, Figure 3D). Similar effects were also observed on multiunitary postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited by extracellular stimulation (mean latency 2.56 ± 0.16 ms in 1 mM Ca2+ and 3 mM Mg2+ versus 1.67 ± 0.19 ms in 5 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+, n = 8; paired t test, p < 0.05; Figure S4A). In the presence of baclofen (20–60 μM), EPSC amplitude was reduced (to 54% ± 9% of the control amplitude, n = 4), and synaptic latency increased to 124% ± 4% of the control (n = 4; Mann-Whitney, p < 0.01; Figure 3D). Thus, our results show that synaptic latency depends on Pr at connections between L5 pyramidal cells. EPSPs between L5 neurons are mediated by the release of transmitter from several sites (Markram et al., 1997Markram H. Lübke J. Frotscher M. Roth A. Sakmann B. Physiology and anatomy of synaptic connections between thick tufted pyramidal neurones in the developing rat neocortex.J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 409-440PubMed Google Scholar). One cannot exclude the possibility that release sites have distinct latencies, and the actual latency could be determined by the release site with the shortest latency. Thus, short latencies would be measured when Pr is high, because all sites are recruited, whereas longer latencies would be measured with a low Pr. This hypothesis predicts that short latencies could occur when Pr is high or low. To test this possibility, the distributions of latency were compared in the same pairs when the [Ca2+] to [Mg2+] ratio varied from 1/3 to 5/0.5. Speaking against this hypothesis, events with short latencies were encountered only in high Ca, not in high Mg (Figure S4B). In fact, the first latency bin was shifted by 0.37 ± 0.09 ms (n = 4). Thus, selective sampling of short latencies within a distribution does not represent a consequential mechanism for Pr-dependent variation in latency. Paired-pulse plasticity at unitary cortical synapses is largely determined by presynaptic mechanisms (Zucker and Regher, 2002Zucker R.S. Regher W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2881) Google Scholar). To test whether synaptic latency is affected by induction of short-term plasticity, pairs of APs were elicited every 10 s in presynaptic L5 pyramidal cells at intervals of 50 ms. Although paired-pulse depression (PPD) dominates at this synaptic connection in young rats (Thomson et al., 1993Thomson A.M. Deuchars J. West D.C. Large, deep layer pyramid-pyramid single axon EPSPs in slices of rat motor cortex display paired pulse and frequency-dependent depression, mediated presynaptically and self-facilitation, mediated postsynaptically.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 2354-2369PubMed Google Scholar, Reyes and Sakmann, 1999Reyes A. Sakmann B. Developmental switch in the short-term modification of unitary EPSPs evoked in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat neocortex.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3827-3835PubMed Google Scholar), the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) varied considerably from trial to trial, and both paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and PPD were observed at the same connection. The amplitude of the second EPSC (EPSC2) was inversely correlated with the amplitude of the first EPSC (EPSC1) (Figure S5), suggesting that quantal fluctuation determines subsequent release (Debanne et al., 1996Debanne D. Guérineau N.C. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Paired-pulse facilitation and depression at unitary synapses in rat hippocampus: quantal fluctuation affects subsequent release.J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the variation in latency (ΔLat = latencyEPSC1 − latencyEPSC2) as a function of PPR. PPD was associated with a relative increase in synaptic latency of EPSC2 (positive ΔLat), whereas PPF was associated with a relative decrease in latency (negative ΔLat). In fact, the variation in latency was cumulative during short-term plasticity (range of ± 1 ms) and was negatively correlated with the PPR (Figure 4A). To eliminate the potential impact of recording noise, individual traces were averaged according to their PPR into two main groups (one group with PPD and the other with PPF). Consistent with the previous observation, the variation in latency measured on averaged traces clearly depended upon PPR. This dependency was observed in all studied connections (n = 50, Figure 4B) when the postsynaptic cell was recorded in current-clamp (Figure S6), thus confirming that latency varies as a function of PPR. To provide further evidence that latency is influenced byshort-term synaptic plasticity, we changed PPR by modifying the extracellular [Ca2+] to [Mg2+] ratio. In saline containing a high [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratio, PPR decreased (from 62% ± 4% to 38% ± 4%, n = 8, paired t test p < 0.01), and the proportion of positive ΔLat increased (from 69% ± 4% to 77% ± 4% n = 8, paired t test p < 0.01; Figures S7A and S7B). Conversely, in saline containing a low [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratio, PPR increased (from 56% ± 3% to 122% ± 10%, n = 6, paired t test p < 0.01), and the proportion of positive ΔLat decreased (from 63% ± 5% to 35% ± 6%, n = 6, paired t test p < 0.01; Figures S7C and S7D). Therefore, variations in latency are observed during short-term plasticity and depend upon the PPR. During paired-pulse stimulation, the second presynaptic spike was generally broader than the first one, which may affect synaptic latency (reviewed in Lin and Faber, 2002Lin J.W. Faber D.S. Modulation of synaptic delay during synaptic plasticity.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether spike broadening was also present in the axon or only in the soma. Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from the cell body and “loose-patch” recordings from the proximal part of the axon (10–170 μm) were obtained from L5 pyramidal neurons. Pairs of APs were evoked with an interval of 50 ms. Half-width of the second AP increased in the cell body (1.49 ± 0.06 ms versus 1.67 ± 0.07 ms for the second AP, n = 10), but the AP waveform recorded in the axon remained unchanged during the second stimulation (Figure S8). Thus, the changes in latency observed during paired-pulse plasticity are not a consequence of a modification of the presynaptic spike width but may rather correspond to a mechanism involving the presynaptic release machinery. Release-dependent variation in latency is present at L5-L5 connections, but it is not clear whether it is a general feature of central synapses. To address this question, we examined whether facilitating synapses also display release-dependent variations in latency. Pairs of CA3 pyramidal neurons were recorded in hippocampal slice cultures (Gähwiler, 1981Gähwiler B.H. Organotypic monolayer cultures of nervous tissue.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1981; 4: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, Debanne et al., 1995Debanne D. Guérineau N.C. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Physiology and pharmacology of unitary synaptic connections between pairs of cells in areas CA3 and CA1 of rat hippocampal slice cultures.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 1282-1294PubMed Google Scholar). Twelve out of thirty pairs were connected, and in six connections, the amplitude of the mean evoked EPSC was larger than 15 pA. Release- and PPR-dependent variations in latency were observed at CA3-CA3 synaptic connections (Figure S9), suggesting that amplitude dependence of latency is a general principle at central synapses. Long-term synaptic plasticity at L5 pyramidal cell connections is associated with a change in the PPR (Markram and Tsodyks, 1996Markram H. Tsodyks M. Redistribution of synaptic efficacy between neocortical pyramidal neurons.Nature. 1996; 382: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, Sjöström et al., 2003Sjöström P.J. Turrigiano G.G.

Neocortical LTD via coincident activation of presynaptic NMDA and cannabinoid receptors.Neuron. 2003; 39: 641-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), indicating that it may result from a presynaptic change in glutamate release (but see Poncer and Malinow, 2001Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Postsynaptic conversion of silent synapses during LTP affects synaptic gain and transmission dynamics.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We tested whether changes in synaptic latency were observed following induction of a presynaptic form of long-term synaptic plasticity. At L5 pyramidal cell synapses, Pr is high in control conditions (low PPR and little effect of elevation of the [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratio). Thus, long-term downregulation of presynaptic efficacy is expected to be easily induced at this synapse. In fact, LTD was reliably induced by stimulating the presynaptic cell at 3 Hz for 3–5 min while the postsynaptic cell was held at −40/−30 mV. After induction, synaptic efficacy was reduced to 63% ± 7% of the control EPSC amplitude (n = 6, Figure 5A), the coefficient of variation was significantly reduced (normalized 1/CV2 = 57% ± 11%, n = 6, Figure 5B), and the PPR was increased (from 53% ± 10% to 89% ± 10%, n = 6, paired t test p < 0.01, Figure 5B), suggesting that presynaptic release was decreased following induction of LTD. Most interestingly, induction of LTD resulted in a long-lasting enhancement of mean latency (141% ± 8%; Figure 5C). In fact, after LTD induction, the latency was found to be increased (from 1.09 ± 0.16 to 1.52 ± 0.24 ms, n = 6; paired t test, p < 0.01). We then induced long-term potentiation (LTP) by stimulating the presynaptic cell at 1 Hz for 2–3 min while the postsynaptic cell was held at −10 mV. After induction, synaptic efficacy (142% ± 7%, n = 4, Figure 6A) and the coefficient of variation (1/CV2 = 256% ± 12%, n = 4) were enhanced, and PPR was decreased (from 73% ± 10% to 42% ± 4%; paired t test, p < 0.01), suggesting a presynaptic facilitation of glutamate release underlying LTP (Figure 6B). Here again, the latency was found to decrease (from 1.63 ± 0.32 ms to 1.38 ± 0.31 ms, n = 4, paired t test, p < 0.03, Figure 6C). Thus, synaptic latency is also subject to long-term regulation when presynaptic long-term synaptic plasticity is induced.Figure 6Change in Latency Associated with Presynaptic LTP at L5-L5 SynapseShow full caption(A) Presynaptic LTP was induced at L5-L5 connections by repetitively stimulating the presynaptic neuron at 1 Hz while the postsynaptic neuron was held at −10 mV.

Next, we determined whether amplitude-dependent variation in latency observed following LTD may affect the input-output function of L5 pyramidal neurons. To test this hypothesis, in vivo-like background synaptic conductance was injected using the dynamic-clamp technique (Galaretta and Hestrin, 2001Galaretta M. Hestrin S. Spike transmission and synchrony detection in networks of GABAergic interneurons.Science. 2001; 292: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Zsiros and Hestrin, 2005Zsiros V. Hestrin S. Background synaptic conductance and precision of EPSP-spike coupling at pyramidal cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the effect of amplitude-dependent latency variation on EPSP-spike coupling was investigated (Figure 7A). Unitary synaptic events were triggered in the middle of the background train (at a latency of ∼500 ms). Two conductance amplitudes were used (3.4 nS [250 pA at −70 mV] and 2.2 nS [170 pA at −70 mV]), with two different latencies (respectively, 0 ms and 0.5 ms, see Figure 1C). Importantly, the raster plot and cumulative probability curve were shifted toward long latencies when synaptic conductance was reduced from 3.4 to 2.2 nS with a latency shift of 0.5 ms (n = 16 neurons, Figure 7B). The cumulative probability curve was shifted by 1.1 ms (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.005), showing that the amplitude-dependent variation in latency has a significant effect on the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. When a latency shift of 0.5 ms was introduced without changing synaptic conductance, the output message was also shifted by 0.5 ms (n = 16; Figure 7C). Interestingly, reduction of synaptic conductance without any change in the latency, delayed the output firing by 0.7 ms (n = 16; Figure 7D). Finally, the opposite configuration was tested where the reduction in amplitude was associated with a shortening of the latency by 0.5 ms (Figure 7E). In these conditions, the two effects compensate each other, and the net effect on postsynaptic spiking was nearly zero. Thus, our findings show that the inverse amplitude-latency variation represents an optimal configuration to affect the timing of the output message. We show here that synaptic latency between pairs of L5 neurons varies within 1–2 ms in an amplitude-dependent"

FabZ has been an essential target for the discovery of compounds effective against pathogenic microbes. In this work, to characterize the catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of FabZ, the crystal structures of the FabZ of Helicobacter pylori (HpFabZ) and its complexes with two newly discovered inhibitors have been solved. Different from the structures of other bacterial FabZs, HpFabZ contains an extra short two-turn α-helix (α4) between α3 and β3, which plays an important role in shaping the substrate-binding tunnel. Residue Tyr-100 at the entrance of the tunnel adopts either an open or closed conformation in the crystal structure. The crystal structural characterization, the binding affinity determination, and the enzymatic activity assay of the HpFabZ mutant (Y100A) confirm the importance of Tyr-100 in catalytic activity and substrate binding. Residue Phe-83 at the exit tunnel was also refined in two alternative conformations, leading the tunnel to form an L-shape and U-shape. All these data thus contributed much to understanding the catalytic mechanism of HpFabZ. In addition, the co-crystal structures of HpFabZ with its inhibitors have suggested that the enzymatic activity of HpFabZ could be inhibited either by occupying the entrance of the tunnel or plugging the tunnel to prevent the substrate from accessing the active site. Our study has provided some insights into the catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of FabZ, thus facilitating antibacterial agent development. β-Hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabZ) is an important enzyme for the elongation cycles of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids biosyntheses in the type II fatty acid biosynthesis system (FAS II) pathway.

The synthesis of fatty acid in vivo includes initiation and elongation phases. During the elongation cycle of FAS II, four consecutive reactions complete the extension of two carbons (4Liu W. Luo C.

In the third step of the elongation cycle, the dehydration of β-hydroxy-ACP to trans-2-acyl-ACP is catalyzed by FabA or FabZ. FabA is a bifunctional enzyme and only found in Gram-negative bacteria with its partner, FabB, to participate in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids (6Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FabZ has ubiquitous distribution in the FAS II pathway, and it is a primary dehydratase that participates in the elongation cycles of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosyntheses. Accordingly, FabZ presents itself as a suitable, yet unexplored, target for the discovery of compounds effective against pathogenic microbes (5Sharma S.K. Kapoor M. Ramya T.N. Kumar S. Kumar G.

However, because these structures were solved without the presence of inhibitor, they provide little insight into the mechanism of FabZ inhibition. In our work, to uncover the structural basis underlying the catalytic mechanism of FabZ, the crystal structures of both FabZ from Helicobacter pylori (HpFabZ) and its Y100A mutant have been determined, and their catalytic activities and binding characteristics to ACP investigated. To illustrate the inhibitory mechanism of FabZ, two new inhibitors of FabZ were discovered, and their crystal structures in complex with HpFabZ were determined, which has provided the first structural model of the inhibitor-FabZ complex. Expression and Purification of Recombinant HpFabZ—The expression, purification, and enzymatic assay of HpFabZ were performed as described previously (4Liu W. Luo C. Han C. Peng S. Yang Y. Yue J. Shen X. Jiang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SPR Technology-based Binding Assay—The compounds for the FabZ inhibitor random screening were from the in-house library. The binding affinity assay of inhibitor against HpFabZ in vitro was carried out by using the SPR technology-based Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for the primary screening (11Chen L. Gui C. Luo X. Yang Q. Gunther S. Scandella E. Drosten C. Bai D. He X. Ludewig B. Chen J. Luo H. Yang Y. Yang Y. Zou J. Thiel V. Chen K. Shen J. Shen X. Jiang H. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7095-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immobilization of protein to the hydrophilic carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) was performed by the standard primary amine coupling reaction. HpFabZ to be covalently bound to the matrix was dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3). Equilibration of the baseline was completed by a continuous flow of HBS-EP running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) through the chip for 1∼2 h. Biacore data were collected at 25 °C with HBS-EP as the running buffer at a constant flow of 20 μl/min. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for evaluation of the protein-ligand binding affinity was determined by the steady-state affinity fitting analysis of the Biacore data. Enzymatic Inhibition Assay—Following the SPR technology-based binding assay, the compounds with high binding affinities to FabZ (KD < 10 μm) were further validated by enzymatic assay. The enzymatic inhibition assay of HpFabZ was monitored by the spectrophotometric method (4Liu W. Luo C. Han C. Peng S. Yang Y. Yue J. Shen X. Jiang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Sharma S.K. Kapoor M. Ramya T.N. Kumar S. Kumar G. Modak R. Sharma S. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45661-45671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In brief, the activity of HpFabZ was measured by detection of the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm for the conversion of crotonoyl-CoA to β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The compound dissolved in 1% Me2SO was incubated with the enzyme for 1 h before the assay was started. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each inhibitor was estimated by fitting the inhibition data to a dose-dependent curve using a logistic derivative equation (11Chen L. Gui C. Luo X. Yang Q. Gunther S. Scandella E. Drosten C. Bai D. He X. Ludewig B. Chen J. Luo H. Yang Y. Yang Y. Zou J. Thiel V. Chen K. Shen J. Shen X. Jiang H. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7095-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The inhibition mode assay for HpFabZ was also monitored using the spectrophotometric approach (4Liu W. Luo C. Han C. Peng S. Yang Y. Yue J. Shen X. Jiang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Sharma S.K. Kapoor M. Ramya T.N. Kumar S. Kumar G. Modak R. Sharma S. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45661-45671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 10 μg of HpFabZ in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Me2SO in a total volume of 200 μl. The decrease in absorption at 260 nm using crotonoyl-CoA as substrate was monitored for 5 min at 25 °C. The inhibitor type was determined in the presence of various inhibitor concentrations (0–50 μm). After 2 h of incubation, the reaction was started by the addition of crotonoyl-CoA (10–250 μm). The Ki values were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots and subsequent secondary plots. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stragene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pQE30-HpFabZ plasmid was used as template for construction of the HpFabZ (Y100A) mutant. The mutant was sequenced to confirm the desired mutation site. The expression and purification of HpFabZ (Y100A) were similar to those of HpFabZ as described above. The enzymatic characterization of HpFabZ (Y100A) mutant was determined according to the previously published method (4Liu W. Luo C. Han C. Peng S. Yang Y. Yue J. Shen X. Jiang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of HpFabZ or its mutant to holo-HpACP was performed on the SPR technology-based Biacore 3000 instrument (12Zhang Y.M. Wu B. Zheng J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52935-52943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), in which the holo-HpACP protein was obtained and immobilized on the CM5 chip as described in our previous work (13Liu W. Du L. Zhang L. Chen J. Shen X. Jiang H. Protein Expr Purif. 2007; 52: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—The purified HpFabZ was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 9.0, 500 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. For crystallization, 1 μl of protein was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 2 m sodium formate, 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate at pH 3.6–5.6 and benzamidine-HCl was added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). The mixture was equilibrated against 500 μl of the reservoir solution at 277 K by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Crystals of dimensions 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 were obtained after 7 days. Inhibitor was added to the original drop to a final concentration of ∼20 mm, and the crystals were soaked for 24 h. Similarly, crystals of HpFabZ (Y100A) mutant in dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm3 were obtained after 5 days in reservoir solution (2 m sodium formate, 0.1 m sodium acetate trihydrate, pH 4.0–6.2). Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using CuKα x-ray with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate. Before crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, the drop was dehydrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution containing 4.0 m sodium formate for 24 h. The data were processed using HKL2000 (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Analysis of the diffraction data indicated that the native crystals belong to space group P212121 and mutant crystals to C2. The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structures were solved by molecular replacement method with the crystal structure of PaFabZ as the search model and refined by using the program CNS (15Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Open table in a new tab Structure of HpFabZ—The native HpFabZ protein used for structure determination was not truncated. The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The final structure of HpFabZ is well ordered, and the electron densities for all residues with the exception of the N terminus (residues 1–10) are clearly interpretable. The statistics of the diffraction data and structure refinement are listed in Table 1. Similar to the structures of PfFabZ (2Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Perozzo R. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1570-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and PaFabZ (7Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Fiebig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the x-ray crystal structure of the native HpFabZ is determined as a hexameric architecture, displaying a classic “trimer of dimmers” organization (Fig. 1A). The six monomers arrange a ring-like (A-B-F-E-C-D-A) contact topology. As expected from the homology to PaFabZ, PfFabZ, and EcFabA at the amino acid sequence level (4Liu W. Luo C. Han C. Peng S. Yang Y. Yue J. Shen X. Jiang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the HpFabZ monomer also adopts a typical β++α “hot dog” fold (17Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Dillon S.C. Bateman A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), where six anti-parallel β-sheets with topology 1/2/4/5/6/3 wrap around a long central six-turn α-helix (α3) located between β2 and β3 (Fig. 1B). Additionally, for HpFabZ, a two-turn α-helix (α1) is located at the N terminus, and a short α-helix (α2) is plugged between β2 and α3. Notably, an extra short two-turn α-helix (α4), never discovered in the structures of any other FabZ or FabA, is found between α3 and β3 (Fig. 1C). Sequence alignment reveals that α4 is formed by the extra residues (residues 87–95) (Fig. 1D), where there is usually a flexible loop or a gap in the structures of EcFabA, PaFabZ, or PfFabZ (supplemental Fig. S1). As will be discussed below, this extra α-helix in HpFabZ plays an important role in shaping the substrate-binding tunnel. The overall structure of the HpFabZ dimer is similar to the dimers of PaFabZ (7Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Fiebig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), PfFabZ (2Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Perozzo R. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1570-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and EcFabA (17Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The HpFabZ dimer is formed mainly via the hydrogen bonds between residues 102–108 of the two β3 strands from two different monomers, thus all the sheets constitute a 12-stranded curved anti-parallel β-sheet layer (Fig. 2A). The dimer is further stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions within residues Val-68, Leu-69, and Val-71 in the last two turns of α3 helix, and interactions between residues Pro-22, His-23, and Phe-59′ (the prime indicates the residue from the other subunit in the dimer). The dimer forms two substrate-binding tunnels with catalytic sites on the interface, which are ∼20 Å away from each other (Fig. 2A). Each catalytic site is formed by two highly conserved residues, His-58 and Glu-72′ (His-49 and Glu-63′ in PaFabZ; His-133 and Glu-147′ in PfFabZ) that are located in the middle kink of the substrate-binding tunnel made up by the conserved residues nearby (Figs. 1D and 2, B and C). For the tunnel, residues Tyr-100 (Tyr-88 in PaFabZ; Leu-170 in PfFabZ; and Arg-104 in EcFabA), Phe-101 (Phe-89 in PaFabZ; Phe-171 in PfFabZ), Met-102 (Val-90 in PaFabZ; Ala-172 in PfFabZ), Ile-64′ (Ile-55′ in PaFabZ; Ile-139′ in PfFabZ), Phe-109′ (Phe-97′ in PaFabZ; Trp-179′ in PfFabZ) and Pro-112′ (Pro-100′ in PaFabZ; Pro-182′ in PfFabZ) form a 4.5-Å wide entrance, permitting the substrate access to the catalytic site (Fig. 1D). The entrance is near the ACP binding groove (7Kimber M.S. Martin F. Lu Y. Houston S. Vedadi M. Dharamsi A. Fiebig K.M. Schmid M. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52593-52602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which is composed of a floor (residues Tyr-100, Met-102, Thr-103, Ile-132, Met-154, and Ala-156) and an edge (residues Lys-129, Lys-108′, and Arg-110′). Residue Tyr-100 of each monomer acts as a doorkeeper of the tunnel, residing between the entrance and the ACP groove (Fig. 2, B and C). Remarkably, Tyr-100 adopts two types of conformations in the whole structure of HpFabZ hexamer: Tyr-100 is recognized in a closed conformation in monomers A-C (The average B-factor values of Tyr-100 are 51.479 in chain A, 39.567 in chain B and 34.856 in chain C) (Fig. 2C) and in an open conformation in monomers D–F (The average B-factor values of Tyr-100 are 32.293 in chain D, 30.564 in chain E and 35.967 in chain F) (Fig. 2B). This is quite different from the structures of PaFabZ and PfFabZ, where the corresponding residues were found in an open conformation for only one monomer. In the closed conformation (Fig. 2C), Tyr-100 is stabilized by the Van der Waals interactions with Met-102, Met-154, and Pro-112′. In the open conformation (Fig. 2B), Tyr-100 flops ∼120° around the Cα-Cβ bond and is stabilized by the Van der Waals interactions with Met-154, Lys-62′, and Ile-64′, allowing the chains of substrates to enter the tunnel. In contrast to the high conservation of residues near the entrance, residues near the bottom of the tunnel are not conserved (Fig. 1D). Residues Pro-91, Ile-93, Ala-94, Lys-95, and Thr-96 in the unique α4 helix constitute half of the bottom of the tunnel. Residues Ile-20, Leu-21, Pro-22, Ala-94, Lys-95, and Lys-97 form a “back door (exit)” for the tunnel. Like Tyr-100, Phe-83 (Phe-74 in PaFabZ, Leu-158 in PfFabZ, and Gly-95 in EcFabA) acting as a doorkeeper from the exit also adopts two major conformations, closed and open (Fig. 2, B and C), which may be associated with the catalytic function of HpFabZ (see discussion below). When the phenyl ring of Phe-83 takes a closed conformation, it points toward Ile-98. In the open conformation, Phe-83 rotates ∼120° around the Cα-Cβ bond and its side chain points toward Ile-93, exposing the exit to the bulk solvent. Meanwhile, the two conformations of Phe-83 lead the tunnel to form two shapes, L-shape and U-shape, as will be discussed below. Three dimers interact with each other through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and hydrophobic interactions to form a hexamer (Fig. 1A). On the dimer-dimer interface, Thr-49 at the loop between α2 and β2 forms H-bonds with Asp-31′ at the N-terminal of β1′ and Lys-46′ at the C-terminal of β2′; and Phe-50 hydrophobically interacts with Ile-14′, Leu-18′, and Leu-28. Because of these strong H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions, HpFabZ still possesses enzymatic activity and high stability at extreme conditions, such as high temperature (>90 °C) and extreme pH value as described in our previous report (4Liu W. Luo C. Han C. Peng S. Yang Y. Yue J. Shen X. Jiang H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, the β3 and β6 strands of monomers B and C turned around toward the β5 strand with the largest displacement of 8.8 Å (Fig. 2D), causing the formation of two “grooves” that are ∼4 Å wide and ∼16 Å long on the surfaces of the dimer A/B and dimer C/D (Fig. 2, E and F), which have never been observed in the structures of PaFabZ, PfFabZ, and EcFabA. As will be discussed below, these grooves facilitate the binding of inhibitor. The Role of Tyr-100 in the Catalytic Activity of HpFabZ—As mentioned above, Tyr-100 adopts two conformations in the crystal structure (Fig. 2, B and C). To investigate whether the flexibility of Tyr-100 is associated with the function of HpFabZ, site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 100 to alanine 100 (Y100A) was performed. The enzymatic assay showed that this mutant possessed less than 50% enzymatic activity of the wild type with Km at 197.8 ± 12.6 μm, kcat at 0.0039 s–1, and kcat/Km at 19.4 m–1 s–1 (Fig. 3A). The crystal structure of the mutant was also obtained (Fig. 3 and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). All the results have thereby suggested that residue Tyr-100 plays an important role in the fatty acid biosynthesis. The crystal structure of HpFabZ (Y100A) mutant was solved at resolution of 2.5 Å. The structure of the hexamer is very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme except for two minor differences. One difference is that the N terminus ofβ3 strand (residues Ile-98 and Val-99) in mutant FabZ Y100A becomes a loop in monomers A and E (supplemental Fig. S2). The other is the disappearance of the stereo specific blockade for the tunnel entrance (Fig. 3, C and D). As a result, a new tunnel entrance was formed by residues Ile-98, Ala-100, Phe-101, Met-102, Phe-59′, Ile-64′, Phe-109′, Arg-110′, and Pro-112′, and this entrance, ∼15 Å in width, completely exposed the active site to the bulk solvent (Fig. 3D), indicating that the mutant may be more suitable for ACP binding, because the ACP binding groove of Y100A mutant is widened. To further investigate the role of Tyr-100 in ACP binding, the binding affinities of ACP with both HpFabZ and its Y100A mutant were determined by using the SPR technique-based assay (Fig. 3B). Indeed, the binding affinity of HpFabZ (Y100A) mutant to holo-HpACP was significantly enhanced compared with that of wild-type HpFabZ. Discovery of HpFabZ Inhibitor—The compounds for FabZ inhibitor screening were from the in-house library. In the primary screening, the compound binding affinity assay against FabZ enzyme was carried out by SPR technology-based Biacore instrument. At this cycle, about 10 compounds with high binding affinities to FabZ (KD < 10 μm) were obtained and further applied to enzymatic inhibition assay, among which 2 compounds (named compound 1 and compound 2 in the article) were discovered to exhibit inhibition against HpFabZ with an IC50 value of 39.8 ± 0.35 and 47.6 ± 0.29 μm, respectively. In addition, the competitive inhibition modes for both of these two inhibitors were also determined by Ki values of 9.7 and 4.3 μm, respectively (Fig. 4, C and F), comparable with their KD values of 8.61 and 7.59 μm produced from the SPR assay (Fig. 4, B and E). To test whether these two compounds could also inhibit FabZs of other species, the recombinant EcFabZ was cloned and purified (see supplemental data). The enzyme inhibition assay showed that these two HpFabZ inhibitors could also inhibit the enzymatic activity of EcFabZ by IC50 values of 32.8 ± 0.65 (compound 1) and 40.4 ± 0.41 μm (compound 2), thus suggesting that these two inhibitors might act as leads for developing antibiotics. In addition, we have ever also performed the antibacterial assay for these two inhibitors in vivo. However, because of their too poor solubility in medium, no acceptable results could be obtained in the related assays. More recently, by screening natural product library, Tasdemir et al. (19Tasdemir D. Lack G. Brun R. Ruedi P. Scapozza L. Perozzo R. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) discovered several flavonoids as PfFabZ inhibitors. We also discovered two favonoids PfFabZ inhibitors (compounds 3 and 4) that exhibit moderate binding affinities and inhibitory activities toward HpFabZ (supplemental Fig. S4), thereby indicating that HpFabZ might act as a potent target for discovering inhibitors against not only H. pylori but also other bacteria. Structure of the Inhibitor-Hp-FabZ Complex—To investigate the potential inhibition mechanism of HpFabZ, the crystal structures of HpFabZ in complex with compounds 1 and 2 were determined (Fig. 5). The binding models of compounds 1 and 2 with HpFabZ are shown in Fig. 6. Compound 1 is mainly composed of a pyridine ring and a 2,4-dihydroxy-3,5-dibromo phenyl ring linked by a formohydrazide moiety. The whole structure of the compound is arranged in a trans configuration around the C=C bond (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, two mo"
https://openalex.org/W2072201581,"In canine genetics, the impact of population structure on whole genome association studies is typically addressed by sampling approximately equal numbers of cases and controls from dogs of a single breed, usually from the same country or geographic area. However one way to increase the power of genetic studies is to sample individuals of the same breed but from different geographic areas, with the expectation that independent meiotic events will have shortened the presumed ancestral haplotype around the mutation differently. Little is known, however, about genetic variation among dogs of the same breed collected from different geographic regions.In this report, we address the magnitude and impact of genetic diversity among common breeds sampled in the U.S. and Europe. The breeds selected, including the Rottweiler, Bernese mountain dog, flat-coated retriever, and golden retriever, share susceptibility to a class of soft tissue cancers typified by malignant histiocytosis in the Bernese mountain dog. We genotyped 722 SNPs at four unlinked loci (between 95 and 271 per locus) on canine chromosome 1 (CFA1). We showed that each population is characterized by distinct genetic diversity that can be correlated with breed history. When the breed studied has a reduced intra-breed diversity, the combination of dogs from international locations does not increase the rate of false positives and potentially increases the power of association studies. However, over-sampling cases from one geographic location is more likely to lead to false positive results in breeds with significant genetic diversity.These data provide new guidelines for association studies using purebred dogs that take into account population structure."

It has homologues in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we report the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli YidC major periplasmic domain (YidCECP1) at 2.5Å resolution. This domain is present in YidC from Gram-negative bacteria and is more than half the size of the full-length protein.

The biogenesis of membrane proteins is a fundamental aspect of cell biology that involves proteinacious factors. In Gram-negative bacteria, most proteins destined for the cell envelope are targeted to the inner membrane in a post-translational manner via the cytosolic chaperone SecB or in a co-translational manner via the ribonucleoprotein SRP and its inner membrane-bound receptor FtsY (1Driessen A.J. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). At the membrane, proteins endowed with a Sec-dependent N-terminal signal peptide are exported across, or into, the inner membrane via the Sec system. The Sec system consists of the proteins SecY, SecE, and SecG, which form a heterotrimeric protein-conducting channel in the inner membrane (2Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The SecDFYajC complex has been proposed to (i) promote the release of substrate proteins from the SecYEG translocase following translocation (6Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S.

It is thought that for Sec-dependent substrates, large hydrophilic domains are first exported across the membrane into the periplasm via the SecYEG channel, followed by movement of the transmembrane regions from the channel into the lipid bilayer; the latter step may be facilitated by YidC (9Urbanus M.L.

How YidC promotes membrane protein insertion in a Sec-independent manner is unknown. YidC has been shown to co-purify with components of the Sec translocase (15Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L.

Deletion analyses have revealed that YidC insertase function is located mainly in the C-terminal five transmembrane regions (18Xie K. Kiefer D. Nagler G. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13401-13408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Jiang F. Chen M. Yi L. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48965-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Remarkably, up to 90% of the 35-kDa YidC periplasmic domain (residues 25-323) can be deleted without affecting inner membrane protein biogenesis or cell viability (18Xie K. Kiefer D. Nagler G. Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13401-13408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Jiang F. Chen M. Yi L. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48965-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). YidC is conserved in all three domains of life and is homologous to the well characterized proteins Oxa1 and ALB3 that are found in the inner membrane of mitochondria and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, respectively (22Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Consistent with functional mapping studies of insertase activity, amino acid sequence alignments reveal that the C-terminal ∼200 residues of YidC, corresponding to transmembrane regions 2-5, are conserved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic versions of the protein (22Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Further, Oxa1 has been shown to complement YidC insertase activity when expressed in E. coli (23van Bloois E. Nagamori S. Koningstein G. Ullers R.S. Preuss M. Oudega B. Harms N. Kaback H.R. Herrmann J.M. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12996-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), underscoring the functional significance of this region in catalyzing protein insertion. By comparison, the function of the YidC periplasmic domain remains largely unknown; nevertheless, the conservation of this domain in Gram-negative bacteria suggests that it performs a significant, but as yet unrecognized, role in the cell. To gain further insight into the structure and function of YidC, we sought to determine the structure of the YidC periplasmic domain. We report here the crystal structure of residues 57-346 of E. coli YidC to 2.5 Å resolution. Cloning and Mutagenesis–A 942-base pair DNA fragment, coding for residues 26-340 of E. coli YidC, was amplified from E. coli K-12 genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-ATGCAAGCATATGGATAAAAACCCGCAACCTCAGG and the reverse primer 5′-ATGCCTACTCGAGGCTGCCGCGCGGCACCAGCAGCGGCTGAGAGATGAACC that contain the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI, respectively. The resulting PCR product was ligated into vector pET20b (Novagen). The YidCEC(26-340)His construct includes an N-terminal methionine and a C-terminal thrombin/hexahistidine affinity tag bearing the sequence LVPRGSLEHHHHHH. DNA sequencing (Macrogen) confirmed that the YidC insert matched the sequence reported in the Swiss-Prot data base (P25714). To facilitate crystallization, several residues within this construct were targeted for mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The primer pair 5′-GTACTCCACGCCTGACGCGGCGTATGCGGCATACGCGTTCGATACCATTGCCG and 5′-CGGCAATGGTATCGAACGCGTATGCCGCATACGCCGCGTCAGGCGTGGAGTAC was used to construct a version of YidCEC(26-340)His that bears the mutations E228A, K229A, E231A, K232A, and K234A. This construct (referred to as pYidCECP1) yielded crystals suitable for structure determination. The expressed pYidCECP1 encodes 330 residues has a molecular mass of 35,702 Da and a theoretical pI of 5.3. Protein Expression and Purification–The expression plasmid pYidCECP1 was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3) and used to inoculate (1:100 back dilution) 3 liters of Luria Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using an Avestin Emulsiflex-3C cell homogenizer. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl (buffer A). The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and eluted with a step gradient (100-500 mm imidazole in buffer A at 100-mm increments) in 5-ml volumes. The majority of the protein eluted from the column in fractions containing 100, 200, and 300 mm imidazole, which were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Concentrated protein was then applied to a Sephacryl S-100 HiPrep 26/60 size-exclusion chromatography column on anÁKTA Prime system (GE Health Care) running at 1 ml/min in buffer A. Fractions containing pure YidCECP1 were pooled and concentrated to 32 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography in line with Multi-Angle Light Scattering analysis is consistent with YidCECP1 being a monodispersed monomer in solution (data not shown). Se-Met-incorporated YidCECP1 was prepared by growing an overnight culture of BL21(DE3) transformed with pYidCECP1 in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. 30 ml of overnight culture was used to inoculate 3 × 1 liter of M9 minimal medium (100 μg/ml ampicillin) that was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Each 1-liter culture was then directly supplemented with a mixture of the following amino acids: 100 mg of lysine, phenylalanine, threonine; 50 mg of isoleucine, leucine, valine; 60 mg of selenomethionine. After 15 min, protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) for 3 h at 37 °C. The purification procedure of Se-Met-incorporated YidCECP1 was the same as that used for the native protein. Crystallization–The crystals used for single wavelength anomalous diffraction data collection were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein (32 mg/ml) with 1 μl of reservoir solution and then equilibrating the drop against 1 ml of reservoir solution. The YidCECP1 construct yielded crystals in the space group I4122 with unit cell dimensions 126.1 × 126.1 × 288.4 Å. The crystals have two molecules in the asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 4.01 Å3 Da-1 (69.36% solvent). The optimal crystallization reservoir condition was 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.1, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, and 13% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystallization was performed at room temperature (∼22 °C). The cryo-solution condition contained 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.1, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 20% glycerol. Crystals were incubated in cryo-solution for ∼5 min before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection–Diffraction data were collected on selenomethionine-incorporated crystals at beamline 8.2.2 of the Advance Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California at Berkeley using a Quantum 315 ADSC area detector. The crystal-to-detector distance was 320 mm. Data were collected with 1° oscillations, and each image was exposed for 3 s. The diffraction data were processed with the program HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar).

Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar). Structure of YidCECP1–We have produced a C-terminal His6-tagged soluble construct of the major periplasmic domain of E. coli YidC (YidCECP1) that spans residues Asp26-Leu340 (Fig. 1A). High resolution size-exclusion chromatography analysis and multiangle light scattering analysis of the YidCECP1 reveal that the protein is very soluble in the absence of detergents and is monomeric in nature (data not shown). YidCECP1 was crystallized, and the structure was solved by single wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined to 2.5 Å resolution. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the refined structure includes residues 57-340. In addition, there is electron density for 3 residues at the C terminus that corresponds to the affinity tag used to purify the protein. There is no visible electron density observed for a presumably mobile loop that spans residues 207-216. Additionally, no electron density is observed for the N-terminal residues 26-56. To facilitate crystallization and improve the diffraction quality of the crystals the following mutations were introduced into YidCECP1: E228A, K229A, E231A, K232A, and K234A. These lysine and glutamate residues were targeted for mutation to alanine in an attempt to reduce the degree of conformational entropy associated with longer side chains that may impede crystallization (46Derewenda Z.S. Vekilov P.G. Acta Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 47Longenecker K.L. Garrard S.M. Sheffield P.J. Derewenda Z.S. Acta Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 679-688Google Scholar). The mutant YidCECP1 protein behaves identically to the wild-type YidCECP1 with regard to its solubility, chromatographic behavior, and light-scattering properties. In addition, no difference was seen between the mutant and wild-type YidCECP1 proteins when analyzed by CD spectroscopy (data not shown). The YidCECP1 Protein Fold–YidCECP1 is a large distorted β-sandwich motif (super sandwich) constructed from 18 β-strands in two β-sheets and three α-helices (Fig. 1). Sheet 1 of YidCECP1 is a mixed β-sheet that contains β-strands 1-6, 10, 13, 16, and 17, and sheet 2 is completely antiparallel and contains strands 7-9, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 18. Strand 4 within sheet 1 is highly twisted in order to maintain anti-parallel interactions between strands 2 and 5. Helix 1 (residues 235-239, between β-strands 12 and 13) sits at the mid-point of the structure between β-sheet 1 and β-sheet 2 and packs against the edge of the β-sandwich. Helix 2 (314-317) and helix 3 (325-336) are positioned near the C terminus and pack against β-sheet 2. There are also two 310-helices spanning residues 123-125 and 156-158, respectively. YidCECP1 has the approximate dimensions of 38 × 60 × 45 Å with a significant groove formed along the face of the twisted β-sheet 1. The groove formed along the opposing β-sheet (sheet 2) of the sandwich is partially occupied by α-helix 3. Examination of surface electrostatics indicates that YidCECP1 does not appear to have any major hydrophobic surface that could accommodate interactions with the acyl chains of the membrane lipids but could possibly interact with the lipid head groups. This is consistent with the solubility of YidCECP1 in the absence of detergents. Protein-Protein Interactions Observed in the YidCECP1 Crystals–Superposition of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit shows that the only significant structural difference between molecule A and molecule B is a shift in the orientation of the C-terminal α-helix 3 (Fig. 2). The difference in the orientation of helix 3 is likely due to crystal-packing interactions. As mentioned earlier, to facilitate crystallization, five mutations were introduced into a region of YidCECP1 to replace a cluster of lysine and glutamate residues. The structure shows that these residues are located on or near β-strand 12. Molecule A makes a significant number of crystal contacts between its C terminus and the residues that were mutated in a symmetry-related molecule A. This type of interaction is not observed in molecule B, giving a possible explanation for the differences seen in the orientation for the C-terminal α-helix 3. Conserved Regions of YidCECP1–Amino acid sequence alignment of eight YidC variants from various Gram-negative bacterial species reveals a number of conserved residues located throughout YidECP1 (Fig. 3). Most notably, the region at the extreme C terminus of the construct corresponding to α-helix 3 is well conserved. PFAM (48Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (Data base issue): D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar) analysis reveals that the residues 61-350 of YidC define a conserved domain PFAM-B_1222 that is remarkably consistent with the region of YidCECP1 observed in the electron density (residues 57-340). Sixty-one YidC variants were extracted from the domain PFAM-B_1222, aligned using ClustalW (44Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar), and analyzed using the program CONSURF (49Glaser F. Pupko T. Paz I. Bell R.E. Bechor-Shental D. Martz E. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) that maps conserved residues onto a three-dimensional structure. As shown in Fig. 4, a significant number of conserved residues map to α-helix 3 and to β-strands 11, 12, 14, 15, 18 that cluster on the face of β-sheet 2 and pack against α-helix 3 (Fig. 4A). Closer inspection reveals that many of the conserved residues are involved in interactions between α-helix 3 and β-sheet 2 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the interaction may be biologically significant.FIGURE 4Conserved amino acids within the large periplasmic domain of YidC in Gram-negative bacteria mapped onto the structure of YidCECP1.

First, deletion analysis of YidC has revealed that residues 323-346 of the first periplasmic domain are essential for cell viability and insertase activity (18Xie K. Kiefer D. Nagler G. Dalbey R.E.

https://openalex.org/W2001392540,"Chemoperception in invertebrates is mediated by a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). To date nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms of chemoperception in coleopteran species. Recently the genome of Tribolium castaneum was sequenced for use as a model species for the Coleoptera. Using blast searches analyses of the T. castaneum genome with previously predicted amino acid sequences of insect chemoreceptor genes, a putative chemoreceptor family consisting of 62 gustatory receptors (Grs) and 26 olfactory receptors (Ors) was identified. The receptors have seven transmembrane domains (7TMs) and all belong to the GPCR receptor family. The expression of the T. castaneum chemoreceptor genes was investigated using quantification real- time RT-PCR and in situ whole mount RT-PCR analysis in the antennae, mouth parts, and prolegs of the adults and larvae. All of the predicted TcasGrs were expressed in the labium, maxillae, and prolegs of the adults but TcasGr13, 19, 28, 47, 62, 98, and 61 were not expressed in the prolegs. The TcasOrs were localized only in the antennae and not in any of the beetles gustatory organs with one exception; the TcasOr16 (like DmelOr83b), which was localized in the antennae, labium, and prolegs of the beetles. A group of six TcasGrs that presents a lineage with the sugar receptors subfamily in Drosophila melanogaster were localized in the lacinia of the Tribolium larvae. TcasGr1, 3, and 39, presented an ortholog to CO2 receptors in D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae was recorded. Low expression of almost all of the predicted chemoreceptor genes was observed in the head tissues that contain the brains and suboesophageal ganglion (SOG). These findings demonstrate the identification of a chemoreceptor family in Tribolium, which is evolutionarily related to other insect species."
https://openalex.org/W2077728594,"To identify functional contacts between HIV-1 integrase (IN) and its viral DNA substrate, we devised a new experimental strategy combining the following two methodologies. First, disulfide-mediated cross-linking was used to site-specifically link select core and C-terminal domain amino acids to respective positions in viral DNA. Next, surface topologies of free IN and IN-DNA complexes were compared using Lys- and Arg-selective small chemical modifiers and mass spectrometric analysis. This approach enabled us to dissect specific contacts made by different monomers within the multimeric complex. The foot-printing studies for the first time revealed the importance of a specific N-terminal domain residue, Lys-14, in viral DNA binding. In addition, a DNA-induced conformational change involving the connection between the core and C-terminal domains was observed. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the importance of the identified contacts for recombinant IN activities and virus infection. These new findings provided major constraints, enabling us to identify the viral DNA binding channel in the active full-length IN multimer. The experimental approach described here has general application to mapping interactions within functional nucleoprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2147804440,"In eukaryotes and Archaea, selenocysteine synthase (SecS) converts O-phospho-l-seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec into selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec using selenophosphate as the selenium donor compound. The molecular mechanisms underlying SecS activity are presently unknown. We have delineated a 450-residue core of mouse SecS, which retained full selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec synthesis activity, and determined its crystal structure at 1.65Å resolution. SecS exhibits three domains that place it in the fold type I family of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. Two SecS monomers interact intimately and together build up two identical active sites around PLP in a Schiff-base linkage with lysine 284. Two SecS dimers further associate to form a homotetramer. The N terminus, which mediates tetramer formation, and a large insertion that remodels the active site set SecS aside from other members of the family. The active site insertion contributes to PLP binding and positions a glutamate next to the PLP, where it could repel substrates with a free α-carboxyl group, suggesting why SecS does not act on free O-phospho-l-serine. Upon soaking crystals in phosphate buffer, a previously disordered loop within the active site insertion contracted to form a phosphate binding site. Residues that are strictly conserved in SecS orthologs but variant in related enzymes coordinate the phosphate and upon mutation corrupt SecS activity. Modeling suggested that the phosphate loop accommodates the γ-phosphate moiety of O-phospho-l-seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec and, after phosphate elimination, binds selenophosphate to initiate attack on the proposed aminoacrylyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec intermediate. Based on these results and on the activity profiles of mechanism-based inhibitors, we offer a detailed reaction mechanism for the enzyme.

The active site insertion contributes to PLP binding and positions a glutamate next to the PLP, where it could repel substrates with a free α-carboxyl group, suggesting why SecS does not act on free O-phospho-l-serine. Upon soaking crystals in phosphate buffer, a previously disordered loop within the active site insertion contracted to form a phosphate binding site. Residues that are strictly conserved in SecS orthologs but variant in related enzymes coordinate the phosphate and upon mutation corrupt SecS activity. Modeling suggested that the phosphate loop accommodates the γ-phosphate moiety of O-phospho-l-seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec and, after phosphate elimination, binds selenophosphate to initiate attack on the proposed aminoacrylyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec intermediate. Based on these results and on the activity profiles of mechanism-based inhibitors, we offer a detailed reaction mechanism for the enzyme. Organisms that co-translationally incorporate selenocysteine (Sec) 2The abbreviations used are:SecselenocysteineSecSselenocysteine synthasePSerO-phospho-l-serinePSerCysSO-phospho-l-serine-cysteine synthaseafu, A. fulgidus;F3-AlatrifluoroalaninemmuM. musculusPGpropargylglycinePLPpyridoxal phosphateSePselenophosphatesynSynechocystisTrxthioredoxinSLA/LPsoluble liver antigen/liver and pancreas antigenP-loopphosphate loop. into proteins in response to UGA codons in mRNA are frequently encountered in all three domains of life, prokaryotes, Archaea, and eukaryotes. The human genome contains 25 known genes encoding selenoproteins (1Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar), several of which have essential functions. Selenoprotein biosynthesis requires two specialized metabolic pathways, the first to synthesize Sec and the second to incorporate Sec into proteins. The benefits of selenoproteins, e.g. their unique redox and catalytic properties, apparently outweigh selenium toxicity and the burden of maintaining intricate Sec synthetic and decoding machineries. selenocysteine selenocysteine synthase O-phospho-l-serine O-phospho-l-serine-cysteine synthase trifluoroalanine M. musculus propargylglycine pyridoxal phosphate selenophosphate Synechocystis thioredoxin soluble liver antigen/liver and pancreas antigen phosphate loop. Notwithstanding some common themes, both Sec synthesis and decoding (for reviews, see Refs. 2Böck A. Forchhammer K. Heider J. Baron C. Trends Biochem.

Resch A. Wilting R. Böck A. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In all organisms a special tRNA[Ser]Sec bearing an anticodon complementary to the UGA codon is central to both processes (6Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Böck A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Lee B.J. Worland P.J. Davis J.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9724-9727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All tRNA[Ser]Sec species exhibit a number of non-canonical features whereby they are exclusively utilized for the Sec synthesis and Sec insertion pathways (8Commans S. Böck A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 335-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Sec insertion at UGA codons, selenocysteyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec is recognized by a special elongation factor, SelB in bacteria (9Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and EFSec in eukaryotes (10Fagegaltier D. Hubert N. Yamada K. Mizutani T. Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 11Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Harney J.W. Driscoll D.M. Hatfield D.L. Berry M.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), that replaces EF-Tu and EF-1α in escorting the aminoacylated Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec to the ribosome. Bacterial SelB binds a stem-loop structure located within the coding region of selenoprotein mRNAs and directly downstream of a UGA codon (12Heider J. Baron C. Böck A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Such stem-loop structures thereby act as Sec insertion sequence elements that recode UGA, which normally signals translational termination. In contrast to bacteria, eukaryotic Sec insertion sequence elements are located in the 3′-untranslated regions of selenoprotein mRNAs (13Berry M.J. Banu L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), alleviating the burden of having to maintain functional secondary structures within the coding region and facilitating insertion of more than one Sec into a single protein chain. Such recognition from a distance requires a special adaptor protein, Sec insertion sequence-binding protein 2 (14Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Additional factors appear to be involved in UGA recoding in higher organisms. For example, SECp43 was recently found to associate with a Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec·EFsec complex in vitro and to enhance the interaction between EFsec and Sec insertion sequence-binding protein 2 in vivo (15Small-Howard A. Morozova N. Stoytcheva Z. Forry E.P. Mansell J.B. Harney J.W. Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Hatfield D.L. Berry M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SECp43 also influences the specific post-transcriptional modification of tRNA[Ser]Sec (16Xu X.M. Mix H. Carlson B.A. Grabowski P.J. Gladyshev V.N. Berry M.J. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41568-41575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a role for ribosomal protein L30 in Sec decoding on the ribosome has recently surfaced (17Chavatte L. Brown B.A. Driscoll D.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Sec synthesis invariably takes place on tRNA[Ser]Sec (6Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Böck A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Lee B.J. Worland P.J. Davis J.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 14: 100-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which is initially aminoacylated with serine by seryl-tRNASer synthetase (6Leinfelder W. Zehelein E. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Böck A. Nature. 1988; 331: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 19Ohama T. Yang D.C. Hatfield D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pathways then diverge in the different domains and recapitulate a trend seen with the decoding systems; i.e. eukaryotes rely on a more complex ensemble of factors. In bacteria, a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, selenocysteine synthase (SelA), uses selenophosphate (SeP) to directly convert Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec into Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec (20Forchhammer K. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6324-6328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotes Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec is first phosphorylated by O-phospho-l-seryl (PSer)-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase to produce PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec (21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phosphate apparently is required as a leaving group by eukaryotic Sec synthase (SecS), which subsequently gives rise to Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec. In bacteria SeP is provided by selenophosphate synthetase, SelD (22Leinfelder W. Forchhammer K. Veprek B. Zehelein E. Böck A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes harbor two homologs of SelD, selenophosphate synthetases 1 and 2 (23Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but only selenophosphate synthetase 2 can synthesize SeP for Sec synthesis (24Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Irons R. Mix H. Zhong N. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of eukaryotic/archaeal SecS has only recently been elucidated. An archaeal open reading frame, annotated as SecS, did not act on Ser-tRNA[Ser]Sec or PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec (25Kaiser J.T. Gromadski K. Rother M. Engelhardt H. Rodnina M.V. Wahl M.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13315-13327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RNA-mediated interference technology provided the first direct evidence for an essential role of soluble liver antigen/liver and pancreas antigen (SLA/LP) in selenoprotein biosynthesis (16Xu X.M.

SLA/LP was originally identified as the target of autoantibodies from patients with a severe form of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (26Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9739-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Wies I. Brunner S. Henninger J. Herkel J. Kanzler S. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Lohse A.W. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1510-1515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Indeed, SLA/LP interacted with SECp43 and tRNA[Ser]Sec as detected by co-immunoprecipitation (16Xu X.M. Mix H. Carlson B.A. Grabowski P.J. Gladyshev V.N. Berry M.J. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41568-41575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Gelpi C. Sontheimer E.J. Rodriguez-Sanchez J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Structural homology modeling predicted that SLA/LP is a PLP-dependent enzyme of the aspartate aminotransferase family (29Kernebeck T. Lohse A.W. Grotzinger J. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unequivocal evidence that SLA/LP embodied the elusive eukaryotic/archaeal SecS was finally provided independently by two groups (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 30Yuan J. Palioura S. Salazar J.C. Su D. O'Donoghue P. Hohn M.J. Cardoso A.M. Whitman W.B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18923-18927Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) who directly demonstrated the conversion of PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec to Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec by the enzyme. The identification of eukaryotic/archaeal SecS paved the way for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying its catalytic activity. Xu et al. (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar) showed that mouse SecS is able to dephosphorylate PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec, indicating that aminoacrylyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec is a likely intermediate in the reaction. It was also unequivocally established that SecS employs SeP produced by selenophosphate synthetase 2 as the activated selenium donor (24Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Irons R. Mix H. Zhong N. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Apart from these aspects, the enzyme is presently enigmatic. In particular, it is not known (i) how SecS recognizes its two substrates (PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec and SeP) and whether binding occurs concomitantly or sequentially, (ii) how SecS differs from related enzymes that recognize low molecular weight amino acid substrates, (iii) whether and how the enzyme discriminates against free PSer, and (iv) which residues participate in PSer to Sec conversion on tRNA[Ser]Sec. Here we report on a combined structural and biochemical analysis of a mammalian SecS which illuminates the above questions. We determined high resolution crystal structures of SecS from mouse (mmuSecS) in which we find that the active site is constructed around a Lys-284-bound PLP cofactor at the interface of two protomers of a close dimer. A SecS-specific N terminus leads to association of two dimers into a homotetramer, which has possible relevance for PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec positioning. The active site is complemented by a SecS-specific loop, which is disordered in the absence of ligands but contracts in the presence of a substrate-mimicking phosphate moiety. A glutamate neighboring the PLP cofactor is ideally positioned to deter substrates bearing a free α-carboxyl group. In line with the structural results, we show that changes of phosphate-coordinating residues, which are solely conserved in SecS orthologs, lead to reduced activity of the enzyme and that SecS does not act on free PSer. Using in addition the response of SecS toward mechanism-based inhibitors, we propose a detailed catalytic mechanism. Protein Production and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A DNA fragment encoding the full-length secS gene from mouse (GenBank™ accession number NM_172490) was amplified and cloned into pETM-13 vector to allow the expression of a C-terminal His6-tagged protein. The insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid was termed pETM-13-secS. Rosetta2(DE3) cells were transformed with the pETM-13-secS expression construct. Overproduction of the target protein was carried out at 289 K using auto-inducing medium (31Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested when the maximum culture density was reached and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). 1 mg of lysozyme and 3 μl of DNase (1 mg/ml) were added per gram of wet cells, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice with stirring. After completing cell rupture by sonication and removing cell debris by centrifugation, soluble fusion protein was captured on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Qiagen), washed with buffer B (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (20 to 250 mm) in buffer A. Fractions containing mmuSecS were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-200 HiLoad 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Purified target protein was concentrated to 14 mg/ml using Vivaspin 15 concentrators (30,000 MWCO; Sartorius Vivascience), separated into aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 193 K until use. Using the above protocol we obtained ∼1.5 mg of mmuSecS per liter of bacterial culture at a purity of greater than 95% as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis (see Fig. 1A). Mutants of mmuSecSArg-313 and mmuSecSGln-105 were generated in pETM-13-secS via the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. All mutants of mmuSecS were purified in the same way as the wild type protein. Limited Proteolysis and Analytical Gel Filtration Analysis—50 μl of mmuSecS (14 mg/ml) were incubated with 3 μg of elastase at 277 K for 80 min. The major band on an SDS gel originating from elastase treatment (mmuSecSelast; see Fig. 1A) was in-gel-digested with trypsin, and fragments were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectroscopy as described (32Hartmuth K. Urlaub H. Vornlocher H.P. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Lührmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16719-16724Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration was conducted on a Superdex-200 PC 3.2/30 size exclusion column (2.4-ml gel bed, column dimensions 3.2 × 300 mm) on a SMART fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Escherichia coli SelA (a decamer of ∼506 kDa), Saccharomyces cerevisiae cystathionine γ-lyase (a tetramer of ∼170 kDa), and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii SelA-like protein (MJ0158; a dimer of ∼84 kDa) served as size standards. In Vitro Transcription and Filter Binding Assay—The template for in vitro transcription was prepared as described (21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Uniformly 32P-labeled tRNA[Ser]Sec was transcribed in 50 μl of transcription buffer (30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 6.4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 400 μm each of GTP, CTP, and ATP, 200 μm UTP, 40 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 32 units of RNasin) containing 5 μg of linearized DNA template and 1.5 μl of T7 RNA polymerase. The transcription mixture was incubated for 2 h at 310 K, and synthetic tRNA[Ser]Sec was gel-purified. 10,000 cpm (100 fmol) of 32P-labeled unacylated tRNA[Ser]Sec were incubated 30 min on ice with 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 μm mmuSecS or mmuSecSelast in 20 μl of buffer D (HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml total E. coli tRNA). 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were loaded on a Protran BA 83 nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman) and washed with 50 ml of buffer C. For the detection of RNA-protein complexes, the membrane was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight, which was then scanned using a Typhoon 8600 (GE Healthcare). SecS Activity Assay—Synthetic tRNA[Ser]Sec was used in all reactions for assaying SecS activity. Synthetic tRNA[Ser]Sec was aminoacylated with serine by seryl-tRNASer synthetase, the seryl moiety was phosphorylated (21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec was isolated (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The extent of serylation of tRNA[Ser]Sec in the presence of seryl-tRNASer synthetase, serine, and other reaction components was 80-90%, and subsequent phosphorylation in the presence of PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase, ATP, and other reaction components neared 100% (Refs. 21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar and references therein). 3X.-M. Xu, B. A. Carlson and D. L. Hatfield, unpublished data. The preparations of seryl-tRNASer synthetase and PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec were exactly as described elsewhere (see Ref. 21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and references therein). Because less than 20% spontaneous deacylation of the aminoacyl-tRNA[Ser]Sec constituents occurs during their preparation and use (Ref. 21Carlson B.A. Xu X.M. Kryukov G.V. Rao M. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12848-12853Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and references therein), the relative amounts of tRNA[Ser]Sec, seryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec, and PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec used in reactions with SecS generating Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec can be estimated to be ∼45:0:55, respectively, wherein an ∼20% deacylation occurs at both steps involving PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec preparation. The activities of mmuSecSelast and of the mmuSecS point mutants relative to that of the full-length wild type mmuSecS were determined. Thioredoxin (Trx) was used as a negative control. Sec synthetic reactions were carried out as described (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The selenium donor, SeP, was generated from chemically synthesized [(CH3)3SiO]3PSe (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which was a generous gift of Dr. Richard Glass, and 0.2 mm SeP was used in all Sec synthesis assays. Dephosphorylation Activity of mmuSecS—Dephosphorylation of PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec was carried out as described (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In the inhibition assays, mmuSecS was incubated with different concentrations of propargylglycine (PG) or trifluoroalanine (F3-Ala) for 3 min at room temperature in a 10-μl volume of buffer (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar), 100 ng of 32P-labeled and 1.0 μg of cold PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec were added to bring the total volume to 20 μl, and the reaction was incubated at 310 K for 15 min. To assess the activity of mmuSecS on free PSer, a stock solution of [32P]PSer was prepared by deacylating 0.5 μg of [32P]PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec in 25 μl at pH 9.0 and 315 K for 1 h.5 μl of [32P]PSer were added to each of the mmuSecS reactions and then incubated for 15 min at 310 K. 10 units of alkaline phosphatase were used to dephosphorylate [32P]PSer, and the resulting phosphate was used as a positive control. Reactions were prepared for chromatography and chromatographed as given (28Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Mix H. Zhang Y. Saira K. Glass R.S. Berry M.J. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 0096-0105Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Crystallographic Procedures—For crystallization, 1.5 μl of mmuSecSelast (14 mg/ml in buffer C) were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (11% [v/v] ethylene glycol without other buffer components) in a 24-well Cryschem plate (Hampton Research) immediately after elastase treatment. Crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 293 K. They appeared overnight and continued to grow for the next 2 days. For data collection, crystals of mmuSecSelast were shock-frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryosystems) after transfer into a cryo-protecting buffer (100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 35% (v/v) ethylene glycol).

https://openalex.org/W1987458637,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-sensitive (HCN) channels mediate the I(f) current in heart and I(h) throughout the nervous system. In spiking neurons I(h) participates primarily in different forms of rhythmic activity. Little is known, however, about its role in neurons operating with graded potentials as in the retina, where all four channel isoforms are expressed. Intriguing evidence for an involvement of I(h) in early visual processing are the side effects reported, in dim light or darkness, by cardiac patients treated with HCN inhibitors. Moreover, electroretinographic recordings indicate that these drugs affect temporal processing in the outer retina. Here we analyzed the functional role of HCN channels in rod bipolar cells (RBCs) of the mouse. Perforated-patch recordings in the dark-adapted slice found that RBCs exhibit I(h), and that this is sensitive to the specific blocker ZD7288. RBC input impedance, explored by sinusoidal frequency-modulated current stimuli (0.1-30 Hz), displays band-pass behavior in the range of I(h) activation. Theoretical modeling and pharmacological blockade demonstrate that high-pass filtering of input signals by I(h), in combination with low-pass filtering by passive properties, fully accounts for this frequency-tuning. Correcting for the depolarization introduced by shunting through the pipette-membrane seal, leads to predict that in darkness I(h) is tonically active in RBCs and quickens their responses to dim light stimuli. Immunohistochemistry targeting candidate subunit isoforms HCN1-2, in combination with markers of RBCs (PKC) and rod-RBC synaptic contacts (bassoon, mGluR6, Kv1.3), suggests that RBCs express HCN2 on the tip of their dendrites. The functional properties conferred by I(h) onto RBCs may contribute to shape the retina's light response and explain the visual side effects of HCN inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1971872489,"Antigen-mediated cross-linking of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI), in the plasma membrane of mast cells, is the first step in the allergic immune response. This event triggers the phosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the cytoplasmic segments of the β and γ subunits of FcϵRI by the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn, which is anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Lyn-induced phosphorylation of FcϵRI occurs in a cholesterol-dependent manner, leading to the hypothesis that cholesterol-rich domains, or “lipid rafts,” may act as functional platforms for IgE receptor signaling. Testing this hypothesis under physiological conditions remains challenging because of the notion that these functional domains are likely transient and much smaller than the diffraction limit of optical microscopy. Here we use ultrafast fluorescence dynamics to investigate the correlation between nanostructural changes in the plasma membrane (labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine (diI-C18)) and IgE-FcϵRI cross-linking in adherent RBL mast cells stimulated with multivalent antigen. Time-dependent two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of diI-C18 shows changes in lifetime that agree with the kinetics of stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FcϵRI, the first identifiable biochemical step of the allergic response, under the same conditions. In addition, two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled IgE indicates that Förster resonance energy transfer occurs with diI-C18 in the plasma membrane.

Previously, we reexamined existing spatial relationships between lipid microdomains and extensively cross-linked IgE-FcϵRI patches at the single cell level by probing the spatio-temporal dynamics (ps to ns) of the molecules that comprise these domains (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using ultrafast excited state dynamics and rotational diffusion (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we observed that the lipid order (i.e. packing) or nanostructure of the plasma membrane is enhanced within cross-linking-induced lipid microdomains, or patches, as evidenced by increases in both fluorescence lifetime and rotational diffusion of diI-C18. Similar trends in the same dynamic properties were also observed for cross-linked, co-localized A488-IgE-FcϵRI. These results supported the hypothesis that lipid molecules are recruited into more ordered domains that serve as platforms for IgE-FcϵRI signaling. Furthermore, the gross perturbations inherent under these nonphysiological cross-linking conditions provided a simple platform on which to test and optimize our fluorescence dynamics imaging assay (25Davey A.M.

Nonetheless, under physiological conditions, cholesterolrich lipid domains in live cells have been hypothesized to vary in composition, dimension, and life span, making them a challenge to directly interrogate with relevant spatial and temporal resolution (28Owen D.M.

The spatial scale of diffraction-limited imaging and the time scale of translational diffusion-based spectroscopic techniques (μs to s) present an obstacle toward understanding the molecular bases regulating domain formation and biological function. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy have been used to monitor the translational dynamics of carbocyanine probes in adherent RBL cells as a function of cholesterol depletion (16Bacia K.

Here, in individual mast cells under more physiological conditions, we test the hypothesis that IgE-FcϵRI signaling occurs in specialized, cholesterol-rich regions of the plasma membrane, using the same fluorescence dynamics assay (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Ariola F.S. Mudaliar D.J. Walvick R.P. Heikal A.A. Phys.

Our rationale is that membrane-associated molecular events on the ps to ns time scales translate to interrogating structural changes on the spatial order of 100 nm (at 100-ps resolution) (30Zewail A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 4371-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is below the diffraction limit of traditional optical microscopy. By interrogating the fast molecular dynamics and order of the plasma membrane as mast cells are stimulated with multivalent antigen at room temperature (23 °C), where domains may be transient and smaller than the diffraction limit, we could relate these changes directly to the stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FcϵRI, the earliest biochemical step in the pathway (under identical conditions). To the best of our knowledge, the work described here represents the first time that these ultrafast dynamics methods have been used to monitor membrane-protein relationships during physiological cell signaling.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 31Pierini L. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Adherent cells (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated onto glass-bottomed 35-mm Petri dishes (MatTek) and sensitized overnight with 0.75 μg of mouse anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE (α-DNP IgE, provided by Dr. David Holowka, Cornell University) per 1 ml of cell suspension. IgE was used either unlabeled or conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (A488-IgE) via a commercially available protein labeling kit (Invitrogen) (dye/IgE = 4). The day of the experiment, the cells were washed three times with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-containing buffered saline solution (BSA/BSS: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml BSA). Cells were then labeled for 3 min at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml diI-C18 (Invitrogen) stock solution prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) that had been diluted 100-fold in BSS, and then washed three times with BSA/BSS. RBL cells were stimulated on the microscope at room temperature (23 °C) with 1 μg/ml multivalent DNP-BSA antigen. Cells were either imaged as only diI-C18-labeled, only A488-IgE-labeled, or dually labeled with both probes. For solution experiments, A488-IgE was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and diI-C18 in Me2SO. Absorption spectra of 10 μm Alexa Fluor 488 in water, 0.052 μm A488-IgE in PBS, and 10 μm diI-C18 in Me2SO were measured with a diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard 8453A) equipped with Chemstation software (Agilent). A fluorimeter (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog FL3-21) was used to record the fluorescence emission spectra of 0.1 μm Alexa Fluor 488 in water, 0.01 μm A488-IgE in PBS, and 2.5 μm diI-C18 in Me2SO. In Vivo Tyrosine Phosphorylation Assays—Adherent, IgE-sensitized RBL cells were plated overnight in 48-well culture plates. The cells were washed three times with BSA/BSS and stimulated at 23 °C for the indicated times with 1 μg/ml DNP-BSA, lysed by addition of SDS sample buffer (10% glycerol, 0.05 m Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g. Equal numbers of cell equivalents of lysate (typically 3.5 × 103 cell eq) were electrophoresed on 12% nonreduced SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to BioTrace polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL Gelman Laboratory), and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10-HRP) (Millipore). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology) was used to detect phosphorylated proteins and quantified from scanned blots using Un-Scan-It (Silk Scientific) and Igor-Pro (WaveMetrics) (6Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 26Holowka D. Sheets E.D. Baird B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—The experimental setup and data analysis have been described in more detail elsewhere (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Ariola F.S. Mudaliar D.J. Walvick R.P. Heikal A.A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006; 8: 4517-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, a confocal microscope consisting of a fiber-coupled laser system, a scanner (Olympus FluoView300), differential interference contrast optics, an inverted microscope (Olympus IX81), and an Olympus 60×, 1.2 NA water-immersion objective was used for three-channel imaging. A488-IgE was imaged using 488 nm argon ion laser excitation and a 525/30 bandpass filter, whereas diI-C18 was imaged with 543 nm HeNe laser excitation and a 605/70 bandpass filter. Differential interference contrast imaging was used to monitor cell viability before and after all experiments to ensure that no photodamage had occurred. Unlabeled RBL cells showed negligible autofluorescence (data not shown). Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging—A femtosecond laser system (∼120 fs, 76 MHz) provided 960 nm excitation, which was conditioned and steered toward the sample, through the confocal scanner and Olympus 60×, 1.2 NA water-immersion objective for 2P-FLIM. The epi-fluorescence was isolated from the excitation laser (∼0.5-5 milliwatt or ∼10-100 pJ/pulse at the sample) using a dichroic mirror and filters (690SP for all samples, plus a 600LP to detect only diI-C18 or plus a 525/50 bandpass to detect only A488-IgE; Chroma) prior to detection using micro-channel plates (Hamamatsu R3809U-50). For 2P-FLIM, measured at the magic angle (54.7°), and polarization imaging, measured at polarizations parallel and perpendicular relative to the excitation laser, the epi-fluorescence polarization was analyzed using a Glan-Thompson polarizer before each of two detector channels. The signal was amplified, and fluorescence lifetime images were constructed with a time-correlated single-photon counting module (Becker & Hickl SPC830) (27Ariola F.S. Mudaliar D.J. Walvick R.P. Heikal A.A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006; 8: 4517-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2P-FLIM images were recorded using 256 × 256 pixels with 65 time bins per pixel (i.e. 259 ps/bin) and a total acquisition time of 120 s, which is slower than membrane ruffling of antigen-stimulated cells. However, these studies remain relevant because of the three-dimensional resolution inherent in 2P microscopy, the polarized excitation selectivity, and the distinct differences in time scales of ruffling (s) versus excited state dynamics (ps to ns). Experiments were performed over several days on different cell preparations. Complementary 1P (480 nm, 4.2 MHz) time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out to enhance the time resolution and signal-to-noise ratio as described previously (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Ariola F.S. Mudaliar D.J. Walvick R.P. Heikal A.A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006; 8: 4517-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In these studies, the laser beam was strategically positioned at areas of interest on the cell membrane. In some cases, single cell averaging measurements using 2P-FLIM (pseudo-single point measurements) were also carried out to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution using low repetition rate laser pulses (960 nm, 4.2 MHz) scanned over the entire cell. Fluorescence Polarization Anisotropy Imaging—Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed using 2P and 1P excitation, respectively. For steady-state 2P anisotropy imaging, the parallel (0°) and perpendicular (90°) fluorescence polarizations were recorded simultaneously in a two-channel, laser-scanning mode. For time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, 1P laser pulses were positioned on regions of interest on the cells, or a single cell was averaged via scanning 2P-FLIM, and the epi-fluorescence polarizations were resolved and detected simultaneously as described earlier. Both polarization images and time-resolved fluorescence polarization decays were constructed using the SPC830 module. Theory and Data Analysis—The fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore provides information about its molecular structure and the surrounding local environment (32Hess S.T. Sheets E.D. Wagenknecht-Wiesner A. Heikal A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2566-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Lakowicz J.R. 3rd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, Singapore2006Google Scholar). Generally, the magic angle fluorescence decay of a fluorophore, located at pixel (x,y), can be described as a sum of exponentials with time constants (τi) and amplitudes (αi) as shown in Equation 1 (27Ariola F.S. Mudaliar D.J. Walvick R.P. Heikal A.A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006; 8: 4517-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), I54.7(t;x,y)=∑i=13αi(x,y)exp(-t/τi(x,y))(Eq. 1) The magic angle fluorescence decays were analyzed by a nonlinear, least squares fitting routine with deconvolution of the system response function (FWHM ∼ 60 ps) in the SPCImage software package (Becker & Hickl GmbH). The average fluorescence lifetime was calculated as 〈τfl〉=∑iαiτi/∑iαi, and the residual and reduced χ¯2 were used to assess the goodness of fit, with χ¯2 = 1.0-1.3 considered satisfactory. The error of the average lifetime value for a given 2P-FLIM image was determined by fitting the total image histogram to a Gaussian with IgorPro to obtain the width or standard deviation. Unpaired, two-tailed Student's t tests were performed using Excel (Microsoft) to determine whether variations in fluorescence decay parameters as a function of antigen stimulation were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). Following photoselective excitation of a fluorophore at pixel coordinates (x,y) in a cell, the time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy, r(t;x,y) can be described as indicated in Equation 2 (27Ariola F.S. Mudaliar D.J. Walvick R.P. Heikal A.A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006; 8: 4517-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), r(t;x,y)=(I∥(t;x,y)-I∥0)-G×(I⊥(t;x,y)-I⊥0)(I∥(t;x,y)-I∥0)+2G×(I⊥(t;x,y)-I⊥0)'=∑j=13βj(x,y)exp(-t/ϕj(x,y))(Eq. 2) where the parallel (I∥) and perpendicular (I⊥) fluorescence emission intensities per pixel were corrected for background signals (I∥0 and I⊥0, respectively). The G-factor (0.74) was calculated using the tail matching approach (32Hess S.T. Sheets E.D. Wagenknecht-Wiesner A. Heikal A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2566-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Lakowicz J.R. 3rd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, Singapore2006Google Scholar) to account for the polarization dependence of the detection efficiency (33Lakowicz J.R. 3rd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, Singapore2006Google Scholar). The rotational correlation time (Φj) depends on the hydrodynamic volume of the fluorophore and the surrounding viscosity (33Lakowicz J.R. 3rd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, Singapore2006Google Scholar). The pre-exponential factor (βj), whose sum is equal to the initial anisotropy, r0, can be used to assess the population fractions of fluorophores under different environmental restrictions (33Lakowicz J.R. 3rd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer, Singapore2006Google Scholar). Depolarization because of the high NA objective was determined previously to be negligible when using an under-filled objective, as is the case for 1P measurements here (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The degree of orientational constraint of a fluorophore is defined by the ratio, r∞/r0, which describes its range of angular rotation (34Kinosita K.J. Ikegami A. Kawato S. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 461-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 35Kinosita K.J. Kawato S. Ikegami A. Biophys. J. 1977; 20: 289-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Using MATLAB (The Mathworks), we developed an image processing algorithm to calculate steady-state initial anisotropy images (r0(t;x,y)) (25Davey A.M. Walvick R.P. Liu Y. Heikal A.A. Sheets E.D. Bio"
https://openalex.org/W2010993487,"Periodontal disease in diabetic patients presents higher severity and prevalence; and increased severity of ligature-induced periodontal disease has been verified in diabetic rats. However, in absence of aggressive stimuli such as ligatures, the influence of diabetes on rat periodontal tissues is incompletely explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the establishment and progression of periodontal diseases in rats only with diabetes induction.Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats (n = 25) by intravenous administration of alloxan (42 mg/kg) and were analyzed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after diabetes induction. The hemimandibles were removed and submitted to radiographical and histopathological procedures. A significant reduction was observed in height of bone crest in diabetic animals at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, which was associated with increased numbers of osteoclasts and inflammatory cells. The histopathological analyses of diabetic rats also showed a reduction in density of collagen fibers, fibroblasts and blood vessels. Severe caries were also detected in the diabetic group.The results demonstrate that diabetes induction triggers, or even co-induces the onset of alterations which are typical of periodontal diseases even in the absence of aggressive factors such as ligatures. Therefore, diabetes induction renders a previously resistant host into a susceptible phenotype, and hence diabetes can be considered a very important risk factor to the development of periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W1982474276,"Individual protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases target multiple substrates; this may generate conflicting signals, possibly within a single pathway. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase ϵ (PTPϵ) performs two potentially opposing roles: in Neu-induced mammary tumors, PTPϵ activates Src downstream of Neu, whereas in other systems PTPϵ can indirectly down-regulate MAP kinase signaling. We now show that the latter effect is mediated at least in part via the adaptor protein Shc. PTPϵ binds and dephosphorylates Shc in vivo, reducing the association of Shc with Grb2 and inhibiting downstream ERK activation. PTPϵ binds Shc in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner mediated by the Shc PTB domain and aided by a sequence of 10 N-terminal residues in PTPϵ. Surprisingly, PTPϵ dephosphorylates Shc in a kinase-dependent manner; PTPϵ targets Shc in the presence of Src but not in the presence of Neu. Using a series of point mutants of Shc and Neu, we show that Neu protects Shc from dephosphorylation by binding the PTB domain of Shc, most likely competing against PTPϵ for binding the same domain. In agreement, PTPϵ dephosphorylates Shc in mouse embryo fibroblasts but not in Neu-induced mammary tumor cells. We conclude that in the context of Neu-induced mammary tumor cells, Neu prevents PTPϵ from targeting Shc and from reducing its promitogenic signal while phosphorylating PTPϵ and directing it to activate Src in support of mitogenesis. In so doing, Neu contributes to the coherence of the promitogenic role of PTPϵ in this system.

Tyrosine kinases and phosphatases are then vastly outnumbered by their potential substrates. These enzymes target multiple substrates each and may play distinct, sometimes opposite, roles in different physiological circumstances. One such example is PTP1B, which down-regulates insulin receptor signaling and several other growth factor receptor pathways (3Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L.

Nevertheless, the outcomes of signaling pathways are specific, coherent, and reproducible, implying that molecular mechanisms exist to prevent or to control situations where opposite signals can be generated by the same enzyme.

However, it remains unclear how the potential conflicts between the activities of a particular PTP on several of its substrates within a single system are prevented or resolved. The two major protein forms of PTPϵ are the receptor type (RPTPϵ) and non-receptor type (cyt-PTPϵ) enzymes (20Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 218: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both forms can support or inhibit mitogenic signaling in a context-dependent manner. We have shown that RPTPϵ supports the transformed phenotype of mouse mammary tumors induced in vivo by an activated Neu transgene. RPTPϵ activates c-Src; lack of RPTPϵ in Neu-induced mammary tumor cells reduced c-Src activity, caused the cells to display aberrant morphology, and reduced their proliferation rate in culture and in vivo (23Gil-Henn H. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15579-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Src by RPTPϵ was shown to be dependent upon phosphorylation of the PTP at its C-terminal tyrosine Tyr695 by Neu (24Berman-Golan D. Elson A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7028-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A Neu-RPTPϵ-Src signaling pathway exists therefore in mammary tumor cells induced by Neu, in which Neu phosphorylates RPTPϵ, thereby driving the phosphatase to activate c-Src and to contribute to the transformed phenotype of these cells (24Berman-Golan D. Elson A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7028-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a clear role for RPTPϵ and cyt-PTPϵ in down-regulating signaling events was shown in the context of insulin receptor signaling (25Andersen J.N. Elson A. Lammers R. Romer J. Clausen J.T. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Nakagawa Y. Aoki N. Aoyama K. Shimizu H. Shimano H. Yamada N. Miyazaki H. Zool. Sci.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that regulate and balance between these opposing roles remain unclear. The ShcA gene yields three protein products, p46, p52, and p66. Shc proteins can associate with a variety of activated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and can be phosphorylated by them on tyrosines Tyr239/Tyr240/Tyr317 (numbered as in p52 Shc). The phosphorylated Shc proteins serve as adaptors, leading to recruitment of the Grb2-SOS complex and resulting in activation of downstream signaling. p66 Shc was found to be a proapoptotic factor activated in response to oxidative stress (32Purdom S. Chen Q.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 206-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that PTPϵ dephosphorylates the three protein products of the ShcA gene following phosphorylation by Src. In so doing, PTPϵ also inhibits the Shc-Grb2 association and phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 further down-stream. In the context of Neu-induced tumor cells, this activity of RPTPϵ should convey an antimitogenic signal, thus antagonizing the promitogenic contribution of RPTPϵ through its activation of Src. Surprisingly, RPTPϵ does not target Shc in cells in which the predominant kinase is Neu, including in Neu-transformed mammary tumor cells, due to strong physical interaction between Neu and Shc. We conclude that Neu balances between two opposing activities of RPTPϵ. Neu phosphorylates RPTPϵ and drives it to activate Src while binding Shc tightly and preventing the phosphatase from dephosphorylating the adaptor molecule. As a result, Neu prevents the potential conflict between these pro- and antimitogenic activities of PTPϵ in mammary tumors, enabling PTPϵ to support mitogenic signaling in a self-consistent and coherent manner.

Monoclonal antibodies used included anti-glutathione S-transferase (Calbiochem), anti-v-Src (Calbiochem), anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma), and anti-Grb2 (BD Transduction Laboratories). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation (clone PY20; Transduction Laboratories) and protein blotting (clone PY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell Culture–Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and SYF cells (immortalized mouse fibroblasts lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn (39Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar)) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 4 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique as described (33Toledano-Katchalski H. Elson A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas SYF cells were transfected by the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Metabolic labeling of cells was performed at 70% confluence; cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-deficient DMEM, followed by overnight incubation in similar medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (175 μCi (1000 Ci/mmol) per 5 ml of medium per plate). Spontaneously immortalized embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from PTPϵ-deficient or wild-type mice by the 3T3 method. NIH3T3 cells were transformed by expression of v-Ha-Ras. Both types of cells were grown in DMEM supplemented as above, which, for the embryonic fibroblasts, also contained 6 × 10–5 m β-mercaptoethanol. Mammary tumor cells isolated from spontaneous tumors of mice carrying the V664E Neu transgene and genetically lacking PTPϵ (23Gil-Henn H. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15579-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and glutamine and antibiotics as above. RPTPϵ was expressed in these cells by retrovirus-mediated infection as described (23Gil-Henn H. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15579-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Protein Blot Analysis–Cells or tissues were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm N-(α-aminoethyl) benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, 40 μm bestatin, 15 μm E64, 20 μm leupeptin, 15 μm pepstatin; Sigma) and 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate. Pervanadate was replaced with 5 mm sodium iodoacetate when the association between Shc and D245A cyt-PTPϵ was examined. Protein amounts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 1–3 mg of total cell lysate and protein A and/or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences or Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as described (24Berman-Golan D. Elson A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7028-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic GST pull-down studies were performed by rocking 800 μg of cellular proteins with glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce) that had been previously blocked in 1% skim milk, followed by three washes in buffer A. Immunoprecipitated material and crude cell lysates were subject to SDS-PAGE and blotting as described (7Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31772-31779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purification of Bacterial GST Fusion Proteins–Bacterial GST fusion proteins were grown in Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce) previously blocked in 1% milk. Following three washes in NETE buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), proteins were eluted in 20 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The quantity and purity of the purified proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Gel-code staining (Pierce). In Vitro Dephosphorylation of Shc–Eukaryotic GST-Shc fusion proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells together with Neu or Y527F Src. Cells were lysed in buffer A as above, supplemented with sodium pervanadate, and rocked gently with glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce) for 3 h followed by 10 washes in buffer A. FLAG-tagged cyt-PTPϵ was expressed in HEK293 cells and was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma) followed by three washes with buffer A, two washes with buffer B (100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol), and two washes with buffer 54K (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5% Triton X-100), all without pervanadate supplement. FLAG-tagged cyt-PTPϵ was then eluted by incubation of the beads with Elution Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide) (Sigma). The integrity, purity, and amount of GST-Shc and PTPϵ were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Bio-Rad) using a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Dephosphorylation reactions were conducted in 150 μl of activity buffer (50 mm MES, pH 7, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), to which 100 ng of purified, eluted cyt-PTPϵ and a similar amount of Shc bound to beads were added. Following gentle rocking at 32 °C for 7 h, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Shc and PTPϵ Associate in Vivo–Previous studies have shown that PTPϵ can down-regulate MAPK signaling but does so indirectly (28Toledano-Katchalski H. Kraut J. Sines T. Granot-Attas S. Shohat G. Gil-Henn H. Yung Y. Elson A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 541-550PubMed Google Scholar), most likely by targeting an upstream molecule(s). In order to examine this issue, we studied the effect of PTPϵ on the adaptor protein Shc as a possible candidate for mediating these effects. Endogenous Shc proteins formed stable associations with endogenous cyt-PTPϵ or RPTPϵ in several tissues and cell types, including in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, Jurkat T-cells, and mouse brain (Fig. 1). p66 Shc and p52 Shc bound PTPϵ; p46 Shc was not visible in these experiments due to interference of the precipitating antibody heavy chain. Similar association was observed in HEK293 cells, which express endogenous p46 and p52 Shc, upon expression of full-length, WT cyt-PTPϵ or of various other forms of PTPϵ (Fig. 2A). The substrate-trapping mutant D245A cyt-PTPϵ (34Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) bound cyt-PTPϵ as strongly as WT Shc; similar binding was observed also when the inactive R283M cyt-PTPϵ or Y683F cyt-PTPϵ, which lacks the key phosphorylation site analogous to Tyr695 in RPTPϵ, was used (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that a stable complex containing both cyt-PTPϵ and Shc exists and that this interaction does not require PTPϵ activity or C-terminal phosphorylation of the phosphatase. In contrast, the receptor RPTPϵ and the shorter p67 form associated with Shc less strongly (Fig. 2A). The only structural difference between cyt-PTPϵ and p67 is the presence of a unique sequence of 27 amino acid residues at the N terminus of cyt-PTPϵ (36Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether sequence motifs present in this region affect binding to Shc, we examined the ability of a series of N-terminal mutant cyt-PTPϵ proteins to bind Shc. cyt-PTPϵ truncation mutants lacking the first 4, 8, or 11 amino acids tended to bind Shc more strongly than full-length cyt-PTPϵ. Mutants of cyt-PTPϵ lacking residues 11–27 or lacking the first 22 residues bound Shc similar to p67 (Fig. 2B). We conclude that sequences between positions 12 and 22 of cyt-PTPϵ are important for binding Shc, whereas residues 1–4 of cyt-PTPϵ may inhibit this association. No obvious sequence motifs that bind PTB domains are present within this region, possibly suggesting that these residues contribute indirectly to the Shc-cyt-PTPϵ association, as discussed further below.FIGURE 2Mechanistic dissection of the PTPϵ-Shc interaction. A, endogenous Shc preferentially binds cyt PTPϵ. HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged cDNAs for WT cyt-PTPϵ (cyt), WT RPTPϵ (R), p67 (p67), R283M cyt-PTPϵ (cytRM), D245A cyt-PTPϵ (cytDA), and Y683F cyt-PTPϵ (cytYF). PTPϵ was immunoprecipitated via its FLAG tag, and PTPϵ and associated Shc were detected by blotting with FLAG or Shc antibodies (top two panels). The bottom panel shows expression of endogenous Shc in the cell lysates. B, residues 12–22 of cyt-PTPϵ contribute to Shc binding. Top, sequence of the N terminus of cyt-PTPϵ and schematic representation of the N termini of truncation and deletion mutants of cyt-PTPϵ used. Bottom, binding of PTPϵ molecules to endogenous Shc was examined by co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (top). Also shown are amounts of precipitated Shc and expression of PTPϵ mutants (second and third panel, respectively). M1 and M28, initiator methionines that give rise to cyt-PTPϵ and p67, respectively (36Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A.

Bottom, bar diagram showing amounts (mean ± S.E.) of co-precipitated PTPϵ; *, p ≤ 0.023 relative to cyt-PTPϵ by Student's t test, n = 3–4. C, PTPϵ binds the PTB domain of Shc. Lysates of HEK293 cells expressing HA-tagged cyt-PTPϵ were incubated with bacterially produced GST fusion proteins of full-length Grb2, full-length (FL) Shc, the SH2 or PTB domains of Shc, or GST alone. Following immunoprecipitation of PTPϵ, bound GST fusion proteins were detected by blotting for GST (panels 1 and 3). The amount of precipitated cyt-PTPϵ (panels 2 and 4) and input of GST fusion proteins (panel 5) are also shown. Cells were either treated (+V) or not (–V) with 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate prior to lysis. Note that pervanadate treatment increases binding of GST-Grb2 to cyt-PTPϵ, which is dependent upon PTPϵ phosphorylation (33Toledano-Katchalski H. Elson A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Shc-PTPϵ interaction was recapitulated also when bacterially produced GST fusion proteins of various domains of Shc were used to pull down cyt-PTPϵ from lysates of eukaryotic cells. A fusion protein containing the PTB domain of Shc bound cyt-PTPϵ strongly, whereas a protein containing the Shc SH2 domain did not bind cyt-PTP at all (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, a GST fusion of full-length p52 Shc bound cyt-PTPϵ less well than a fusion protein containing only the PTB domain. These results indicate that the Shc-PTPϵ interaction is mediated by the PTB domain of Shc and suggest that other sequences within Shc may antagonize this interaction. Similar binding was observed when the GST-Shc fusion proteins were used to pull down hyperphosphorylated cyt-PTPϵ from cells pretreated with sodium pervanadate, indicating that the Shc-cyt-PTPϵ interaction is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphatase (Fig. 2C). The Shc PTB domain binds the nonreceptor type phosphatase PTP-PEST by targeting a tyrosineless NPLH sequence motif located at the C terminus of the PTP (41Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). cyt-PTPϵ contains a similar sequence, NPSH, at positions 266–269 within its D1 PTP domain. However, mutating the above four residues to alanines did not affect binding of cyt-PTPϵ to Shc, indicating that the NPSH motif is not a target of the Shc PTB domain (not shown). Replacement of tyrosines 239, 240, or 317 on Shc, which play important roles in binding Grb2 and in Shc signaling (42Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), with nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residues also had no effect on cyt-PTPϵ binding (not shown). Together with the strong ability of bacterially produced GST-Shc proteins to bind cyt-PTPϵ (Fig. 2C), this result indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc is also not required for the interaction with cyt-PTPϵ. In all, we conclude that the Shc-cyt-PTPϵ interaction is mediated by the PTB domain of Shc and is supported by residues 12–22 of cyt-PTPϵ; the interaction is constitutive and is independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of either Shc or cyt-PTPϵ. cyt-PTPϵ Reduces Shc Phosphorylation in a Kinase-specific Manner– In order to examine the physiological consequences of the Shc-cyt-PTPϵ interaction, we expressed the phosphatase in cells and examined its effect on phosphorylation of endogenous Shc in 293 cells. Basal phosphorylation of Shc in this system is low, hence Shc was activated by co-expression of PTKs. When the endogenous p46 and p52 forms of Shc were phosphorylated in the presence of activated (Y527F) Src, cyt-PTPϵ reduced their phosphorylation levels significantly (Fig. 3A). Catalytically inactive R283M cyt-PTPϵ did not reduce Shc phosphorylation, indicating that this effect requires PTPϵ activity. Similar results were obtained also when wild-type Src was used (not shown) and when experiments were repeated in fibroblasts lacking endogenous Src, Fyn, and Yes (Fig. 3B). The latter cells also express p66 Shc, whose phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of cyt-PTPϵ. Interestingly, the presence of cyt-PTPϵ did not reduce phosphorylation of Shc when the latter was phosphorylated by Neu (Fig. 3, C and D). The distinction between Neu and Src also affected down-stream signaling events; the presence of cyt-PTPϵ reduced the association of Shc with Grb2 and reduced activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in the presence of S"
https://openalex.org/W2013111603,"Blood-based studies have demonstrated the potential of immunological assays to detect tuberculosis. However lung fluid sampling may prove superior as it enables simultaneous microbiological detection of mycobacteria to be performed. Until now this has only been possible using the expensive and invasive technique of broncho-alveolar lavage. We sought to evaluate an immunoassay using non-invasive induced-sputum to diagnose active tuberculosis.Prospective cohort study of forty-two spontaneous sputum smear-negative or sputum non-producing adults under investigation for tuberculosis. CD4 lymphocytes specific to purified-protein-derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis actively synthesising interferon-gamma were measured by flow cytometry and final diagnosis compared to immunoassay using a cut-off of 0.5%. Sixteen subjects (38%) were HIV-infected (median CD4 count [range] = 332 cells/microl [103-748]). Thirty-eight (90%) were BCG-vaccinated. In 27 subjects diagnosed with active tuberculosis, the median [range] percentage of interferon-gamma synthetic CD4+ lymphocytes was 2.77% [0-23.93%] versus 0% [0-2.10%] in 15 negative for active infection (p<0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay versus final diagnosis of active tuberculosis were 89% (24 of 27) and 80% (12 of 15) respectively. The 3 positive assays in the latter group occurred in subjects diagnosed with quiescent/latent tuberculosis. Assay performance was unaffected by HIV-status, BCG-vaccination or disease site. Combining this approach with traditional microbiological methods increased the diagnostic yield to 93% (25 of 27) alongside acid-fast bacilli smear and 96% (26 of 27) alongside tuberculosis culture.These data demonstrate for the first time that a rapid immunological assay to diagnose active tuberculosis can be performed successfully in combination with microbiological methods on a single induced-sputum sample."
https://openalex.org/W1975123147,"Mediator complex is essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. Although chromatin remodeling is an integral part of transcriptional activation at many promoters, whether Mediator is required for this function has not been determined. Here we have used the yeast CHA1 gene to study the role of Mediator in chromatin remodeling and recruitment of the transcription machinery. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Mediator subunits are recruited to the induced CHA1 promoter. Inactivation of Mediator at 37 °C in yeast harboring the srb4-138 (med17) ts mutation severely reduces CHA1 activation and prevents recruitment to the induced CHA1 promoter of Med18/Srb5, from the head module of Mediator, and Med14/Rgr1, which bridges the middle and tail modules. In contrast, recruitment of Med15/Gal11 from the tail module is unaffected in med17 ts yeast at 37 °C. Recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP) is severely compromised in the absence of functional Mediator, whereas Kin28 and polymerase II recruitment are reduced but to a lesser extent. Induced levels of histone H3K4me3 at the CHA1 promoter are not diminished by inactivation of Mediator, whereas recruitment of Paf1 and of Ser2- and Ser5-phosphorylated forms of Rbp1 are reduced but not eliminated. Loss of histone H3 from the induced CHA1 promoter is seen in wild type yeast but is greatly reduced by loss of intact Mediator. In contrast, Swi/Snf recruitment and nucleosome remodeling are unaffected by loss of Mediator function.

Mediator in turn facilitates recruitment of the preinitiation complex (PIC) and Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex in a promoter-dependent fashion (21Kuras L. Struhl K.

Recruitment of pol II is probably achieved in part by direct contacts with the CTD domain of the Rpb1 subunit via the middle and head modules of Mediator, as visualized by electron microscopy (25Asturias F.J.

Genetic interactions between Mediator and pol II have also been shown by the identification of the SRB genes, which encode Mediator subunits, as suppressors of a truncated rpb1 mutant (27Thompson C.M.

Several studies have examined the relationship between Mediator complex and the recruitment of chromatin remodeling activities during gene activation. Stable association between Mediator and Swi/Snf was reported but also disputed (10Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D.

Direct recruitment of Mediator was shown to suffice for PHO5 remodeling and activation in “activator bypass” experiments (32Gaudreau L. Schmid A. Blaschke D. Ptashne M. Horz W. Cell. 1997; 89: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Activation of the GAL10 promoter by direct recruitment of Mediator was found to depend strongly on Swi/Snf, suggesting an intimate relationship between the two complexes (33Ryan M.P. Jones R. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1774-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that such direct recruitment of Mediator was indeed accompanied by Swi/Snf recruitment and that recruitment of Swi/Snf to the activated GAL1 promoter depends on functional Mediator complex (34Lemieux K. Gaudreau L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4040-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Swi/Snf by Gcn4 also depends strongly, but not completely, on Mediator integrity (35Yoon S. Qiu H. Swanson M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8829-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, several studies have reported a connection between Mediator and Swi/Snf recruitment. However, apart from a single report showing that Swi/Snf-dependent chromatin remodeling of the activated RNR3 promoter depends on Mediator, the requirement of Mediator for remodeling per se has not been examined (36Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the relationship between Mediator and chromatin remodeling at genes at which such remodeling does not depend on Swi/Snf has remained unexplored. To address this issue and to further our understanding of the role of the Mediator complex in gene activation, we have investigated the induction of the S. cerevisiae CHA1 gene. CHA1 encodes l-serine/threonine dehydratase, and its expression can be induced by serine or threonine (37Bornaes C. Petersen J.G. Holmberg S. Genetics. 1992; 131: 531-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bornaes C. Ignjatovic M.W. Schjerling P. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Holmberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7604-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The CHA1 promoter has an upstream activating sequence about 230 bp upstream of its ORF, which is constitutively bound by the activator, Cha4 (39Martens J.A. Wu P.Y. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2695-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 40Sabet N. Tong F. Madigan J.P. Volo S. Smith M.M. Morse R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4084-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and a TATA box at –90 bp (Fig. 1A); both are required for CHA1 transcription (40Sabet N. Tong F. Madigan J.P. Volo S. Smith M.M. Morse R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4084-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Holmberg S. Schjerling P. Genetics. 1996; 144: 467-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TATA element is occupied by a positioned nucleosome when the CHA1 gene is uninduced, and this nucleosome is remodeled upon activation in a Cha4-dependent manner, exposing the TATA element for TBP to bind (42Moreira J.M. Holmberg S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6028-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the TATA-occupying nucleosome is remodeled during CHA1 activation is currently unknown. Remodeling does not require the Swi/Snf complex, although the complex is recruited to the CHA1 promoter during its activation (39Martens J.A. Wu P.Y. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2695-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 42Moreira J.M. Holmberg S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6028-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we report the role of the Mediator complex in the recruitment of both PIC components and chromatin remodeling activities to the induced CHA1 promoter. We find that intact Mediator is required for recruitment of TBP and, to a somewhat lesser extent, pol II. Intact Mediator is required for histone H3 loss from the induced CHA1 promoter but, surprisingly, not for recruitment of Swi/Snf or for chromatin remodeling, the latter of which occurs independently of both Mediator and Swi/Snf. Furthermore, although loss of functional Mediator complex results in decreased levels of Paf1 and Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of pol II, both of which are required for H3 Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) (43Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol.

Yeast Strains and Growth—Yeast cultures were grown on complete synthetic dropout media. Transformation of yeast was performed as previously described (45Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Donald G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were rapidly shifted to 37 °C by adding an equal volume of medium prewarmed to 50 °C to cultures grown at 25 °C. The CHA1 gene was induced by the addition of 1 mg/ml serine to growth medium. Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains harboring the srb4-138 ts allele and their wild type counterparts were created by first introducing the plasmid RY2844 or RY2882 (harboring SRB4 or srb4-138) (1Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and then replacing the chromosomal SRB4 ORF with the KanMX cassette. Strain RMY503 was derived from Z628 (1Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).

Strains RMY511 and RMY512 were derived from H3028 (47Kim S.J. Swanson M.J. Qiu H. Govind C.K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11171-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Strains RMY521 and RMY522 were derived from MSY120 (48Zhang F. Sumibcay L. Hinnebusch A.G. Swanson M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6871-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Strains RMY551 and RMY552 were derived from BY4741 using EcoRV-digested pHQ1300 (a generous gift of Hongfang Qiu and Alan Hinnebusch) to introduce a10× Myc tag to Rpb3 prior to replacement of the endogenous SRB4 with plasmid-borne SRB4 or srb4-138.

For ChIP against Ser5- and Ser2-phosphorylated forms of the Rpb1 CTD, whole cell extract was incubated with ∼20 μg of H14 and H5 antibody (Covance), respectively, at 4 °C for 3 h, after which 0.5 μg of anti-mouse IgM antibody (Invitrogen) was added, and incubation continued overnight. Antigens then were precipitated by protein A-agarose beads, and DNA was extracted. Antibodies against Myc and HA tags were purchased from Roche Applied Science; antibody against H3K4me3 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and antibody against the COOH terminus of H3 (pan-H3 antibody) was from Lake Placid Biologicals. For ChIP of TAP-tagged proteins, antibody to protein A was used (Sigma). Quantitations were done either by PCR and Southern blot, using PCR conditions determined to be in the exponential phase of amplification (40Sabet N. Tong F. Madigan J.P. Volo S. Smith M.M. Morse R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4084-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or quantitative real time PCR and normalized as indicated in the figure legends. ChIP was repeated three or four times for each experiment, and S.D. values are shown in the figures. Primer sequences are available upon request. Chromatin Preparation and Indirect End Labeling—Chromatin structure was analyzed as described (40Sabet N. Tong F. Madigan J.P. Volo S. Smith M.M. Morse R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4653-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with all steps through MNase digestion performed at 37 °C to ensure the inactivation of Srb4 throughout the experiment. All chromatin mapping experiments were done at least twice and with a range of micrococcal nuclease concentrations. RNA and Protein Analysis—For analysis of CHA1 mRNA, RNA was prepared by standard methods, and Northern blotting was conducted as described previously (54Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 55Tsang S.S. Yin X. Guzzo-Arkuran C. Jones V.S. Davison A.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 380-381PubMed Google Scholar). CHA1 mRNA was normalized to 25 S rRNA. For Western blotting, 10 optical density at 600 nm (A600) units of cells (A600 =∼1.0) were precipitated and added to 3 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaN3 on ice, spun down, resuspended in 100 μl of ESB (2% SDS, 80 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 1.5% dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue), and quickly transferred to microcentrifuge tubes for a 3-min incubation at 100 °C. Glass beads were added to reach the meniscus, and the samples were vortexed at top speed for 2 min. An additional 100 μl of ESB was added, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 1 min. Following standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted to Millipore polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked by blotto buffer (5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for about 3 h at 4 °C. For Western blot against hyperphosphorylated Rpb1-CTD, the membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibodies H14 (1:3,000; Covance) and H5 (1:1,200; Covance) mixed with rabbit anti-IgM antibody (1:30,000; Invitrogen). For Western blot against histone H3, the membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of histone H3 (1:15,000; Upstate Biotechnology). Following washing by PBST (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20), the blots were incubated for about 3 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody. After washing, ECL (GE Healthcare) was used to illuminate the reactive band. Mediator Is Essential for CHA1 Activation—Mediator has been suggested to be required for all transcription mediated by pol II on the basis of in vivo and in vitro results (1Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, a recent study found no association of Mediator above background levels with a number of yeast genes, calling this general requirement into question (3Fan X. Chou D.M. Struhl K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To test whether Mediator is required for CHA1 induction, we used a ts mutant in the MED17/SRB4 gene, which encodes a subunit of the head module of Mediator and is essential in yeast. In yeast harboring the temperature-sensitive mutant srb4-138 (med17 ts), the head module of Mediator is disrupted at 37 °C, and mRNA transcription is decreased to less than 10% of wild type levels (1Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 80-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We monitored CHA1 expression in srb4 ts yeast and a corresponding wild type strain after rapidly shifting both strains from 25 to 37 °C prior to the addition of serine or inducing at 25 °C as a control and normalized to the 25 S rRNA message, which is transcribed by pol I and does not require Mediator. Results show that although CHA1 is induced to comparable levels at 25 °C over the first 2 h of induction in wild type and srb4-138 yeast, CHA1 expression in the srb4-138 mutant is greatly reduced at 37 °C compared with wild type (Fig. 1B; see also Fig. 2A). Thus, MED17/SRB4, and therefore intact Mediator, is essential for CHA1 activation. Effect of Loss of Med17/Srb4 Function on Mediator Recruitment—To test whether loss of CHA1 activation in srb4-138 ts yeast at 37 °C is caused by a direct effect, we used ChIP to assess Mediator recruitment to the induced CHA1 promoter, using the protocol depicted in Fig. 2A. Isogenic wild type and srb4-138 strains were generated from yeast expressing Myc-tagged Med18/Srb5 or Med15/Gal11 or TAP-tagged Med14/Rgr1 by deleting the endogenous MED17/SRB4 gene in the presence of an episomal copy of either wild type MED17/SRB4 or the srb4-138 ts mutant allele. The wild type and the mutant strains were grown at 25 °C, rapidly shifted to 37 °C, and kept at 37 °C for 30 min to inactivate the srb4 ts mutant. Half of each culture was then induced by 1 mg/ml serine for 30 min at 37 °C, whereas the other half was used as the uninduced control. RNA was extracted from an aliquot of the culture to monitor CHA1 mRNA, and the remainder was used for ChIP (Fig. 2A). Results of ChIP assays showed that upon induction, Med18/Srb5, Med14/Rgr1, and Med15/Gal11 are all recruited to the CHA1 promoter in wild type yeast, consistent with Mediator being recruited to the active gene promoter (Fig. 2, B–D). In the srb4 ts mutant strain, Med18/Srb5 and Med14/Rgr1 were no longer recruited to the activated CHA1 promoter (Fig. 2, B–C). Med18/Srb5 is a component of the head module of Mediator, which is disrupted at the restrictive temperature in srb4-138 ts yeast (12Takagi Y. Calero G. Komori H. Brown J.A. Ehrensberger A.H. Hudmon A. Asturias F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 355-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas Med14/Rgr1 bridges the middle and tail modules (9Guglielmi B. van Berkum N.L. Klapholz B. Bijma T. Boube M. Boschiero C. Bourbon H.M. Holstege F.C. Werner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5379-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore infer that the head and middle modules of Mediator are not recruited to the induced CHA1 promoter in srb4 ts yeast at 37 °C. Similarly, association of the head and middle modules of Mediator with the activated GAL1 promoter is reduced in srb4-138 ts yeast at 37 °C (12Takagi Y. Calero G. Komori H. Brown J.A. Ehrensberger A.H. Hudmon A. Asturias F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 355-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 56Linder T. Zhu X. Baraznenok V. Gustafsson C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, Med15/Gal11 recruitment was not affected in srb4-138 yeast after the temperature shift, since essentially the same increased level of Med15/Gal11 was measured at the CHA1 promoter upon induction in both the induced wild type and srb4 ts mutant strain (Fig. 2D). Western blotting indicates that levels of Med18/Srb5 and Med15/Gal11 are comparable in wild type and mutant yeast at 37 °C (data not shown), so that the differential recruitment observed cannot be attributed to altered protein levels. Together these results indicate a partial disruption of Mediator complex caused by the loss of Med17/Srb4 function; recruitment of the head and middle modules of the Mediator complex to the induced CHA1 promoter depends on functional Med17/Srb4, whereas recruitment of the tail module does not. This finding is consistent with a report that the tail module can be recruited to promoters activated by Gcn4 independently of the rest of Mediator (48Zhang F. Sumibcay L. Hinnebusch A.G.

Furthermore, previous lines of evidence have strongly suggested that ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 participate in global-genomic nucleotide excision repair, a critical antineoplastic pathway that removes helix-distorting DNA adducts induced by a variety of mutagenic agents, including UV. To rigorously evaluate the potential role of mitogen-activated protein kinases in global-genomic nucleotide excision repair, various human cell strains (primary skin fibroblasts, primary lung fibroblasts, and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells) were treated with highly specific chemical inhibitors, which, following UV exposure, (i) abrogated the capacities of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, or p38α/β to phosphorylate specific downstream effectors and (ii) characteristically modulated cellular proliferation, clonogenic survival, and/or apoptosis. A highly sensitive flow cytometry-based nucleotide excision repair assay recently optimized and validated in our laboratory was then employed to directly demonstrate that the kinetics of UV DNA photoadduct repair are highly similar in mock-treated versus mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor-treated cells. These data on primary and tumor cells treated with pharmacological inhibitors were fully corroborated by repair studies using (i) short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells and (ii) expression of a dominant negative p38α mutant in human primary lung fibroblasts.

Among these adducts is the highly promutagenic UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), which lies at the origin of sunlight-associated mutagenesis and skin cancer development (1Melnikova V.O. Ananthaswamy H.N. Mutat. Res. 2005; 571: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of NER is highlighted by xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective removal of bulky DNA adducts, UV hypersensitivity, and striking predisposition to skin cancer (2Kraemer K.H. Patronas N.J. Schiffmann R. Brooks B.P. Tamura D. DiGiovanna J.J. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NER status of tumors in cancer patients has been identified as a major determinant in the clinical response to UV-mimetic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, which exert antineoplastic effects via the induction of bulky DNA adducts (3Olaussen K.A. Dunant A. Fouret P. Brambilla E. Andre F. Haddad V. Taranchon E. Filipits M. Pirker R. Popper H.H. Stahel R. Sabatier L. Pignon J.P. Tursz T. Le Chevalier T. Soria J.C. N. Engl. J.

NER is composed of two distinct subpathways (i.e. global genomic-NER (GG-NER) removes bulky adducts from the genome overall, whereas transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) removes such adducts exclusively from the transcribed strands of active genes) (see Ref. 4Cleaver J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar for an excellent overview). These subpathways differ only in the mechanism of lesion recognition. GG-NER is triggered when the UV-DDB1/UV-DDB2 heterodimer recognizes and binds the helical distortion created by bulky adducts, which is followed by recruitment of the XPC-hHR23B complex. On the other hand, TC-NER is initiated uniquely by blockage of RNA polymerase II and subsequent recruitment of the CS-A and CS-B gene products. Thereafter, in the case of either GG-NER or TC-NER, the common “core NER pathway” is recruited to faithfully restore the integrity of the DNA through sequential steps of localized strand unwinding, incision of the DNA on either side of the adduct, excision of the adduct leaving a small single-stranded gap, and, finally, gap filling and ligation using normal DNA replication factors and the intact complementary strand as template. Since its initial discovery over 40 years ago, the GG-NER pathway has been extensively studied and fully reconstituted in vitro (5Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V.

Nonetheless, relatively little is known about the potential roles in this repair process of various preeminent mutagen-responsive cellular signaling cascades. It has, however, been shown in many human cell lines treated with the model mutagen 254-nm UV (hereafter UV) that the p53 tumor suppressor, a critical stress-induced regulator of apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoints, is strictly required for efficient GG-NER (6Mathonnet G.

Sci. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In support of this, up-regulation of the GG-NER-specific proteins UV-DDB2 and XPC were shown to depend upon the presence of functional p53 (8Adimoolam S. Ford J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 12985-12990Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 9Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 up-regulates Gadd45 and binds the histone acetyltransferase p300, events required to stimulate chromatin relaxation, which in turn facilitates access of GG-NER recognition proteins to damaged heterochromatin within the genome overall (10Smith M.L. Ford J.M. Hollander M.C. Bortnick R.A. Amundson S.A. Seo Y.R. Deng C.X. Hanawalt P.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Rubbi C.P. Milner J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Following exposure to diverse genotoxic agents, the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2), and p38α/β kinase, become rapidly phosphorylated and go on to activate a plethora of transcription factors that regulate apoptosis and/or growth arrest (12Hildesheim J. Fornace Jr., A.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Of particular interest here, it has been demonstrated in UV-irradiated human cells that all three MAPKs phosphorylate p53 on multiple amino acid residues and that this has functional consequences for both p53 stabilization and p53-dependent apoptosis (13Bulavin D.V.

This substantial level of cross-talk between the MAPK and p53 pathways strongly suggests a priori that the former pathway may also play a role in p53-dependent GG-NER. Although previous investigations have supported such a role in human cells, this important issue has still not been conclusively addressed (see “Discussion”). We thus employed human primary and tumor cell strains wherein MAPK signaling was abrogated using highly specific small molecule inhibitors, shRNA targeting, and/or expression of dominant negative mutant protein. A sensitive flow cytometry-based NER assay recently optimized and validated in our laboratory was then used to directly determine, in each UV-irradiated human strain, whether or not individual MAPKs modulate the efficiency of DNA photoproduct removal via GG-NER. Cell Culture—Primary human diploid skin fibroblasts (HDSFs), including the wild type strain (GM01652B) and XPA-deficient counterpart (GM01630), were purchased from the Coriell Institute. Primary human diploid lung fibroblasts (HDLFs) were provided by Dr. J. Sedivy (Brown University). HDLF-E6 (i.e. a p53-deficient isogenic derivative stably expressing the HPV-E6 oncoprotein) was described previously (18Therrien J.P. Drouin R. Baril C. Drobetsky E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 15038-15043Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Low passage HDSFs and HDLFs were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics (Wisent, Montreal, Canada). HCT116/p53+/+ human colon carcinoma cells and the isogenic p53-deficient counterpart (HCT116/p53-/-) (a gift of Dr. B. Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University) were cultured in McCoy's 5A supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. UV Irradiation—Cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS, covered with 2 ml of PBS, and irradiated with UV using a Philips G25T8 germicidal lamp at a fluence of 0.2 J/m2/s. Pharmacological Inhibition of MAPK Activity in Human Primary and Tumor Cell Strains—HDSFs, HDLFs, or HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were pretreated for 2 h with Me2SO (carrier) or with one among the highly specific chemical MAPK inhibitors 10 μm U0126, 30 μm SP600125, or 20 μm SB202190 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) to abrogate signaling through ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38α/β, respectively. Following UV or mock irradiation, fresh medium containing either Me2SO or inhibitor was added during subsequent incubations. shRNA-mediated Knockdown of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, or p53 in U2OS Osteosarcoma Cells—shRNA constructs, cloned into the pLKO.1-puro vector and targeting ERK1 (clone TRCN0000006150), ERK2 (clone TRCN0000010050), JNK1 (clone TRCN0000010580), or JNK2 (clone TRCN0000001012), were purchased from Sigma. ERK1 and ERK2 or JNK1 and JNK2 shRNA constructs were pooled (4 μg of each) and transiently transfected into U2OS osteosarcoma cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Immediately following antibiotic selection (i.e. for 3 days in 2 μg/ml puromycin), transfected cells were incubated for 3–5 h in complete medium without antibiotic prior to treatment with UV. Cells transfected with pLKO.1 expressing a scrambled shRNA were used as control. For stable knockdown of p53 protein in U2OS cells, an shRNA targeting nucleotides 1095–1115 of this tumor suppressor was chosen (GenBank™ accession number AF307851). This shRNA was cloned into the pSuper-retroviral vector (Oligo-Engine), and infectious retroviral particles were produced following transfection of PT67 packaging cells. Retroviral transductions were carried out as previously described (19Loignon M. Drobetsky E.A. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A polyclonal U2OS population stably expressing p53-targeting shRNA was obtained following selection in 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The efficiencies of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p53 knockdowns were monitored by Western blotting (see below). Abrogation of p38α/β Signaling in HDLFs via Stable Expression of the Dominant Negative Mutant p38α (AGF)—Total RNA from HDLFs was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). Four μl of the reaction was used for PCR amplification of full-length human p38α wild type cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_001315.1) using cloned pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in conjunction with the forward and reverse primers (5′-GCTGGAAAATGTCTCAGGAGA-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGACTCCATCTCTTCTT-3′), respectively. The wild type p38α cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector pMSCVretro (Clontech). The dominant negative p38α (AGF) mutant (20Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) was then produced using site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). Point mutations were introduced at each of the p38α kinase activation sites ((Thr180 (ACA) → Ala180 (GCA) and Tyr182 (TAC) → Phe182 (TTC)) using the following forward/reverse primer sets (mutations underlined): 5′-C ACA GAT GAT GAA ATG GCA GGC TAC GTG GCC-3′ and 5′-GGC CAC GTA GCC TGC CAT TTC ATC ATC TGT G-3′;5′-GAT GAA ATG GCA GGC TTC GTG GCC ACT AGG TGG-3′ and 5′-CCA CCT AGT GGC CAC GAA GCC TGC CAT TTC ATC-3′). A polyclonal HDLF population stably expressing p38α (AGF) was isolated by retroviral transduction as mentioned above. Inhibition of p38α/β signaling was monitored by Western blotting (see below). Activation and Inhibition of MAPK Signaling Determined by Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed in human primary and tumor cell strains as previously described (19Loignon M. Drobetsky E.A. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Activation or pharmacological inhibition of MAPK signaling was evaluated (i) by measuring levels of phosphorylated MAPKs using anti-phospho-ERK1/2, -JNK1/2, or -p38α/β antibodies (BIOSOURCE International) and/or (ii) by measuring levels of phosphorylated downstream MAPK effectors, where solid-phase kinase assay kits (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) were first used to pull down phospho-ERK1/2, total JNK1/2, or phospho-p38α/β. This was followed by phosphorylation reactions in vitro and detection of activated substrates (i.e. phospho-Elk-1, -c-Jun, or -ATF-2) using specific anti-phosphoantibodies. In order to assess p38α/β activity in vivo, as described and validated previously (21Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar, 22Clifton A.D. Young P.R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), levels of phosphorylated forms of the specific p38α/β substrate MAPKAPK2 (hereafter MK2) were distinguished from and compared with unphosphorylated forms by band shift using an anti-MK2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). In order to verify shRNA knockdowns, levels of total ERK1/2, total JNK1/2, or p53 were probed using anti-ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-SAPK/JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), or anti-p53 (Santa Cruz) antibodies, respectively. To evaluate inhibition of p38α/β signaling by expression of dominant negative p38α (AGF), MK2 phosphorylation was quantified as described above. Actin, or in some cases total JNK, was used as loading control. Bands were quantified by densitometry using Multigauge software (Fuji Corp.). Flow Cytometry-based Determination of GG-NER Kinetics—Normal or XPA-deficient HDSFs were maintained at confluence for 4 days prior to irradiation (yielding > 95% synchronization in G0) and maintained at confluence during post-UV incubation. In the case of HDLFs or colon carcinoma cells, exponentially growing monolayers were synchronized in G0/G1 by serum starvation (0.5%) for 3 days, and 3 h before treatment fresh complete medium was added to restimulate proliferation. U2OS cells transiently expressing shRNAs could not be synchronized by either confluence or serum starvation. As such, immediately following UV exposure, 200 ng/ml nocodazole was added to the medium to block cell division. At various times post-UV, cells were washed with PBS plus 50 mm EDTA, trypsinized, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS plus 50 mm EDTA, and fixed by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold 100% ethanol. 1 × 106 fixed cells were then washed with PBS plus 50 mm EDTA, resuspended in either 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 2 n HCl (for CPD detection) or 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 0.1 n HCl (for 6-4 photoproduct (6-4PP) detection), and incubated for 20 min at 22 °C. Cells were washed with 0.1 m Na2B4O7 (pH 9.0) and then with PBS and resuspended in 300 μl of RNase (100 μg/ml in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing with PBS-TB (1% bovine serum albumin plus 0.25% Tween 20 in PBS). Cells were resuspended in PBS-TB containing a primary monoclonal antibody against either CPDs or 6-4PPs (Kamiya Biomedical Company) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS-TB, and then resuspended in 300 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature. Pellets were washed twice with PBS-TB and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and repair kinetics were monitored for populations gated in G1 using a flow cytometer fitted with an argon laser and CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences). Evaluation of Apoptosis, Clonogenic Survival, and Cellular Proliferation in HDLFs—At various times post-UV, in HDLFs treated or not treated with MAPK inhibitors, apoptosis was investigated by both (i) annexin-V labeling using a kit according to the manufacturer's directions (Sigma) and (ii) sub-G1 peak analysis following staining of cells with propidium iodide. Annexin-V-positive early apoptotic cells or propidium iodide-positive sub-G1 cells were quantified using a FACScan flow cytometer fitted with CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences). For determination of clonogenic survival, appropriate cell numbers were seeded on 100-mm dishes 6 h prior to treatments with or without MAPK inhibitors. Cells were incubated for 15–21 days, and colonies were scored after staining with 0.5% methylene blue in 50% methanol. Cellular proliferation was evaluated by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using a kit as described by the manufacturer (American Type Culture Collection). UV-induced Activation and Pharmacological Abrogation of MAPK Activity in Human Cells—Replicate cultures representing three human strains (i.e. to stringently control for cell type-specific effects that are highly characteristic of MAPK function) were irradiated with 10 J/m2 UV (yielding ∼5–10% relative clonogenic survival in each strain; data not shown) in the presence of either carrier (Me2SO) or well characterized, highly specific chemical MAPK inhibitors (i.e. U0126, SP600125, and SB202190 to abrogate signaling through ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38α/β, respectively) (21Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R.

In the case of HDSFs, phospho-JNK1/2 and phospho-p38α/β peaked at early times (0.5–1 h) and diminished rapidly thereafter, whereas phospho-ERK1/2 peaked at 0.5 h and remained elevated for at least 24 h (Fig. 1A). This correlated temporally with in vitro phosphorylation by phospho-ERK1/2, -JNK1/2, and -p38α/β of the specific downstream effectors Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF2, respectively (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, incubation of HDSFs with chemical inhibitors resulted in strong diminishment (>85%) of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, or p38α/β activity at 1 h post-UV (Fig. 1, C–E). Results similar to those described immediately above for MAPK activation/abrogation in HDSFs were obtained for UV-irradiated HDLFs (Fig. 2, A and B). However in the case of HCT116/p53+/+, although phospho-JNK1/2 peaked at 1 h post-UV as anticipated, ERK1/2 appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated (Fig. 2, C and D), and no phospho-p38α/β could be detected within 48 h despite the presence of nonphosphorylated forms (not shown).FIGURE 2Activation and pharmacological abrogation of MAPK signaling in UV-exposed primary human lung fibroblasts and HCT116p53+/+ colon carcinoma cells. Phosphorylation and pharmacological inhibition of specific MAPKs in exponentially growing HDLFs (A and B) or in human HCT116p53+/+ (C and D) were evaluated essentially as described in the legend to Fig. 1 for HDSFs.

This assay directly detects CPDs in partially denatured double-stranded DNA in intact permeabilized cells using highly specific fluorescently labeled anti-CPD antibodies. Although a similar method was previously reported over a decade ago (25Berg R.J. de Gruijl F.R. Roza L. van der Leun J.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it was subsequently only very rarely used to address biological mechanisms. We have now optimized this type of assay (i) to be rapid, reproducible, and extremely sensitive, detecting CPDs induced by UV doses as low as 1 J/m2 and (ii) to exhibit a linear dose response for CPD induction up to 40 J/m2 (Fig. 3A). Our optimized NER assay was initially applied to confluent UV-exposed HDSFs treated or not with MAPK inhibitors. (For all repair analyses described in this study, cells were synchronized by various approaches (see “Materials and Methods”) to prevent cell division, which would otherwise dilute the CPD-specific immunofluorescence signal, thereby interfering with accurate determination of repair kinetics.) Representative raw data are shown for normal HDSFs and NER-deficient XPA HDSFs (Fig. 3, B and C), and the complete experiment in HDSFs is graphically illustrated in Fig. 4A. Relative to Me2SO-treated controls, incubation with any of U0126, SP600125, or SB202190 had virtually no effect on CPD removal over a 48-h period in normal HDSFs, whereas GG-NER-deficient XPA HDSFs (negative control), in line with expectations, exhibited almost complete abrogation of CPD repair. For HDLFs, precisely the same trends with respect to CPD repair kinetics were observed (Fig. 4B). Also, repair of another UV-induced bulky adduct, i. e. the 6-4PP (induced 5-fold less frequently than CPDs), was evaluated in HDLFs after irradiation with 25 J/m2 UV using a specific anti-6-4PP antibody. 6-4PPs are characteristically removed much more rapidly relative to CPDs via GG-NER in human and murine cells (26Mitchell D.L. Haipek C.A. Clarkson J.M. Mutat. Res. 1985; 143: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In accord with this, we observed nearly 100% 6-4PP removal by 8 h post-UV in HDLFs; moreover, incubation of HDLFs with MAPK inhibitors engendered virtually no effect on repair of 6-4PP (Fig. 4C). In addition, as fully expected, HPV-E6-expressing HDLFs and XPA-deficient HDSFs (negative controls) manifested significant reductions in the removal of CPD and 6-4PP, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). Finally, toward characterizing the potential influence of MAPKs on GG-NER in human tumor cells, pharmacological inhibition of signaling via ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 in HCT116p53+/+ had no significant impact on CPD repair kinetics (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, isogenic control p53-null HCT116/p53-/- cells characteristically exhibited significantly reduced GG-NER efficiency relative to its isogenic p53-proficient counterpart.FIGURE 4Flow cytometry-based evaluation of NER kinetics in UV-exposed human primary and tumor cell lines treated with chemical MAPK inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2007396163,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is an adaptor/scaffold protein that mediates several important signaling pathways, including the tumor necrosis factor-R:NF-κB pathway, involved in immune surveillance, inflammation, etc. Because most studies of TRAF6 function have focused primarily on its role as an adaptor molecule in signaling pathways in the cytoplasm, the potential functions of TRAF6 in other cellular compartments has not been previously investigated. Here, we demonstrate that TRAF6 resides not only in the cellular cytoplasm but is also found in the nuclei of both normal and malignant B lymphocytes. TRAF6 does not possess a nuclear localization signal but enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex containing RanGap1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning experiments demonstrated that nuclear TRAF6 associates with c-Myb within the 5′-end of the c-Myb promoter. Further analysis showed that nuclear TRAF6 is modified by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1, interacts with histone deacetylase 1, and represses c-Myb-mediated transactivation. Thus, TRAF6 negatively regulates c-Myb through a novel repressor function in the nuclei of both normal and malignant B-lymphocytes that could represent a novel control mechanism that maintains cell homeostasis and immune surveillance.

TRAF6 has been shown to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, allowing TRAF6 autoubiquitination, which further activates the IKK complex (4Deng L. Weng C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C.

Although ubiquitination normally targets a protein for degradation, TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination is independent of proteasomal degradation (5Lamothe B. Webster W.K. Gopinathan A. Besse A.

TRAF6 is one of seven closely related TRAF proteins and was isolated by screening of an expressed sequence tag expression library utilizing CD40 as bait (8Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N.

All TRAF protein sequences contain a C-terminal receptor-binding domain that mediates receptor binding. All of the TRAFs except for TRAF1 contain a variable number of zinc-finger motifs and a zinc ring domain (9Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The zinc-binding domains seem to function principally in mediating interactions with other proteins such as kinases and transcription factors that are involved in the propagation and regulation of signaling cascades. TRAF6 is unique among the TRAFs in showing the least homology to the prototypical TRAF domain sequence and interacting with both the TNF-receptor family members as well as the Toll-like receptor family for signaling (10Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF6-deficient mice show defects in B-cell differentiation, lymph node organogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, and interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, and receptor activator of NF-κB signaling (11Choi Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2005; 560: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because most studies of TRAF6 have focused primarily on its function as an adaptor molecule in cytoplasmic signaling pathways, the role of TRAF6 in other cellular compartments has not been investigated. Our recent studies have demonstrated that CD40, a TNF-receptor family member, is present in the nucleus of both normal and lymphoma B cells and also acts as a transcription factor (12Lin-Lee Y.C. Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Fu L. Zhou H.J. Yoshimura L.C. Decker G.L. Ford R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18878-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Zhou H.J.

These studies unveiled a new paradigm for cell signal transduction involving cell membrane and adaptor proteins trafficking into the cell nucleus. However, the functional roles of these proteins in the nucleus and how they enter the nucleus have yet to be fully defined. Recent studies have suggested that sumoylation, a post-translational protein modification step very similar to protein ubiquitination, involving covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to lysine residues, is linked to nucleocytoplasmic protein transport and transcriptional gene repression (17Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 18Pichler A. Melchior F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that TRAF6, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex involving RanGap-1, a Ran GTPase-activating enzyme. Further studies show that nuclear TRAF6 is modified by SUMO-1, interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1, and has the ability to repress c-Myb-mediated transactivation in B lymphocytes. Cells and Reagents–Human large B-cell lymphoma cell lines (MZ, McA, LR, MS, LP, and EJ) were established from diagnostic biopsy tissue or effusions from patients as described else-where (16Sardi S.P. Murtie J. Koirala S. Patten B.A. Corfas G. Cell. 2006; 127: 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Normal human B lymphocytes were purified from donors' buffy coats by using the human B-cell enrichment mixture from StemCell Technologies (Vancouver, Canada). Antibodies and Small Interfering RNA Oligonucleotides–The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal and monoclonal TRAF6, c-Myb, SUMO-1, RanGap-1, and HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas-Red-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides for TRAF6 were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Subcellular Fractionation of B Lymphoid Cells–Cellular fractionation procedures were performed as described previously (12Lin-Lee Y.C. Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Fu L. Zhou H.J. Yoshimura L.C. Decker G.L. Ford R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18878-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation PCR and Cloning Assays–Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) cloning assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit and protocol provided by Millipore (Billerica, MA). Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in SDS cell lysis buffer (provided with kit) for 10 min on ice, and sonicated three times at 10-s intervals. Samples were subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatants were diluted with ChIP dilution buffer. To reduce nonspecific background, samples were precleared with salmon sperm DNA and protein A-agarose (50% slurry) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Primary antibodies were added to the samples that were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The slurry was added to each sample, which was then incubated for an additional hour. The protein A-antibody-DNA complexes were washed and eluted according to the manufacturer's protocol and then reverse cross-linked by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA fragments were purified by proteinase K digestion, phenolchloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA from immunoprecipitations and DNA inputs were used for PCR amplification with PCR beads from Amersham Biosciences and oligonucleotide primers specific for the c-Myb promoter (forward, 5′-TTA GTG AGC GGT GAT GGT TG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAT TCC CGC ACA GAA GAT TG-3′; 225 bp). The PCR conditions were as follows: the cDNA template was denatured at 95 °C for 1 min, annealed at 48 °C for 30 s, and extended at 72 °C for 1 min per cycle for 35 cycles. The PCR product was visualized on a 2.0% agarose gel. For cloning purposes, DNA fragments were repaired in the reaction containing 1 mm dNTPs and T4 DNA polymerase at 37 °C for 30 min to create blunt ends. DNA fragments were purified by proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were dephosphorylated by calf intestine phosphatase and cloned into PCR-Blunt II Topo vectors (Invitrogen). Each clone was subjected to DNA sequencing and subsequent Blast computer analysis to identify the DNA sequence from the Entrez Genome Project data base of the National Institutes of Health. Co-immunoprecipitation Procedures–Antibodies were cross-linked to Dynabeads protein A (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cell lysates were precleared with IgG Dynabeads protein A for 30 min at 4 °C before incubation with antibody-linked Dynabeads overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated Dynabead complexes were washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% glucopyranoside, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were eluted by boiling in protein loading buffer and then processed for Western blot analysis. Confocal Microscopic Analysis–Cells were cytospun onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, fixed with 100% cold methanol for 5 min, and air-dried. Nonspecific protein binding was prevented by blocking the cells with 5% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stained with the appropriate primary antibodies (1:200 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were stained with the appropriate anti-donkey secondary antibody (labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy2, Cy3, Texas-Red, or Cy5; 1:200 dilution) for 45 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were applied with Slow Fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were visualized using an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were captured with a 60× objective using the appropriate filter sets. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis–TRAF6 expression vectors in pGEX-4T1 and pCR3-FLAG have been previously described (5Lamothe B. Webster W.K. Gopinathan A. Besse A. Campos A.D. Darnay B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All mutations in reporter constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The c-Myb expression vector was a gift from Dr. Alan Gewirtz (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). The EW5-luc plasmid (3×-c-Myb binding sites) was provided by Dr. Scott A. Ness (The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM). The pCMV-SPORT-SUMO1 expression vector was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Transfection, Luciferase, and β-Galactosidase Assays–Cultured lymphoma cells and B lymphocytes were transfected transiently according to the Nucleofactor protocol from Amaxa Biosystems (Cologne, Germany) as described previously (19Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Ford R.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega, Madison, WI). Each sample assay was repeated at least three times in different experiments with similar results. Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored using the cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector. In Vitro/in Vivo Sumoylation Assays–In vitro sumoylation assays were performed using GST-TRAF6 fusion proteins and the SUMOlink SUMO-1 Kit according to the protocol from Active Motif (Invitrogen). In vivo sumoylation assays were performed by transfecting lymphoma cells with FLAG-TRAF6 and HA-SUMO-1 expression vectors as indicated. 24-48 h after transfection, cell nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis as described under “Co-immunoprecipitation Procedures.” Identification of Nuclear TRAF6 in Lymphoma B Cells–While studying the nuclear role of CD40 in lymphoma B cells, we identified the presence of TRAF6 protein in the nuclei of cells from five different aggressive B-cell lymphoma cell lines by nuclear cell fractionation and Western blotting (Fig. 1A). TRAF5, another member of the TRAF protein family, on the other hand, was detected primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction and was used as a negative control. TRAF2 and TRAF3 were also found in the nucleus, but at lower relative concentrations in comparison to TRAF6 (data not shown). TRAF6 is also present in the nuclei of both resting (Go) and activated T and B lymphocytes (Fig. 1B; for more detail on B cells, see supplemental Fig. S2). To further determine the subcellular localization of TRAF6 in lymphoma B cells, we used indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy as well as nucleoplasm fractionation analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that TRAF6 protein was expressed not only in the plasma membrane and cellular cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of lymphoma B cells. TRAF6 protein expression was not widely distributed throughout the nucleus, but it was expressed unequivocally in punctate nuclear body protein complexes in the nuclear compartment, demonstrated using stack images from confocal microscopic analysis (see supplemental Fig. S1). Control TRAF5 was detected primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Cell fractionation studies in two different lymphoma cell lines confirmed that TRAF6 was also present in the nucleoplasm fraction, suggesting that TRAF6 may interact with chromatin (Fig. 1D). Characterizing Nuclear TRAF6 in Lymphoma B Cells–TRAF6 has been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is capable of autoubiquitination. To determine if TRAF6 was ubiquitinated in lymphoma B cells, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using anti-TRAF6 polyclonal antibody with cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts purified from a lymphoma cell line (MS). As shown in Fig. 2A, TRAF6 is endogenously autoubiquitinylated in the cytoplasmic fraction but not in the nuclear fraction, suggesting that TRAF6 may have a role other than ubiquitination in the nucleus. Subsequent ChIP cloning analysis using anti-TRAF6 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2B) revealed a total of 200 clones, one of which contained a 185-bp fragment belonging to the proximal 5′-end of the c-Myb oncogene promoter. ChIP analysis followed by reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the interaction of TRAF6 with the c-Myb promoter (Fig. 2C). c-Myb is known to bind to its own promoter, in the same region as TRAF6 (Fig. 2C). The other 199 clones contained DNA that did not match any known promoter sequence. However, the majority of the sequences matched genomic DNA that is in the proximity of both known and unknown genes (data not shown). The interaction of TRAF6 with DNA, either directly or indirectly, suggests that TRAF6 might have a role in gene transcriptional regulation. To determine if TRAF6 has transcriptional activation activity, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed by fusing full-length TRAF6 to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and then transfecting the resulting construct into lymphoma cells. Unexpectedly, the chimeric protein showed decreased transactivation activity (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the TRAF6 protein might act as a negative transcriptional regulator in the nuclei of lymphoma B cells. Interaction of TRAF6 with c-Myb Results in Repression of Its Transactivational Activity–The 185-bp DNA fragment of the c-Myb promoter, which was immunoprecipitated with TRAF6 antibody using ChIP cloning assays, contains a consensus c-Myb binding site. The other clones obtained were also analyzed for transcription factor binding sites that identified 87% of the sequences as containing at least one consensus c-Myb binding site (data not shown). These findings suggest that TRAF6 interacts with DNA, possibly indirectly, probably through binding to the c-Myb protein. Immunoprecipitation assays clearly showed that TRAF6 interacts with c-Myb (Fig. 3A) that was confirmed by confocal microscopic analysis (Fig. 3B). Because the Gal4 assays had demonstrated that TRAF6 has transcriptional repression activity, we examined whether TRAF6 could be involved in regulating c-Myb-mediated transcriptional activity. When B-cell lymphoma MS cells were co-transfected with a 3×-c-Myb binding site reporter plasmid (EW5-luc) in conjunction with a c-Myb expression vector and with increasing amounts of FLAG-TRAF6 expression vector, overexpression of TRAF6 repressed c-Myb-mediated transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). To further substantiate the TRAF6-mediated transcriptional repression of c-Myb, normal B-lymphocytes were co-transfected with a TRAF6 expression vector along with the reporter EW5-luc, followed by CD40 ligand and anti-IgM stimulation. Normal B-cell activation by CD40 and IgM induced c-Myb transcriptional activity (Fig. 3D). As predicted, TRAF6 also repressed c-Myb transcriptional activity induced by CD40 and IgM stimulation in normal B-lymphocytes (Fig. 3D), further confirming that TRAF6 negatively regulates c-Myb-mediated transcription. We next questioned whether endogenous TRAF6 represses c-Myb transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited endogenous TRAF6 protein expression using an RNA interference approach. Transfection of a TRAF6 siRNA into lymphoma B cells resulted in a decrease of cellular TRAF6 protein without altering the endogenous level of actin protein (Fig. 3E). Under these conditions, TRAF6 siRNA transfection enhanced c-Myb-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3E), further confirming the negative regulatory effect of nuclear TRAF6 on c-Myb transcriptional activity. TRAF6 Is Modified by SUMO-1 in Neoplastic B Cells–Recent findings suggest that sumoylation, a protein modification process that requires conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO, is associated with gene transcriptional repression. Of the SUMO proteins, only SUMO-1 contains a nuclear localization signal that functions by transporting the cargo protein into the nucleus. Confocal microscopy assays demonstrated that TRAF6 co-localizes with SUMO-1 in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). The nuclear interaction between TRAF6 and SUMO-1 appears to occur in nuclear body complexes (indicated by arrows) (see supplemental Fig. S1 for confocal stacking images). Immunoprecipitation analysis, carried out with TRAF6 antibody to confirm TRAF6-SUMO-1 interactions, demonstrated that, when immunoblotted with SUMO-1 monoclonal antibody, three protein bands of molecular masses 40, 80, and 90 kDa appeared in the nuclear extracts but were not present in cytoplasmic extracts or IgG controls (Fig. 4B). Because the TRAF6 protein is ∼62 kDa, the 90-kDa protein band could represent SUMO-1-modified TRAF6, and the 40- and 80-kDa bands could represent SUMO-1-modified proteins that interact with TRAF6. Further analysis by Western blotting (Fig. 4C) and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4D) confirmed that the 80-kDa band is RanGap1, a Ran GTPase-activating enzyme, fused with SUMO-1, and this fusion protein co-localized with TRAF6 at the nuclear membrane (Fig. 4E), suggesting that TRAF6 actively enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. The 40-kDa protein has not as yet been identified. To demonstrate that TRAF6 is modified by SUMO-1, we performed in vitro sumoylation assays by incubating recombinant GST-TRAF6 fusion proteins with reaction mixtures containing recombinant sumoylation components. A slower migrating protein band reacted with anti-SUMO-1 antibody in the reaction that contained TRAF6 and wild-type SUMO-1 but not in the reactions without E1/E2 enzymes or wild-type SUMO-1 or in the reaction with mutated SUMO-1 (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the slower migrating band is in fact, a sumoylated full-length TRAF6 species. To confirm this result, endogenous TRAF6 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from purified cytoplasmic extracts of a lymphoma cell line (MS) and incubated with sumoylation components as indicated in Fig. 5B. TRAF6-containing immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting, using an anti-SUMO-1 or anti-TRAF6 antibody. A slower migrating band was observed in the sample with TRAF6 and wild-type SUMO-1 but was not present in the sample without wild-type SUMO-1 or with recombinant SENP1 (a SUMO protease) (Fig. 5B). Modified TRAF6 species could be cleaved by the catalytic domain of recombinant SENP-1, further confirming that TRAF6 is modified by SUMO-1. We next sought to examine whether TRAF6 is modified by SUMO-1 endogenously in vivo and to identify the amino acid residue(s) of TRAF6 involved in SUMO1 conjugation. A sumoylation site prediction software, based on properties sequential forward selection (20Liu B. Li S. Wang Y. Lu L. Li Y. Cai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), reveals four SUMO consensus lysine sites (124, 142, 319, and 453) on TRAF6 with high scores and one SUMO lysine site (124) that was refined based on the NDSM (negatively charged amino acid-dependent sumoylation motif) (21Mabb A.M. Miyamoto S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1979-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These sites were individually mutated on the TRAF6 expression vector, by converting the lysine amino acid residues into arginines. MS cells were co-transfected with the FLAG-tagged wild-type (wt)-TRAF6 or TRAF6 mutants, along with SUMO1 expression vector. A slower migrating band of ∼90 kDa, which occurred only in wt-TRAF6 and K319R mutant, suggested that TRAF6 is modified by SUMO-1 at lysines 124, 142, and 453 (Fig. 5C). TRAF6 mutants (K124R, K142R, and K453) were unable to suppress c-Myb-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 5D), indicating that the sumoylation of TRAF6 at lysine 124, 142, and 453 is required for its repressive activity. Nuclear TRAF6 also interacts with HDAC1 (Fig. 5E), suggesting that TRAF6 can recruit HDAC proteins into transcription repressor complexes in gene promoters for its inhibitory role in the nucleus. Many components of signal transduction networks, including membrane and adaptor proteins, are now known to localize to different cellular compartments, where they exert diverse functions (22Bryant D.M. Stow J.L. Traffic. 2005; 6: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Johnson H.M. Subramaniam P.S. Olsnes S. Jans D.A. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The finding that TRAF proteins localize in the nucleus is not unprecedented, because previous studies have demonstrated that TRAF proteins such as TRAF2 (24Min W. Bradley J.R. Galbraith J.J. Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 319-324PubMed Google Scholar) and TRAF4 (25Glauner H. Siegmund D. Motejadded H. Scheurich P. Hendler F. Janssen O. Wajant H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4819-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) can be identified in the cell nucleus, although their functional roles in the nucleus have not as yet been defined. Min et al. (24Min W. Bradley J.R. Galbraith J.J. Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 319-324PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that nuclear TRAF2 directly regulates transcriptional activity via a mechanism independent of its role in cytoplasmic signal transduction. Our findings show that nuclear TRAF6 may function differently than cytoplasmic TRAF6, possibly because TRAF6 ubiquitination occurs in the cytoplasm and sumoylation in the nucleus. How nuclear TRAF6 sumoylation correlates with TRAF6 ubiquitination in the cytoplasm and whether these mechanisms are dependent of each other are important issues. Recent findings have suggested that in some proteins such as IκBα, ubiquitination competes with sumoylation (26Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), and in certain circumstances, important proteins (e.g. NEMO) are ubiquitinated, and then sumoylated (27Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. Cell. 2003; 115: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In fact, both IκBα and IKKs, as well as CD40, all components of the CD40:NF-κB canonical pathway, are found in the nucleus, raising the possibility that the entire CD40-TRAF6-IKK-NF-κB signaling pathway, like the PI3K-AKT-PTEN signaling pathway (28Lian Z. Di Cristofano A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7394-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), functions in the nuclear compartment. Sumoylation has emerged recently as an important step in post-translational protein modification that regulates the functions of numerous proteins, mainly transcription factors, involved in many cellular processes (29Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification by SUMO has diverse effects on substrate activity, but, in most cases described so far, sumoylation of transcriptional regulators correlates with inhibition of gene transcription (30Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide new insights into the mechanisms by which sumoylation regulates transcription and suggest that one consequence of sumoylation is promotion of the interaction of transcription factors with co-repressors of transcription (17Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Our finding that nuclear TRAF6 is modified by SUMO-1, repressing transcriptional activity, implies that TRAF6 has a function very similar to that of the protein Daxx, which initially was identified as a cytoplasmic signaling adaptor molecule but has been reported recently to function as a transcriptional repressor in the nuclear compartment (15Lin D.Y. Huang Y.S. Jeng J.C. Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Chao T.T. Ho C.C. Chen Y.C. Lin T.P. Fang H.I. Hung C.C. Suen C.S. Hwang M.J. Chang K.S. Maul G.G. Shih H.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 341-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Unlike Daxx, TRAF6 does not contain an intrinsic nuclear localization signal, suggesting either that TRAF6 binds to another nuclear localization signal-bearing protein to be transported as molecular complex or that a novel mechanism regulates its nuclear import. Our results suggest that TRAF6 enters the nucleus, through the nuclear pore complex containing RanGap1, a RanGTPase-activating enzyme, where TRAF6 is then further modified by sumoylation, which confers its repressor function on gene transcription. TRAF6 is present in the nuclei of un-stimulated normal B cells and does not exhibit increased nuclear translocation in response to CD40L stimulation. This suggests that TRAF6 exists as a distinct pool in the nucleus that constitutively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, as do the NF-κB upstream signaling kinases IκBα, NIK, and IKK in unstimulated cells in the absence of exogenous stimuli (31Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 32Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. de Martin R. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), or alternatively, that an unknown stimulus provides the signal for TRAF6 nuclear translocation. It is also possible that stress conditions can induce nuclear TRAF6 translocation, similar to IKK nuclear translocation and sumoylation modification observed upon genotoxic stress induction (27Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S. Cell. 2003; 115: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). It will be of considerable importance to determine the one or more mechanisms that induce nuclear translocation of TRAF6 in lymphocytes in future studies. The finding that TRAF6 is a negative regulator is also not unprecedented. Recent studies have suggested that TRAF6 is a T-cell-intrinsic negative regulator required for the maintenance of immune homeostasis, through the suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway (34King C.G. Kobayashi T. Cejas P.J. Kim T. Yoon K. Kim G.K. Chiffoleau E. Hickman S.P. Walsh P.T. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of suppression of PI3K-AKT activation by TRAF6 has yet to be further elucidated. We also have found that TRAF6 is expressed in the nucleus of T lymphocytes, suggesting that nuclear TRAF6 expression is not restricted to B lymphocytes. These data support our findings suggesting that TRAF6 can function as a negative transcriptional regulator, expanding the function of TRAF6 as an adaptor molecule in the cytoplasm. The negative regulatory mechanism of nuclear TRAF6 in lymphocytes could represent a novel control system to keep innate immunity and inflammation in check by suppressing key signaling pathways, such as c-Myb, a downstream target of the interleukin-2-PI3K-AKT pathway (35Lauder A. Castellanos A. Weston K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5797-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). How TRAF6 represses c-Myb-mediated transactivation activity is still unknown. Our ChIP cloning experiments suggested that TRAF6 interacts with the c-Myb promoter DNA, through its association with c-Myb, an important transcription factor that has been shown to bind to its own promoter (36Nicolaides N.C. Gualdi R. Casadevall C. Manzella L. Calabretta B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6166-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). c-Myb protein contains a transactivation domain and a negative regulatory domain, indicating that c-Myb can either activate or repress target genes (37Gonda T.J. Favier D. Ferrao P. Macmillan E.M. Simpson R. Tavner F. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 99-109PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that TRAF6 represses c-Myb transactivation activity through one of two potential mechanisms: disassembling the protein complex between c-Myb and its partner transcription factors from binding to DNA or recruiting a repressor complex. Our confocal images show that TRAF6 and SUMO-1 co-localized in punctated nuclear protein complexes. Therefore, the latter mechanism seems more likely, because ChIP analysis demonstrated that TRAF6 and c-Myb endogenously bind to genomic DNA, and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that TRAF6 associates with HDAC1. Perhaps sumoylated TRAF6 can recruit co-repressor proteins, such as HDAC1, to form nuclear promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (38Shen T.H. Lin H.K. Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Pandolfi P.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), similar to Sp100 or Daxx (15Lin D.Y. Huang Y.S. Jeng J.C. Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Chao T.T. Ho C.C. Chen Y.C. Lin T.P. Fang H.I. Hung C.C. Suen C.S. Hwang M.J. Chang K.S. Maul G.G. Shih H.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 341-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 39Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although this result does not directly demonstrate dependence on HDAC for transcriptional repression activity by TRAF6, it is consistent with previous reports suggesting that sumoylation promotes transcriptional repression through recruitment of HDACs (40Girdwood D.W. Tatham M. Hay R.T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the contrary, sumoylated TRAF6 may enhance c-Myb sumoylation and repress c-Myb transactivation, by acting as a SUMO ligase similar to TRAF7 (41Morita Y. Kansei-Ishii C. Nomura T. Ishii S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Until recently, TRAF molecules like TRAF6 were considered to be primarily cytoplasmic adaptor molecules, binding TNFR and Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling pathways (10Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings not only extend the role of TRAF6 in cellular signal transduction but also broaden the range of important physiological processes that are regulated by sumoylation. The physiological importance of negative regulation of c-Myb transactivation by nuclear TRAF6 and how it relates to the disease process in lymphoma are still unclear. c-Myb is an oncogene that is highly expressed in hematopoietic malignancies (42Emambokus N. Vegiopoulos A. Harman B. Jenkinson E. Anderson G. Frampton J. EMBO. 2003; 22: 4478-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but its exact oncogenic function is still mostly undefined (43Weston K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3034-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated, however, that c-Myb suppresses the oncogenic activity of the proto-oncogene c-Rel (44Fu S.L Ganter B. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, c-Myb can function as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene. Putting these findings together, our model predicts that TRAF6 can function as a negative regulator by suppressing transcriptional regulators to maintain cell signaling homeostasis in the nucleus, in addition to its role as a positive regulator of the NF-κB pathway in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W1969501775,"The neural induction has remained a debatable issue pertaining to whether it is a mere default process or it involves precise instructive cues. We have chosen the embryonic stem (ES) cell model to address this issue. In a devised monoculture strategy, the cell-cell interaction availed through optimum cell plating density could define the niche for the attainment of efficient in vitro neurogenesis from the ES cells. The medium plating density was found ideal in generating optimum number of progenitors and also yielded about 80% mature neurons in a serum free culture set up barring any exogenous inducers. We could also demarcate and quantify the neural stem cells/progenitors among the heterogeneous cell population of differentiating ES cells using nestin intron II driven EGFP expression as a tool. The one week post-plating was determined to be the critical time window for optimum neural progenitor generation from ES cells that helped us further in purifying these cells and in demonstrating their proliferation and multipotent differentiation potential. Seeding cells at varying densities, we could decipher an interesting paradoxical scenario that interlinked both commitment and maturation with the initial plating density having a vital influence on neuronal maturation but not specification and the secretory factors were apparently playing a key role during this process. Thus it was comprehended that, the neural specification was a default process independent of exogenous factors and cellular interaction. Conversely, a defined number of cells at the specification stage itself seemed critical to provide an auto-/paracrine means of signaling threshold for the maturation process to materialize."
https://openalex.org/W2042784759,"Studies of different fragments and mutants of SP-B suggest that the function related structural and compositional characteristics in SP-B are its positive charges with intermittent hydrophobic domains. KL4 ([lysine-(leucine)4]4-lysine) is a synthetic peptide based on SP-B structure and is the major constituent of Surfaxin®, a potential therapeutic agent for respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. There is, however, no clear understanding about the possible lipid-KL4 interactions behind its function, which is an inevitable knowledge to design improved therapeutic agents. To examine the phase behavior, topography, and lipid specificity of KL4/lipid systems, we aimed to study different surfactant model systems containing KL4, neutral dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and/or negatively charged dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Surface pressure-area isotherms, fluorescence microscopic images, scanning force microscopy as well as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry suggest (i) that KL4 is not miscible with DPPC and therefore forms peptide aggregates in DPPC/KL4 mixtures; (ii) that KL4 specifically interacts with DPPG via electrostatic interactions and induces percolation of DPPG-rich phases; (iii) that existing DPPG-Ca2+ interactions are too strong to be overcome by KL4, the reason why the peptide remains excluded from condensed DPPG domains and passively colocalizes with DPPC in a demixed fluid phase; and (iv) that the presence of negatively charged lipid is necessary for the formation of bilayer protrusions. These results indicate that the capability of the peptide to induce the formation of a defined surface-confined reservoir depends on the lipid environment, especially on the presence of anionic lipids.

Pulmonary surfactant, a thin lipid-protein film lining the alveolar/air interface of the vertebrate lung, functions in vivo to lower surface tension, thereby reducing the work of breathing. A significant amount of investigations has been reported dealing with the physiological importance of lung surfactant and the implication of its absence or inability to function in premature neonates and adults (1Goerke J.

Over a long period, a lot of biophysical research has been undertaken using some of the major components of lung surfactant to better understand the means by which it is delivered to the air/liquid interface and promotes alveolar stability (4Fleming B.D.

(7Veldhuizen R. Nag K. Orgeig S. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 90-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Particular emphasis has been placed on the important role of this major disaturated phospholipid component in reducing surface tension to very low values and thus protecting the alveolus against collapse (8Yu S. Harding P.G. Smith N. Possmayer F. Lipids. 1983; 18: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Holm B.A. Wang Z. Egan E.A. Notter R.H. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There also has been a strong interest in other major lipid components, such as anionic phosphatidylglycerol, and phospholipids containing unsaturated acyl chains (10Tanaka Y. Takei T. Kanazawa Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1983; 31: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Cockshutt A.M. Absolom D.R. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Besides phospholipids, four proteins, designated as SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D, have been found in association with lung surfactant (12Hawgood S. Shiffer K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 375-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Johansson J. Curstedt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 675-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), among which SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic. These two proteins are believed to be related to the storage and transport of lung surfactant as well as to participate in host defense. On the other hand, the hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C are thought to play an important role in promoting the adsorption and spreading of monolayers containing large amounts of DPPC, which by itself only adsorbs slowly and respreads poorly at air/liquid interfaces (8Yu S. Harding P.G. Smith N. Possmayer F. Lipids. 1983; 18: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Hamilton Jr., R.L.

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is caused by lung immaturity with a deficiency of surfactant in the alveolar spaces and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Studies on replacement therapy on respiratory distress syndrome indicate that SP-B and SP-C are essential constituents of exogenous surfactants (16Robertson B. Halliday H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because of microbiological, immunological, economic and purity concerns, many efforts have been made to develop synthetic surfactant replacement formulations, which involve a combination of synthetic lipids with either synthetic or recombinant peptides (17Robertson B. Johansson J. Curstedt T. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 119-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To understand the role of SP-B in such replacement materials, different spectroscopic techniques have been used to study the interaction between SP-B and phospholipids (18Baatz J.E. Elledge B. Whitsett J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis M.A. van Eijk M. van Golde L.M. Haagsman H.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Studies of different fragments and mutants of SP-B suggest that the function-related structural and compositional characteristics in SP-B are its positive charges with intermittent hydrophobic domains (21Revak S.D.

Science. 1993; 261: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on these structural characteristics a SP-B model peptide with 21 amino acids containing the hydrophobic amino acid leucine (Leu) and cationic lysine (Lys) in the sequence ([lysine-(leucine)4]4-lysine) was synthesized. KL4 proved to be a potent mimic of SP-B not only in vitro (25Cochrane C.G. Revak S.D. Science. 1991; 254: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) but also in vivo as it improved lung function of premature human infants with respiratory distress syndrome (26Cochrane C.G. Revak S.D. Merritt T.A. Heldt G.P. Hallman M. Cunningham M.D. Easa D. Pramanik A. Edwards D.K. Alberts M.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although KL4-based replacement surfactants such as Surfaxin® seem to be effective therapeutic agents the molecular mechanism by which the peptide unfolds its effect in lipid mixtures remains unclear. KL4 displays a rather complex behavior when mixed with lipids. In fluid model systems, at low peptide concentrations and/or in the presence of negatively charged lipids KL4 adopts a predominantly α-helical secondary structure. In more rigid membranes, at higher peptide contents and/or in the absence of anionic lipids, KL4 converts to a β-sheet (27Saenz A. Canadas O. Bagatolli L.A. Johnson M.E. Casals C. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2515-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The conformational transition from α-helix to β-sheet was also found to be surface pressure dependent leading to a mainly β-sheet secondary structure in DPPC and DPPC/DPPG monolayers at surface pressures >40 mN/m (28Cai P. Flach C.R. Mendelsohn R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9446-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only in the presence of pure DPPG did KL4 form an α-helix over the whole pressure range. It is possible that this conformational flexibility is important for the peptides effectiveness in medical treatment, especially because it is assumed that during the breathing process an enrichment of negatively charged lipids in the multilayers formed at higher surface pressures occurs (29Veldhuizen E.J. Batenburg J.J. van Golde L.M. Haagsman H.P. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3164-3171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A peptide capable of adapting its conformation to the changing lipid composition during inhalation and exhalation is then thought to represent an effective therapeutic agent. To obtain a more complete picture of KL4 function and phase behavior in surfactant model systems we performed a systematic monolayer study applying different well established and elaborate techniques such as film balance, fluorescence light microscopy, scanning force microscopy (SFM), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). We employed DPPC and DPPG as lipid components for our model system because they represent main constituents of native surfactant (7Veldhuizen R. Nag K. Orgeig S. Possmayer F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 90-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 8Yu S. Harding P.G. Smith N. Possmayer F. Lipids. 1983; 18: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to systematically analyze the phase behavior of KL4 in DPPC, DPPG, as well as DPPC/DPPG (4:1, mol ratio) monolayers in the presence of Ca2+ ions. So far, all monolayer studies published on KL4/lipid systems were performed in the absence of Ca2+ ions even though this cation is present in the alveolar fluid at a concentration of about ∼1.8 mm (30Nielson D.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1986; 60: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was our intention to study the ability of the peptide to induce the formation of multilayers by means of SFM and to identify specific lipid interactions via TOF-SIMS imaging of LB films. Materials–The lipids used in this study, namely 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 2-(4,4-Difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (β-BODIPY® 500/510 C12-HPC, BODIPY-PC) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All lipids were used without further purification. Chloroform, methanol, and hexane were high pressure liquid chromatography grade and purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Water was purified and deionized by a multicartridge system (MilliPore, Billerica, MA) and had a resistivity >18 MΩ·m. HEPES was obtained from Sigma and CaCl2 from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The SP-B model peptide KL4 with the sequence KLLLLKLLLLKLLLLKLLLLK was obtained from Richard Mendelsohn, Rutgers University. The concentration of the peptide was estimated by fluorescamine assays. Lipids and peptides were dissolved in chloroform/methanol solution (1:1, v/v). Surface Pressure-Area Isotherms–All the film balance experiments were performed on an analytical Wilhelmy film balance (Riegler and Kirstein, Mainz, Germany) with an operational area of 144 cm2. All surface pressure-area measurements were performed on a buffered subphase (25 mm HEPES, 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7, 20 °C). Lipid/peptide monolayers were composed of DPPC, DPPG, or DPPC/DPPG (4:1, mol ratio) and were supplemented with various concentrations of KL4. The lipid/protein mixtures were prepared in a chloroform/methanol solution (1:1, v/v) and spread onto the subphase. After an equilibration time of 10-15 min the monolayers were compressed at a rate of 5.8 cm2/min. Fluorescence Light Microscopy–All lipid/peptide systems were doped with 0.5 mol % BODIPY-PC.

J. 1997; 26: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar a setup consisting of an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus STM5-MJS, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a xy-stage and connected to a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Herrsching, Germany) was used to obtain fluorescence micrographs of lipid/peptide mixtures at the air/water interface at certain pressures by stopping the barrier. All the measurements were performed on a subphase containing 25 mm HEPES and 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7, at 20 °C. Preparation of Gold Supports–Preparation of gold supports was done as described in Ref. 32Bourdos N. Kollmer F. Benninghoven A. Ross M. Sieber M. Galla H.J. Biophys.

Immediately before evaporation the slides were dried in a nitrogen stream and further treated with argon plasma in a plasma cleaner (PDC 32G-2, Harrick, Ossining, NY) for 3 min. First, 1 nm of chromium was deposited on the surface of the slide, serving as an adhesive layer, onto which 200 nm of gold were sublimed at a rate of 0.01 nm/s. The gold-covered slides were cleaned by rectification for 8 h in a Soxhlet apparatus using n-hexane. They were then dried and used as substrates for the Langmuir-Blodgett transfers. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) Transfer–For scanning force microscopy investigations mica-supported phospholipid monolayers were prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett transfer. First, a freshly cleaved mica sheet (Electron Microscopy Science, Munich, Germany) was dipped into the subphase. Then the lipid/peptide mixture was spread from chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) solutions onto a buffered subphase of a Wilhelmy film balance (Riegler and Kirstein) with an operational area of 39 cm2 at a temperature of 20 °C. After an equilibration period of 10 min the film was compressed with a velocity of 1.5 cm2/min until a surface pressure of 50 mN/m was reached. The monolayer was then equilibrated for another 25 min at this surface pressure before transferring the film onto the mica sheet with a velocity of 0.7 mm/min. For TOF-SIMS the samples were transferred onto gold supports using the same procedure as above. SFM–Scanning force microscopy images of the LB films transferred onto mica sheets were obtained at ambient conditions (20 °C) using a Dimension 3000 scanning force microscope with a Nanoscope IIIa controller from Digital Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA) operating in contact mode. Silicon nitride tips (Budget Sensors, Sofia, Bulgaria) with a spring constant of 40 N/m. A detailed section height analysis was performed for all the images taken using WsXM/Nanoscope SFM software. The number of protrusions found in a defined height range was plotted as “counts” against the protrusion height. The obtained statistical histograms of section heights were analyzed using Gaussian functions to determine the average protrusion heights. TOF-SIMS–TOF-SIMS measurements of surface films were transferred onto gold supports obtained on a TOF-SIMS IV (IONTOF, Muenster, Germany) using Bi+3 as the primary ion at 25 keV. Spectra were taken in bunched mode (focus 3-5 μm) with a mass resolution of 5000-10,000. Cycling time of the instrument was set to 200 μs, allowing the acquisition of spectra up to a mass to charge ratio of 1800. Mass-resolved images were taken at nominal mass resolution (burst alignment mode, focus 300 nm). A surface of 802 μm2 was rastered with 256 × 256 pixels (pixel size 312 nm). The primary ion dose did not exceed 8 × 1012 ions/cm2. In line with observations of Biesinger et al.(33Biesinger M.C. Paepegaey P.Y. McIntyre N.S. Harbottle R.R. Petersen N.O. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5711-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), at this primary ion dose no change or inversion of contrast could be detected in any of the measurements performed. Surface Pressure-Area (π-A) Isotherms–One approach to verify if specific interactions between KL4 and negatively charged lipids occur in lipid monolayers at an air/liquid interface is to perform film balance measurements. The obtained surface pressure-area (or short π-A isotherms) in combination with fluorescence microscopy images of lipid/peptide films provide fundamental knowledge on phase behavior and mixing properties of KL4 and thus information on its mode of interaction with individual lipids. We systematically analyzed mixtures of DPPC, DPPG, and DPPC/DPPG (4:1, mol ratio) with varying KL4 concentrations by spreading the respective lipid/peptide solutions on a buffered subphase containing Ca2+ ions (25 mm HEPES, 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7, 20 °C) and slowly compressing the monolayer by moving a barrier in a film balance trough. Changes in surface pressure π (with π = γ0 - γ, where γ0 is the surface tension of the interface before and γ the surface tension of the interface after monolayer formation) are recorded in dependence of the molecular area A, which is successively reduced upon compression of the film. The isotherms obtained for the studied lipid/peptide mixtures are presented in Fig. 1. They display considerable differences depending on the lipid that can only be attributed to discriminative forces occurring between KL4 and DPPC or DPPG, respectively. In the case of DPPC/KL4 monolayers increasing the peptide concentration leads to a shift of the isotherms to larger molecular areas and a loss of the DPPC-specific plateau at 5 mN/m (Fig. 1a), which is indicative of a liquid-expanded (le) to liquid-condensed (lc) phase transition (34Möhwald H. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1990; 41: 441-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Such an effect generally occurs when impurities are present in lipid monolayers that suppress the highly cooperative le-lc transition (34Möhwald H. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1990; 41: 441-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the area shift to larger values is very pronounced at low peptide concentrations and seems to reach a limiting value at higher KL4 fractions. To evaluate this tendency more accurately we compared the so-called A20 values, which represent the molecular areas of different DPPC/KL4 mixtures at a surface pressure of 20 mN/m, and plotted them against the peptide concentration (Fig. 1d). This way of presentation of A20 values reveals that the peptide-induced area shift of the isotherms is concentration dependent at KL4 contents up to 2 mol %. For higher peptide amounts a limiting value of 60 Å2 is reached. Aggregation of KL4 at higher concentrations could account for such a behavior assuming an area requirement of phase-separated molecules that is smaller than that of mixed lipid-KL4 complexes. Such differences could result from different conformations adopted by the peptide that could allow a tighter packing of KL4 and DPPC, respectively. Additionally, a slight change in compressibility is observed at peptide amounts larger than 5 mol % leading to a small shoulder in the isotherm. Such a kink could be attributed to either squeeze-out of material or a conformational change of the peptide as was evidenced for SP-B at 40 mN/m (35Krol S. Ross M. Sieber M. Künneke S. Galla H.J. Janshoff A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 904-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When mixed with DPPG, KL4 displays a completely different phase behavior than in DPPC/peptide monolayers (Fig. 1b). The most prominent difference is a plateau at higher surface pressures appearing already at very low KL4 amounts. Plateau height decreases from 42 to 38 mN/m, whereas plateau length increases from 5 to 15 Å2 when peptide concentration is increased from 0.4 to 10 mol %. Interestingly, when DPPG/KL4 films are compressed beyond plateau pressure, molecular areas smaller than those typical for pure DPPG monolayers in the high pressure region are reached. Such a behavior can be attributed to material loss, more precisely to the squeeze-out of peptide together with significant amounts of lipid. This exclusion of material, however, is highly reversible, which was verified by consecutive compression/expansion cycles (data not shown). Another difference is the influence of the peptide on the compressibility of DPPG monolayers in the pressure region beneath 40 mN/m. Minimal increase in KL4 concentration leads to a significant increase in molecular area as well as compressibility that is a strong indication for a pronounced fluidizing effect. Plotting the A20 values against the peptide amount reveals that the area shift induced by KL4 almost linearly increases at the higher peptide concentration and does not reach a limiting A20 value (as is indicated by a line drawn through the data points in Fig. 1d). This, too, is in contrast to DPPC/KL4 monolayers indicating strong interactions, probably of electrostatic nature, between DPPG and KL4 leading to a more expanded phase. Because KL4 seems to behave in totally different ways with neutral DPPC and anionic DPPG, respectively, studying the DPPC/DPPG/KL4 system should uncover if specific lipid interactions exist in the ternary mixture. As can be seen from the isotherms presented in Fig. 1c DPPG already has an influence on the phase behavior of DPPC. The le-lc plateau vanishes because DPPG, too, acts as an impurity disturbing the highly cooperative phase transition. Adding KL4 to the DPPC/DPPG mixture only leads to a concentration dependent area shift typical for surface active peptides and otherwise does not significantly alter the monolayer properties. This is especially surprising because KL4 affected the phase behavior of DPPG monolayers. We would have expected the appearance of a more pronounced shoulder at ∼40 mN/m similar to the one found in DPPG/KL4 mixtures. The evaluation of A20 values, however, revealed a dependence similar to the one found in DPPG/KL4 monolayers, which is a continuous increase of the A20 values with an increasing peptide amount without reaching any limitation (Fig. 1d). It seems that in the ternary mixture a more delicate equilibrium of forces between the individual components exists, which needs further studying. Fluorescence Light Microscopy–We performed fluorescence light microscopy measurements to visualize the morphology of lipid/peptide monolayers at the air/water interface and to further scrutinize lipid-KL4 interactions. Fluorescence microscopy offers the possibility of studying the le-lc phase transition of lipids based on the different partitioning of the fluorescent probe into fluid or condensed regions of the lipid monolayer. The solubility of the fluorescent probe in a given phase depends on lipid packing, and orientation of the lipid acyl chains. Due to the molecular structure of the fluorescent labeled lipid it is not soluble in tightly packed lc domains. It is therefore enriched in the surrounding fluid phase and leads to the appearance of dark lc domains amid a fluorescent background (33Biesinger M.C. Paepegaey P.Y. McIntyre N.S. Harbottle R.R. Petersen N.O. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5711-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 we present a series of fluorescence microscopic images of DPPC, DPPG and DPPC/DPPG (4:1, mol ratio) monolayers with or without 0.4 mol % KL4 investigated in a surface pressure range of 0-50 mN/m, where each monolayer is stable over the time scale of the experiments. In the case of DPPC dark slightly kidney-shaped domains embedded in a bright fluorescent phase appear at a surface pressure of 4-5 mN/m corresponding to the plateau observed in the π-A isotherms. The observed domains grow in size upon further compression and have a mean diameter of 18-20 μm at a surface pressure of 15 mN/m and of 25 μm at 50 mN/m (Fig. 2a). In the presence of the model peptide dark irregularly shaped domains with diameters of 10-15 μm are already visible at 0 mN/m (Fig. 2b). The peptide obviously induces a phase separation already after spreading of the film. Increasing the surface pressure leads to nucleation and growth of further domains that reach a diameter of 20-25 μm at 50 mN/m. Pure DPPG monolayers are characterized by the appearance of a large number of small circular domains with diameters well below 5-8 μm (Fig. 2c). Increasing the surface pressure does not result in a significant increase in domain size or additional nucleation of lc domains but only in a continuous loss in contrast because of self-quenching (36Piknova B. Marsh D. Thompson T.E. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 892-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This effect arises from energy transfer among fluorophore molecules when their mole fraction increases and leads to a reduction of emission intensity. In accord with film balance measurements, the addition of cationic KL4 has a strong fluidizing effect on DPPG monolayers. Fluorescence microscopy images reveal a greater degree of fluorescent le phase in which large kidney-shaped domains (20-25 μm) already appear at 0 mN/m (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, a very unusual extended network is visible within the fluid fluorescent regions at all analyzed surface pressures. This network seems to consist of bright domains embedded in a less fluorescent dark backg"
https://openalex.org/W2028780722,"IntI1 integrase is a tyrosine recombinase involved in the mobility of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes within bacterial class 1 integrons. Recent data have shown that its recombination specifically involves the bottom strand of the attC site, but the exact mechanism of the reaction is still unclear. An efficient in vitro assay is still required to better characterize the biochemical properties of the enzyme. In this report we describe for the first time an in vitro system partially reproducing the activity of a recombinant pure IntI1. This new assay, which constitutes the only available in vitro model of recombination by IntI1, was used to determine whether this enzyme might be the sole bacterial protein required for the recombination process. Results show that IntI1 possesses all the features needed for performing recombination between attI and attC sites. However, differences in the in vitro intermolecular recombination efficiencies were found according to the target sites and were correlated with DNA affinities of the enzyme but not with in vivo data. The differential affinity of the enzyme for each site, its capacity to bind to a single-stranded structure at the attC site and the recombination observed with single-stranded substrates unambiguously confirm that it constitutes an important intermediary in the reaction. Our data strongly suggest that the enzyme possesses all the functions for generating and/or recognizing this structure even in the absence of other cellular factors. Furthermore, the in vitro assay reported here constitutes a powerful tool for the analysis of the recombination steps catalyzed by IntI1, its structure-function studies and the search for specific inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2050431144,"The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (CEBP) family of transcription factors includes five genes. In the ovary, both Cebpa and Cebpb are essential for granulosa cell function. In this study we have explored the role of the Cebpd gene in ovarian physiology by expression and functional studies. Here we report that Cebpd (C/EBPδ) is expressed in the mouse ovary in a highly restricted temporal and spatial pattern. In response to luteinizing hormone (LH/hCG), CEBPD expression is transiently induced in interstitial cells and in theca cells of follicles from the primary to pre-ovulatory stage, and overlaps in part with expression of the alpha-smooth muscle actin protein. Efficient down-regulation of CEBPD was dependent on a functional Cebpb gene. Proliferating human theca cells in culture also express Cebpd. Cells from patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) exhibited higher Cebpd expression levels. However, deletion of Cebpd in mice had no overt effect on ovarian physiology and reproductive function. Very little is known at present about the molecular mechanisms underlying theca/interstitial cell functions. The expression pattern of CEBPD reported here identifies a novel functional unit of mouse theca cells of primary through tertiary follicles responding to LH/hCG together with a subset of interstitial cells. This acute stimulation of CEBPD expression may be exploited to further characterize the hormonal regulation and function of theca and interstitial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050573684,"Response variability is a fundamental issue in neural coding because it limits all information processing. The reliability of neuronal coding is quantified by various approaches in different studies. In most cases it is largely unclear to what extent the conclusions depend on the applied reliability measure, making a comparison across studies almost impossible. We demonstrate that different reliability measures can lead to very different conclusions even if applied to the same set of data: in particular, we applied information theoretical measures (Shannon information capacity and Kullback-Leibler divergence) as well as a discrimination measure derived from signal-detection theory to the responses of blowfly photoreceptors which represent a well established model system for sensory information processing. We stimulated the photoreceptors with white noise modulated light intensity fluctuations of different contrasts. Surprisingly, the signal-detection approach leads to a safe discrimination of the photoreceptor response even when the response signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is well below unity whereas Shannon information capacity and also Kullback-Leibler divergence indicate a very low performance. Applying different measures, can, therefore, lead to very different interpretations concerning the system's coding performance. As a consequence of the lower sensitivity compared to the signal-detection approach, the information theoretical measures overestimate internal noise sources and underestimate the importance of photon shot noise. We stress that none of the used measures and, most likely no other measure alone, allows for an unbiased estimation of a neuron's coding properties. Therefore the applied measure needs to be selected with respect to the scientific question and the analyzed neuron's functional context."
