https://openalex.org/W2011681768,"Intramolecular vibrations strongly scatter electrons near the Fermi-surface in doped fullerenes. A simple expression for the electron-phonon coupling parameters for this case is derived and evaluated by quantum-chemical calculations. The observed superconducting transition temperatures and their variation with lattice constants can be understood on this basis. To test the ideas and calculations presented here, we predict that high frequency H2 modes acquire a width of about 20% of their frequency in superconductive fullerenes, and soften by about 5% compared to the insulating fullerenes."

Observations over a period of three tuber generations suggest stable changes in tuber shape, yield, and maturity date, in photo-period requirements for flowering, and in plant morphology. Enhanced resistance to early blight (Alternaria solani) and late blight (Phytophthora infestans) diseases also regularly occurs within regenerated populations. These findings are discussed in the context of possible application to varietal improvement, particularly as they pertain to asexually propagated plants."

Variations in pollen, diatoms, concentration of organic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, acid-soluble iron, and an estimate of the degree of pyritization of iron indicate that sedimentation rates, anoxic conditions and eutrophication have increased in the Chesapeake Bay since the time of European settlement."
https://openalex.org/W2090284795,"A theory of the electronic properties of doped fullerenes is proposed in which electronic correlation effects within single fullerene molecules play a central role, and qualitative predictions are made which, if verified, would support this hypothesis. Depending on the effective intrafulllerene electron-electron repulsion and the interfullerene hopping amplitudes (which should depend on the dopant species, among other things), the calculations indicate the possibilities of singlet superconductivity and ferromagnetism."

https://openalex.org/W2169944934,"The maize mutant orange pericarp is a tryptophan auxotroph, which results from mutation of two unlinked loci of tryptophan synthase B. This mutant was used to test the hypothesis that tryptophan is the precursor to the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Total IAA in aseptically grown mutant seedlings was 50 times greater than in normal seedlings. In mutant seedlings grown on media containing stable isotopelabeled precursors, IAA was more enriched than was tryptophan. No incorporation of label into IAA from tryptophan could be detected. These results establish that IAA can be produced de novo without tryptophan as an intermediate."

These changes are not caused by any current climatic change, but by the combination of a delayed response to the end of the last global glacial cycle and an internal instability. The near-future impact of the ice sheet on global sea level is largely due to processes internal to the movement of the ice sheet, and not so much to the threat of a possible greenhouse warming. Thus the near-term future of the ice sheet is already determined. However, too little of the ice sheet has been surveyed to predict its overall future behavior."

When scaled to Earth's mass the martian rate is much smaller than that for Earth or Venus and slightly smaller than for the Moon."
https://openalex.org/W2063384435,"The relative importance of x-rays alone and of x-ray-generated primary and secondary electrons in damaging organic materials was explored by use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on multilayer thin-film supports. The substrates were prepared by the deposit of thin films of silicon (0, 50, 100, and 200 angstroms) on thick layers of gold (2000 angstroms). These systems were supported on chromium-primed silicon wafers. Trifluoroacetoxy-terminated SAMs were assembled on these substrates, and the samples were irradiated with common fluxes of monochromatic aluminum K(alpha) x-rays. The fluxes and energy distributions of the electrons generated by interactions of the x-rays with the various substrates, however, differed. The substrates that emitted a lower flux of electrons exhibited a slower loss of fluorine from the SAMs. This observation indicated that the electrons-and not the x-rays themselves-were largely responsible for the damage to the organic monolayer."
https://openalex.org/W2013791199,Models of Jupiter and Saturn postulate a central rock core surrounded by a fluid mixture of hydrogen and helium. These models suggest that the mixture is undergoing phase separation in Saturn but not Jupiter. State-of-the-art total energy calculations of the enthalpy of mixing for ordered alloys of hydrogen and helium confirm that at least partial phase separation has occurred in Saturn and predict that this process has also begun in Jupiter.
https://openalex.org/W2066676707,"Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to characterize the growth of oxidized areas on galena (100) surfaces and the formation of gold islands by the reductive adsorption of AuCl(4)(-) from aqueous solution. The gold islands and galena substrate were distinguished by atomic resolution imaging and tunneling spectroscopy. Oxidized areas on galena have [110]-trending boundaries; gold islands elongate along [110] directions. However, there are no obvious structural registry considerations that would lead to elongation of gold islands in a [110] direction. Instead, it is probable that a direct coupling of gold reduction and sulfide surface oxidation controls the initial formation of gold islands. Gold islands grow less quickly on preoxidized galena surfaces and show no preferred direction of growth."

https://openalex.org/W2039855300,"The hottest and most luminous stars lose a substantial fraction of their mass in strong stellar winds. These winds not only affect the evolution of the star, they also carve huge expanding cavities in the surrounding interstellar medium, possibly affecting star formation. The winds are probably driven by radiation pressure, but uncertainties persist in their theoretical description. Strong x-ray sources associated with a few of these hot stars may be used to probe the stellar winds. The nature of the weak x-ray sources recently observed to be associated with many of these stars is uncertain. It is suggested that roughly 10 percent of the luminous hot stars may have as companions neutron stars or black holes orbiting within the stellar winds."

It is usually a matter of pride with medical men as well as with many other scientific investigators that any discoveries are given freely to the profession and the public. The tradition opposed to patent restrictions is generally assumed to be based on a renunciation of personal profit because of fraternal ideals. This spirit among productive scientists certainly must be cherished. But there are other

The study has been ordered partly because American industry is faced with a shortage of engineers, especially engineers trained in computer-augmented design and manufacturing techniques. Also, with most new engineering graduates finding attractive jobs in industry upon receiving their bachelor?s degree the engineering schools are discovering that to recruit enough graduate students and ju nior faculty they must look increasingly to foreign-born nationals."
