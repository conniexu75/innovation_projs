https://openalex.org/W2126450798,"An emerging DNA sequencing technique uses protein or solid-state pores to analyze individual strands as they are driven in single-file order past a nanoscale sensor. However, uncontrolled electrophoresis of DNA through these nanopores is too fast for accurate base reads. Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the α-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10% to 24.5% without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis."

However, elucidating the roles of miRNAs in cancer biology, especially in epithelial cancers, remains an ongoing process. In this study, we show that both miR-143 and miR-145, which belong to the same miRNA cluster, can negatively modulate expression of their target gene, MDM2. The miR-143 and miR-145 is posttranscriptionally activated by upregulated p53, thereby generating a short miRNAs-MDM2-p53 feedback loop. Re-expression of these miRNAs suppresses cellular growth and triggers the apoptosis of epithelial cancer, in vitro and in vivo, by enhancing p53 activity via MDM2 turnover. Moreover, the miRNA-dependent MDM2 turnover contributes to the equilibrium of repeated p53 pulses in response to DNA damage stress. These findings suggest that MDM2 dysregulation caused by downregulation of miR-143 and miR-145 contributes to epithelial cancer development and has a key role in regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Re-expression of miR-143 and miR-145 may be a reasonable strategy for treatment of epithelial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2071593083,"Little is known about the alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns during the consecutive stages of cervical cancer development and their association with chromosomal instability. In this study, miRNA expression in normal cervical squamous epithelium, high-grade precancerous lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2-3)), squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and adenocarcinomas (AdCAs) was integrated with previously generated chromosomal profiles of the same samples. Significantly differential expression during the consecutive stages of cervical SCC development was observed for 106 miRNAs. Of these differentially expressed miRNAs, 27 showed early transiently altered expression in CIN2-3 lesions only, 46 miRNAs showed late altered expression in SCCs only and 33 showed continuously altered expression in both CIN2-3 and SCCs. Altered expression of five significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, hsa-miR-9 (1q23.2), hsa-miR-15b (3q25.32), hsa-miR-28-5p (3q27.3), hsa-miR-100 and hsa-miR-125b (both 11q24.1), was directly linked to frequent chromosomal alterations. Functional analyses were performed for hsa-miR-9, representing a potential oncogene with increased expression linked to a chromosomal gain of 1q. Hsa-miR-9 overexpression was found to increase cell viability, anchorage-independent growth and migration in vitro. Upon organic raft culturing, hsa-miR-9 hampered differentiation and induced proliferation in all strata of the epithelial layer. These findings support a potential oncogenic function of hsa-miR-9 in cervical cancer. In summary, differential expression of 106 miRNAs, partly associated with chromosomal alterations, was observed during cervical SCC development. Altered expression of hsa-miR-9 associated with a chromosomal gain of chromosome 1q was shown to be functionally relevant, underlining the importance of deregulated miRNA expression in cervical carcinogenesis."

To explore this possibility, we treated cultured hippocampal slices or primary neurons with glutamate or Bic/4-AP to increase the synaptic activity with or without pretreatment of zinc chelators, and then detected the phosphorylation levels of tau. We found that glutamate or Bic/4-AP treatment caused tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites, including Ser-396, Ser-404, Thr-231, and Thr-205, while application of intracellular or extracellular zinc chelators, or blockade of zinc release by extracellular calcium omission almost abolished the synaptic activity-associated tau hyperphosphorylation. The zinc release and translocation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus were detected, and zinc-induced tau hyperphosphorylation was also observed in cultured brain slices incubated with exogenously supplemented zinc. Tau hyperphosphorylation induced by synaptic activity was strongly associated with inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and this inactivation can be reversed by pretreatment of zinc chelator. Together, these results suggest that synaptically released zinc promotes tau hyperphosphorylation through PP2A inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2032600226,"Chromatin structure organization is crucial for regulating many fundamental cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates the assembly of higher-order chromatin structure remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Brd4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) protein participates in the maintenance of the higher-order chromatin structure. Brd4, a member of the BET family of proteins, has been shown to play important roles in cellular growth control, cell cycle progression, and cancer development. We apply in situ single cell chromatin imaging and micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assay to show that Brd4 depletion leads to a large scale chromatin unfolding. A dominant-negative inhibitor encoding the double bromodomains (BDI/II) of Brd4 can competitively dissociate endogenous Brd4 from chromatin to trigger severely fragmented chromatin morphology. Mechanistic studies using Brd4 truncation mutants reveal that the Brd4 C-terminal domain is crucial for maintaining normal chromatin structure. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation technology, we demonstrate that Brd4 molecules interact intermolecularly on chromatin and that replacing Brd4 molecules by BDI/II causes abnormal nucleosome aggregation and chromatin fragmentation. These studies establish a novel structural role of Brd4 in supporting the higher chromatin architecture.

These studies establish a novel structural role of Brd4 in supporting the higher chromatin architecture. Chromatin structure plays key roles in chromosomal functional events such as transcription, DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Mutations in genes encoding enzymes that modulate chromatin structure can result in perturbations of these important cellular processes and have been linked to many human genetic diseases (1Bickmore W.A. van der Maarel S.M. Perturbations of chromatin structure in human genetic disease. Recent advances.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R207-R213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aberrant chromatin structure is also manifested in cancer (2Davis P.K. Brackmann R.K. Chromatin remodeling and cancer.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 22-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, different processes involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling have become the potential drug targets for diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, AIDS etc. A more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the chromatin structure is therefore vital for developing more rational drug therapies for these diseases. Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, consisting of ∼147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer containing two copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (3Mohd-Sarip A. Verrijzer C.P. Molecular biology. A higher order of silence.Science. 2004; 306: 1484-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Neighboring nucleosomes are connected through a 10–50-base pair linker DNA to form a 10-nm “beads on a string” array. Nucleosome-nucleosome interaction drives the folding of a nucleosomal array into the 30-nm chromatin fiber and eventually into large scale structure (4Tremethick D.J. Higher-order structures of chromatin. The elusive 30 nm fiber.Cell. 2007; 128: 651-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Besides compaction into chromosomes during mitosis, the chromatin fiber is organized, either in euchromatin that contains actively transcribed genes, or in heterochromatin that contains inactive genes (5Morales V. Giamarchi C. Chailleux C. Moro F. Marsaud V. Le Ricousse S. Richard-Foy H. Chromatin structure and dynamics. Functional implications.Biochimie. 2001; 83: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The folding of chromatin into a 30-nm fiber in vitro has been revealed by x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy studies (6Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Nucleosome arrays reveal the two-start organization of the chromatin fiber.Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 7Schalch T. Duda S. Sargent D.F.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6506-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, it is still unknown how the nucleosome fibers compact into condensed chromatin within a cell. Although a number of contributors to chromatin dynamics are known, their functional relationships have not been mechanistically defined. The mechanisms involved in higher-order chromatin architecture assembly and maintenance have remained elusive. Reversible post-translational modifications of the N-terminal tails of histones are crucial for regulating the higher-order states of chromatin compaction (9Gelato K.A. Fischle W. Role of histone modifications in defining chromatin structure and function.Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The bromodomain is an evolutionarily conserved motif present in many chromatin-associated proteins and histone acetyltransferases (10Filetici P. Ornaghi P. Ballario P. The bromodomain. A chromatin browser?.Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D866-D876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is the only known protein module capable of specifically binding to acetylated lysines at the histone tails (11Mujtaba S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Structure and acetyl-lysine recognition of the bromodomain.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5521-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Structural studies have established the bromodomain/acetyl-lysine recognition as a pivotal mechanism for regulating protein-protein interactions in histone-directed chromatin remodeling (11Mujtaba S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Structure and acetyl-lysine recognition of the bromodomain.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5521-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle reveals that the basic N-terminal tail of histone H4 plays an important role in chromatin compaction (6Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Nucleosome arrays reveal the two-start organization of the chromatin fiber.Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), suggesting that bromodomain proteins binding to the acetylated H4 tail may be directly involved in this process. Brd4 is a member of the BET family of proteins that harbor two bromodomains and an extra terminal domain (12Dey A. Ellenberg J. Farina A. Coleman A.E. Maruyama T. Sciortino S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Ozato K. A bromodomain protein, MCAP, associates with mitotic chromosomes and affects G2 to M transition.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6537-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is normally expressed as a long isoform (Brd4L, aa 1–1362) 4The abbreviations used are: aaamino acid(s)Brd4bromodomain 4MNasemicrococcal nucleaseCTDC-terminal domainIPimmunoprecipitationBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationP-TEFbpositive transcription elongation factor bAcHacetylated histoneVNN terminus of VenusVCC terminus of Venus. and a short isoform (Brd4S, aa 1–722). Brd4 binds to acetylated histones through its double bromodomains and becomes associated with both interphase chromatin and mitotic chromosomes (13Dey A. Chitsaz F. Abbasi A. Misteli T. Ozato K. The double bromodomain protein Brd4 binds to acetylated chromatin during interphase and mitosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8758-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Brd4 knock-out in mice is embryonic lethal (14Houzelstein D. Bullock S.L. Lynch D.E. Grigorieva E.F. Wilson V.A. Beddington R.S.

The human Brd4 gene is also the target of translocation t(15;19) that defines a highly lethal carcinoma (24French C.A. Miyoshi I. Aster J.C. Kubonishi I. Kroll T.G. Dal Cin P. Vargas S.O.

Brd4 activation in human breast carcinomas induces a gene expression signature that efficiently predicts survival (25Crawford N.P. Alsarraj J. Lukes L. Walker R.C. Officewala J.S. Yang H.H. Lee M.P.

It has also been identified as a novel target required for maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (26Zuber J. Shi J. Wang E. Rappaport A.R. Herrmann H. Sison E.A. Magoon D. Qi J. Blatt K.

Most of the Brd4 functions have been linked to its role in transcription regulation (27Yang Z. Yik J.H. Chen R. He N. Jang M.K. Ozato K. Zhou Q.

However, in our study, we observed that Brd4 depletion leads to enlarged nuclei indicating chromatin decondensation. Because the closely related Brd2 protein has been shown to possess a histone chaperone activity (30LeRoy G. Rickards B. Flint S.J.

In this study, we use micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assay and in situ chromatin imaging to show that Brd4 knockdown in human cells leads to highly decondensed chromatin structure. A mutant encoding the double bromodomains of Brd4 functions in a dominant-negative manner to dissociate Brd4L from chromatin and to cause a highly fragmented chromatin structure. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the Brd4 CTD is crucial for maintaining normal chromatin structure. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) reveals that Brd4 molecules interact intermolecularly on chromatin through the N terminus and that replacing Brd4 molecules with the double-bromodomain mutant lacking the CTD causes abnormal chromatin fragmentation. Our study therefore provides mechanistic evidence to support a novel structural role of Brd4 in higher-order chromatin structure organization. Plasmids encoding the Xpress-tagged Brd4L (pcDNA4C-Brd4L), BDI/II (pcDNA4C-NLS-BDI/II), and CTD (pcDNA4C-NLS-CTD) have been described (19You J. Croyle J.L. Nishimura A. Ozato K. Howley P.M.

To generate Xpress-tagged Brd4 aa 1–594, 1–730, and 1–1046 mutants, the coding sequences were PCR amplified, and subcloned into pcDNA4C vector using BamHI and NotI sites. For generating the constructs encoding the Xpress-tagged BDI/II-LacI, BDI/II-(731–1046), BDI/II-(1047–1362), and BDI/II-C50, the coding sequences for LacI, Brd4 aa 731–1046, 1047–1362, and 1313–1362, were amplified by PCR and cloned individually into pcDNA4C-NLS-BDI/II using NotI and XhoI sites. The pOZN-Brd4L, pOZN-NLS-BDI/II, and pOZN-NLS-CTD were also constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified cDNA fragments into pOZN vector using XhoI and NotI sites. pOZN-NLS-BDI/II-C50 was constructed by cloning the PCR amplified coding sequence for C50 (Brd4 aa 1313–1362) into pOZN-NLS-BDI/II using NotI site. Brd4L-pOZC and BDI/II-pOZC containing the C-terminal FLAG-HA tags were cloned by ligating the PCR amplified coding sequences (without stop codon) into pOZC vector using XhoI and NotI sites. For pOZN-VN (encoding Venus N for Venus aa 1–155) and pOZN-VC (encoding Venus C for Venus aa 156–238), the coding sequences were amplified from pCS2-Venus provided by Dr. Atsushi Miyawaki. A small linker sequence (GGSGG) was introduced in the N-terminal end of each fragment by PCR and the amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pOZN vector at NotI site. BDI/II or Brd4L DNA fragments excised from BDI/II-pOZC or Brd4L-pOZC using XhoI and NotI digestion were ligated into pOZN-VN and pOZN-VC to generate in-frame fusion of the Brd4 molecules with Venus N or Venus C. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. C33A and 293T cells were maintained as monolayers in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone). U2OS cells were cultured using McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Hyclone). U2OS 2-6-5 cells provided by Dr. Susan M. Janicki were maintained in DMEM GlutaMAXTM-I high glucose medium with sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) containing 10% tet system approved FBS (Clontech). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transient transfection in U2OS cells. For 293T cells, the calcium phosphate transfection method was applied as previously described (32Yan J. Li Q. Lievens S. Tavernier J. You J.

The siRNA were transfected into cells using DharmaFECT 2 (Thermo). For the experiment described in Fig. 1, C and D, U2OS 2-6-5 cells were first transfected with either Brd4 si1 or control siRNA using DharmaFECT 4 (Thermo). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the YFP-LacI construct was transfected into the cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cells were split onto coverslips 24 h later and harvested at 96 h after the first transfection. Recombinant retroviruses were prepared using standard methods and infections of the monolayer cells were performed as described previously (19You J. Croyle J.L. Nishimura A. Ozato K. Howley P.M.

All immunofluorescent images were collected using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX81) equipped with UPlanSApo ×40/0.95 NA lens (Olympus), UPlanSApo ×100/1.4 oil immersion lens (Olympus), and a high-resolution charge-coupled device camera (QImaging, FAST1394). Image data were analyzed and presented using SlideBook 5.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). The scale bars were added using ImageJ software. Three-dimensional imaging of DAPI stained cells was performed using the “three-dimensional capture” mode of SlideBook 5.0 software with the step size set at 0.3 μm. The photos were assembled for presentation using the “make montage” function of ImageJ software. The immunofluorescent images of U2OS 2-6-5 cells were also analyzed using ImageJ software. The “adjust threshold” function of the software was used to select the YFP-LacI dots in the photos and the area data were acquired using “measure” function of the software. 5 × 106 C33A cells were resuspended in 300 μl of HNB (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF). After 20 min incubation on ice, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 240 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were gently resuspended in 50 μl of nuclear buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 70 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm CaCl2). Nuclei suspension was incubated with 0.06 unit of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min. The digestion was terminated by addition of EDTA and EGTA to a 5 mm final concentration each. The nuclear pellets were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) supplemented with RNase (Roche Applied Science, 100 μg/ml). After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, Proteinase K (Roche Applied Science, 200 μg/ml) was added into the samples and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, DNA was resuspended in H2O. Equal amounts of DNA samples were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and detected with ethidium bromide. All MNase assay experiments were repeated more than three times. At 48 h post-transfection, 293T cells were lysed in H buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 3 mm sodium butyrate, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mixture, from Roche Applied Science) by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times. After a 20-min incubation on ice, the supernatant (S1) and the nuclear pellets were separated by centrifugation at 2,700 × g for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in digestion buffer (H buffer with 20 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 18 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for every 107 cells. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 2,700 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (S2) was combined with S1 to make the whole cell lysates. Cell lysates for all of IPs except the one presented in Fig. 5C were prepared using this method. Nuclear extracts used in Fig. 5C were prepared as described previously (32Yan J. Li Q. Lievens S.

After preblocking in 1% BSA/PBS at 4 °C for 1 h, anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with cell lysates at 4 °C for 4 h. For Brd4 IP, the lysates were immunoprecipitated using protein A beads (pre-blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h) mixed with 2 μg of either normal rabbit IgG or Brd4 antibody at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed and eluted as described previously (32Yan J. Li Q. Lievens S. Tavernier J. You J.

Input and IP samples were resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies as indicated in the figure legends (ECL detection). Antibodies employed in the Western blot analysis include: Brd4C (1:80,000), Brd4N (1:80,000), AcH4 (Upstate, 1:2,000), Xpress (Invitrogen, 1:5,000), Actin (Chemicon, 1:150,000), HA-HRP (Roche, 1:1000), FLAG (Sigma, 1:1,000), Cyclin T1 (Santa Cruz, 1:200), and Cdk9 (Santa Cruz, 1:200). All of the IP experiments were repeated at least three times. In our previous study, aberrant chromosome segregation and failures in cytokinesis were consistently observed when Brd4 was knocked down by RNA interference (33You J. Li Q. Wu C. Kim J. Ottinger M. Howley P.M. Regulation of aurora B expression by the bromodomain protein Brd4.Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 5094-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We also noticed that, prior to the onset of the chromosome segregation defects, Brd4 knockdown cells first demonstrated enlarged nuclear shape that resembles chromatin decondensation. In this study, we further examined the chromatin structure induced by Brd4 knockdown in C33A cells. Efficient Brd4 knockdown was achieved using each of the four siRNAs (si1–4) targeting different regions of Brd4 gene (supplemental Fig. S1A). Brd4 knockdown frequently leads to increased cell size and enlarged/lobulated nuclei that are absent in the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1A). Similar chromatin defects were observed in several other cell lines including 293T, U2OS, and primary human foreskin keratinocytes (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that Brd4 knockdown leads to G1 cell cycle arrest and does not increase DNA contents in cells (17Mochizuki K. Nishiyama A. Jang M.K. Dey A. Ghosh A. Tamura T. Natsume H. Yao H. Ozato K. The bromodomain protein Brd4 stimulates G1 gene transcription and promotes progression to S phase.J. Biol.

Brd4 recruits P-TEFb to chromosomes at late mitosis to promote G1 gene expression and cell cycle progression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the enlarged nuclei in Brd4 siRNA-treated cells therefore indicate chromatin decondensation (Fig. 1A). We then performed limited MNase digestion to further assess the chromatin structural defect induced by Brd4 knockdown. MNase digestion provides a useful tool for analyzing chromatin structure because it cleaves the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes, and depending on the extent of digestion, generates chromatin fragments with different sizes corresponding to nucleosome number, which could be detected as a specific ladder of DNA. The patterns of permeability to nuclease digestion reveal the chromatin organization of cells under different experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, compared with the control siRNA-treated cells, MNase digestion of chromatin from cells treated with Brd4 siRNA resulted in increased lower molecular weight DNA fragments especially the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd smallest bands and significantly reduced large DNA fragments migrating in the upper half of the gel. The changes in the DNA band pattern were confirmed by quantification using ImageJ (Fig. 1B, right panel). This increased chromatin accessibility to MNase reveals a decondensed chromatin structure associated with Brd4 knockdown, suggesting that the physiological level of Brd4"

In this study, we used biochemical and molecular biological approaches to elucidate which factors control the cytoplasmic translocation and lytic activation of LytA. We show that LytA is mainly localized intracellularly, as only a small fraction was found attached to the extracellular cell wall. By manipulating the extracellular concentration of LytA, we found that the cells were protected from lysis during exponential growth, but not in the stationary phase, and that a defined threshold concentration of extracellular LytA dictates the onset of autolysis. Stalling growth through nutrient depletion, or the specific arrest of cell wall synthesis, sensitized cells for LytA-mediated lysis. Inhibition of cell wall association via the choline binding domain of an exogenously added enzymatically inactive form of LytA revealed a potential substrate for the amidase domain within the cell wall where the formation of nascent peptidoglycan occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2064522668,"Epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes is an important mechanism involved in cell transformation and tumour progression. The Set and RING-finger-associated domain-containing protein UHRF1 might be an important link between different epigenetic pathways. Here, we report that UHRF1 is frequently overexpressed in human prostate tumours and has an important role in prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression. Analysis of human prostate cancer samples by microarrays and immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of UHRF1 in about half of the cases. Moreover, UHRF1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival after prostatectomy in patients with organ-confined prostate tumours (P < 0.0001). UHRF1 expression was negatively correlated with several tumour suppressor genes and positively with the histone methyltransferase (HMT) EZH2 both in prostate tumours and cell lines. UHRF1 knockdown reduced proliferation, clonogenic capability and anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. Depletion of UHRF1 resulted in reactivation of several tumour suppressor genes. Gene reactivation upon UHRF1 depletion was associated with changes in histone H3K9 methylation, acetylation and DNA methylation, and impaired binding of the H3K9 HMT Suv39H1 to the promoter of silenced genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed direct interaction between UHRF1 and Suv39H1. Our data support the notion that UHRF1, along with Suv39H1 and DNA methyltransferases, contributes to epigenetic gene silencing in prostate tumours. This could represent a parallel and convergent pathway to the H3K27 methylation catalyzed by EZH2 to synergistically promote inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. Deregulated expression of UHRF1 is involved in the prostate cancer pathogenesis and might represent a useful marker to distinguish indolent cancer from those at high risk of lethal progression."
https://openalex.org/W2105894327,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) plays a key role in regulating food intake and energy expenditure at least in part by its actions in hypothalamic neurons. Previously, we showed that loss of CaMKK2 protected mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. However, although pair feeding HFD to WT mice to match food consumption of CAMKK2-null mice slowed weight gain, it failed to protect from glucose intolerance. Here we show that relative to WT mice, HFD-fed CaMKK2-null mice are protected from inflammation in adipose and remain glucose-tolerant. Moreover, loss of CaMKK2 also protected mice from endotoxin shock and fulminant hepatitis. We explored the expression of CaMKK2 in immune cells and found it to be restricted to those of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. CaMKK2-null macrophages exhibited a remarkable deficiency to spread, phagocytose bacteria, and synthesize cytokines in response to the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mechanistically, loss of CaMKK2 uncoupled the TLR4 cascade from activation of protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2; also known as PTK2B). Our findings uncover an important function for CaMKK2 in mediating mechanisms that control the amplitude of macrophage inflammatory responses to excess nutrients or pathogen derivatives."

Low concentrations of CO partially inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in astrocytes, by preventing caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial potential depolarization, and plasmatic membrane permeability. CO exposure enhanced intracellular ATP generation, which was accompanied by an increase on specific oxygen consumption, a decrease on lactate production, and a reduction of glucose use, indicating an improvement of oxidative phosphorylation.

In astrocytes, COX interacts with Bcl-2, which was verified by immunoprecipitation; this interaction is superior after 24 h of CO treatment. Furthermore, CO enhanced Bcl-2 expression in astrocytes. By silencing Bcl-2 expression with siRNA transfection, CO effects in astrocytes were prevented, namely: (i) inhibition of apoptosis, (ii) increase on ATP generation, (iii) stimulation of COX activity, and (iv) mitochondrial biogenesis.

The pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin is essential for targeting to and severing of lipid tubules, but the function of the corresponding variable domain (VD, or insert B) of Drp1 is unknown. We replaced the VD of Drp1 with a panel of linker sequences of varying length and secondary structure composition and found that the VD is dispensable for mitochondrial recruitment, association with the Drp1-anchoring protein Mff (mitochondrial fission factor), and basal and protonophore-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Indeed, several ΔVD mutants constitutively localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and fragmented mitochondria more efficiently than wild-type Drp1. Consistent with an autoinhibitory role of the VD, we identified Arg-376 in the Drp1 stalk domain as necessary for Mff interaction, assembly into spirals, and mitochondrial fission. Switching the length of N- and C-terminal α-helical segments in the VD-replacing linker converted Drp1 from constitutively active and OMM-localized to inactive and cytosolic. Other hypoactive ΔVD mutants formed stable and characteristically shaped aggregates, including extended filaments. Phosphorylation of a PKA site bordering the VD disassembled the filamentous ΔVD mutant and accelerated cytosolic diffusion of full-length Drp1. We propose a model for regulation of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, in which posttranslational modifications in or near the VD alter the conformation of a membrane-proximal oligomerization interface to influence Drp1 assembly rate and/or geometry.

Fission and fusion reactions determine mitochondrial shape and interconnectivity and are critical for biogenesis as well as recycling of the organelle by mitophagy.

Cross-bridging of GTPase domains from adjacent spiral rungs induces a GTP hydrolysis-dependent conformational change, which leads to spiral constriction and severing of the organelle. Dynamin and Drp1 have in common GTPase, middle (MID), and GTPase effector domains (GED, see Fig. 1). According to the recently solved crystal structure of dynamin 1, the MID and GED form a three-helix bundle termed the stalk (12Faelber K. Posor Y. Gao S. Held M. Roske Y. Schulze D. Haucke V. Noé F.

In place of the PH domain, Drp1 features an 80–130-residue long sequence referred to as insert B or variable domain (VD) because it shows the least evolutionary sequence conservation and because it is subject to insertion of two alternative exons in vertebrates (see Fig. 1). The VD contains all eight identified sumoylation sites (14Figueroa-Romero C. Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Stadler J. Chang C.R. Arnoult D. Keller P.J. Hong Y. Blackstone C. Feldman E.L.

Mff oligomerizes via a coiled-coil domain and binds via its N terminus directly to Drp1. The Mff interaction site on Drp1 has, however, not been mapped. Here, we use linker substitution mutagenesis to investigate the function of the Drp1 VD. Our results indicate that the VD is an autoinhibitory domain that modulates mitochondrial fission through oligomeric assembly of Drp1. We also provide evidence that SerPKA phosphorylation inhibits mitochondrial fission by disrupting Drp1 assembly and identify a residue in the Drp1 stalk domain necessary for Mff-dependent recruitment to mitochondria. Drp1 mutants were based on the rat splice variant lacking all three alternative exons. ΔVD mutants were generated using a PCR-based method, amplifying N-terminal GTPase-MID and C-terminal GED sequences using nested primers encoding α-helical and random coil linker sequences. The two PCR fragments were joined by ligation using a silent NotI site included in one α-helical segment. Point mutations in Drp1 and Mff mutants were made by full plasmid synthesis according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). H1 promoter-shRNA cassettes to silence endogenous Drp1 or Mff were inserted into the PciI sites of pEGFP-C1-based vectors that also encoded RNAi-resistant GFP-tagged Drp1 and V5-tagged Mff cDNAs.

Vectors coexpressing GFP2-Drp1 or Renilla luciferase Mff and shRNAs silencing the endogenous proteins were generated starting with GFP-Drp1 and V5-Mff plasmids by PCR-based methods. Drp1 dimerization was assessed by coimmmunoprecipitation. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with triple HA-tagged wild-type Drp1 and GFP-Drp1 mutants at 1:1 ratios. After 48 h, cells were lysed in IP buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiotreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 20,000 × g) and triple HA-tagged -Drp1 was recovered with HA antibody-conjugated agarose beads (EZView, Sigma). After extensive washes in IP buffer, beads were analyzed for coimmmunoprecipitation of mutant GFP-Drp1 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, using a Licor Odyssey infrared scanner for detection of infrared fluorophore-coupled secondary antibodies. Drp1:Mff coimmmunoprecipitation was assayed similarly, except that Drp1 and Mff complexes were stabilized by cross-linking prior to cell lysis (20Otera H. Wang C. Cleland M.M. Setoguchi K. Yokota S. Youle R.J. Mihara K. Mff is an essential factor for mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1 during mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1141-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with the reducible, amino-reactive cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate (0.75 mm in HEPES-buffered Hank's balanced salts (HHBS)) for 30 min prior to cell lysis. Lysates were prepared in buffer containing 0.3% SDS and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA. After sonication with a probe tip to shear DNA, lysates were supplemented with equal volumes of 2× IP buffer, cleared by centrifugation, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with V5 antibody-coupled agarose beads (Invitrogen) as described above. HeLa cells were cultured on no. 1 cover glasses (20 mm2 chamber, Nalgen Nunc, Thermo Fisher) and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and subjected to immunofluorescence staining with primary antibodies to cytochrome c oxidase II (COX2, Neomarkers) and GFP (Abcam), and Alexa Fluor 555- and 488-coupled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) as reported (22Merrill R.A. Dagda R.K. Dickey A.S. Cribbs J.T. Green S.H. Usachev Y.M. Strack S. Mechanism of neuroprotective mitochondrial remodeling by PKA/AKAP1.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Images were captured at 1000× magnification using a Leica epifluorescence microscope and processed for local contrast enhancement (contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization) using ImageJ software. Images subjected to red/green colocalization analysis underwent a second processing step involving iterative two-dimensional deconvolution (macro code and algorithm parameters are available upon request). To quantify mitochondrial morphology, mitochondria channel images were analyzed using a custom ImageJ macro described previously (22Merrill R.A. Dagda R.K. Dickey A.S. Cribbs J.T. Green S.H. Usachev Y.M. Strack S. Mechanism of neuroprotective mitochondrial remodeling by PKA/AKAP1.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Cribbs J.T. Strack S. Functional characterization of phosphorylation sites in dynamin-related protein 1.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 457: 231-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Shape metrics reported here are aspect ratio (long axis divided by short axis of a best fit ellipse) and form factor (perimeter2/(4 × Π × area)), both of which have a minimum value of 1 for perfectly circular mitochondria. Colocalization of GFP-Drp1 with mitochondria was quantified as the Pearson's or Manders' coefficient using the JaCoP plug-in for ImageJ software (24Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). FRAP of GFP-Drp1 in HeLa cells was carried out as described (22Merrill R.A. Dagda R.K. Dickey A.S. Cribbs J.T. Green S.H. Usachev Y.M. Strack S. Mechanism of neuroprotective mitochondrial remodeling by PKA/AKAP1.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Diffusion coefficients of cytosolic GFP-Drp1 were approximated using the equation 0.224 × r2/t½, where r is the radius of the photobleached area and t½ is the time of half-recovery obtained by curve fitting (25Soumpasis D.M. Theoretical analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments.Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 26McNally J.G. Quantitative FRAP in analysis of molecular binding dynamics in vivo.Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 85: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To quantify mitochondrial interconnectivity, a square area next to the nucleus containing mitochondria was bleached with the 633 nm laser line of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and recovery of MitoTracker Deep Red fluorescence was tracked by capturing images every 5 s for 3–4 min. Recovery curves were normalized to prebleach intensity and corrected for acquisition bleach (26McNally J.G. Quantitative FRAP in analysis of molecular binding dynamics in vivo.Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 85: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using a custom-written ImageJ macro. HeLa cells transfected with GFP2-Drp1 and Renilla luciferase Mff at 1:1 ratios were detached from the substrate with 0.25% trypsin/2 mm EDTA and suspended to ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in HHBS. Cell suspensions (40 μl) were dispensed into white 96-well plates, and luminescence reactions were started by automated injection of DeepBlueC coelenterazine substrate (10 μl of 25 μm in HHBS). Emission at 410 nm (Renilla luciferase) and 513 nm (GFP2) was recorded using a Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek) and BRET signals were calculated as Em513/Em410 − Em0513/Em0410, where Em0 are emissions of cells transfected with the donor (Renilla luciferase Mff) only (27Pfleger K.D. Seeber R.M. Eidne K.A. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) for the real-time detection of protein-protein interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Equivalent expression of GFP2-Drp1 wild-type and R376E was verified by fluorescence microscopy immediately prior to BRET measurements. Data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test for single comparisons and by one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise tests with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. To characterize the role of the Drp1 variable domain, we selected deletion boundaries based on crystal structures of dynamin 1 and sequence alignments of dynamin 1 and Drp1 (12Faelber K. Posor Y. Gao S. Held M. Roske Y. Schulze D. Haucke V. Noé F. Daumke O. Crystal structure of nucleotide-free dynamin.Nature. 2011; 477: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Ford M.G. Jenni S. Nunnari J. The crystal structure of dynamin.Nature. 2011; 477: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Outer (o) N- and C-terminal borders of VD deletions corresponded to transitions of α-helices of the stalk domain to disordered sequences that link to the PH domain in dynamin 1. More conservative, inner (i) deletion boundaries preserved additional 17 residues at the N terminus and 5 residues at the C terminus, the latter including the SerPKA phosphorylation site (Fig. 1). The VD and flanking sequences were replaced by 10 to 28-residue-long artificial linkers composed of different permutations of modules forming 1.5 α-helical turns (h = EAAAR) and flexible, hydrophilic coils (c = GGSGGSGG). Inadvertent internal duplication during PCR-based mutagenesis resulted in a third linker module containing five consecutive alanines (H = EAAAAAR) (Fig. 1). Drp1ΔVD mutants were expressed in human HeLa or HEK293 cells as N-terminally tagged GFP fusion proteins from plasmids that also silence endogenous Drp1 via shRNAs to mitigate artifacts due to overexpression or coassembly of wild-type and mutant Drp1 (16Cribbs J.T. Strack S. Reversible phosphorylation of Drp1 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and calcineurin regulates mitochondrial fission and cell death.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). All 16 ΔVD mutants analyzed efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type HA-tagged Drp1 (Fig. 2A), indicating that the VD is not required for dimerization and that these large scale deletions do not globally perturb protein folding. We also examined Drp1ΔVD association with coexpressed, V5-tagged Mff by coimmunoprecipitation. As reported previously (20Otera H. Wang C. Cleland M.M. Setoguchi K. Yokota S. Youle R.J. Mihara K. Mff is an essential factor for mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1 during mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1141-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), this interaction assay requires chemical cross-linking of intact cells, presumably to stabilize Drp1 and/or Mff oligomers. The two representative ΔVD mutants (6 and 13) selected for these experiments both interacted with Mff, although ΔVD13 did so with reduced efficiency (Fig. 2B). In contrast, a Drp1 point mutant (R376E, discussed further below) abrogated Mff coimmunoprecipitation. Wild-type GFP-Drp1 assumed a mixed diffuse cytosolic and punctate mitochondrial localization in live HeLa cells, which was also observed with the majority of ΔVD mutants albeit to varying degrees (Fig. 3, first row). The remaining six Drp1ΔVD mutants formed characteristically shaped intracellular aggregates, ranging from large (3 = ohhchhi) to small globular (5 = ohho), to drop-shaped (2b = icHho), and filamentous (1 = ichhi, Fig. 3, middle and bottom rows; summarized in Fig. 1). Drp1ΔVD1 formed extended and uniformly fine filaments that associated into bundles of variable caliber. These filaments did not colocalize with microtubules, actin, or vimentin (data not shown) and may therefore correspond to linear Drp1 homopolymers. To assess the mitochondria-fragmenting activity of the Drp1ΔVDs, transfected HeLa cells were immunofluorescently labeled for COX2 to stain mitochondria, and epifluorescence micrographs were subjected to digital morphometry (22Merrill R.A. Dagda R.K. Dickey A.S. Cribbs J.T. Green S.H. Usachev Y.M. Strack S. Mechanism of neuroprotective mitochondrial remodeling by PKA/AKAP1.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Cribbs J.T. Strack S. Functional characterization of phosphorylation sites in dynamin-related protein 1.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 457: 231-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial shape changes were quantified as aspect ratio and form factor, both of which have a minimum value of 1 for perfectly circular objects. Replacement of endogenous with wild-type GFP-tagged and RNAi-resistant Drp1 did not appreciably change mitochondrial morphology as compared with untransfected, GFP- and shRNA-negative cells (Fig. 4A). Expression of the aggregate-forming Drp1ΔVD mutants uniformly resulted in mitochondrial elongation presumably as a consequence of unopposed fusion. The cytosolic/mitochondria-localized ΔVD mutants, in contrast, promoted significant mitochondrial fission compared with wild-type Drp1, with mitochondria in ΔVD6/ohchho expressing cells displaying the smallest aspect ratios and form factors. A notable exception was ΔVD13/ohhcho, which was largely cytosolic but caused mitochondrial elongation similar to the aggregating Drp1ΔVD mutants (Fig. 4A). To confirm that variable domain deletion can activate Drp1, we assessed mitochondrial interconnectivity in live cells by FRAP. Recovery of MitoTracker Deep Red fluorescence into a laser-bleached 5 × 5 μm area near the nucleus was monitored in HeLa cells expressing wild-type Drp1 as well as two hyperactive ΔVD constructs (3b/ohchhi, 6/ohchho). Both mutants slowed the extent and rate of mitochondrial dye refilling as quantified as fluorescence recovery integrated over the first 3 min (area under the curve, AUC, Fig. 4C), indicating that visually smaller mitochondria are indeed physically separated. For a subset of Drp1ΔVD mutants with mixed cytosolic/mitochondrial distribution, we also evaluated colocalization with mitochondria (Pearson's coefficient, PC) as a function of mitochondrial morphology (form factor) in fixed and immunofluorescently labeled HeLa cells. A negative, linear correlation was observed, with Drp1ΔVD6/ohchho expressing cells displaying the smallest mitochondria and highest colocalization, and the linker-reversing Drp1ΔVD13/ohhcho placing at the opposite of end of the spectrum (Fig. 4D). Dissipation of the proton gradient causes mitochondrial swelling and rapid, Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation (28De Vos K.J. Allan V.J. Grierson A.J. Sheetz M.P. Mitochondrial function and actin regulate dynamin-related protein 1-dependent mitochondrial fission.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Because all previously characterized regulatory posttranslational modifications of Drp1 occur within or near the VD, we asked whether the VD is necessary for stimulation of mitochondrial fission by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). We examined Drp1ΔVD4, a mixed cytosolic/mitochondrial mutant with moderately impaired activity that lacks all sumoylation and phosphorylation sites, but retains the nitrosylation site in the GED. Another mutant carried a Cys→Val substitution to also block nitrosylation (ΔVD4 CV). FCCP treatment (5 μm, 20 min prior to fixation) resulted in mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 as well as fragmentation of the organelle, regardless of whether HeLa cells expressed GFP-Drp1 wild-type, ΔVD4, or ΔVD4 CV (Fig. 4E). Thus, FCCP-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation does not require any of the known posttranslational modification sites in Drp1. Drp1ΔVD6 did not respond to uncoupler treatment, likely because this mutant is already maximally active and mitochondria-associated. Because mitochondria in cells expressing Drp1ΔVD6 were highly punctiform, on average smaller than those in FCCP-treated, wild-type Drp1 expressing cells (Fig. 4E), we examined them ultrastructurally for signs of dysfunction. To identify GFP-Drp1ΔVD6-positive cells at the electron microscope level, we subjected them to GFP-catalyzed diaminobenzidine photo-oxidation prior to embedding (29Grabenbauer M. Geerts W.J. Fernadez-Rodriguez J. Hoenger A. Koster A.J. Nilsson T. Correlative microscopy and electron tomography of GFP through photo-oxidation.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Mitochondria in Drp1ΔVD6-expressing HeLa cells were ultrastructurally indistinguishable from those in untransfected cells, displaying close apposition of inner and outer membranes and abundant christae (Fig. 4F). Collectively, these results reveal that the VD is dispensable for basal and uncoupler-stimulated mitochondrial targeting and severing by Drp1. ΔVD mutants with decreased fission activity feature either the more conservative N-terminal deletion border (i …), a linker beginning with a three-turn α-helix (hh), or both. Therefore, the autoinhibitory function o"
https://openalex.org/W2164078051,"The yeast Pah1p phosphatidate phosphatase, which catalyzes the penultimate step in the synthesis of triacylglycerol and plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid synthesis genes, is a cytosolic enzyme that associates with the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane to catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate to yield diacylglycerol. Pah1p is phosphorylated on seven (Ser-110, Ser-114, Ser-168, Ser-602, Thr-723, Ser-744, and Ser-748) sites that are targets for proline-directed protein kinases. In this work, we showed that the seven sites are phosphorylated by Pho85p-Pho80p, a protein kinase-cyclin complex known to regulate a variety of cellular processes. The phosphorylation of recombinant Pah1p was time- and dose-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of ATP (3.7 μm) and Pah1p (0.25 μm). Phosphorylation reduced (6-fold) the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) of Pah1p and reduced (3-fold) its interaction (Kd) with liposomes. Alanine mutations of the seven sites ablated the inhibitory effect that Pho85p-Pho80p had on Pah1p activity and on the interaction with liposomes. Analysis of pho85Δ mutant cells, phosphate-starved wild type cells, and cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient forms of Pah1p indicated that loss of Pho85p-Pho80p phosphorylation reduced Pah1p abundance. In contrast, lack of Nem1p-Spo7p, the phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates Pah1p at the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane, stabilized Pah1p abundance. Although loss of phosphorylation caused a decrease in abundance, a greater amount of Pah1p was associated with membranes when compared with phosphorylated enzyme, and the loss of phosphorylation allowed bypass of the Nem1p-Spo7p requirement for Pah1p function in the synthesis of triacylglycerol.

Thus, the phosphorylation of one or more of the remaining sites among the seven is needed to regulate Pah1p function. However, until now, the identity of the relevant kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylating the remaining four sites was unknown. In the present work, we identified Pho85p, together with its cyclin partner Pho80p, as the protein kinase that phosphorylated all seven of the sites within the (Ser/Thr)-Pro motif (Fig. 1). Pho85p is a multifunctional cyclin-dependent protein kinase involved in several signal transduction pathways that affect cell cycle progression and the metabolism of nutrients (26Moffat J. Huang D.

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been shown to regulate energy balance in lower organisms, but whether a similar pathway exists in mammals is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that BMP7 can regulate brown adipogenesis and energy expenditure. In the current study, we have uncovered a novel role for BMP7 in appetite regulation. Systemic treatment of diet-induced obese mice with BMP7 resulted in increased energy expenditure and decreased food intake, leading to a significant reduction in body weight and improvement of metabolic syndrome. Similar degrees of weight loss with reduced appetite were also observed in BMP7-treated ob/ob mice, suggesting a leptin-independent mechanism utilized by BMP7. Intracerebroventricular administration of BMP7 to mice led to an acute decrease in food intake, which was mediated, at least in part, by a central rapamycin-sensitive mTOR-p70S6 kinase pathway. Together, these results underscore the importance of BMP7 in regulating both food intake and energy expenditure, and suggest new therapeutic approaches for obesity and its comorbidities.— Townsend, K.

https://openalex.org/W2074445285,"Lipin-2 is a member of the lipin family of enzymes, which are key effectors in the biosynthesis of lipids. Mutations in the human lipin-2 gene are associated with inflammatory-based disorders; however, the role of lipin-2 in cells of the immune system remains obscure. In this study, we have investigated the role of lipin-2 in the proinflammatory action of saturated fatty acids in murine and human macrophages. Depletion of lipin-2 promotes the increased expression of the proinflammatory genes Il6, Ccl2, and Tnfα, which depends on the overstimulation of the JNK1/c-Jun pathway by saturated fatty acids. In contrast, overexpression of lipin-2 reduces the release of proinflammatory factors. Metabolically, the absence of lipin-2 reduces the cellular content of triacylglycerol in saturated fatty acid-overloaded macrophages. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a protective role for lipin-2 in proinflammatory signaling mediated by saturated fatty acids that occurs concomitant with an enhanced cellular capacity for triacylglycerol synthesis. The data provide new insights into the role of lipin-2 in human and murine macrophage biology and may open new avenues for controlling the fatty acid-related low grade inflammation that constitutes the sine qua non of obesity and associated metabolic disorders."

In Arabidopsis thaliana, trichome and root hair initiation requires a combination of three groups of proteins, including the WD40 repeat protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1), R2R3 repeat MYB protein GLABRA1 (GL1), or WEREWOLF (WER) and the IIIf subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein GLABRA3 (GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3). The bHLH component acts as a docking site for TTG1 and MYB proteins. Here, we isolated a mutant showing defects in trichome and root hair patterning that carried a point mutation (R173H) in AtMYC1 that encodes the fourth member of IIIf bHLH family protein. Genetic analysis revealed partial redundant yet distinct function between AtMYC1 and GL3/EGL3. GLABRA2 (GL2), an important transcription factor involved in trichome and root hair control, was down-regulated in Atmyc1 plants, suggesting the requirement of AtMYC1 for appropriate GL2 transcription. Like its homologs, AtMYC1 formed a complex with TTG1 and MYB proteins but did not dimerized. In addition, the interaction of AtMYC1 with MYB proteins and TTG1 was abrogated by the R173H substitution in Atmyc1-1. We found that this amino acid (Arg) is conserved in the AtMYC1 homologs GL3/EGL3 and that it is essential for their interaction with MYB proteins and for their proper functions. Our findings indicate that AtMYC1 is an important regulator of trichome and root hair initiation, and they reveal a novel amino acid necessary for protein-protein interactions and gene function in IIIf subfamily bHLH transcription factors.

AtMYC1, the fourth member of the R/B-like IIIf subfamily of bHLH transcription factors in Arabidopsis, was first cloned by Urao et al. in 1996 (44Urao T. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Mitsukawa N. Shibata D. Shinozaki K. Molecular cloning and characterization of a gene that encodes a MYC-related protein in Arabidopsis.Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); subsequently it was characterized as the direct target as GL3 by Morohashi and Grotewold (20Morohashi K. Grotewold E. A systems approach reveals regulatory circuitry for Arabidopsis trichome initiation by the GL3 and GL1 selectors.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000396Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and it was shown to interact with GL1 and WER in yeast (45Zimmermann I.M. Heim M.A. Weisshaar B. Uhrig J.F. Comprehensive identification of Arabidopsis thaliana MYB transcription factors interacting with R/B-like BHLH proteins.Plant J. 2004; 40: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and after we finished this manuscript, it was reported that AtMYC1 is an important source of variation for trichome cell fate determination in different ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (46Symonds V.V. Hatlestad G. Lloyd A.M. Natural allelic variation defines a role for ATMYC1. Trichome cell fate determination.PLoS Genetics. 2011; 7: e1002069Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we characterized the function of AtMYC1 in root hair development in addition to in trichome cell fate determination through the isolation of a mutant carrying a point mutation in AtMYC1. We found that the function of AtMYC1 is partially redundant yet distinct with that of GL3/EGL3 in trichome and root hair development, probably through the regulation of GL2 expression. Furthermore, we identified an amino acid residue that is functionally conserved among the R/B-like IIIf subfamily of bHLH transcription factors and which is necessary for the interaction between bHLH and MYB proteins in trichome and root hair patterning. The A. thaliana stocks described in this work were of the Columbia (Col) ecotype. Atmyc1-2, Atmyc1-3, and gl3-11 correspond to SALK_056899, SAIL_227_H01, and SALK_118201, respectively. Seeds were surface-sterilized in 75% ethanol, washed with sterile water, kept at 4 °C in a chamber for 2 days, and then planted on Murashige and Skoog medium. After 8 days, the seedlings were transferred to soil and grown in a growth chamber under long-day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of dark) at 65% relative humidity. The Atmyc1-1 mutant (Col background) was crossed with wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) plants. The F2 population was used for mapping. Simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS), and derived CAPS (dCAPS) markers were designed according to differences announced publicly on the TAIR website (47Lukowitz W.

Root hair cell number and cell type pattern analysis were carried on with toluidine blue-stained 4-day-old seedling roots, viewed with differential interference contrast optics. At least 20 seedling roots were analyzed for each strain. Epidermis with visible protrusion was taken as root hair cells (12Bernhardt C. Lee M.M. Gonzalez A. Zhang F. Lloyd A. Schiefelbein J.

Total RNA for quantitative real-time PCR was prepared using TRI Reagent Solution (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's handbook. After digestion with RNase-free DNase (Promega) to eliminate contaminating DNA, 3 mg of total RNA were used for reverse transcription (Fermentas). Real-time PCR was carried out using Takara SYBR Premix Ex Taq in a 7500 real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). To construct pAtMYC1::AtMYC1 for our complementation analysis, a 2581-bp 5′-regulatory sequence together with the coding sequence of AtMYC1 was inserted into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300 and introduced into Atmyc1-1 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated floral transformation (49Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Floral dip. A simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct pAtMYC1::GUS, the above promoter was inserted upstream of GUS in the pCAMBIA 1300, and the construct was transformed into wild-type plants. GUS staining was performed as described by Cao et al. (50Cao Y. Dai Y. Cui S. Ma L. Histone H2B monoubiquitination in the chromatin of FLOWERING LOCUS C regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 2586-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Trichome staining in mature leaves was done using T1 plants; all other tissues were taken from T3 plants. Fresh 10-day-old seedlings were fixed in 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, and 3.7% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C then dehydrated in an ethanol series (once in 30, 50, 70, and 95% and twice in 100%). The samples were then freeze-dried overnight in tertiary butyl alcohol. The dried seedlings were mounted on scanning electron microscopy stubs with double-sided mounting tape, then coated with gold and examined by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-2"
https://openalex.org/W2097824911,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) has recently been associated with a high incidence of diverse mutations in genes such as TET2 or EZH2 that are implicated in epigenetic mechanisms. We have performed genome-wide DNA methylation arrays and mutational analysis of TET2, IDH1, IDH2, EZH2 and JAK2 in a group of 24 patients with CMML. 249 genes were differentially methylated between CMML patients and controls. Using Ingenuity pathway analysis, we identified enrichment in a gene network centered around PLC, JNK and ERK suggesting that these pathways, whose deregulation has been recently described in CMML, are affected by epigenetic mechanisms. Mutations of TET2, JAK2 and EZH2 were found in 15 patients (65%), 4 patients (17%) and 1 patient (4%) respectively while no mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes were identified. Interestingly, patients with wild type TET2 clustered separately from patients with TET2 mutations, showed a higher degree of hypermethylation and were associated with higher risk karyotypes. Our results demonstrate the presence of aberrant DNA methylation in CMML and identifies TET2 mutant CMML as a biologically distinct disease subtype with a different epigenetic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2144888494,"The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a member of the AGC group of protein kinases. Whereas PKA has served as a structural model for the protein kinase superfamily, all previous structures of the catalytic subunit contain a phosphorylated activation loop. To understand the structural effects of activation loop phosphorylation at Thr-197 we used a PKA mutant that does not autophosphorylate at Thr-197. The enzyme crystallized in the apo-state, and the structure was solved to 3.0 Å. The N-lobe is rotated by 18° relative to the wild-type apoenzyme, which illustrates that the enzyme likely exists in a wide range of conformations in solution due to the uncoupling of the N- and C-lobes. Several regions of the protein including the activation loop are disordered in the structure, and there are alternate main chain conformations for the magnesium positioning loop and catalytic loop causing a complete loss of hydrogen bonding between these two active site structural elements. These alterations are reflected in a 20-fold decrease in the apparent phosphoryl transfer rate as measured by pre-steady-state kinetic methods. The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a member of the AGC group of protein kinases. Whereas PKA has served as a structural model for the protein kinase superfamily, all previous structures of the catalytic subunit contain a phosphorylated activation loop. To understand the structural effects of activation loop phosphorylation at Thr-197 we used a PKA mutant that does not autophosphorylate at Thr-197. The enzyme crystallized in the apo-state, and the structure was solved to 3.0 Å. The N-lobe is rotated by 18° relative to the wild-type apoenzyme, which illustrates that the enzyme likely exists in a wide range of conformations in solution due to the uncoupling of the N- and C-lobes. Several regions of the protein including the activation loop are disordered in the structure, and there are alternate main chain conformations for the magnesium positioning loop and catalytic loop causing a complete loss of hydrogen bonding between these two active site structural elements. These alterations are reflected in a 20-fold decrease in the apparent phosphoryl transfer rate as measured by pre-steady-state kinetic methods."
https://openalex.org/W2001474652,"α-Synuclein (AS) is associated with both sporadic and familial forms of Parkinson disease (PD). In sporadic disease, wild-type AS fibrillates and accumulates as Lewy bodies within dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. The accumulation of misfolded AS is associated with the death of these neurons, which underlies many of the clinical features of PD. In addition, a rare missense mutation in AS, A30P, is associated with highly penetrant, autosomal dominant PD, although the pathogenic mechanism is unclear. A30P AS fibrillates more slowly than the wild-type (WT) protein in vitro and has been reported to preferentially adopt a soluble, protofibrillar conformation. This has led to speculation that A30P forms aggregates that are distinct in structure compared with wild-type AS. Here, we perform a detailed comparison of the chemical shifts and secondary structures of these fibrillar species, based upon our recent characterization of full-length WT fibrils. We have assigned A30P AS fibril chemical shifts de novo and used them to determine its secondary structure empirically. Our results illustrate that although A30P forms fibrils more slowly than WT in vitro, the chemical shifts and secondary structure of the resultant fibrils are in high agreement, demonstrating a conserved β-sheet core."
https://openalex.org/W2017729700,"Integrins are heterodimeric type I membrane cell adhesion molecules that are involved in many biological processes. Integrins are bidirectional signal transducers because their cytoplasmic tails are docking sites for cytoskeletal and signaling molecules. Kindlins are cytoplasmic molecules that mediate inside-out signaling and activation of the integrins. The three kindlin paralogs in humans are kindlin-1, -2, and -3. Each of these contains a 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM) domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. Kindlin-3 is expressed in platelets, hematopoietic cells, and endothelial cells. Here we show that kindlin-3 is involved in integrin αLβ2 outside-in signaling. It also promotes micro-clustering of integrin αLβ2. We provide evidence that kindlin-3 interacts with the receptor for activated-C kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein that folds into a seven-blade propeller. This interaction involves the pleckstrin homology domain of kindlin-3 and blades 5-7 of RACK1. Using the SKW3 human T lymphoma cells, we show that integrin αLβ2 engagement by its ligand ICAM-1 promotes the association of kindlin-3 with RACK1. We also show that kindlin-3 co-localizes with RACK1 in polarized SKW3 cells and human T lymphoblasts. Our findings suggest that kindlin-3 plays an important role in integrin αLβ2 outside-in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2037606237,"Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), an orphan G protein-coupled receptor-type seven transmembrane protein, was recently found mutated or silenced in multiple human cancers and can interfere with tumor growth when overexpressed. Yet, little is known about its regulation and the molecular mechanisms through which this novel tumor suppressor exerts its anti-cancer effects. Here, we demonstrate that the N terminus of BAI1 is cleaved extracellularly to generate a truncated receptor and a 40-kDa fragment (Vasculostatin-40) that inhibits angiogenesis. We demonstrate that this novel proteolytic processing event depends on a two-step cascade of protease activation: proprotein convertases, primarily furin, activate latent matrix metalloproteinase-14, which then directly cleaves BAI1 to release the bioactive fragment. These findings significantly augment our knowledge of BAI1 by showing a novel post-translational mechanism regulating BAI1 activity through cancer-associated proteases, have important implications for BAI1 function and regulation, and present novel opportunities for therapy of cancer and other vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2091945743,"Serine/threonine kinase IKBKE is a newly identified oncogene; however, its regulation remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence that IKBKE is a downstream target of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and that tobacco components induce IKBKE expression through STAT3. Ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3 increased IKBKE mRNA and protein levels, whereas inhibition of STAT3 reduced IKBKE expression. Furthermore, expression levels of IKBKE are significantly associated with STAT3 activation and tobacco use history in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients examined. In addition, we show induction of IKBKE by two components of cigarette smoke, nicotine and nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK). Upon exposure to nicotine or NNK, cells express high levels of IKBKE protein and mRNA, which are largely abrogated by inhibition of STAT3. Characterization of the IKBKE promoter revealed two STAT3-response elements. The IKBKE promoter directly bound to STAT3 and responded to nicotine and NNK stimulation. Notably, enforcing expression of IKBKE induces chemoresistance, whereas knockdown of IKBKE not only sensitizes NSCLC cells to chemotherapy but also abrogates STAT3- and nicotine-induced cell survival. These data indicate for the first time that IKBKE is a direct target of STAT3 and is induced by tobacco carcinogens through STAT3 pathway. In addition, our study also suggests that IKBKE is an important therapeutic target and could have a pivotal role in tobacco-associated lung carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018003514,"Epigenetic modifications are a driving force in carcinogenesis. However, their role in cancer metastasis remains poorly understood. The present study investigated the role of DNA methylation in the cervical cancer metastasis. Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. Using methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis, we found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) was silenced through DNMT3B-mediated methylation in the cervical cancer. PTPRR inhibited p44/42 MAPK signaling, the expression of the transcription factor AP1, human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6/E7 and DNMTs. The methylation status of PTPRR increased in cervical scrapings (n=358) in accordance with disease severity, especially in invasive cancer. Methylation of the PTPRR promoter has an important role in the metastasis and may be a biomarker of invasive cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2012359491,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation is an important post-translational modification that confers a variety of biological properties and functions to proteins. This post-translational modification has a particularly complex and differentially regulated biosynthesis rendering prediction and control of where O-glycans are attached to proteins, and which structures are formed, difficult. Because plants are devoid of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation, we have assessed requirements for establishing human GalNAc O-glycosylation de novo in plants with the aim of developing cell systems with custom-designed O-glycosylation capacity. Transient expression of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa Glc(NAc) C4-epimerase and a human polypeptide GalNAc-transferase in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in GalNAc O-glycosylation of co-expressed human O-glycoprotein substrates. A chimeric YFP construct containing a 3.5 tandem repeat sequence of MUC1 was glycosylated with up to three and five GalNAc residues when co-expressed with GalNAc-T2 and a combination of GalNAc-T2 and GalNAc-T4, respectively, as determined by mass spectrometry. O-Glycosylation was furthermore demonstrated on a tandem repeat of MUC16 and interferon α2b. In plants, prolines in certain classes of proteins are hydroxylated and further substituted with plant-specific O-glycosylation; unsubstituted hydroxyprolines were identified in our MUC1 construct. In summary, this study demonstrates that mammalian type O-glycosylation can be established in plants and that plants may serve as a host cell for production of recombinant O-glycoproteins with custom-designed O-glycosylation. The observed hydroxyproline modifications, however, call for additional future engineering efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2006863188,"How the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery gains access to damaged chromatinized DNA templates and how the chromatin structure is modified to promote efficient repair of the non-transcribed genome remain poorly understood. The UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex (UV-DDB, consisting of DDB1 and DDB2, the latter of which is mutated in xeroderma pigmentosum group E patients, is a substrate-recruiting module of the cullin 4B-based E3 ligase complex, DDB1-CUL4B(DDB2). We previously reported that the deficiency of UV-DDB E3 ligases in ubiquitinating histone H2A at UV-damaged DNA sites in the xeroderma pigmentosum group E cells contributes to the faulty NER in these skin cancer-prone patients. Here, we reveal the mechanism by which monoubiquitination of specific H2A lysine residues alters nucleosomal dynamics and subsequently initiates NER. We show that DDB1-CUL4B(DDB2) E3 ligase specifically binds to mononucleosomes assembled with human recombinant histone octamers and nucleosome-positioning DNA containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts photolesions. We demonstrate functionally that ubiquitination of H2A Lys-119/Lys-120 is necessary for destabilization of nucleosomes and concomitant release of DDB1-CUL4B(DDB2) from photolesion-containing DNA. Nucleosomes in which these lysines are replaced with arginines are resistant to such structural changes, and arginine mutants prevent the eviction of H2A and dissociation of polyubiquitinated DDB2 from UV-damaged nucleosomes. The partial eviction of H3 from the nucleosomes is dependent on ubiquitinated H2A Lys-119/Lys-120. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how post-translational modification of H2A at the site of a photolesion initiates the repair process and directly affects the stability of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2040558557,"Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are expressed from two-gene operons that encode a cytoplasmic protein toxin and its cognate protein antitoxin. These gene cassettes are often present in multiple copies on bacterial chromosomes, where they have been reported to regulate stress adaptation and persistence during antimicrobial treatment. We have identified a novel type II TA cassette in the intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus that consists of the toxin gene, brnT, and its antitoxin, brnA. BrnT is coexpressed and forms a 2:2 tetrameric complex with BrnA, which neutralizes BrnT toxicity. The BrnT(2)-BrnA(2) tetramer binds its own promoter via BrnA, and autorepresses its expression; its transcription is strongly induced in B. abortus by various stressors encountered by the bacterial cell during infection of a mammalian host. Although highly divergent at the primary sequence level, an atomic resolution (1.1 Å) crystal structure of BrnT reveals a secondary topology related to the RelE family of type II ribonuclease toxins. However, overall tertiary structural homology to other RelE family toxins is low. A functional characterization of BrnT by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates a correspondence between its in vitro activity as a ribonuclease and control of bacteriostasis in vivo. We further present an analysis of the conserved and variable features of structure required for RNA scission in BrnT and the RelE toxin family. This structural investigation informs a model of the RelE-fold as an evolutionarily flexible scaffold that has been selected to bind structurally disparate antitoxins, and exhibit distinct toxin activities including RNA scission and DNA gyrase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2014725643,"CXC chemokine ligand-13 (CXCL13) has been implicated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumor progression and osteolysis. The tumor necrosis factor family member RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand), a critical bone resorbing osteoclastogenic factor, has an important role in cancer invasion of bone/osteolysis. Here, we show high-level expression of CXCL13 in primary human OSCC tumor specimens; however, human bone marrow-derived stromal (SAKA-T) and murine preosteoblast (MC3T3-E1) cells produce at very low level. Recombinant CXCL13 (0-15 ng/ml) dose dependently induced CXCR5 expression in SAKA-T and MC3T3-E1 cells. Conditioned media obtained from OSCC cell lines increased the RANKL expression and an antibody against the CXCL13 specific receptor, CXCR5 markedly decreased RANKL expression in these cells. Furthermore, CXCL13 increased hRANKL-Luc promoter activity. Superarray screening identified c-Myc and NFATc3 transcription factors upregulated in CXCL13-stimulated SAKA-T cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of OSCC tumors that developed in athymic mice demonstrated RANKL and NFATc3 expression in tumor and osteoblast cells, however, showed p-c-Myc expression specific to osteoblastic cells at the tumor-bone interface. We further identified NFATc3 expression, but not c-Myc activation in primary human OSCC tumor specimens compared with adjacent normal tissue. Also, CXCL13 significantly increased p-ERK1/2 in SAKA-T and MC3T3-E1 cells. siRNA suppression of c-Myc expression markedly decreased CXCL13-induced RANKL and NFATc3 expression in preosteoblast cells. Chromatin-immuno precipitation assay confirmed p-c-Myc binding to the hRANKL promoter region. In summary, c-Myc activation through CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling axis stimulates RANKL expression in stromal/preosteoblast cells. Thus, our results implicate CXCL13 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent OSCC invasion of bone/osteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2073244778,"Microenvironmental acidosis is a common feature of inflammatory loci, in which clearance of apoptotic cells is necessary for the resolution of inflammation. Although it is known that a low pH environment affects immune function, its effect on apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages has not been fully investigated. Here, we show that treatment of macrophages with low pH medium resulted in increased expression of stabilin-1 out of several receptors, which are known to be involved in PS-dependent removal of apoptotic cells. Reporter assays showed that the -120/-1 region of the mouse stabilin-1 promoter was a low pH-responsive region and provided evidence that extracellular low pH mediated transcriptional activation of stabilin-1 via Ets-2. Furthermore, extracellular low pH activated JNK, thereby inducing translocation of Ets-2 into the nucleus. When macrophages were preincubated with low pH medium, phagocytosis of phosphatidylserine-exposed red blood cells and phosphatidylserine-coated beads by macrophages was enhanced. Blockade of stabilin-1 in macrophages abolished the enhancement of phagocytic activity by low pH. Thus, our results demonstrate that a low pH microenvironment up-regulates stabilin-1 expression in macrophages, thereby modulating the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, and suggest roles for stabilin-1 and Ets-2 in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by the immune system."

In an analogous study, we showed that the globular domain of variant H1c interacts with the nucleosome with a binding orientation that is distinct than that of H10 (29George E.M. Izard T.

It is plausible that differential orientation of the globular domain could impart functional specificity to the linker histone isotypes. Thus, it is important to comprehensively elucidate the structural properties of H1 isotypes that dictate their binding characteristics. The globular domain sequence shows a high degree of conservation across individual linker histones, whereas those of the terminal domains are quite divergent within the same species (17Parseghian M.H.

In this manuscript, we report a novel dual color FRAP assay approach, which permits simultaneous determination of the in vivo binding kinetics of two distinct forms of linker histone proteins within a subnuclear region of a single cell. In this system, sequences encoding two linker histones are separately fused with sequences encoding spectrally separable fluorescent proteins and are co-expressed from a bicistronic vector. Thus, an extremely stringent and precise measurement and comparison of the binding behavior of the two proteins is possible. Using this system, combined with a domain swap and a mutagenesis-based experimental approach, we determined that the N- and C-terminal domains have distinct roles in the chromatin binding characteristics of linker histone isotypes H10 and H1c. We conclude that the N-terminal domain contributes to overall chromatin binding affinity, whereas the C-terminal domain directs differential nucleosomal orientation of the H10 and H1c globular domains. fluorescence recovery after photobleaching mCherry fluorescent protein. Plasmids containing H1 isotypes tagged at the C terminus with enhanced GFP have been described previously (16Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Dynamic binding of histone H1 to chromatin in living cells.Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing mouse H1 isotypes tagged with mCherry (ChFP) were constructed by inserting the coding sequence of monomeric mCherry (a kind gift from R. Tsein) after the last lysine residue of the H1 isotypes. Plasmids containing H1 isotypes tagged at the N terminus, separated by a 20-amino acid linker, were also constructed. Domain shift hybrids were generated in multiple steps using PCR-based and silent mutagenesis. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by introduction of annealed oligonucleotides between restriction sites. Details of the constructs used are presented in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1. Bicistronic constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instruction into mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast cells cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Multiple stable clonal cell lines were selected for each construct using 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Clontech). The cells were plated at 50% confluency and imaged on Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass (Nalgene Nunc) in growth DMEM in the absence of inducer. The Zeiss 510 LSM META confocal microscope with a Plan Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil-immersion objective lens was used for imaging studies. The cells were imaged at 37 °C using a heat-regulated stage (Heating insert P) and an objective heater (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.). For excitation of GFP, the 488-nm line of an argon laser (nominal output, 30 milliwatt) operating at 75% output laser power was used. For excitation of ChFP, the 543-nm line of 10 milliwatt helium-neon lasers was used. Fluorescence emission of GFP and ChFP was detected by using the BP 505–530- and LP 585-nm filters, respectively. The detection was achieved using the multitracking mode at 4–5% laser intensity in the linear range of detection with maximal gain of 650. Scanning was bidirectional at the highest possible rate using a 4× zoom and image format 512 × 512 pixels with the pinhole of 3 Airy units. Control experiments with cells expressing only H1-mCherry or H1-GFP confirmed absence of bleed through of fluorescence signals between channels (supplemental Fig. S2). For all FRAP experiments, three prebleach scans of the cells were acquired. Bleaching of a random heterochromatic spot in the nucleus was performed simultaneously for GFP and mCherry with a single pass with all laser lines between 488 and 543 nm set to maximal power. The bleach area was set to be a spot of 2 μm, and bleaching was achieved using 10 consecutive bleach scans of 49-ms duration. Fluorescence recovery was monitored for 150 s after bleaching by scanning the cell at 2-s intervals. Identical settings were used for the pre- and postbleach images. Image analysis was carried out using MBF ImageJ software. Each cell image was split into two separate channel windows for ChFP and GFP, and image alignment was performed for each with the TurboReg Plugin (34Thévenaz P. Ruttimann U.E. Unser M. A pyramid approach to subpixel registration based on intensity.IEEE Trans. Image Process. 1998; 7: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Double normalization was carried out to normalize the raw fluorescence recovery data to the average prebleach signal while correcting for acquisition bleaching and background subtraction to obtain the relative fluorescence intensity as described (35Phair R.D. Gorski S.A. Misteli T. Measurement of dynamic protein binding to chromatin in vivo, using photobleaching microscopy.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The normalized recovery curves were processed in separate channels for mCherry and GFP for each cell. The normalization measurements were carried out in the same regions for mCherry and GFP in a single cell, by applying the defined region of interest for the bleached region, total cell nucleus, and a random region outside the cell for background subtraction, saved using ImageJ ROI manager to both channels. The fluorescence recovery data for GFP- and ChFP-tagged H1 proteins were obtained by plotting the normalized relative fluorescence intensity versus time. The t50 values for both were obtained by fitting their normalized recovery curves to a single exponential equation (Origin 6.1; OriginLab) as described previously (35Phair R.D. Gorski S.A. Misteli T. Measurement of dynamic protein binding to chromatin in vivo, using photobleaching microscopy.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and the relative ratios of the t50 values were calculated. The data sets from at least eight random cells from a pool of three independent cell lines were averaged to obtain the final quantitative values. A bicistronic expression vector containing an internal ribosome entry site was constructed to co-express two linker histone-fluorescent protein hybrids (Fig. 1a). The spectrally distinct fluorescent markers ChFP and GFP can be monitored independently and simultaneously in a single cell (Fig. 1b). Stable cell lines expressing linker histone proteins encoded by the bicistronic vector were established in murine BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast cells. These proteins are expressed at similar levels and comprise less than 5% of the total H1 population (supplemental Fig. S3). Dual color FRAP analysis was performed, and the binding affinity of individual proteins was estimated from the t50 value obtained by fitting their normalized recovery curves to a single exponential equation (35Phair R.D. Gorski S.A. Misteli T. Measurement of dynamic protein binding to chromatin in vivo, using photobleaching microscopy.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We limited the analysis to the first 150 s of recovery to focus on the highly mobile fraction of H1 that constitutes more than 75% of the total linker histone pool (16Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Dynamic binding of histone H1 to chromatin in living cells.Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 36Raghuram N. Carrero G. Stasevich T.J.

Core histone hyperacetylation impacts cooperative behavior and high-affinity binding of histone H1 to chromatin.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4420-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To validate the dual color FRAP approach, proof-of-principle constructs were made in which we systematically switched the position of expression of WT and mutant linker histone proteins and their fluorescent tags in the vector (Fig. 2). The mutant proteins contained a K73A mutation within the globular domain of histone H10. This residue is critical for binding, and the mutation to alanine results in faster recovery kinetics of H10 (7Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Mapping the interaction surface of linker histone H10 with the nucleosome of native chromatin in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Dual color FRAP experiments with WT H10-ChFP co-expressed with WT H10-GFP displayed overlapping recovery kinetics with similar t50 values of ∼ 28 s (Fig. 2a and Table 1). Similarly, mutant proteins H10(K73A)-ChFP and H10(K73A)-GFP had nearly identical t50 values of ∼16 s (Fig. 2b and Table 1). Thus, identical forms of H1 proteins fused with GFP or ChFP showed similar t50 values, indicating that the binding kinetics of these proteins is not appreciably affected by the type of fluorescent tag. Simultaneous FRAP analysis of H10(K73A)-GFP and WT H10-ChFP (Fig. 2c and Table 1) or of H10(K73A)-ChFP and WT H10-GFP (Fig. 2d and Table 1) displayed recovery kinetics for the mutant and WT proteins similar to that obtained with vectors expressing only mutant or only WT proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that neither the position of the protein within the vector nor the fluorescent tag significantly affects the binding behavior. The results also indicate that expression of a mutant protein at the low levels used in these assays does not affect the binding of the WT protein (37Yellajoshyula D. Brown D.T. Global modulation of chromatin dynamics mediated by dephosphorylation of linker histone H1 is necessary for erythroid differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18568-18573Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data reveals some distinct advantages of the dual color FRAP approach. The t50 values obtained for any given protein vary considerably as noted by the standard deviations. However, the ratios of the values obtained for two proteins in a single cell display much less variability (supplemental Fig. S4) as is shown by the coefficients of variability, which are much lower for the ratios. Thus, the experimental system provides stringent internal controls for biological and instrumentation variability inherent in quantitative FRAP experiments. Additionally, the design allows the application of paired Student's t tests for statistical analysis that can reduce the number of replicates needed for accurate determination of significant differences.TABLE 1Quantitative analyses validating the dual color FRAP approachConstructt50aThe values for t50 were determined as previously described (35).

WT H10-ChFP recovered with a t50 of ∼30 s, whereas WT H1c-GFP had a t50 of ∼23 s. The reciprocal construct generated essentially identical results (Fig. 3b and Table 2).

https://openalex.org/W2088307305,"The herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein is important for the expression and nuclear export of viral mRNAs. Although several binding sites have been mapped along the ICP27 sequence for various RNA and protein partners, including the transport receptor TAP of the host cell nuclear transport machinery, several aspects of ICP27 trafficking through the nuclear pore complex remain unclear. We investigated if ICP27 could interact directly with the nuclear pore complex itself, finding that ICP27 directly binds the core nucleoporin Nup62. This is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays with purified components. Mapping with ICP27 deletion and point mutants further shows that the interaction requires sequences in both the N and C termini of ICP27. Expression of wild type ICP27 protein inhibited both classical, importin α/β-dependent and transportin-dependent nuclear import. In contrast, an ICP27 point mutant that does not interact with Nup62 had no such inhibitory effect. We suggest that ICP27 association with Nup62 provides additional binding sites at the nuclear pore for ICP27 shuttling, thus supporting ICP27-mediated transport. We propose that ICP27 competes with some host cell transport receptors for binding, resulting in inhibition of those host transport pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2059244672,"Processing of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins by the HIV-1 protease (PR) is essential for the production of infectious particles. However, the determinants governing the rates of processing of these substrates are not clearly understood. We studied the effect of substrate context on processing by utilizing a novel protease assay in which a substrate containing HIV-1 matrix (MA) and the N-terminal domain of capsid (CA) is labeled with a FlAsH (fluorescein arsenical hairpin) reagent. When the seven cleavage sites within the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins were placed at the MA/CA site, the rates of cleavage changed dramatically compared with that of the cognate sites in the natural context reported previously. The rate of processing was affected the most for three sites: CA/spacer peptide 1 (SP1) (≈10-fold increase), SP1/nucleocapsid (NC) (≈10-30-fold decrease), and SP2/p6 (≈30-fold decrease). One of two multidrug-resistant (MDR) PR variants altered the pattern of processing rates significantly. Cleavage sites within the Pro-Pol region were cleaved in a context-independent manner, suggesting for these sites that the sequence itself was the determinant of rate. In addition, a chimera consisting of SP1/NC P4-P1 and MA/CA P1'-P4' residues (ATIM↓PIVQ) abolished processing by wild type and MDR proteases, and the reciprocal chimera consisting of MA/CA P4-P1 and SP1/NC P1'-4' (SQNY↓IQKG) was cleaved only by one of the MDR proteases. These results suggest that complex substrate interactions both beyond the active site of the enzyme and across the scissile bond contribute to defining the rate of processing by the HIV-1 PR."
https://openalex.org/W2012706912,"Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from monoclonal antibodies tested as synthetic peptides display anti-infective and antitumor activities, independent of the specificity of the native antibody. Previously, we have shown that the synthetic peptide C7H2, based on the heavy chain CDR 2 from monoclonal antibody C7, a mAb directed to a mannoprotein of Candida albicans, significantly reduced B16F10 melanoma growth and lung colony formation by triggering tumor apoptosis. The mechanism, however, by which C7H2 induced apoptosis in tumor cells remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that C7H2 interacts with components of the tumor cells cytoskeleton, being rapidly internalized after binding to the tumor cell surface. Mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro validation revealed that β-actin is the receptor of C7H2 in the tumor cells. C7H2 induces β-actin polymerization and F-actin stabilization, linked with abundant generation of superoxide anions and apoptosis. Major phenotypes following peptide binding were chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, annexin V binding, lamin disruption, caspase 8 and 3 activation, and organelle alterations. Finally, we evaluated the cytotoxic efficacy of C7H2 in a panel of human tumor cell lines. All tumor cell lines studied were equally susceptible to C7H2 in vitro. The C7H2 amide without further derivatization significantly reduced lung metastasis of mice endovenously challenged with B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. No significant cytotoxicity was observed toward nontumorigenic cell lines on short incubation in vitro or in naïve mice injected with a high dose of the peptide. We believe that C7H2 is a promising peptide to be developed as an anticancer drug."
https://openalex.org/W2081167014,"Most human tumors are not eliminated by the immune system, and therapeutic vaccination shows poor results, a fact that can be explained at least partially by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that is abundant in galectin-3. On cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones, maintained in culture by regular stimulation, recently activated CTLs present low effector functions. However, these functions are restored after a short treatment with LacNAc. The latter, which is in agreement with the glycoprotein-galectin lattice concept involving reduced motility, poses the question why galectin-3 ligands improve effector functions. We employed ultrasensitive MALDI-TOF-MS on resting and recently activated CTL clones combined with various glycosidase digestions and GC-MS linkage analyses. Our results showed that compared with the resting CTLs, the N-glycans of the recently activated CTLs consisted of (i) larger LacNAc oligomers of which a significant portion was longer than four-units and (ii) more multi-antennary structures. Interestingly, our results showed that the poly-LacNAc appeared to be equally distributed on all available N-glycan branches and not selectively enriched on a specific branch. The above structural alterations in the recently activated CTLs are expected to increase the galectin-3-LacNAc lattices and multivalent interactions and, therefore, reduce the motility of surface glycoproteins, such as the T-cell receptor. These findings suggest that the loss of effector functions on CTLs may be linked to reduced motility of surface glycoproteins. In addition, our results showed that recently activated CTLs had a reduced abundance of NeuAcα2,6-linked N-glycans and an increased abundance of disialylated core 1 and monosialylated core 2 O-glycan structures."

Here, we show that HPK1-deficient B cells display hyper-proliferation and hyper-activation of IκB kinase and MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) upon the ligation of BCR. HPK1 attenuates BCR-induced cell activation via inducing BLNK threonine 152 phosphorylation, which mediates BLNK/14-3-3 binding. Furthermore, threonine 152-phosphorylated BLNK is ubiquitinated at lysine residues 37, 38, and 42, leading to attenuation of MAPK and IκB kinase activation in B cells during BCR signaling. These results reveal a novel negative feedback regulation of BCR signaling by HPK1-mediated phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of the activated BLNK."

The high resolution structure of this domain has not been determined, and this lack of information has hindered structure-function analysis. In the current study, a coupled computational experimental approach was employed to correlate changes in cTnT dynamics to basic function using the regulated in vitro motility assay (R-IVM). An in silico approach to calculate forces in terms of a bending coordinate was used to precisely identify decreases in bending forces at residues 105 and 106 within the proposed cTnT ""hinge"" region. Significant functional changes were observed in multiple functional properties, including a decrease in the cooperativity of calcium activation, the calcium sensitivity of sliding speed, and maximum sliding speed. Correlation of the computational and experimental findings revealed an association between TNT1 flexibility and the cooperativity of thin filament calcium activation where an increase in flexibility led to a decrease in cooperativity. Further analysis of the primary sequence of the TNT1 region revealed a unique pattern of conserved charged TNT1 residues altered by the R92W and R92L mutations and may represent the underlying ""structure"" modulating this central functional domain. These data provide a framework for further integrated in silico/in vitro approaches that may be extended into a high-throughput predictive screen to overcome the current structural limitations in linking molecular phenotype to genotype in thin filament cardiomyopathies."

Epidermis is stratified epithelia and lamellar granules (LGs) are secreted from the stratum granulosum (SG) in a sequential manner. Previously, continuous TJs and paracellular permeability barriers were found in the second layer (SG2) of SG in mice, but their fate and correlation with LG secretion have been poorly understood. We studied epidermal TJ-related structures in humans and in mice and found occludin/ZO-1 immunoreactive multilayered networks spanning the first layer of SG (SG1) and SG2. Paracellular penetration tracer passed through some TJs in SG2, but not in SG1. LG secretion into the paracellular tracer positive spaces started below the level of TJs of SG1.

It consists of a proteolytic core particle and two 19 S regulatory particles (RPs) composed of 6 ATPase (Rpt) and 13 non-ATPase (Rpn) subunits. Multiple proteasome-dedicated chaperones facilitate the assembly of the proteasome, but little is known about the detailed mechanisms. Hsm3, a 19 S RP dedicated chaperone, transiently binds to the C-terminal domain of the Rpt1 subunit and forms a tetrameric complex, Hsm3-Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpn1, during maturation of the ATPase ring of 19 S RP. To elucidate the structural basis of Hsm3 function, we determined the crystal structures of Hsm3 and its complex with the C-terminal domain of the Rpt1 subunit (Rpt1C). Hsm3 has a C-shaped structure that consists of 11 HEAT repeats. The structure of the Hsm3-Rpt1C complex revealed that the interacting surface between Hsm3 and Rpt1 is a hydrophobic core and a complementary charged surface. Mutations in the Hsm3-Rpt1 surface resulted in the assembly defect of the 26 S proteasome. Furthermore, a structural model of the Hsm3-Rpt ring complex and an in vitro binding assay suggest that Hsm3 can bind Rpt2 in addition to Rpt1. Collectively, our results provide the structural basis of the molecular functions of Hsm3 for the RP assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2090269572,"UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) is a flavin-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-Galp) to UDP-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf). As in prokaryotic UGMs, the flavin needs to be reduced for the enzyme to be active. Here we present the first eukaryotic UGM structures from Aspergillus fumigatus (AfUGM). The structures are of UGM alone, with the substrate UDP-Galp and with the inhibitor UDP. Additionally, we report the structures of AfUGM bound to substrate with oxidized and reduced flavin. These structures provide insight into substrate recognition and structural changes observed upon substrate binding involving the mobile loops and the critical arginine residues Arg-182 and Arg-327. Comparison with prokaryotic UGM reveals that despite low sequence identity with known prokaryotic UGMs the overall fold is largely conserved. Structural differences between prokaryotic UGM and AfUGM result from inserts in AfUGM. A notable difference from prokaryotic UGMs is that AfUGM contains a third flexible loop (loop III) above the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring that changes position depending on the redox state of the flavin cofactor. This loop flipping has not been observed in prokaryotic UGMs. In addition we have determined the crystals structures and steady-state kinetic constants of the reaction catalyzed by mutants R182K, R327K, R182A, and R327A. These results support our hypothesis that Arg-182 and Arg-327 play important roles in stabilizing the position of the diphosphates of the nucleotide sugar and help to facilitate the positioning of the galactose moiety for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1977954648,"Serpins are remarkable and unique proteins in being able to spontaneously fold into a metastable conformation without the aid of a chaperone or prodomain. This metastable conformation is essential for inhibition of proteinases, so that massive serpin conformational change, driven by the favorable energetics of relaxation of the metastable conformation to the more stable one, can kinetically trap the proteinase-serpin acylenzyme intermediate. Failure to direct folding to the metastable conformation would lead to inactive, latent serpin. How serpins fold into such a metastable state is unknown. Using the ability of component peptides from the serpin α(1)PI to associate, we have now elucidated the pathway by which this serpin efficiently folds into its metastable state. In addition we have established the likely structure of the polymerogenic intermediate of the Z variant of α(1)PI."
https://openalex.org/W2091095502,"Naturally occurring germ line mutations in the X-linked human androgen receptor (AR) gene cause incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia by disrupting AR function in males with androgen insensitivity syndrome. Almost all AR missense mutations that cause androgen insensitivity syndrome are located in the highly structured DNA and ligand binding domains. In this report we investigate the functional defect associated with an AR exon 1 missense mutation, R405S, that caused partial androgen insensitivity. The 46,XX heterozygous maternal carrier had a wild-type Arg-405 CGC allele but transmitted an AGC mutant allele coding for Ser-405. At birth, the 46,XY proband had a bifid scrotum, hypospadias, and micropenis consistent with clinical stage 3 partial androgen insensitivity. Androgen-dependent transcriptional activity of AR-R405S expressed in CV1 cells was less than wild-type AR and refractory in androgen-dependent AR NH(2)- and carboxyl interaction transcription assays that depend on the coregulator effects of melanoma antigen-A11. This mutation created a Ser-405 phosphorylation site evident by the gel migration of an AR-R405S NH(2)-terminal fragment as a double band that converted to the wild-type single band after treatment with λ-phosphatase. Detrimental effects of the R405S mutation were related to the proximity of the AR WXXLF motif (433)WHTLF(437) required for melanoma antigen-A11 and p300 to stimulate transcriptional activity associated with the AR NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction. We conclude that the coregulator effects of melanoma antigen-A11 on the AR NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction amplify the androgen-dependent transcriptional response to p300 required for normal human male sex development in utero."
https://openalex.org/W1978585714,"A growing body of evidence attributes properties of chemo- and/or radiation-resistance to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Moreover, non-targeted delayed effects such as genomic instability, transmitted through many generations, can be observed in the progeny of surviving irradiated cells. As a consequence, we propose that radiation-resistance properties associated to CSCs could confer a key role to this subpopulation in the transmission of genomic instability. To test this hypothesis, we searched the CSC markers associated to radiation-resistance in breast cancer cell lines and studied the role of the resistant cells in the transmission of genomic instability. First, we show that irradiation induces a 2–4 weeks period of intense cell death leading to the emergence of chromosomal unstable cells during more than 35 population doublings. Then, among seven breast CSC markers, we identify CD24−/low labelling as a marker of radiation-resistance. We demonstrate that CD24+ progeny of irradiated cells exclusively descends from CD24−/low cells. Finally, we show that delayed chromosomal instability is only expressed by CD24+ cells, but is transmitted by stable surviving CD24−/low cells. So, for the first time a CSC marker, CD24, is associated with the transmission of genomic instability. This work may assign a new deleterious role to breast CSCs in aggressive recurrence after radiotherapy, as the transmitted genomic instability potentially leads tumour cells to acquire more aggressive characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2018818254,"An aptamer targeting factor IXa has been evaluated in animal models and several clinical studies as a potential antithombotic therapy. We elucidate the molecular mechanism by which this aptamer acts as an anticoagulant. The aptamer binds tightly to factor IXa and prolongs the clotting time of human plasma. The aptamer completely blocks factor IXa activation of factor X regardless of the presence of factor VIIIa. However, the aptamer does not completely block small synthetic substrate cleavage, although it does slow the rate of cleavage. These data are consistent with the aptamer binding to the catalytic domain of factor IXa in such a way as to block an extended substrate-binding site. Therefore, unlike small molecule inhibitors, aptamers appear to be able to bind surfaces surrounding an active site and thereby sterically interfere with enzyme activity. Thus, aptamers may be useful agents to probe and block substrate-binding sites outside of the active site of an enzyme.

Currently, heparin is widely used as an antithrombotic; it is a potent anticoagulant that targets multiple activated factors in the coagulation cascade (2Bauer K.A. Selective inhibition of coagulation factors: advances in antithrombotic therapy.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2002; 28 (015–024)PubMed Google Scholar). However, heparin therapy can be associated with bleeding as well as complications such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (3Yavari M. Becker R.C. Anticoagulant therapy during cardiopulmonary bypass.J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 2008; 26: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Heparin is not alone in this respect, and in general, current therapies represent a balance between the risk of thrombosis without treatment and the risk of bleeding due to treatment (4Millar J.A. Rational thromboprophylaxis in medical inpatients: not quite there yet.Med. J. Aust. 2008; 189: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One approach to reducing complications and improving antithrombotic therapy is to selectively target a specific coagulation protein (2Bauer K.A. Selective inhibition of coagulation factors: advances in antithrombotic therapy.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2002; 28 (015–024)PubMed Google Scholar). Factor IX is an attractive target for antithrombotic therapy. It participates in the propagation phase of coagulation; after activation by either factor XIa or the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex, factor IXa binds to factor VIIIa on a platelet surface and activates factor X. Two studies have suggested that the primary effect of heparin on prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 2The abbreviations used are: aPTTactivated partial thromboplastin timeDEGR-CKdansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone. is through blocking factor IXa activation of factor X (5McNeely T.B.

Studies in dogs and baboons showed that when active site-inhibited factor IXa is used as an anticoagulant in place of heparin, the extracorporeal circuit remains free of fibrin deposition, and intraoperative blood loss is significantly diminished relative to the standard heparin protocol (7Spanier T.B.

An emerging class of therapeutics is the folded nucleic acid structures called aptamers (10Tuerk C. Gold L.

Aptamers are small single-stranded oligonucleotides that fold into a specific three-dimensional shape that is assembled upon a secondary structure derived from multiple hydrogen-bonded base pairs. The surfaces on these molecular shapes can bind to complementary molecular surfaces on their target (13Long S.B. Long M.B. White R.R. Sullenger B.A. Crystal structure of an RNA aptamer bound to thrombin.RNA. 2008; 14: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This complementary shape binding is similar to the types of interactions observed between antibody-antigen pairs, and it allows aptamers to bind to proteins that do not naturally recognize nucleic acids (14Nimjee S.M. Rusconi C.P. Sullenger B.A. Aptamers: an emerging class of therapeutics.Annu. Rev. Med. 2005; 56: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Because aptamer binding is very dependent on the internal hydrogen-bonded base pairs, the three-dimensional structure of the aptamer can be disrupted with an appropriately chosen oligonucleotide that can interrupt such base pairing. Application of this concept led us to develop the idea of therapeutic aptamers generated in concert with antidote oligonucleotides (15Rusconi C.P. Scardino E. Layzer J. Pitoc G.A. Ortel T.L.

Applying the aptamer-antidote principles to the question of targeted antithrombotics, we have developed an aptamer (9.3t) targeted against factor IXa (15Rusconi C.P. Scardino E. Layzer J. Pitoc G.A.

This aptamer can prolong the clotting time (aPTT) of normal human plasma; at saturating levels of aptamer, the aPTT was prolonged to the values seen in hemophilia B (factor IX-deficient) plasma. In a porcine model of cardiopulmonary bypass, this aptamer controlled thrombin generation better than heparin and was able to maintain patency in the bypass circuit for 30 min when used instead of heparin as an anticoagulant (17Nimjee S.M.

Moreover, recently, an optimized version of this aptamer was able to replace heparin as the anticoagulant in a phase 2a clinical trial in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (22Cohen M.G.

Currently, a large ∼800-person phase 2b study is under way to further evaluate the aptamer and its matched antidote in this patient population. The studies presented here were initiated to identify the mechanisms by which this anti-factor IXa aptamer acts as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic. Factor Xa substrate (Pefachrome® FXa) was from Pentapharm (Basel, Switzerland), as was factor IXa substrate (Pefachrome® FIXa3960, H-d-Leu-phenylglycine-Arg-p-nitroanilide acetate). Cleavage of Pefachrome FIXa was not enhanced by ethylene glycol. Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-CK) was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-factor IX antibodies were purchased from Affinity Biologicals (Ancaster, Ontario, Canada). Unless indicated otherwise, all reactions were run in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml ovalbumin. Factor IX was isolated from plasma by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose eluted with NaCl, heparin-Sepharose eluted with NaCl, copper-loaded iminodiacetic acid (metal chelate)-Sepharose eluted with glycine, and HiTrap Q eluted with CaCl2 at a fixed NaCl concentration (pseudo-affinity). It was converted to factor IXa with a 1:200 molar ratio of factor XIa (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) as described previously and repurified by pseudo-affinity chromatography (23McCord D.M.

Roberts Comprehensive Hemophilia Diagnostic and Treatment Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Factor X was isolated from plasma by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose eluted with NaCl, heparin-Sepharose eluted with NaCl, hydroxylapatite eluted with phosphate, and HiTrap Q eluted with CaCl2 at a fixed NaCl concentration (pseudo-affinity). Antithrombin was isolated from plasma on heparin-Sepharose as described previously (24Griffith M.J. Noyes C.M. Church F.C.

Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Large unilamellar vesicles containing 15% phosphatidylserine, 41% phosphatidylcholine, 44% phosphatidylethanolamine were prepared by extrusion (25Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim.

Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Before all assays, the aptamer was refolded by heating to 65 °C for 5 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. The aptamer is designated 9.3t (15Rusconi C.P. Scardino E. Layzer J. Pitoc G.A. Ortel T.L. Monroe D. Sullenger B.A. RNA aptamers as reversible antagonists of coagulation factor IXa.Nature. 2002; 419: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The aptamer 9.3tM was used as a control; it differs from 9.3t by only 2 bases but does not bind factor IX (15Rusconi C.P. Scardino E. Layzer J. Pitoc G.A. Ortel T.L. Monroe D. Sullenger B.A. RNA aptamers as reversible antagonists of coagulation factor IXa.Nature. 2002; 419: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The aptamer was dephosphorylated using bacterial alkaline phosphatase and 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Citrated human plasma was purchased from King George Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). aPTTs were performed in a Diagnostica Stago ST4 coagulometer using TriniCLOT aPTT S reagent (Trinity Biotech) with aptamer-treated plasma for 5 min before initiating clotting with TriniCLOT aPTT S (0.02 m CaCl2). Factor IX (5 μm) was incubated with aptamer 9.3t (6 μm) for 30 min before addition of 25 nm factor XIa. At timed intervals, samples were removed into SDS buffer with 1% mercaptoethanol and heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were run on a 10–15% PhastGel and stained with silver stain. Band intensity was determined using the NIH program ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Factor IX (1 μm) was incubated with aptamer 9.3t (5 μm) for 30 min before addition of 2 nm factor VIIa with 1 nm relipidated recombinant human tissue factor. At timed intervals, samples were removed into SDS buffer (with or without 1% mercaptoethanol) and heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were run on a 10–15% PhastGel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and blotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-factor IX antibodies. The presence of anti-factor IX antibodies was detected with IRDye 680-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies and visualized on a LI-COR ODYSSEY system. The fraction activated is the proportion of the staining in each lane found in the factor IXa band (unreduced) or the heavy chain (reduced) Western blots. The rate of factor IX activation (k) was determined by fitting the data to Equation 1. Intensity=Intensitymax1−e −kt(Eq. 1) For assays with factor VIIIa, factor IXa (0.6 nm) was incubated with varied concentrations of 9.3t or 9.3tM. Factor VIIIa (1.4 nm) with 80 μm lipid was added, reducing the factor IXa concentration to 0.4 nm, and incubated for 3 min before addition of factor X and factor X substrate. Final concentrations in the assay were 0.2 nm factor IXa, 0.7 nm factor VIIIa, 40 μm lipid, 135 nm factor X, and 0.5 mm factor X substrate. Factor X activation was monitored by substrate cleavage, and data were analyzed to determine the initial rate as described previously (28Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Briet E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L. Roberts H.R. Characterization of the clotting activities of structurally different forms of activated factor IX. Enzymatic properties of normal human factor IXaα, factor IXaβ, and activated factor IX Chapel Hill.J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For assays with preformed factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex, 0.4 nm factor IXa was incubated with 1.4 nm factor VIIIa and 80 μm lipid for 3 min before addition of aptamer for 1 min. Factor X and factor Xa substrate were added to give the same final concentrations as described above. For assays without factor VIIIa, 6 or 12 nm factor IXa was incubated with aptamer 9.3t or 9.3tM for 15 min before being added to factor X, lipid, and factor Xa substrate. Final concentrations were 3 or 6 nm factor IXa, 150 μm factor X, 50 μm lipid, and 0.5 mm factor X substrate. Factor X activation was monitored as described above. Factor IXa (400 nm) was incubated with varied concentrations of aptamer 9.3t or 9.3tM before being added to H-d-Leu-phenylglycine-Arg-p-nitroanilide acetate (Pefachrome FIXa3960) to give final concentrations of 200 nm factor IXa, the indicated concentration of the aptamer, and 0.5 mm substrate. The substrate is a peptide sequence attached to a p-nitroanilide group. Cleavage of the substrate released a p-nitroaniline group; appearance was monitored at 405 nm. Substrate cleavage was monitored for 10 min, during which time the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was linear. Background hydrolysis of the substrate was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm in the absence of factor IXa but in the presence of aptamer. Factor IXa binding to aptamer 9.3t is an equilibrium reaction as shown in Equation 2. IXa+9.3t⇄KdIXa-9.3t(Eq. 2) The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is defined as shown in Equation 3. Kd=[|Xa][9.3t][|Xa−9.3t](Eq. 3) The terms for free factor IXa and free aptamer 9.3t are rewritten in terms of [IXa-9.3t], total factor IXa ([IXa]t), and total aptamer ([9.3t]t) as shown in Equation 4. Kd[|Xa−9.3t]=[|Xa] t−[|Xa−9.3t][9.3t] t−[|Xa−9.3t](Eq. 4) Because the concentration of the IXa-9.3t complex cannot be assumed to be small relative to the total concentration of the aptamer, the equation has to be evaluated without simplifying assumptions. Rearranging gives Equation 5. 0=[|Xa] [[9.3t] t−Kd+[|Xa] t+[9.3t] t[|Xa−9.3t]+[|Xa−9.3t] 2(Eq. 5) Solving for the concentration of the IXa-9.3t complex gives Equation 6. [IXa−9.3t]=Kd+[IXa] t+[9.3t] t2−Kd+[IXa] t+[9.3t] t2−4[IXa] t[9.3t] t2(Eq. 6) Because factor IXa in complex with the aptamer is inactive, the activity is proportional to the amount of free factor IXa as shown in Equation 7. rate=rate0∗∣Xafree(Eq. 7) Activity expressed as the relative rate is given by Equation 8. raterate0=IXat−[IX−9.3t](Eq. 8) Substituting Equation 5 into Equation 7 gives Equation 9. 1−Kd+[IXa] t+[9.3t] t2[IXa] t−Kd+[IXa] t+[9.3t] t2−4[IXa] t[9.3t] t2[IXa] t(Eq. 9) As reported previously (15Rusconi C.P. Scardino E. Layzer J. Pitoc G.A. Ortel T.L. Monroe D. Sullenger B.A. RNA aptamers as reversible antagonists of coagulation factor IXa.Nature. 2002; 419: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), the ability of aptamer 9.3t to prolong clotting was studied by adding varied concentrations of the aptamer to plasma and then measuring the aPTT. Aptamer 9.3t, but not a mutant version of the aptamer (9.3tM), dose-dependently prolonged the aPTT of plasma (Fig. 1). The aPTT reached values seen in hemophilic human plasma (29Telgt D.S. Macik B.G. McCord D.M. Monroe D.M. Roberts H.R. Mechanism by which recombinant factor VIIa shortens the aPTT: activation of factor X in the absence of tissue factor.Thromb. Res. 1989; 56: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of aptamer 9.3t to protein was measured using a double-filter binding assay as described previously (30Wong I. Lohman T.M. A double-filter method for nitrocellulose-filter binding: application to protein-nucleic acid interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). A fixed concentration of radiolabeled aptamer 9.3t was incubated with varied protein concentrations and then added to membrane. Aptamer bound to protein was captured on the (top) nitrocellulose membrane. Unbound aptamer passed through and was captured by the (bottom) nylon membrane. Counts associated with protein were expressed as a percentage of the total counts (nitrocellulose capture + nylon capture). Aptamer 9.3t binding to factor IX was similar to that to factor IXa (Fig. 2); this is consistent with a previous study that used surface plasmon resonance to show that the aptamer binds with similar affinity to factors IX and IXa (31Gopinath S.C. Shikamoto Y. Mizuno H. Kumar P.K. A potent anticoagulant RNA aptamer inhibits blood coagulation by specifically blocking the extrinsic clotting pathway.Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutant aptamer 9.3tM did not bind to either factor IX or IXa. Because aptamer 9.3t bound both factors IX and IXa, we first examined if the aptamer would inhibit activation of factor IX by factor XIa. The aptamer did not change factor XIa activation of factor IX (Fig. 3A). We also examined factor IX activation by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. The aptamer decreased the rate of factor IX activation to ∼50% of the rate seen in its absence (Fig. 3B). Because factor IXa activity was increased by >2000-fold when it associated with its cofactor, factor VIIIa, we evaluated if the aptamer could inhibit the activity of the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex. Factor IXa was incubated with varied concentrations of aptamer 9.3t or mutant aptamer 9.3tM for 20 min at room temperature. Factor IXa activity was assessed by adding factor VIIIa with lipid and incubating for 3 min before adding factor X and factor Xa substrate. Aptamer 9.3t, but not mutant aptamer 9.3tM, inhibited factor X activation by the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). Based upon this inhibition, the affinity of the aptamer for factor IXa was calculated to be 0.16 nm. To determine whether the aptamer was interfering with formation of the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex, factor IXa was incubated with factor VIIIa and lipid for 3 min before addition of the aptamer for 1 min. Factor X and factor Xa substrate were then added to give the same final concentrations as before. Even though the incubation times were shorter, the aptamer was not less effective at inhibiting factor X activation (Fig. 4A) and may have been more effective (calculated affinity of 0.07 nm). This suggests that the aptamer is not competing with factor VIIIa for factor IXa binding. We next sought to determine whether the aptamer could inhibit factor IXa in the absence of factor VIIIa. Factor IXa activity in the absence of factor VIIIa was determined by activating factor X using lipid vesicles as the surface. Two concentrations of factor IXa were incubated with varied concentrations of either aptamer 9.3t or 9.3tM (Fig. 4B). A dose-dependent decrease in factor X activation was observed. Here, the apparent affinity of the aptamer for factor IXa was 0.9 nm in the absence of factor VIIIa. We next wanted to determine whether the aptamer would interfere with the ability of antithrombin to inhibit factor IXa function. Factor IXa (1 μm) was incubated with 2 μm aptamer 9.3t or 9.3tM for 15 min. Antithrombin (20 μm) was added, and formation of the factor IXa-antithrombin complex was monitored by sampling into SDS buffer and heating to 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were run on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane for Western blotting. Aptamer 9.3t blocked formation of factor IXa-antithrombin complexes for at least 12 h (Fig. 5). Thus, the aptamer inhibits antithrombin from inactivating factor IXa. To further elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we next determined if the aptamer could inhibit cleavage of small synthetic substrates. Factor IXa was incubated with varied concentrations of aptamer 9.3t or 9.3tM before being added to synthetic substrate. As expected, increasing concentrations of aptamer 9.3t decreased the rate of substrate cleavage. Unexpectedly, substrate cleavage did not go to zero; even when the aptamer was in a molar excess to factor IXa, ∼10% residual substrate cleavage remained (Fig. 6A). We next examined the ability of the aptamer to inhibit an active site probe from binding to factor IXa. DEGR-CK can incorporate into the active site of factor IXa (32Lollar P. Fass D.N. Inhibition of activated porcine factor IX by dansyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Incorporation can be measured as a change in the fluorescent environment of the dansyl group. The chloromethyl ketone group is smaller than the p-nitroanilide group of the chromogenic substrate. Factor IXa (200 nm) was incubated with aptamer 9.3t or 9.3tM (400 nm) in the absence of calcium for 15 min before addition of 20 μm DEGR-CK. Incorporation was monitored by following the fluorescence at 490 nm (excitation at 330 nm). Data were fit to Equation 10. F=Fo+Fmax1−e−k∗t(Eq. 10) Aptamer decreased Fmax, and although it did not completely block incorporation of DEGR-CK into the active site (Fig. 6B), aptamer 9.3t did decrease the rate to ∼30% of that observed with the mutant aptamer (from 3.2 to 1.1 s−1). Functionally, factor IXa binds to factor VIIIa on a surface and converts factor X to factor Xa. Interfering with any of those functions, including lipid binding, factor VIIIa binding, or factor X cleavage, can block factor IXa activity. When the aptamer was incubated with factor IXa, factor VIIIa-dependent activation of factor X on a lipid surface was blocked in a dose-dependent fashion. The data could be fitted to a model in which the aptamer bound to factor IXa with a Kd of ∼0.2 nm. This compares tolerably well to values of 0.6 nm measured in a double-filter binding assay and 0.9 nm determined from factor IXa cleavage of factor X in the absence of factor VIIIa. Taken together, these values are in reasonable agreement with a previous publication that used surface plasmon resonance to measure a dissociation constant of ∼0.4 nm (31Gopinath S.C. Shikamoto Y. Mizuno H. Kumar P.K. A potent anticoagulant RNA aptamer inhibits blood coagulation by specifically blocking the extrinsic clotting pathway.Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Monitoring the complete time course of factor IX activation showed that the aptamer did not alter factor IX activation by factor XIa. The aptamer did reduce factor IX activation by factor VIIa-tissue factor to ∼50% of the rate seen in its absence. This result was somewhat surprising given that, in a previous study, Gopinath et al. (31Gopinath S.C. Shikamoto Y. Mizuno H. Kumar P.K. A potent anticoagulant RNA aptamer inhibits blood coagulation by specifically blocking the extrinsic clotting pathway.Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported a greater inhibition of factor IX activation by factor VIIa-tissue factor. The relative difference in our conclusions may arise from differences in the conditions used in the assays. We used 1 nm tissue factor with 2 nm factor VIIa and a ratio of factor IX to factor VIIa-tissue factor of 1000:1, and we monitored the reaction for up to 120 min by Western blotting so that the presence of other proteins did not interfere. Gopinath et al. used less tissue factor (0.5 nm) with more factor VIIa (800 nm) and a ratio of factor IX to factor VIIa-tissue factor of 17,400:1, and they assessed at a 30-min time point by Coomassie Blue staining. The loss of factor IX could not be easily assessed because the tissue factor reagent ran at the same place on the gel as factor IX. If staining of the cleavage product were not linear at low concentrations of protein, then the reduced rate of activation that we observed would not be inconsistent with the results of Gopinath et al. given the differences in methodology. To determine whether the aptamer was interfering with factor IXa binding to factor VIIIa, the complex of factors IXa and VIIIa was allowed to form, and the aptamer was then added immediately before the start of the assay. If the aptamer and factor VIIIa are competing for a binding site on factor IXa, then the aptamer should not bind as well to the preformed complex as it does to factor IXa alone. However, the aptamer was not any less effective at inhibiting the preformed factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex, which suggests that the aptamer interacts with factor IXa at a site different from the sites of factor VIIIa interaction. When factor VIIIa was removed from the reaction, the aptamer still blocked factor IXa activation of factor X, so the aptamer could be blocking either factor IXa binding to lipid or factor IXa binding to substrate. To help sort the two possibilities, a solution-phase reaction was studied. The aptamer blocked formation of a factor IXa-antithrombin complex for as long as 12 h. This result suggests that the aptamer acts by inhibiting substrate binding and cleavage rather than by inhibiting factor IXa binding to a surface. One possible explanation for these observations would be that the aptamer binds to factor IXa so as to block access to the active site. Thus, we were surprised to observe that the aptamer did not completely block factor IXa cleavage of synthetic substrate, although the rate was reduced to 10% of the initial value. Titrating the aptamer into factor IXa suggested that all of the factor IXa in the reaction was bound to the aptamer (as expected because the Kd for complex formation was <1 nm and the concentration of factor IXa was 200 nm). Furthermore, saturating concentrations of the aptamer were not able to completely block incorporation of DEGR-CK into the active site of factor IXa, although the rate was reduced. This result is consistent with the observation that no aptamers directed toward a proteolytic active site have yet been identified and suggests that an exosite necessary for macromolecular substrate binding is blocked. Exosites on coagulation proteins are important for providing the substrate specificity of those factors (33Bock P.E. Panizzi P. Verhamme I.M. Exosites in the substrate specificity of blood coagulation reactions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). There are a number of exosite inhibitors that target and can potently inhibit the function of many proteins in the coagulation cascade (33Bock P.E. Panizzi P. Verhamme I.M. Exosites in the substrate specificity of blood coagulation reactions.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An aptamer targeted to be an exosite inhibitor of thrombin completely blocks conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (34Nimjee S.M. Oney S. Volovyk Z. Bompiani K.M. Long S.B. Hoffman M. Sullenger B.A. Synergistic effect of aptamers that inhibit exosites 1 and 2 on thrombin.RNA. 2009; 15: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) but does not inhibit cleavage of a small molecular weight substrate (35Müller J. Freitag D. Mayer G. Pötzsch B. Anticoagulant characteristics of HD1–22, a bivalent aptamer that specifically inhibits thrombin and prothrombinase.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ixolaris, a protein from the salivary gland of ticks, binds to an exosite on factor Xa, and although it completely blocks factor Xa/Va activation of prothrombin, it enhances factor Xa cleavage of small synthetic substrates (36Monteiro R.Q. Rezaie A.R. Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Ixolaris: a factor Xa heparin-binding exosite inhibitor.Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A fusion of two peptides targeted to exosites of factor VIIa results in a molecule that completely inhibits factor X activation but only partially inhibits small substrate cleavage (37Roberge M. Santell L. Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Dwyer M.A. Lazarus R.A. A novel exosite on coagulation factor VIIa and its molecular interactions with a new class of peptide inhibitors.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Roberge M. Peek M. Kirchhofer D. Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. Fusion of two distinct peptide exosite inhibitors of factor VIIa.Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the action of aptamer 9.3t against factor IX behaved as an exosite inhibitor (completely blocked macromolecular substrate cleavage but only partially blocked small substrate interactions). To the best of our knowledge, this aptamer represents the first inhibitor that targets the extended substrate-binding site (exosite) of factor IXa. The mechanism of this aptamer can be distinguished from nitrophorin-2 because that molecule appears to block lipid binding, possibly through interaction with the light chain of factor IX (39Zhang Y. Ribeiro J.M. Guimarães J.A. Walsh P.N. Nitrophorin-2: a novel mixed-type reversible specific inhibitor of the intrinsic factor-X activating complex.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10681-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aptamer binding to a heavy chain site is consistent with the observed difference of factor XIa activation and factor VIIa-tissue factor activation. Factor XIa activation of factor IX is mediated in large part through factor XIa exosite interactions with the Gla domain of factor IX (40Aktimur A. Gabriel M.A. Gailani D. Toomey J.R. The factor IX γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain is involved in interactions between factor IX and factor XIa.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Ogawa T. Verhamme I.M. Sun M.F. Bock P.E. Gailani D. Exosite-mediated substrate recognition of factor IX by factor XIa. The factor XIa heavy chain is required for initial recognition of factor IX.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23523-23530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These interactions would not be changed by aptamer binding to the heavy chain. By contrast, the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex binds to the catalytic domain of its substrate to activate factor IX (42Chen S.W. Pellequer J.L. Schved J.F. Giansily-Blaizot M. Model of a ternary complex between activated factor VII, tissue factor, and factor IX.Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 43Hamaguchi N. Roberts H. Stafford D.W. Mutations in the catalytic domain of factor IX that are related to the subclass hemophilia Bm.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6324-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), so it is not unreasonable that aptamer binding to the catalytic domain (heavy chain) of factor IX might alter activation by factor VIIa-tissue factor. Among the macromolecular interactions blocked by the aptamer is factor IXa interaction with the natural inhibitor antithrombin. Although this might seem to argue against use of the aptamer in a clinical setting, data from preclinical studies on this molecule as well as from clinical studies of other active site inhibitors suggest otherwise. Active site inhibitors that, as a side effect, block antithrombin inactivation are currently available for thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa (rivaroxaban). With these inhibitors, the major adverse events are not thrombosis, which would be expected if factor Xa and thrombin are available because they are not inhibited, but rather the inhibitors are too effective, with bleeding, frequently major bleeding, being the dominant adverse effect (27Perka C. Preoperative versus postoperative initiation of thromboprophylaxis following major orthopedic surgery: safety and efficacy of postoperative administration supported by recent trials of new oral anticoagulants.Thromb. J. 2011; 9: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Early phase clinical studies with this aptamer have shown that it is effective, suggesting that the ability of the aptamer to block factor IXa activity outweighs any negative consequences of blocking antithrombin inhibition (21Chan M.Y. Cohen M.G. Dyke C.K. Myles S.K. Aberle L.G. Lin M. Walder J. Steinhubl S.R. Gilchrist I.C. Kleiman N.S. Vorchheimer D.A. Chronos N. Melloni C. Alexander J.H. Harrington R.A. Tonkens R.M. Becker R.C.

Phase 1b randomized study of antidote-controlled modulation of factor IXa activity in patients with stable coronary artery disease.Circulation. 2008; 117: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these data show that the factor IXa aptamer 9.3t blocks factor IXa interaction with macromolecular substrate but does not completely block interaction with small molecular weight active site probes. These results suggest 1) that aptamers may be particularly useful for probing extended surfaces on target proteins and for blocking substrate-binding exosites of enzymes and 2) that the factor IXa aptamer in clinical development acts as a potent anticoagulant in patients by inhibiting factor X binding to the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex."
https://openalex.org/W2140560371,"Apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is up-regulated in various cancer cells. Here, we present the crystal structure of human API5. API5 exhibits an elongated all α-helical structure. The N-terminal half of API5 is similar to the HEAT repeat and the C-terminal half is similar to the ARM (Armadillo-like) repeat. HEAT and ARM repeats have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the cellular roles of API5 may be to mediate protein-protein interactions. Various components of multiprotein complexes have been identified as API5-interacting protein partners, suggesting that API5 may act as a scaffold for multiprotein complexes. API5 exists as a monomer, and the functionally important heptad leucine repeat does not exhibit the predicted a dimeric leucine zipper. Additionally, Lys-251, which can be acetylated in cells, plays important roles in the inhibition of apoptosis under serum deprivation conditions. The acetylation of this lysine also affects the stability of API5 in cells."

In vitro, in addition to nucleating filaments, Spire can sever them and sequester actin monomers. Understanding how Spire is capable of these disparate functions and which are physiologically relevant is an important goal. To study severing, we examined the effect of Drosophila Spire on preformed filaments in bulk and single filament assays. We observed rapid depolymerization of actin filaments by Spire, which we conclude is largely due to its sequestration activity and enhanced by its weak severing activity. We also studied the solution and crystal structures of Spire-actin complexes. We find structural and functional differences between constructs containing four WH2 domains (Spir-ABCD) and two WH2 domains (Spir-CD) that may provide insight into the mechanisms of nucleation and sequestration. Intriguingly, we observed lateral interactions between actin monomers associated with Spir-ABCD, suggesting that the structures built by these four tandem WH2 domains are more complex than originally imagined. Finally, we propose that Spire-actin mixtures contain both nuclei and sequestration structures."
https://openalex.org/W2009769080,"Genome sequencing has revealed examples of horizontally transferred genes, but we still know little about how such genes are incorporated into their host genomes. We have previously reported the identification of a gene (flp) that appears to have entered the Hydra genome through horizontal transfer. Here we provide additional evidence in support of our original hypothesis that the transfer was from a unicellular organism, and we show that the transfer occurred in an ancestor of two medusozoan cnidarian species. In addition we show that the gene is part of a bicistronic operon in the Hydra genome. These findings identify a new animal phylum in which trans-spliced leader addition has led to the formation of operons, and define the requirements for evolution of an operon in Hydra. The identification of operons in Hydra also provides a tool that can be exploited in the construction of transgenic Hydra strains."
https://openalex.org/W2027337736,"The Glucocorticoid-Induced Tumor necrosis factor Receptor GITR, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, has been shown to be important in modulating immune responses in the context of T cell immunity. B lymphocytes also express GITR, but a role of GITR in humoral immunity has not been fully explored. To address this question, we performed studies to determine the kinetics of GITR expression on naïve and stimulated B cells and the capacity of B cells to develop and mount antibody responses in GITR(-/-) mice. Results of our studies indicate that all mature B cells express GITR on the cell surface, albeit at different levels. Expression of GITR on naïve mature B cells is upregulated by BCR signaling, but is counteracted by helper T cell-related factors and other inflammatory signals in vitro. In line with these findings, expression of GITR on germinal center and memory B cells is lower than that on naïve B cells. However, the expression of GITR is strongly upregulated in plasma cells. Despite these differences in GITR expression, the absence of GITR has no effect on T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antibody responses to model antigens in GITR(-/-) mice, or on B cell activation and proliferation in vitro. GITR deficiency manifests only with a slight reduction of mature B cell numbers and increased turnover of naïve B cells, suggesting that GITR slightly contributes to mature B cell homeostasis. Overall, our data indicate that GITR does not play a significant role in B cell development and antibody responses to T-dependent and independent model antigens within the context of a GITR-deficient genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W2035558413,"Transcriptional up-regulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2) gene is a major response to cellular stress. The expression of PAI-2 is induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors that act in a cell type- and differentiation stage-dependent manner. We previously reported that the human SERPINB2 gene promoter is controlled by three major transcription regulatory domains: an inducible proximal promoter, an upstream silencer (PAUSE-1), and a distal transactivator region between −5100 and −3300, which appears to overcome inhibition mediated by the silencer. The distal transactivator region is inducible by the phorbol ester PMA, a potent activator of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway that is a powerful inducer of PAI-2 gene expression in monocytes, macrophages, and myelomonocytic cells as well as in epidermal keratinocytes. Here we show that a 21-bp region (−4952/−4932), containing an AP-1 element, is both necessary and sufficient for PMA-induced transactivator activity in PAI-2-expressing U937 cells. This site specifically binds FosB in PAI-2-expressing U937 cells but not in HeLa cells that do not express PAI-2, and overexpression of FosB, c-Fos, or c-Jun in HeLa cells is sufficient to cause derepression of transcription from the SERPINB2 promoter. Although FosB is likely to be involved in transactivator-mediated derepression of PAI-2 transcription in macrophage-like cells, as exemplified by the U937 cell line, c-Jun may be functional in other cell types.

PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) is a strong inducer of PAI-2 gene expression in many cells, including cells of the monocytic lineages. PMA, a potent tumor promoter, is a naturally derived organic compound whose endogenous analog is diacylglycerol. It is well established that a major cellular receptor for PMA and other phorbol esters is protein kinase C (PKC), a family of at least 11 serine/threonine protein kinase isoenzymes with selective tissue distributions, activators, and substrates (22Musashi M.

PMA-induced changes in gene transcription are primarily mediated through the specific binding of AP-1 complexes to the DNA sequence 5′-TGA(G/C)TCA-3′, which has been termed the AP-1 binding site or PMA responsive element (24Angel P.

AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor complex composed primarily of members of the Jun and Fos protein families (26Angel P. Karin M.

Jun family members (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) can homo- or heterodimerize with other Jun or Fos family proteins. Fos family proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) are unable to homo- or heterodimerize with other Fos family proteins and are therefore only found as dimers with Jun partners. To define regulatory mechanisms responsible for the limited and cell-type-specific expression of PAI-2, we have characterized transcriptional regulatory promoter elements important for expression of the SERPINB2 gene (29Antalis T.M. Costelloe E. Muddiman J. Ogbourne S. Donnan K. Regulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 gene in monocytes.

Characterisation of PAUSE-1, a powerful silencer in the human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 gene promoter.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3919-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our previous studies revealed that the SERPINB2 gene promoter was transcriptionally controlled by an inducible proximal promoter, an upstream silencer (PAUSE-1), and a more distal transactivator region. While the proximal promoter was PMA-inducible in U937 cells and constitutively active in HeLa cells, the silencer region repressed transcription in both cell types. The transactivator region was functional only in U937 cells, and hypothesized to derepress transcription in PAI-2-expressing U937 cells, but not in HeLa cells that do not express PAI-2. This transactivator region was located between 3.3 and 5.0 kb upstream of the PAI-2 transcription initiation site. In the present study, we have defined the minimal DNA region responsible for PAI-2 transactivator activity, and we have identified specific members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) superfamily of proteins that bind to the PAI-2 transactivator region and functionally derepress the SERPINB2 promoter in both PAI-2-expressing and -non-expressing cells. This mechanism may offer valuable insight into differential PAI-2 gene expression during cell differentiation and in certain cancers. Human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures no. 85011440) and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (ATCC no. CCL-2.2) were maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% serum supreme (BioWhittaker), 200 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, in 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air atmosphere at 37 °C. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, an activator of U937 cells, was undetectable in cell cultures. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. All cultures were routinely checked to exclude mycoplasma infection. Cells were stimulated with 40 ng/ml PMA for 18 h, unless otherwise indicated, prior to harvesting. U937 cells expressed a low level of PAI-2 mRNA, which was increased as early as 2 h following treatment with PMA, rising to a maximum at 10 h of more than 30-fold that of constitutive levels (supplemental Fig. S1). An 8.8-kb genomic fragment containing 5 kb of the SERPINB2 promoter as well as the first exon and first intron of the human SERPINB2 gene has been described (31Antalis T.M. Godbolt D. Donnan K.D.

We report the sequence of the interim 1.4 kb, which has been deposited in GenBankTM with accession number AF071400.

These included pCAT-4952 (pNatCAT), pCAT-3306 (pCAT5′-3.3), and pCAT-1977 (pCAT5′-1.9), which contain the human SERPINB2 gene 5′-flanking sequence from −4952, −3306, and −1977 nucleotides, respectively, to the 3′-end of the first intron (+3729). The deletion constructs pCAT-4622, pCAT-4276, pCAT-3993, and pCAT-3628 were created by PCR amplification from pCAT-4952 using the sense primers, BShPt2, 5′-CTCCAAGCTTCCTAAGCCTATGCTTATTCA-3′; BShPt3, 5′-TAATAAGCTTGATCTTTGCTATAAATTAAC-3′; BShPt4, 5′-TACAAAGCTTCAAACATGAGTAAGTCATTC-3′; and BShPt5, 5′-TTAAAAGCTTTGCATGCCTATTATGGAAAA-3′, and the antisense primer BShPt1, 5′-GATTAAGCTTTCTCAAATAACCTGAAATAG-3′. Each primer contained a HindIII restriction site (underlined). The 5′-nucleotide of each new construct is indicated in bold type. PCR products were digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site (−3306) of pCAT-3306. pCAT-1977+330 and pCAT-1977+330R contain the 330-bp transactivator region −4952/−4623 cloned into the HindIII site immediately upstream of nucleotide −1977 of pCAT-1977 in the wild-type and reverse orientation, respectively. The −4952/−4623 region was cloned from pCAT-4952 by a PCR approach using the sense primer BS5′CAT (5′-ACCGGGAAGCTTGAATTCATGACTCACAGTGTT-3′) and the antisense primer BShPt6 (5′-AAGCATAAGCTTAGGCCACCGGGAGG-3′). Both primers contain a HindIII restriction site (underlined) that enable digestion of the PCR product with HindIII and subsequent cloning into the HindIII site of pCAT-1977. pCAT-1977+AP-1 contains the transactivator region −4952/−4932 cloned into the HindIII site immediately upstream of nucleotide −1977 of pCAT-1977 in the wild-type orientation. This construct was prepared by annealing the synthesized oligonucleotides BSAP1c (5′-AGCTTGAATTCATGACTCACAGTGTTA-3′) and BSAP1n (5′-AGCTTAACACTGTGAGTCATGAATTCA-3′), phosphorylating their 5′-termini and cloning the resultant product into the HindIII site of pCAT-1977. CAT reporter constructs containing mutations of the PAI-2 transactivator region AP-1, AP-2, and NF-κB-like sites (pCAT-4952mAP-1, pCAT-4952mAP-2, and pCAT-4952mNF-κB, respectively) were produced by one of two methods. pCAT-4952mAP-1 was generated from pCAT-4952 using the PCR primers BSmAP1c (5′-ACCGGGAAGCTTGAATTCACATATTCCAGTGTTCTGAGGCTGCTCT-3′) (mutated bases in bold and the HindIII restriction site underlined) and BShPt6, and cloning the HindIII-digested PCR product into pCAT-3306. pCAT-4952mAP-2 and pCAT-4952NFkB were created by the splicing by overlap extension recombinant PCR approach of Ho et al. (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction.Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). The internal, partially overlapping, complementary oligonucleotide primer pairs used to introduce mutations were as follows: BSmAP2c, 5′-TAGCTGTACTATTTCCACTTCTTAAAATAGGTGAGG-3′; BSmAP2n, 5′-GAAGTGGAAATAGTACAGCTATGAGTGTGAGAAAGT-3′; BSmNFkBc, 5′-TCTCTCTATTAAGTAGCTCCCGGTGGCCTAAGCCTA-3′; and BSmNFkBn, 5′-ACCGGGAGCTACTTAATAGAGAGACAGGGCAAAGAAAA-3′ (mutated bases in bold). The flanking oligonucleotide primers used were BS5′CAT and BShPt1. PCR products were digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII restriction site of pCAT-3306. All constructs were verified by DNA (Applied Biosystems) sequence analysis. All plasmid DNA preparations were twice purified by equilibrium centrifugation in cesium chloride-ethidium bromide gradients prior to transfection. Cells (1 × 107 HeLa and 3 × 107 U937) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid reporter DNA in a total volume of 250 μl by electroporation (0.25 kV and 960 microfarads). For co-transfection experiments, 20 μg of reporter plasmid and 5 μg of expression plasmid were used. Transfected cells were transferred to 10 ml of media and incubated 16–18 h prior to harvesting. CAT assays were performed using 50 μg of whole cell lysate essentially as described previously (29Antalis T.M. Costelloe E. Muddiman J. Ogbourne S. Donnan K. Regulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 gene in monocytes. Localization of an upstream transcriptional silencer.Blood. 1996; 88: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylation of [14C]chloramphenicol was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and signals were quantitated using ImageQuant version 4.2a (Molecular Dynamics). CAT activity was expressed as the percentage conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol per microgram of whole cell lysate and normalized to the value of the positive control plasmid, pCAT-Control (Promega), to allow comparison of the results of independent experiments. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were prepared using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and purified using Sephadex G-25 (NAPTM 5) columns (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa and U937 nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (34Antalis T.M. Godbolt D. Isolation of intact nuclei from hematopoietic cell types.Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 194301Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNA-binding reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 7.5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science), 5 μg of nuclear extract, and 10,000–20,000 cpm (0.05–0.2 ng) of radiolabeled probe. Binding reactions were incubated 20 min at room temperature. EMSAs were performed on 5% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide (Bio-Rad)) cast in 1× TBE (50 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XK-1 film between intensifying screens at −70 °C. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated 1 h on ice with 2 μg of antibody prior to the DNA-protein-binding reaction. Antibodies used were: anti-c-Jun (sc-45), anti-JunB (sc-46), anti-JunD (sc-74), anti-c-Fos (sc-52), anti-FosB (sc-7203), anti-Fra-1 (sc-183), and anti-Fra-2 (sc-604) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Smads bind directly to the Jun family of AP-1 transcription factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. X. Wang. Total RNA for Northern analysis and RT-PCR was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Gel electrophoresis was performed using denaturing 1.2% agarose gels, and RNA transfer was to Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized in the presence of probe at 65 °C and washed to a final stringency of 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C before exposure to Kodak XK-1 film. RT-PCR was performed using SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for first strand cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification with AmpliTaqTM DNA polymerase. For first strand cDNA synthesis, 5 μg of total RNA and 500 ng of oligo(dT) (Invitrogen), in a volume of 12 μl, were first incubated together at 70 °C for 10 min then chilled on ice. The reaction was then made up to a final volume of 20 μl, containing 0.5 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 200 units of SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase in its supplied buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT). The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min followed by heat inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. PCR was performed using 3 μl of the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction, 25 ng (3–4 pmol) of each oligonucleotide primer, 0.4 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 unit of AmpliTaqTM DNA polymerase in its supplied buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl), in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Cycle conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate total RNA from PMA-treated HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with Jun and Fos family pCMV expression plasmids (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen). For first-strand cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was used as a template with random primers and TaqMan® reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). For quantitative PCR, inventoried TaqMan® Gene Expression 20× primers for SERPINB2 and β-actin were used, and the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The constitutive and PMA-inducible transactivator activity of the SERPINB2 promoter is present within a 1.6-kb region (−3306 to −4952) upstream of the PAI-2 transcription initiation site (29Antalis T.M. Costelloe E. Muddiman J. Ogbourne S. Donnan K. Regulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 gene in monocytes. Localization of an upstream transcriptional silencer.Blood. 1996; 88: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To localize this transactivator activity, a series of CAT reporter plasmids was constructed from pCAT-4952 with progressively greater 5′-deletions to −3306 (Fig. 1A). U937 cells were transiently transfected with these reporter plasmids, and CAT activity was measured in the presence or absence of 40 ng/ml PMA. As shown in Fig. 1B, constitutive and PMA-inducible CAT activity was abolished upon deletion of the PAI-2 promoter to position −4622 in U937 cells. Furthermore, deletion beyond nucleotide −4622 resulted in neither additional loss nor significant restoration of PAI-2 promoter-directed CAT activity. In contrast, no significant constitutive nor PMA-inducible PAI-2 promoter-directed CAT activity was seen with any of the CAT reporter constructs in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Together these results demonstrate that the cell-type-specific activity of the human PAI-2 transactivator is located within a 330-bp region between nucleotides −4952 and −4623 of the human PAI-2 promoter. To investigate whether the 330-bp region (−4952 to −4623) of the human SERPINB2 transactivator contained the one or more necessary cis-elements for mediating PAI-2 transactivator activity, this region was inserted immediately upstream of nucleotide −1977 in pCAT-1977 in both the wild-type and reverse orientations, denoted as pCAT-1977+330 and pCAT-1977+330R, respectively (Fig. 1A). pCAT-1977 contains the PAUSE-1 silencer element, which effectively silences transcription from the SERPINB2 promoter in both U937 and HeLa cells (29Antalis T.M. Costelloe E. Muddiman J. Ogbourne S. Donnan K. Regulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 gene in monocytes.

Characterisation of PAUSE-1, a powerful silencer in the human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 gene promoter.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3919-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments in U937 cells demonstrated that the 330-bp transactivator region, when positioned immediately upstream of nucleotide −1977 in the wild-type orientation, effectively reproduced the transactivator activity detected with pCAT-4952 (Fig. 1C), thereby derepressing silencer activity in pCAT-1977. In contrast, inversion of the 330-bp transactivator was found to greatly reduce transactivator activity (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicated that the 330-bp region of the human SERPINB2 promoter (−4952/−4623) contains the necessary cis-element(s) required for transactivator function and that this activity is orientation-dependent. Moreover, the data further indicate that the activity of the 330-bp region can occur independently of nucleotides −4622 to −1978. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the 330-bp transactivator region revealed several potential candidates for mediating transactivator function (Fig. 2A). These include an AP-1 site, an AP-2 site, and an NF-κB motif, each of which are recognized"

The members of this family share numerous structural and functional characteristics. Resolution of the atomic structure of the bovine Ancp, in a complex with one of its specific inhibitors, revealed interesting features and suggested the involvement of some particular residues in the movements of the protein to perform translocation of nucleotides from one side of the membrane to the other. They correspond to three prolines located in the odd-numbered transmembrane helices (TMH), Pro-27, Pro-132, and Pro-229. The corresponding residues of the yeast Ancp (Pro-43, Ser-147, and Pro-247) were mutated into alanine or leucine, one at a time and analysis of the various mutants evidenced a crucial role of Pro-43 and Pro-247 during nucleotide transport. Beside, replacement of Ser-147 with proline does not inactivate Ancp and this is discussed in view of the conservation of the three prolines at equivalent positions in the Ancp sequences. These prolines belong to the signature sequences of the mitochondrial carriers and we propose they play a dual role in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier function and biogenesis. Unexpectedly their mutations cause more general effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and morphology, as evidenced by measurements of respiratory rates, cytochrome contents, and also clearly highlighted by fluorescence microscopy.

The corresponding residues of the yeast Ancp (Pro-43, Ser-147, and Pro-247) were mutated into alanine or leucine, one at a time and analysis of the various mutants evidenced a crucial role of Pro-43 and Pro-247 during nucleotide transport. Beside, replacement of Ser-147 with proline does not inactivate Ancp and this is discussed in view of the conservation of the three prolines at equivalent positions in the Ancp sequences. These prolines belong to the signature sequences of the mitochondrial carriers and we propose they play a dual role in the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier function and biogenesis. Unexpectedly their mutations cause more general effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and morphology, as evidenced by measurements of respiratory rates, cytochrome contents, and also clearly highlighted by fluorescence microscopy.

Ancp is the paradigm of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) and its atomic structure was solved at high resolution in 2003 (1Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V.

Although the three-dimensional structure of the bovine Anc1p (BfAnc1p) is that of an inhibited carrier, we could learn a lot from it. However, it is now necessary to go further to get insights into the precise mechanism of the nucleotide exchange. Ancp is very specifically and efficiently inhibited by two classes of inhibitors whose representative members are carboxyatractyloside (CATR) for one class, and bongkrekic acid (BA) for the other one. CATR binds only to the cytosolic side of the ADP/ATP carrier, whereas BA binds only to the matrix side. The extensive use of these inhibitors for past studies allowed to propose that they stabilize Ancp in two different conformations, named BA and CATR conformations, which are probably involved in the nucleotide exchange process. The three-dimensional structure of the BfAnc1p is that of the CATR conformation but that of the BA conformation is still missing. As a general rule membrane transporters are characterized by the switch from one conformation open to one side of the membrane to another one open to the opposite side of the membrane to catalyze transport. In the BfAnc1p structure, the cavity is oriented toward the intermembrane space (IMS) and CATR lies deeply inside. The six-tilted TMH of BfAnc1p (TMH1 to 6) delineate this cavity. We can hypothesize that in the BA conformation, it is open toward the matrix and closed to the intermembrane space. The odd-numbered TMH are sharply kinked at the level of prolines. They belong to the signature sequences of the MCF members, PX(D/E)XX(K/R) (7Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. The mitochondrial transport protein superfamily.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Nelson D.R. Felix C.M. Swanson J.M. Highly conserved charge-pair networks in the mitochondrial carrier family.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). An example of the conservation of these sequences is given for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MCF (Fig. 1A). As can be seen these prolines are particularly well conserved: 97, 85, and 100% in TMH1, -3, and -5, respectively. Motif 2 is the less well conserved, but still relatively high. In the case of the Ancp subfamily, it was suggested that the three transmembrane prolines play the role of hinges during the swing from one conformation to the other involved in nucleotide transport (1Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G.

Structural dynamics of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier revealed by molecular dynamics simulation studies.Proteins. 2006; 65: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although prolines in TMH1 and -5 of Ancp are perfectly conserved, the proline in TMH3 is replaced with a serine residue in almost 50% of Ancp sequences (Fig. 1B). However, Gray and Matthews (10Gray T.M. Matthews B.W. Intrahelical hydrogen bonding of serine, threonine, and cysteine residues within α-helices and its relevance to membrane-bound proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) noticed in a survey of known protein structures that serine in helices has a high propensity to make hydrogen bonds to carbonyl oxygen atoms in the preceding turn of the helix. Ballesteros et al. (11Ballesteros J.A. Deupi X. Olivella M. Haaksma E.E. Pardo L. Serine and threonine residues bend α-helices in the χ(1) = γ(−) conformation.Biophys.

Indeed, TMH3 of ScAnc2p is also kinked at the level of this residue in the three-dimensional structure obtained by homology modeling (12David C. Arnou B. Sanchez J.F. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J.-M. Trézéguet V. Two residues of a conserved aromatic ladder of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier are crucial to nucleotide transport.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 13223-13231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamic simulations of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier in the presence of ADP reinforced the putative role of the transmembrane prolines. In these experiments, Wang and Tajkhorshid (13Wang Y. Tajkhorshid E. Electrostatic funneling of substrate in mitochondrial inner membrane carriers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9598-9603Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) probed early structural changes, which might be involved in substrate translocation. They observed on the nanosecond time scale radial, outward displacements of the C-terminal part of the odd numbered helices around Pro-27, Pro-132, and Pro-229 (in TMH1, -3, and -5, respectively), accompanied by rearrangements of the salt bridge network responsible for the closure of the bottom of the cavity. Besides, hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics coupled to mass spectrometry highlighted dramatic accessibility to the solvent of the regions exposed to the matrix and to the intermembrane space depending on the inhibitor bound to BfAnc1p, CATR, or BA (14Rey M. Man P. Clémençon B. Trézéguet V. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L.

For example, regions 21–35 in TMH1 and 129–140 in TMH3, encompassing MCF motives 1 and 2, were much more deuterated in the BA-carrier complex than in the CATR-carrier complex. Besides, these prolines are part of the signature sequences of the MCF members, PX(D/E)XX(K/R), which were suggested to be involved in mitochondrial carrier biogenesis (15Endres M. Neupert W.

Convincing experimental data are still missing. In addition, it was shown that other parts of the carriers participate in the translocation, namely TMH4 and part of TMH5 (18Brix J. Rüdiger S.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1445-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore we also investigated the role of these prolines in the mitochondrial import. To do so, we mutated the positions of ScAnc2p equivalent to Pro-27, Pro-132, and Pro-229 (Pro-43, Ser-147, and Pro-247) either in a small amino acid, alanine, or in a bulkier hydrophobic one, leucine. Alanine scanning was often used to probe important residues for protein function (22Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A.

Combinatorial alanine scanning.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Leucine is considered a helix former and stabilizer (24Eilers M. Patel A.B. Liu W. Smith S.O. Comparison of helix interactions in membrane and soluble α-bundle proteins.Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2720-2736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and we can expect negative effects on transport activity if these three prolines act as hinges for helix movements to close or open the Ancp cavity during nucleotide translocation. Genetic studies are easier with yeast than with bovine. ScAnc2p was chosen because it is the only isoform necessary for S. cerevisiae to grow under respiratory conditions (25Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trézéguet V. Vignais P.V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Biochemical characterisation of the isolated Anc2 adenine nucleotide carrier from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, primary sequence conservation is relatively high between the bovine and yeast carriers (47% identity) indicating that any conclusion drawn for the yeast carrier will be accurate for the bovine carrier. As expected, proline/serine substitutions hampered ScAnc2p activity, although at very different levels. Interestingly, the productive ADP binding to Ancp as well as CATR binding properties were modified. Noticeably, the consequences of Pro-43, Ser-147, and Pro-247 mutations were also at the mitochondrial level: oxygen consumption, cytochrome contents, morphology, and network. Hence, we evidenced for the first time a role of Ancp in its own biogenesis and more generally in mitochondrial biogenesis, in line with Ancp being a key energetic link in the cell metabolism. Ancp not only provides the cell with its main energy source but also controls the quality and the amount of the organelle that produces this energy and hosts Ancp. [3H]Atractyloside ([3H]ATR) and N-ADP were synthesized as previously described in David et al. (12David C. Arnou B. Sanchez J.F. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J.-M. Trézéguet V.

The resulting plasmids were used to transform the JL1Δ2Δ3u− strain to assess their ability to complement the Scanc2 deletion. Cells were cultivated in 100 ml of SGal-W until their A600 nm = 2–4. Cells were harvested and washed twice with fresh water, then resuspended in 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 6.8 (A600 nm ≈ 100). They were reduced with sodium dithionite and oxidized with 10 μl/ml of 3% H2O2.

Cell proteins were extracted by the post-alkaline method described by Kushnirov (27Kushnirov V.V. Rapid and reliable protein extraction from yeast.Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in SGal-W medium until their A600 nm = 2–3. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. After 5 min at room temperature and a rapid centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% bromophenol blue. It was boiled for 3 min and 6 μl of the supernatant was loaded on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Tubulin was detected after transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane with an anti-tubulin antibody (1/2000) kindly provided by A. Baines (28Woods A. Sherwin T. Sasse R. MacRae T.H. Baines A.J. Gull K.

Yeast cells used for isolation of mitochondria were grown in SGal-W to allow the plasmid to be maintained in transformants. The protocols and materials used to perform isolation of mitochondria, ADP/ATP transport, [3H]ATR binding experiments, cytochrome content measurements, and protein immunostaining are described in De Marcos et al. (26De Marcos Lousa C. Trézéguet V. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J.-M. The human mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers. Kinetic properties and biogenesis of wild-type and mutant proteins in the yeast S. cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14412-14420Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For determination of the relative ScAnc2p content mitochondria were isolated from cells grown in SGal-W. Different amounts of mitochondrial proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane that was then immunostained with an antibody raised against yeast porin (1/14,000) plus an antibody raised against the last 14 amino acids of ScAnc2p (1/7,000). After ECL detection with a GeneGnome system (Syngene, Ozyme), intensities of the signals were quantified with ImageJ (Rasband, W. S., National Institutes of Health). The ScAnc2p/porin ratio in arbitrary units was set at 1 for the wild-type protein. The time course of CATR-induced release of bound N-ADP was studied by incubating freshly isolated mitochondria (0.5 mg of mitochondrial proteins/ml) at 16 °C in 2 ml of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA. Fluorescence measurements were performed as described in David et al. (12David C. Arnou B. Sanchez J.F. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Lauquin G.J.-M. Trézéguet V.

The DNA fragments carrying the leucine variant ORF (EcoRI-BamHI) were subcloned into the pGEM4Z plasmid (kindly provided by M.

The samples were subjected to a 15% SDS-PAGE and the labeled proteins were visualized with the Fluorescent Image Analyzer Fujifilm FLA-500. Radioactivity of the bands was quantified using the ImageJ software. Respiratory rates were measured with a Clark electrode in a 1-ml cell, thermostated at 30 °C. Freshly isolated mitochondria are diluted (0.1–0.3 mg/ml) in 5 mm KCl, 0.6 m mannitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm potassium Pi, pH 6.8, and 4 mm MgCl2. State 3 and 4 respiration rates are determined in presence of NADH (0.5–2 mm), with or without ADP (100 μm) or with FCCP (1 μm). To observe the mitochondrial network, the various yeast strains were transformed with a plasmid encoding a mutant GFP (S65T), which is targeted to mitochondria, pVT100U-mtGFP (29Westermann B. Neupert W. Mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent proteins. Convenient tools for the study of organelle biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), a kind gift of W. Neupert and B. Westermann. Cells were then cultivated in 25 ml of a selective medium until A600 nm = 2–4. The cell suspension (2 μl) was mounted on a microscope slide under a coverslip. GFP was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems DM-LB) under an oil immersion objective. The images were acquired with a SIS camera and processed with Corel Draw 9.0 suite software. Ser-147 in TMH3 of ScAnc2p was mutated into proline to mimic what could be an evolutionary process, as suggested by Ancp sequence alignment (30Nury H. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Pebay-Peyroula E. Relations between structure and function of the mitochrondrial ADP/ATP carrier.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 713-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the second MCF signature motif PX(D/E)XX(K/R), the first residue is a proline in Ancp sequences from animals and it corresponds to a serine in trypanosoma, leishmania, plants, and fungi. The mutated ScAnc2p, S147P, was introduced into a yeast strain deleted for endogenous ANC, JL1Δ2Δ3u−, of which growth on a non-fermentable carbon source such as lactate can be restored only by the presence of an active ScAnc2p. As can be seen in Fig. 2 (third lane), the S147P variant restored growth on lactate with characteristics (doubling time and growth yield) similar to that of the wild-type (WT) ScAnc2p. The empty plasmid did not allow growth on lactate, although the transformed strain was viable on glucose, a fermentable carbon source, which does not require functional mitochondria (Fig. 2, second lane). The S147P variant is active enough to complement the anc null mutation. Next, we estimated the ScAnc2p contents in mitochondria from immunostaining experiments. The relative ScAnc2p content was determined after immunostaining of mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondria were isolated from cells grown in SGal-W. Different amounts of mitochondrial proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer, the nitrocellulose membrane was then immunodecorated with an antibody raised against ScAnc2p (31Brandolin G.

Transforming growth factor type β (TGFβ) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) interact synergistically to increase PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels in human HepG2 and mink Mv1Lu cells. Other growth factors that activate tyrosine kinase receptors can substitute for EGF. EGF and TGFβ regulate PAI-1 by synergistically activating transcription, which is further amplified by a decrease in the rate of mRNA degradation, the latter being regulated only by EGF. The combined effect of transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization results in a rapid 2-order of magnitude increase in the level of PAI-1. TGFβ also increases the sensitivity of the cells to EGF, thereby recruiting the cooperation of EGF at lower than normally effective concentrations. The contribution of EGF to the regulation of PAI-1 involves the MAPK pathway, and the synergistic interface with the TGFβ pathway is downstream of MEK1/2 and involves phosphorylation of neither ERK1/2 nor Smad2/3.

This work demonstrates the existence of a multidimensional cellular mechanism by which EGF and TGFβ are able to promote large and rapid changes in PAI-1 expression. Cells are finely tuned to their external environment with many response modes. Most mammalian cell responses are initiated at the level of receptors that recognize hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and other currencies of intercellular communication. The means by which these signals are integrated guides the speed and intensity of the cell's response. In many instances, the integration is additive, with both signals contributing a certain quantitative change in the target cellular function. However, in some cases, the signals are integrated so as to be synergistic, where the sum of the two signals provides a larger increase than expected if they were additive. These synergistic responses provide opportunities for a broader range of response that can be tightly controlled over a larger range of intensity or time span. The requirement of two or more regulators for increased gene expression also minimizes the probability of adventitious gene activation that could be deleterious to the organism. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a secreted glycoprotein, is the major plasma inhibitor of plasminogen activator (1Häggroth L. Mattsson C. Felding P. Nilsson I.M.

Due to its critical function in normal physiology, PAI-1 requires tight control over a large range of its gene and protein expression. The need for tight regulation of PAI-1 expression levels and time of production is reflected in the many hormones, cytokines, and growth factors that regulate it, including insulin, transforming growth factor type β (TGFβ), epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (7Landin K.

Here we demonstrate that EGF and TGFβ cooperate synergistically to regulate PAI-1 expression at the level of transcription and that EGF alone stabilizes PAI-1 mRNA with the result that the mRNA level increases rapidly by 2 orders of magnitude or higher after the addition of TGFβ and EGF. In addition, TGFβ recruits the cooperation of EGF even when it is at suboptimal concentrations by increasing the sensitivity of cells to EGF. The mechanism by which synergism is achieved is unique to the combination of the two growth factors, and the same level of expression cannot be achieved by either growth factor alone. These studies demonstrate a powerful synergistic regulation of PAI-1 gene expression between two growth factors that are frequently present at elevated levels in diseased tissues, such as cancer, and during an inflammatory response.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells (HB-8065, ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 10 μm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air. All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative with regular testing by PCR analysis. For experiments, cells were seeded and cultured until confluent. The medium was then changed to DMEM or Eagle's minimal essential medium with or without 0.2% calf serum for 24 h prior to the addition of growth factors and other treatments. Growth factors were 1 ng/ml EGF and 5 ng/ml TGFβ unless otherwise stated. Mv1Lu cells were seeded 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1.6 ng/ml plasmids in DMEM medium in the presence of 0.4% Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 20 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 1 ng/ml EGF, 5 ng/ml TGFβ, or their combination and incubated for the indicated time period.

PAI-1 was metabolically labeled as described previously (9Thalacker F.W. Nilsen-Hamilton M. Specific induction of secreted proteins by transforming growth factor-β and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Relationship with an inhibitor of plasminogen activator.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2283-2290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent Mv1Lu cells were treated with EGF and/or TGFβ for 2 h, and then [35S]methionine was added to the culture medium. After 4 h, the medium was collected, and the amount of radiolabeled PAI-1 protein was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. After an 8-h exposure to EGF and/or TGFβ, 35S-Trans-label was added to HepG2 cells to label newly synthesized protein. The amount of human PAI-1 protein was detected after immunoprecipitation by using PAI-1 antiserum (α-Sp46), followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For quantitative results, the exposed film was scanned to determine the relative amount of cpm in each protein band, and each value was divided by the total acid-precipitable 35S cpm in the cell monolayer from which the sample of medium was removed. By this means, the incorporation of 35S-amino acid into secreted proteins was normalized to the number of producing cells. Newly transcribed RNA was metabolically labeled as described previously (20Dölken L. Ruzsics Z. Rädle B. Friedel C.C. Zimmer R. Mages J. Hoffmann R. Dickinson P. Forster T. Ghazal P. Koszinowski U.H.

Fifteen minutes before the end of the treatment period, 500 μm 4-thiouridine was added to the cell culture medium. The reaction was stopped 15 min later, and total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. Newly transcribed RNA was biotinylated by incubation with 0.2 mg/ml biotin-HPDP in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA for 1.5 h at room temperature. The biotinylated RNA was isolated on streptavidin-coated beads, M270. The mRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mv1Lu cells were treated with 5 ng/ml EGF and/or 1 ng/ml TGFβ, for 2 h, and then 15 μg/ml cordecypin was added, and the cells were incubated for the identified time periods before collection and extraction of total RNA for analysis by qRT-PCR. At least five independent experiments were performed for each treatment. Western blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using Western Lightning® Plus-ECL Enhanced Chemiluminescent Substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 min and then exposed to autoradiography film. Data from multiple experiments are summarized and represented as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by the linear model of analysis of variance, and multiple comparisons were performed according to least square means Student's t test. The concentration dependence of PAI-1 expression in the presence of TGFβ with or without EGF was analyzed for the EC50 by using the online software BioDatafit 1.02 (Chang Bioscience, Inc., Castro Valley, CA). The four-parameter (Hill slope) model was used to fit the data and calculate log EC50. The effects of treatments on the PAI-1 mRNA half-life were assessed by linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance. All statistical analyses were performed using the software JMP7.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) unless otherwise stated. Significant differences between samples are indicated as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. Synergism is calculated as follows: synergism = TGFβ plus EGF net effect/(TGFβ net effect + EGF net effect). EGF and TGFβ cooperate to stimulate PAI-1 protein production, as demonstrated in mink lung Mv1Lu cells and human liver HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The synergistic increase in PAI-1 gene expression is also observed at the mRNA level (Fig. 1, C and D). Synergism is defined as when the increase due to the combination of treatments is more than expected from the sum of the increases due to either treatment alone. Unlike the large changes in gene expression observed for PAI-1, much smaller changes in mRNA levels were observed for other genes (Fig. 1, C and D). There was a slight increase for urokinase plasminogen activator expression in response to EGF, but there was no effect of TGFβ. A small (but not statistically significant) synergistic increase was observed in urokinase plasminogen activator receptor expression. Cyclooxygenase (COX2) mRNA was not altered by EGF, TGFβ, or their combination. Thus, the synergism between EGF and TGFβ is gene-specific but not species-specific. If EGF and TGFβ utilize the same mechanism to increase PAI-1 gene expression, they should only work synergistically at concentrations below their saturation. To test this hypothesis, we varied the concentration of each growth factor to reach saturation in the presence of a constant saturating concentration of the other (supplemental Fig. 1). The results clearly show that neither growth factor can substitute for the other in raising the level of PAI-1 mRNA to the level observed with both together, which is about an order of magnitude beyond that achievable by either growth factor alone. Analysis of the EC50 values for PAI-1 mRNA changes in response to EGF and/or TGFβ also revealed that TGFβ increases the sensitivity of cells to EGF by an order of magnitude, but EGF does not change the EC50 for TGFβ responsiveness (supplemental Table 1). Thus, TGFβ recruits EGF at suboptimal concentrations to a synergistic interaction. To determine if a signal transduction pathway downstream from a tyrosine kinase is responsible for the EGF contribution to synergism with TGFβ, we examined the effect on TGFβ-activated PAI-1 expression of FGF-2, IGF-1, and TNFα. Although the PAI-1 mRNA level was not significantly increased after treatment by IGF-1, FGF-2, or TNFα alone, it was dramatically increased when the cells were treated with the combination of any one of these stimuli and TGFβ (Fig. 2, A and B). EGF and TGFβ exhibited the highest synergism, which elevated PAI-1 mRNA level about 4-fold over the additive effects expected from each growth factor acting independently. Synergism is not uniquely downstream of tyrosine kinases. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a PKC agonist, synergizes with TGFβ upon PAI-1 expression (Fig. 2C). This effect was specific for PAI-1 and not observed for a 73-kDa TGFβ-induced protein secreted by the same cells (Fig. 2D). The involvement of RTK receptors and PKC identified a subset of signal transduction pathways that might be involved in the synergistic mechanism. To identify the likely pathway(s), a series of kinase inhibitors and their inactive analogs were tested (Fig. 3, A–E, and supplemental Table 2). Although several inhibitors decreased the overall responses to EGF and TGFβ, only inhibition of the p38 MAPK and the MEK1/2 reduced synergism, with the largest effect being produced by the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a major target of MEK, increased within 10 min of adding EGF but was not altered by TGFβ (Fig. 3F). Therefore, the synergism is a downstream of MEK. To test if new translation were required for synergism, cells were treated with cycloheximide prior to growth factor treatment. Although blocking protein synthesis decreased the total PAI-1 mRNA level induction (Fig. 4A), the calculated synergisms with and without cycloheximide treatment were 2.7 ± 0.2 and 3.3 ± 0.8, respectively, which were not significantly different by a two-tailed t test. We evaluated if enhanced mRNA stability might be the post-transcriptional step responsible for the period of persistently elevated PAI-1 mRNA level in response to the combination of EGF and TGFβ. Although the basal level of PAI-1 mRNA was too low to obtain sufficient quantitative values for a decay curve, we were able to determine the mRNA decay rates in cells treated with each growth factor alone and in combination (Fig. 4B). The PAI-1 mRNA half-life was 37 min in TGFβ-treated cells, 52 min in EGF-treated cells, and 56 min in cells treated with EGF and TGFβ. A statistical analysis of the data verified that the PAI-1 mRNA half-life in cells treated with the combination of EGF and TGFβ was significantly different from that in cells treated with TGFβ alone (p < 0.05) but not different from that in cells treated with EGF. Thus, by stabilizing PAI-1 mRNA, EGF uniquely contributes to the magnitude of the increase in expression of PAI-1 mRNA in combined treatment with TGFβ and increases the time span of increased PAI-1 mRNA after growth factor stimulation. To determine if EGF and TGFβ cooperate to increase the rate of initiation of PAI-1 transcription, we performed nuclear run-on experiments and found a synergistic effect of about 2-fold for newly transcribed PAI-1 mRNA (Fig. 5A). A trivial explanation for the observed synergism is that, rather than increasing the maximum level of gene expression, the combination of the two growth factors changes the time course of expression to move the peak expression level closer to the monitored time point. To test this question, we performed a time course study where it was seen that PAI-1 transcription and the mRNA level were increased within 1 h of adding EGF and TGFβ and peaked at 1.5 and 2 h, respectively (Fig. 5, B and D). Synergism was observed throughout the induction period. These results demonstrate that the response of PAI-1 gene expression is rapid and that synergism between EGF and TGFβ does not result from a temporal disparity. Cross-talk has been reported between the MAPK and Smad pathways (21Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Smad3/AP-1 interactions control transcriptional responses to TGF-β in a promoter-specific manner.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Smad3 and Smad4 cooperate with c-Jun/c-Fos to mediate TGF-β-induced transcription.Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). To determine if this type of interaction is the basis for the cooperation between EGF and TGFβ, we examined the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated C-terminal SS(V/M)S motif and found that the Smads were phosphorylated only in response to TGFβ, and EGF treatment did not affect Smad phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 2A). To determine if nuclear Smad activity is synergistically increased by EGF and TGFβ, we utilized the plasmid pSBE4, which contains four Smad-binding elements (SBEs) that are specifically recognized by activated Smad3/4 (17Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Human Smad3 and Smad4 are sequence-specific transcription activators.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) and the plasmid p3ARE that contains the activin-responsive element that is regulated by Smad2/4 and FAST-1 (forkhead activin signal transducer-1) (23Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Smad2 and Smad3 positively and negatively regulate TGFβ-dependent transcription through the forkhead DNA-binding protein FAST2.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). TGFβ activated Smad3/4 but had little or no effect on Smad2/4, whereas EGF inhibited Smad3/4 and Smad2/3 activities regardless of TGFβ stimulation (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, synergism between EGF and TGFβ does not involve increasing the nuclear activities of the Smads. When tested with the reporter plasmid p3TP, which contains adjacent AP-1 and Smad-binding elements, EGF and TGFβ increased expression with 3-fold synergism (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that cooperation between TGFβ and EGF involves interaction between AP-1 and Smad, both of which bind the PAI-1 promoter. To confirm the involvement of AP-1 in the synergism between EGF and TGFβ, we tested two AP-1 antagonists, curcumin and dominant negative Fos (ΔFosB). Both antagonists significantly reduced 3TP activation in response to the combination of EGF and TGFβ but not to EGF or TGFβ alone (Fig. 6, B and C). By contrast, curcumin did not affect activation of the pSBE4 promoter, which contained only the Smad-binding elements (Fig. 6D). ΔFosB also decreased synergistic induction of PAI-1 mRNA in Mv1Lu cells, demonstrating that the same mechanism as is seen in the reporter constructs is likely to be occurring on the endogenous PAI-1 promoter (Fig. 6F and supplemental Table 3). Neither Fos nor Jun phosphorylation was regulated synergistically (Fig. 6E). Synergism between cell regulators is a powerful means of increasing the strength of the response. EGF and TGFβ synergize to regulate several important cellular processes, including colony formation in soft agar (24Roberts A.B. Anzano M.A. Wakefield L.M. Roche N.S. Stern D.F. Sporn M.B.
