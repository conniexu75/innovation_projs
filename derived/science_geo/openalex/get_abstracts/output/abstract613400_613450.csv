https://openalex.org/W2808909747,"Intratumoral stimulatory dendritic cells (SDCs) play an important role in stimulating cytotoxic T cells and driving immune responses against cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate their abundance in the tumor microenvironment (TME) could unveil new therapeutic opportunities. We find that in human melanoma, SDC abundance is associated with intratumoral expression of the gene encoding the cytokine FLT3LG. FLT3LG is predominantly produced by lymphocytes, notably natural killer (NK) cells in mouse and human tumors. NK cells stably form conjugates with SDCs in the mouse TME, and genetic and cellular ablation of NK cells in mice demonstrates their importance in positively regulating SDC abundance in tumor through production of FLT3L. Although anti-PD-1 ‘checkpoint’ immunotherapy for cancer largely targets T cells, we find that NK cell frequency correlates with protective SDCs in human cancers, with patient responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, and with increased overall survival. Our studies reveal that innate immune SDCs and NK cells cluster together as an excellent prognostic tool for T cell–directed immunotherapy and that these innate cells are necessary for enhanced T cell tumor responses, suggesting this axis as a target for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2790364467,"Hepatic steatosis is a multifactorial condition that is often observed in obese patients and is a prelude to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we combine shotgun sequencing of fecal metagenomes with molecular phenomics (hepatic transcriptome and plasma and urine metabolomes) in two well-characterized cohorts of morbidly obese women recruited to the FLORINASH study. We reveal molecular networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplants and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under the curve = 87%) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the steatosis phenome (>75% shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via microbiome-based therapies. Metabolic activity of specific human gut microorganisms contributes to liver steatosis in obese women."
https://openalex.org/W2809675891,"As oxygen is essential for many metabolic pathways, tumour hypoxia may impair cancer cell proliferation1-4. However, the limiting metabolites for proliferation under hypoxia and in tumours are unknown. Here, we assessed proliferation of a collection of cancer cells following inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), a major metabolic pathway requiring molecular oxygen5. Sensitivity to ETC inhibition varied across cell lines, and subsequent metabolomic analysis uncovered aspartate availability as a major determinant of sensitivity. Cell lines least sensitive to ETC inhibition maintain aspartate levels by importing it through an aspartate/glutamate transporter, SLC1A3. Genetic or pharmacologic modulation of SLC1A3 activity markedly altered cancer cell sensitivity to ETC inhibitors. Interestingly, aspartate levels also decrease under low oxygen, and increasing aspartate import by SLC1A3 provides a competitive advantage to cancer cells at low oxygen levels and in tumour xenografts. Finally, aspartate levels in primary human tumours negatively correlate with the expression of hypoxia markers, suggesting that tumour hypoxia is sufficient to inhibit ETC and, consequently, aspartate synthesis in vivo. Therefore, aspartate may be a limiting metabolite for tumour growth, and aspartate availability could be targeted for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2808976292,"Defining the metabolic limitations of tumour growth will help to develop cancer therapies1. Cancer cells proliferate slower in tumours than in standard culture conditions, indicating that a metabolic limitation may restrict cell proliferation in vivo. Aspartate synthesis can limit cancer cell proliferation when respiration is impaired2-4; however, whether acquiring aspartate is endogenously limiting for tumour growth is unknown. We confirm that aspartate has poor cell permeability, which prevents environmental acquisition, whereas the related amino acid asparagine is available to cells in tumours, but cancer cells lack asparaginase activity to convert asparagine to aspartate. Heterologous expression of guinea pig asparaginase 1 (gpASNase1), an enzyme that produces aspartate from asparagine5, confers the ability to use asparagine to supply intracellular aspartate to cancer cells in vivo. Tumours expressing gpASNase1 grow at a faster rate, indicating that aspartate acquisition is an endogenous metabolic limitation for the growth of some tumours. Tumours expressing gpASNase1 are also refractory to the growth suppressive effects of metformin, suggesting that metformin inhibits tumour growth by depleting aspartate. These findings suggest that therapeutic aspartate suppression could be effective to treat cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2809559846,"The major genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a C9orf72 G4C2 repeat expansion1,2. Proposed mechanisms by which the expansion causes c9FTD/ALS include toxicity from repeat-containing RNA and from dipeptide repeat proteins translated from these transcripts. To investigate the contribution of poly(GR) dipeptide repeat proteins to c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis in a mammalian in vivo model, we generated mice that expressed GFP-(GR)100 in the brain. GFP-(GR)100 mice developed age-dependent neurodegeneration, brain atrophy, and motor and memory deficits through the accumulation of diffuse, cytoplasmic poly(GR). Poly(GR) co-localized with ribosomal subunits and the translation initiation factor eIF3η in GFP-(GR)100 mice and, of importance, in c9FTD/ALS patients. Combined with the differential expression of ribosome-associated genes in GFP-(GR)100 mice, these findings demonstrate poly(GR)-mediated ribosomal distress. Indeed, poly(GR) inhibited canonical and non-canonical protein translation in HEK293T cells, and also induced the formation of stress granules and delayed their disassembly. These data suggest that poly(GR) contributes to c9FTD/ALS by impairing protein translation and stress granule dynamics, consequently causing chronic cellular stress and preventing cells from mounting an effective stress response. Decreasing poly(GR) and/or interrupting interactions between poly(GR) and ribosomal and stress granule-associated proteins may thus represent potential therapeutic strategies to restore homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2809425738,"Designer microbial consortia are an emerging frontier in synthetic biology that enable versatile microbiome engineering. However, the utilization of such consortia is hindered by our limited capacity in rapidly creating ecosystems with desired dynamics. Here we present the development of synthetic communities through social interaction engineering that combines modular pathway reconfiguration with model creation. Specifically, we created six two-strain consortia, each possessing a unique mode of interaction, including commensalism, amensalism, neutralism, cooperation, competition and predation. These consortia follow distinct population dynamics with characteristics determined by the underlying interaction modes. We showed that models derived from two-strain consortia can be used to design three- and four-strain ecosystems with predictable behaviors and further extended to provide insights into community dynamics in space. This work sheds light on the organization of interacting microbial species and provides a systematic framework-social interaction programming-to guide the development of synthetic ecosystems for diverse purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2809053936,"Developing adaptive materials with geometries that change in response to external stimuli provides fundamental insights into the links between the physical forces involved and the resultant morphologies and creates a foundation for technologically relevant dynamic systems1,2. In particular, reconfigurable surface topography as a means to control interfacial properties3 has recently been explored using responsive gels4, shape-memory polymers5, liquid crystals6-8 and hybrid composites9-14, including magnetically active slippery surfaces12-14. However, these designs exhibit a limited range of topographical changes and thus a restricted scope of function. Here we introduce a hierarchical magneto-responsive composite surface, made by infiltrating a ferrofluid into a microstructured matrix (termed ferrofluid-containing liquid-infused porous surfaces, or FLIPS). We demonstrate various topographical reconfigurations at multiple length scales and a broad range of associated emergent behaviours. An applied magnetic-field gradient induces the movement of magnetic nanoparticles suspended in the ferrofluid, which leads to microscale flow of the ferrofluid first above and then within the microstructured surface. This redistribution changes the initially smooth surface of the ferrofluid (which is immobilized by the porous matrix through capillary forces) into various multiscale hierarchical topographies shaped by the size, arrangement and orientation of the confining microstructures in the magnetic field. We analyse the spatial and temporal dynamics of these reconfigurations theoretically and experimentally as a function of the balance between capillary and magnetic pressures15-19 and of the geometric anisotropy of the FLIPS system. Several interesting functions at three different length scales are demonstrated: self-assembly of colloidal particles at the micrometre scale; regulated flow of liquid droplets at the millimetre scale; and switchable adhesion and friction, liquid pumping and removal of biofilms at the centimetre scale. We envision that FLIPS could be used as part of integrated control systems for the manipulation and transport of matter, thermal management, microfluidics and fouling-release materials."
https://openalex.org/W2809226260,"Epilepsy is a frequent feature of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but little is known about genetic differences between NDDs with and without epilepsy. We analyzed de novo variants (DNVs) in 6,753 parent–offspring trios ascertained to have different NDDs. In the subset of 1,942 individuals with NDDs with epilepsy, we identified 33 genes with a significant excess of DNVs, of which SNAP25 and GABRB2 had previously only limited evidence of disease association. Joint analysis of all individuals with NDDs also implicated CACNA1E as a novel disease-associated gene. Comparing NDDs with and without epilepsy, we found missense DNVs, DNVs in specific genes, age of recruitment, and severity of intellectual disability to be associated with epilepsy. We further demonstrate the extent to which our results affect current genetic testing as well as treatment, emphasizing the benefit of accurate genetic diagnosis in NDDs with epilepsy. Analysis of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with epilepsy identifies 33 genes with a significant excess of de novo variants. Comparison of rates of de novo variants between NDDs with or without epilepsy highlights differences between these phenotypic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2809134706,"The association between altered gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, inflammation and cardiometabolic diseases is becoming increasingly clear but remains poorly understood1,2. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is an enzyme induced in many types of immune cells, including macrophages in response to inflammatory stimuli, and catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity is better known for its suppression of effector T cell immunity and its activation of regulatory T cells3,4. However, high indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity predicts worse cardiovascular outcome5–9 and may promote atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation6, suggesting a more complex role in chronic inflammatory settings. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity is also increased in obesity10–13, yet its role in metabolic disease is still unexplored. Here, we show that obesity is associated with an increase of intestinal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, which shifts tryptophan metabolism from indole derivative and interleukin-22 production toward kynurenine production. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase deletion or inhibition improves insulin sensitivity, preserves the gut mucosal barrier, decreases endotoxemia and chronic inflammation, and regulates lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. These beneficial effects are due to rewiring of tryptophan metabolism toward a microbiota-dependent production of interleukin-22 and are abrogated after treatment with a neutralizing anti-interleukin-22 antibody. In summary, we identify an unexpected function of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in the fine tuning of intestinal tryptophan metabolism with major consequences on microbiota-dependent control of metabolic disease, which suggests indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase as a potential therapeutic target. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase normally suppresses inflammation, but knockout of its gene is metabolically beneficial as its depletion reshapes the gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2809388509,"There is increasing evidence that many risk loci found using genome-wide association studies are molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Here we introduce a new set of functional annotations based on causal posterior probabilities of fine-mapped molecular cis-QTLs, using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and BLUEPRINT consortia. We show that these annotations are more strongly enriched for heritability (5.84× for eQTLs; P = 1.19 × 10−31) across 41 diseases and complex traits than annotations containing all significant molecular QTLs (1.80× for expression (e)QTLs). eQTL annotations obtained by meta-analyzing all GTEx tissues generally performed best, whereas tissue-specific eQTL annotations produced stronger enrichments for blood- and brain-related diseases and traits. eQTL annotations restricted to loss-of-function intolerant genes were even more enriched for heritability (17.06×; P = 1.20 × 10−35). All molecular QTLs except splicing QTLs remained significantly enriched in joint analysis, indicating that each of these annotations is uniquely informative for disease and complex trait architectures. A new set of functional annotations based on fine-mapped molecular quantitative trait loci from GTEx and BLUEPRINT consortium data are enriched for disease heritability across 41 diseases and complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2809371807,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been shown to suppress immune pathologies by preferentially expanding regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, this therapy has been limited by off-target complications due to pathogenic cell expansion. Recent efforts have been focused on developing a more selective IL-2. It is well documented that certain anti-mouse IL-2 antibodies induce conformational changes that result in selective targeting of Tregs. We report the generation of a fully human anti-IL-2 antibody, F5111.2, that stabilizes IL-2 in a conformation that results in the preferential STAT5 phosphorylation of Tregs in vitro and selective expansion of Tregs in vivo. When complexed with human IL-2, F5111.2 induced remission of type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse model, reduced disease severity in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and protected mice against xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest that IL-2–F5111.2 may provide an immunotherapy to treat autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host disease. A human anti-IL-2 antibody that selectively expands regulatory T cells is developed in this study for clinical applications aiming to mitigate autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and to promote transplant tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2811244167,"Dysregulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling network is a prominent feature of breast cancers. However, clinical responses to drugs targeting this pathway have been modest, possibly because of dynamic changes in cellular signaling that drive resistance and limit drug efficacy. Using a quantitative chemoproteomics approach, we mapped kinome dynamics in response to inhibitors of this pathway and identified signaling changes that correlate with drug sensitivity. Maintenance of AURKA after drug treatment was associated with resistance in breast cancer models. Incomplete inhibition of AURKA was a common source of therapy failure, and combinations of PI3K, AKT or mTOR inhibitors with the AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 were highly synergistic and durably suppressed mTOR signaling, resulting in apoptosis and tumor regression in vivo. This signaling map identifies survival factors whose presence limits the efficacy of targeted therapies and reveals new drug combinations that may unlock the full potential of PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway inhibitors in breast cancer. Proteomic mapping of dynamic changes in kinase signaling after drug treatment identifies that AURKA inhibition is required for drug sensitivity, representing a new co-targeting opportunity with PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitors in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2810626145,"Background Population-based data on prevalence, causes of blindness and extent of ophthalmological coverage is required for efficient implementation and evaluation of ocular health programs. In view of the scarcity of prevalence data for visual impairment and blindness in Malaysia, this study aims to estimate the prevalence and causes of visual impairment (VI) in the elderly, using Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) survey technique. Methods Malaysia was divided into six regions, with each region consisting of 50 clusters. Multistage cluster sampling method was used and each cluster contained 50 residents aged 50 years and above. Eligible subjects were interviewed and pertinent demographic details, barriers to cataract surgery, medical and ocular history was noted. Subjects had visual acuity assessment with tumbling ‘E’ Snellen optotypes and ocular examination with direct ophthalmoscope. The primary cause of VI was documented. Results were calculated for individual zones and weighted average was used to obtain overall prevalence for the country. Inter-regional and overall prevalence for blindness, severe VI and moderate VI were determined. Causes of VI, cataract surgical coverage and barriers to cataract surgery were assessed. Results A total of 15,000 subjects were examined with a response rate of 95.3%. The age and gender-adjusted prevalence of blindness, severe visual impairment and moderate visual impairment were 1.2% (95% Confidence Interval: 1.0–1.4%), 1.0% (95%CI: 0.8–1.2%) and 5.9% (5.3–6.5%) respectively. Untreated cataract (58.6%), diabetic retinopathy (10.4%) and glaucoma (6.6%) were the commonest causes of blindness. Overall, 86.3% of the causes of blindness were avoidable. Cataract surgical coverage (CSC) in persons for blindness, severe visual impairment and moderate visual impairment was 90%, 86% and 66% respectively. Conclusion Increased patient education and further expansion of ophthalmological services are required to reduce avoidable blindness even further in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2810683575,"Liver fibrosis arises from dysregulated wound healing due to persistent inflammatory hepatic injury. Periostin is a nonstructural extracellular matrix protein that promotes organ fibrosis in adults. Here, we sought to identify the molecular mechanisms in periostin-mediated hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis in periostin−/− mice was attenuated as evidenced by significantly reduced collagen fibril density and liver stiffness compared with those in WT controls. A single dose of carbon tetrachloride caused similar acute liver injury in periostin−/− and WT littermates, and we did not detect significant differences in transaminases and major fibrosis-related hepatic gene expression between these two genotypes. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major periostin-producing liver cell type. We found that in primary rat HSCs in vitro, periostin significantly increases the expression levels and activities of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl oxidase–like (LOXL) isoforms 1–3. Periostin also induced expression of intra- and extracellular collagen type 1 and fibronectin in HSCs. Interestingly, periostin stimulated phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, which was sustained despite short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor I and II, indicating that periostin-mediated SMAD2/3 phosphorylation is independent of TGFβ receptors. Moreover, periostin induced the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT in HSCs. Notably, siRNA-mediated FAK knockdown failed to block periostin-induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. These results suggest that periostin promotes enhanced matrix stiffness in chronic liver disease by activating LOX and LOXL, independently of TGFβ receptors. Hence, targeting periostin may be of therapeutic benefit in combating hepatic fibrosis."

We present the discovery of three homologous cytochrome P450s from three monoterpene indole alkaloid-producing plants (Rauwolfia serpentina, Gelsemium sempervirens and Catharanthus roseus) that provide entry into two distinct alkaloid classes, the sarpagans and the β-carbolines. Our results highlight how a common enzymatic mechanism, guided by related but structurally distinct substrates, leads to either cyclization or aromatization."
https://openalex.org/W2810443508,"Schistosomiasis affects million people and its control is widely dependent on a single drug, praziquantel. Computational chemistry has led to the development of new tools that predict molecular properties related to pharmacological potential. We conducted a theoretical study of the imizadole alkaloids of Pilocarpus microphyllus (Rutaceae) with schistosomicidal properties. The molecules of epiisopiloturine, epiisopilosine, isopilosine, pilosine, and macaubine were evaluated using theory models (B3lyp/SDD, B3lyp/6-31+G(d,p), B3lyp/6-311++G(d,p)). Absorption, distribution, metabolization, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) predictions were used to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the alkaloids. After optimization, the molecules were submitted to molecular docking calculations with the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, thioredoxin glutathione reductase, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, arginase, uridine phosphorylase, Cathepsin B1 and histone deacetylase 8 enzymes, which are possible targets of Schistosoma mansoni. The results showed that B3lyp/6-311++G(d,p) was the optimal model to describe the properties studied. Thermodynamic analysis showed that epiisopiloturine and epiisopilosine were the most stable isomers; however, the epiisopilosine ligand achieved a superior interaction with the enzymes studied in the molecular docking experiments, which corroborated the results of previous experimental studies on schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2810044919,"Objectives Electronic health records (EHR) might be a useful resource to study the risk factors and clinical care of people with dementia. We sought to determine the diagnostic validity of dementia captured in linked EHR. Methods and findings A cohort of adults in linked primary care, hospital, disease registry and mortality records in England, [CALIBER (CArdiovascular disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records)]. The proportion of individuals with dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, vascular and rare dementia in each data source was determined. A comparison was made of symptoms and care between people with dementia and age-, sex- and general practice-matched controls, using conditional logistic regression. The lifetime risk and prevalence of dementia and mortality rates in people with and without dementia were estimated with random-effects Poisson models. There were 47,386 people with dementia: 12,633 with Alzheimer’s disease, 9540 with vascular and 1539 with rare dementia. Seventy-four percent of cases had corroborating evidence of dementia. People with dementia were more likely to live in a deprived area (conditional OR 1.26;95%CI:1.20–1.31 most vs least deprived), have documented memory impairment (cOR = 11.97;95%CI:11.24–12.75), falls (cOR = 2.36;95%CI:2.31–2.41), depression (cOR = 2.03; 95%CI:1.98–2.09) or anxiety (cOR = 1.27; 95%CI:1.23–1.32). The lifetime risk of dementia at age 65 was 9.2% (95%CI:9.0%-9.4%), in men and 14.9% (95%CI:14.7%-15.1%) in women. The population prevalence of recorded dementia increased from 0.3% in 2000 to 0.7% in 2010. A higher mortality rate was observed in people with than without dementia (IRR = 1.56;95%CI:1.54–1.58). Conclusions Most people with a record of dementia in linked UK EHR had some corroborating evidence for diagnosis. The estimated 10-year risk of dementia was higher than published population-based estimations. EHR are therefore a promising source of data for dementia research."

In order to identity high quality mulberry leaves that are suitable for healthy products to expand planting, 24 samples from three regions (Guangdong, Guangxi, Chongqing) in the south of China were quantified for two alkaloids (1-deoxynojirimycin and fagomine) and five phenols (chlorogenic acid, rutin, isoquercitrin, etc.) using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Additionally, the total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, antioxidant and glycosidase inhibitory activities (hypoglycemic activity) were tested using different assays (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP) to comprehensively evaluate the quality of the mulberry leaves. The contents of DNJ and fagomine ranged from 0.401±0.003 to 5.309±0.036 mg/g and from 0.279±0.031 to 2.300±0.060 mg/g, respectively. The main phenolic constituents were chlorogenic acid, rutin and isoquercitrin, with chlorogenic acid present in the highest concentrations, ranging from 3.104±0.191 to 10.050±0.143 mg/g. The antioxidant activity exhibited a tendency as follows: Guangxi > Guangdong > Chongqing, except for two samples from Chongqing, which showed the highest antioxidant activity. Based on our study, mulberry leaves from Guangdong and Guangxi could be future sources of natural hypoglycemic and antioxidant products."
https://openalex.org/W2809736008,"Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) plays an essential role in sulfur metabolism by regulating homeostatic levels of cysteine. Human CDO contains a post-translationally generated Cys93-Tyr157 cross-linked cofactor. Here, we investigated this Cys-Tyr cross-linking by incorporating unnatural tyrosines in place of Tyr157 via a genetic method. The catalytically active variants were obtained with a thioether bond between Cys93 and the halogen-substituted Tyr157, and we determined the crystal structures of both wild-type and engineered CDO variants in the purely uncross-linked form and with a mature cofactor. Along with mass spectrometry and 19F NMR, these data indicated that the enzyme could catalyze oxidative C-F or C-Cl bond cleavage, resulting in a substantial conformational change of both Cys93 and Tyr157 during cofactor assembly. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of Cys-Tyr cofactor biogenesis and may aid the development of bioinspired aromatic carbon-halogen bond activation."
https://openalex.org/W2809338903,"Although much focus is placed on cholera epidemics, the greatest burden occurs in settings in which cholera is endemic, including areas of South Asia, Africa and now Haiti1,2. Dhaka, Bangladesh is a megacity that is hyper-endemic for cholera, and experiences two regular seasonal outbreaks of cholera each year3. Despite this, a detailed understanding of the diversity of Vibrio cholerae strains circulating in this setting, and their relationships to annual outbreaks, has not yet been obtained. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of V. cholerae across several levels of focus and scale, at the maximum possible resolution. We analyzed bacterial isolates to define cholera dynamics at multiple levels, ranging from infection within individuals, to disease dynamics at the household level, to regional and intercontinental cholera transmission. Our analyses provide a genomic framework for understanding cholera diversity and transmission in an endemic setting. Whole-genome sequencing of 303 Vibrio cholerae isolates taken from individuals and households over time in Bangladesh provides insight into the dynamics of cholera diversity and transmission in an endemic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2811291463,"Background Sputum smear and culture conversions are an important indicator of treatment efficacy and help to determine treatment duration in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. There are no published studies of sputum smear and culture conversion of MDR-TB patients in Ethiopia. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare time to initial sputum smear and culture conversion and to identify factors influencing time to culture conversion. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all culture positive and rifampicin mono resistant (RR) or MDR-TB patients from September 2011 to August 2016 at University of Gondar Hospital. Sputum cultures were collected monthly and conversion was defined as two consecutive negative cultures taken at least 30 days apart. Data were entered using EpiData and exported to SPSS software for analysis. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the predictor variables for culture conversion. Results Overall, 85.5% (201/235) of the patients converted their cultures in a median of 72 days (inter-quartile range: 44–123). More than half (61.7%) of patients achieved culture conversion within three months. The median time for sputum smear conversion was 54 days (inter-quartile range: 31–72). The median time to culture conversion among HIV positive patients was significantly shorter at 67 days (95% CI, 55.4–78.6) compared to HIV negative patients, 77 days (95% CI, 63.9–90, p = 0.005). Independent predictors of significantly longer time to sputum culture conversion were underweight (aHR = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.52–0.97), HIV negative (aHR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.47–0.94) and treatment regimen composition (aHR = 0.57, 95% CI, 0.37–0.88). Significantly higher rate of culture conversion was observed in 2015 (aHR = 1.86, 95% CI, 1.1–3.14) and in 2016 (aHR = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.88–7.35) years of treatment compared to 2011. Conclusions Majority of patients achieved sputum culture conversion within three months and smear conversion within two months. Patients with identified risk factors were associated with delayed culture conversion. These factors should be considered during management of MDR-TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2809982881,"Understanding what people like about birds can help target advocacy for bird conservation. However, testing preferences for characteristics of birds is methodologically challenging, with bias difficult to avoid. In this paper we test whether preferred characteristics of birds in general are shared by the individual bird species the same people nominate as being those they consider most attractive. We then compare these results with the birds which appear most frequently in the imagery of conservation advocates. Based on a choice model completed by 638 general public respondents from around Australia, we found a preference for small colourful birds with a melodious call. However, when the same people were asked which five birds they found most attractive, 48% named no more than three, mostly large well-known species. Images displayed by a leading Australian bird conservation organisation also favoured large colourful species. The choice model results suggest conservation advocates can promote a much wider range of bird types as flagships, particularly smaller species that might otherwise be neglected."
https://openalex.org/W2811217869,"Posner-Schlossman-Syndrome (PSS) is clinically characterized by acute, recurrent, mild, unilateral uveitis anterior accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Fuchs´ Uveitis (FU) is a chronic, low-grade-inflammatory disorder, involving anterior uvea and vitreous. The clinical findings show remarkable similarities as well as differences. In our study, we determine the composition of immune mediators in aqueous humor of patients with PSS and FU and evaluate if immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation and IOP rises. Aqueous humor samples from 81 uveitis patients (= eyes) presenting with either PSS or FU were collected at one time point. Local intraocular antibody synthesis to rubella virus was confirmed in 65 patients, whereas 16 were tested positively for human cytomegalovirus. Thirteen patients with PSS and 10 patients with FU were treated with glaucoma medications. Additionally, 11 cataract patients acted as control group. Immune mediator concentrations were measured by Bio-Plex Pro assay. We observed in both PSS (IFN-γ: 174.9 pg/mL; TNF-α: 25.1 pg/mL) and FU (IFN-γ: 25.4 pg/mL; TNF-α: 27.2 pg/mL) groups a significantly increased level of T-helper 1 immune mediators compared to controls (IFN-γ, TNF-α: 0 pg/mL) [median]. Notably, PSS patients (IL-1RA: 73.4 pg/mL; IL-8: 199.4 pg/mL; IL-10: 33.4 pg/mL; IP-10: 126350 pg/mL) showed a stronger and more active ocular inflammatory response, than FU patients (IL-1RA: 4.3 pg/mL; IL-8: 72.4 pg/mL; IL-10: 1.6 pg/mL; IP-10: 57400 pg/mL). Furthermore, a negative correlation between mediators and IOP was seen in the PSS group, potentially caused by acetazolamide-treatment. Our findings show that immune mediators play a crucial role in specific viral intraocular inflammation and influence IOP levels. Remarkable similarities but also significant differences of immune mediator concentrations are apparent in PSS compared to FU. High concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-8, IL-10, and IP-10 correlate with active inflammation in PSS, while FU may trigger chronic inflammation. Our data also substantiated a very similar composition of cytokines in those patients from the PSS group suffering from ocular hypertension and thus offers a potential explanation model for a negative correlation between mediators and IOP."

This study investigated the association between the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the Mobile Phone Dependence Questionnaire (MPDQ) as a test of concurrent validity. Participants were 1,072 students aged between 9 and 18 years old (63% male and 37% female) from three primary schools and three secondary schools in Hong Kong. Correlations showed that scores on the two measures were moderately correlated, providing further evidence of each measure's validity. Confirmatory factor analysis that the IAT's factor structure was similar in both younger and older samples, suggesting that it is developmentally appropriate for primary and secondary school students. Latent Class Analysis showed that 4 classes or 5 classes are appropriate for IAT's score classification. ROC analyses showed similar rates of participants with high scores on the IAT and on the MPDQ. The outcomes have implications for the prevention and treatment of Internet and mobile phone addiction. Future research can establish norms for different ages, genders and cultural groups."
https://openalex.org/W2810122725,"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models allow the exogenous growth of human tumors, offering an irreplaceable preclinical tool for oncology research. Mice are the most commonly used host for human PDX models, however their small body size limits the xenograft growth, sample collection, and drug evaluation. Therefore, we sought to develop a novel rat model that could overcome many of these limitations. We knocked out Rag1, Rag2, and Il2rg in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated protein 9 technology. The development of lymphoid organs is significantly impaired in Rag1−1− Rag2−/− Il2rg−/Υ (designated as SD-RG) rats. Consequently, SD-RG rats are severely immunodeficient with an absence of mature T, B, and NK cells in the immune system. After subcutaneous injection of tumor cell lines of different origin, such as NCI-H460, U-87MG, and MDA-MB-231, the tumors grow significantly faster and larger in SD-RG rats than in nonobese diabetic–Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl / SzJ mice. Most important of all, we successfully established a PDX model of lung squamous cell carcinoma in which the grafts recapitulate the histopathologic features of the primary tumor for several passages. In conclusion, the severely immunodeficient SD-RG rats support fast growth of PDX compared with mice, thus holding great potential to serve as a new model for oncology research.—He, D., Zhang, J., Wu, W., Yi, N., He, W., Lu, P., Li, B., Yang, N., Wang, D., Xue, Z., Zhang, P., Fan, G., Zhu, X.

https://openalex.org/W2810642219,"Keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) are the major cytoskeletal component in epithelial cells. The dynamics of keratin IFs have been described to depend mostly on the actin cytoskeleton, but the rapid transport of fully polymerized keratin filaments has not been reported. In this work, we used a combination of photoconversion experiments and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 genome editing to study the role of microtubules and microtubule motors in keratin filament transport. We found that long keratin filaments, like other types of IFs, are transported along microtubules by kinesin-1. Our data revealed that keratin and vimentin are nonconventional kinesin-1 cargoes because their transport did not require kinesin light chains, which are a typical adapter for kinesin-dependent cargo transport. Furthermore, we found that the same domain of the kinesin heavy chain tail is involved in keratin and vimentin IF transport, strongly suggesting that multiple types of IFs move along microtubules using an identical mechanism.-Robert, A., Tian, P., Adam, S.

Premature termination on sense codons, for example, results in truncated proteins, whose accumulation could be detrimental to the cell. Nevertheless, some sense codons are prone to triggering premature termination, but the structural basis for this is unclear. To investigate premature termination, we determined a cryo-EM structure of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome bound with RF1 in response to a UAU (Tyr) sense codon. The structure reveals that RF1 recognizes a UAU codon similarly to a UAG stop codon, suggesting that sense codons induce premature termination because they structurally mimic a stop codon. Hydrophobic interaction between the nucleobase of U3 (the third position of the UAU codon) and conserved Ile-196 in RF1 is important for misreading the UAU codon. Analyses of RNA binding in ribonucleoprotein complexes or by amino acids reveal that Ile–U packing is a frequent protein–RNA-binding motif with key functional implications.

Seed biochemistry of the new species and pollen micromorphology (only one of the two species) are also studied. Based on the plastid sequence data, the new taxa are nested in a well-supported monophyletic group that includes Argocoffeopsis and Calycosiphonia. Within this clade, three well-supported subclades are recovered that are morphologically easy to diagnose: (1) Calycosiphonia (excluding C. pentamera), (2) Argocoffeopsis (excluding A. fosimondi and A. spathulata), and (3) a clade including the above excluded species, in addition to the new species. Based on the results, Kupeantha, a new genus of five species, is described, including two new Critically Endangered taxa from the Highlands of Cameroon: Kupeantha ebo and K. kupensis.

https://openalex.org/W2810118784,"Office workers spend most of their working day sitting, and prolonged sitting has been associated with increased risk of poor health. Standing in meetings has been proposed as a strategy by which to reduce workplace sitting but little is known about the standing experience. This study documented workers' experiences of standing in normally seated meetings. Twenty-five participants (18+ years), recruited from three UK universities, volunteered to stand in 3 separate, seated meetings that they were already scheduled to attend. They were instructed to stand when and for however long they deemed appropriate, and gave semi-structured interviews after each meeting. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using Framework Analysis. Four themes, central to the experience of standing in meetings, were extracted: physical challenges to standing; implications of standing for meeting engagement; standing as norm violation; and standing as appropriation of power. Participants typically experienced some physical discomfort from prolonged standing, apparently due to choosing to stand for as long as possible, and noted practical difficulties of fully engaging in meetings while standing. Many participants experienced marked psychological discomfort due to concern at being seen to be violating a strong perceived sitting norm. While standing when leading the meeting was felt to confer a sense of power and control, when not leading the meeting participants felt uncomfortable at being misperceived to be challenging the authority of other attendees. These findings reveal important barriers to standing in normally-seated meetings, and suggest strategies for acclimatising to standing during meetings. Physical discomfort might be offset by building standing time slowly and incorporating more sit-stand transitions. Psychological discomfort may be lessened by notifying other attendees about intentions to stand. Organisational buy-in to promotional strategies for standing may be required to dispel perceptions of sitting norms, and to progress a wider workplace health and wellbeing agenda."

https://openalex.org/W2809901404,"We determine an optimal protocol for temozolomide using population variability and dynamic optimization techniques inspired by artificial intelligence. We use a Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model based on Faivre and coauthors (Faivre, et al., 2013) for the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide, as well as the pharmacodynamics of its efficacy. For toxicity, which is measured by the nadir of the normalized absolute neutrophil count, we formalize the myelosuppression effect of temozolomide with the physiological model of Panetta and coauthors (Panetta, et al., 2003). We apply the model to a population with variability as given in Panetta and coauthors (Panetta, et al., 2003). Our optimization algorithm is a variant in the class of Monte-Carlo tree search algorithms. We do not impose periodicity constraint on our solution. We set the objective of tumor size minimization while not allowing more severe toxicity levels than the standard Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) regimen. The protocol we propose achieves higher efficacy in the sense that –compared to the usual MTD regimen– it divides the tumor size by approximately 7.66 after 336 days –the 95% confidence interval being [7.36–7.97]. The toxicity is similar to MTD. Overall, our protocol, obtained with a very flexible method, gives significant results for the present case of temozolomide and calls for further research mixing operational research or artificial intelligence and clinical research in oncology."
https://openalex.org/W2811469472,"Although cirrhosis is a key risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mounting evidence indicates that in a subset of patients presenting with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) HCC manifests in the absence of cirrhosis. Given the sheer size of the ongoing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) epidemic and the dismal prognosis associated with late-stage primary liver cancer there is an urgent need for HCC surveillance in the NASH population. Using serum levels of HCC biomarkers as vectors and biopsy-proven HCC or no HCC as outputs / binary classifier, a supervised learning campaign was undertaken to develop a minimally invasive technique for making a diagnosis of HCC in a clinically relevant model of NASH. Adult mice randomized to control diet or a fast food diet (FFD) were followed for up to 14 mo and serum level of a panel of HCC-relevant biomarkers was compared with liver biopsies at 3 and 14 mo. Both NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and hepatic hydroxyproline content were elevated at 3 and 14 mo on FFD. Picrosirius red staining of liver sections revealed a filigree pattern of fibrillar collagen deposition with no cirrhosis at 14 mo on FFD. Nevertheless, 46% of animals bore one or more tumors on their livers confirmed as HCC in hematoxylin-eosin-stained liver sections. In this training set, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis for serum levels of the HCC biomarkers osteopontin (OPN), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) returned concordance-statistic/area under ROC curve of ≥ 0.89. Serum levels of OPN (threshold, 218 ng/mL; sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 86%), AFP (136 ng/mL; 91%; 97%) and DKK1 (2.4 ng/mL; 82%; 81%) diagnostic for HCC were confirmed in a test set comprising mice on control diet or FFD and mice subjected to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. These data suggest that levels of circulating OPN, AFP and DKK1 can be used to make a diagnosis of HCC in a clinically relevant model of NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2810406194,"Introduction The objective was to analyze whether socioeconomic factors related to the context and those related to the model of care—specifically the coverage of primary care by the Family Health Strategy (ESF)—had an impact on hospitalizations due to heart failure (HF) and stroke, in the State of São Paulo/Brazil between 1998 and 2013. Methods A longitudinal ecological study involving 645 municipalities was conducted in the state of São Paulo/Brazil from 1998 to 2013, using the Hospital Information System (SIH–DataSUS database). The hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions: Stroke and heart failure (HF) that correspond to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10): I50, I63 to I67; I69, G45 to G46 were analyzed longitudinally during the period indicated regarding the percentage of people covered by the Family Health Program (PSF) adjusted for confounders (population size, gross domestic product -GDP and human development index- HDI). Results There was a significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations for heart failure and stroke per 10000 (inhabitants) in the period (p <0.0001), with a significant relationship with increased proportion of ESF (p <0.0001), and this remained significant even when possible confounders (population size, GDP and HDI) were included in the model (p <0.0001). Conclusions GDP per capita was close to or higher than that if many European countries, which shows the relevance of the study. The health care model based on the Family Health Strategy positively impacted hospitalization indicators for heart failure and stroke, indicating that this model is effective in the prevention of primary care sensitive conditions."

For the 5-year follow-up studies, 75 participants (aged 1-14 years) with early-onset FA and 81 healthy peers were included.Participants were diagnosed with FA using antibody/cytokine content immunoassay tests. Medical history, including BMI z-scores, was completed using data obtained in response to a validated allergic questionnaire that incorporated the SCOFF and EAT-8 screening questionnaires for ED. FA was confirmed if total IgE was elevated, specific sIgE to food allergens exceeded 0.7 kUA/L and if manifestations were observed. Screening for ED was considered positive if two or more SCOFF and EAT-8 items were confirmed.In the FA+ group, 50% of female participants and 6.7% of their healthy female peers reported ED. An ED+ result was more frequent in FA+ individuals than in their healthy peers (p = 0.046) although the association is weak. In the FA+/ED+ group, 25.3% of the participants were underweight, and 14.7% were overweight compared to their peers where this reached respectively 4.2% and 2.8% (p<0.005). 74% of the FA+/ED+ individuals reported elimination diet implementation and only 15% declared it was medically consulted. The prevalence of ED in the FA+ male group was consistently correlated with lack of confidence in FA issues (r = 0.5424) and in the FA+ female group with applied medical procedures (r = 0.7069; p<0.005).These findings suggest that participants with FA especially struggling with lack of confidence in FA issues and those following an uncontrolled, restrictive elimination diet are more prone to food aversion and ED than their healthy peers. Applied procedures are necessary, and their neglect is associated with FA deterioration; however, the possibility of ED and biopsychosocial implications development should not be underestimated."

This study examined the heterogeneity of adolescent health risk behaviors and the associations between demographic characteristics and subgroup membership in rural western China. Methods In fall 2015, 2805 students from rural middle schools in Sichuan Province were surveyed using the Health-Related Behavior Questionnaire for Adolescents. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of adolescents with distinct patterns of health risk behaviors. Differences in class membership related to selected demographic characteristics were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results A four-class model emerged: (1) high-risk group (n = 108, 4.0%), (2) high-physical-inactivity and suicide-risk group (n = 340, 12.1%), (3) moderate-risk group (n = 897, 32.0%), and (4) low-risk group (n = 1460, 52.1%).

The influence of input torque and rotational speed on Meshing Efficiency is analyzed. The results show that Sliding friction coefficient is an important factor affecting the Meshing Efficiency of gears.

Substitution of six of the eight Phe residues in the ECD with Ala resulted in loss of function or significantly increased the EC50 and also altered the maximal response to the partial GlyR agonist taurine compared with glycine in those receptor variants that were functional. Substitutions with other amino acids, combined with examination of nearby residues that could potentially interact with these Phe residues, suggested interactions that could be important for GlyR function, and possibly similar interactions could contribute to the function of other members of the Cys-loop receptor family.

https://openalex.org/W2811365018,"Background Country decisions to scale-up “test and treat” approaches for HIV depend on consideration of both the health and economic consequences of such investments. Evidence about economic impacts of expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision is particularly relevant for decisions regarding foreign assistance levels for HIV/AIDS programs. We used baseline data from the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) cluster randomized controlled trial in Kenya and Uganda to examine the association between HIV status, CD4+ T-cell counts, viral suppression, and multiple indicators of economic well-being. Methods and findings Socio-economic surveys were conducted in households with HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults sampled after a census of 32 communities participating in the SEARCH trial (NCT01864603). Data were obtained for 11,500 individuals from 5,884 households in study communities. Participants were stratified based on their own HIV status as well as CD4 counts and viral suppression status if they were HIV-positive. HIV-negative participants residing in households with no HIV-positive adults were considered separately from HIV-negative participants residing in households with ≥1 HIV-positive adult. Generalized estimating equation models were used to examine the relationship between HIV status, CD4 counts, ART, viral suppression, and outcomes of employment, self-reported illness, lost time from usual activities due to illness, healthcare utilization, health expenditures, and hospitalizations. In all models, HIV-negative participants in households with no HIV-positive persons were the reference group. There was no significant difference in the probability of being employed between HIV-positive participants with CD4>500 and the reference group of HIV-negative participants residing in households with no HIV-positive adults (marginal effect, ME, 1.49 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, CI, -1.09, 4.08). However, HIV-positive participants with CD4 351–500 were less likely to be employed than the reference group (ME -4.50, 95% CI -7.99, -1.01), as were HIV-positive participants with CD4 ≤350 (ME -7.41, 95% CI -10.96, -3.85). Similarly, there was no significant difference in employment likelihood between HIV-negative participants who resided in households with a CD4>500 HIV-positive person and the reference group (ME -1.78, 95% CI -5.16, 1.59). HIV-negative participants residing with an HIV-positive person with CD4 351–500, however, were less likely to be employed than the reference group (ME -7.03, 95% CI -11.49, -2.57), as were people residing with a household member with CD4 ≤350 (ME -6.28, 95% CI -10.76, -1.80). HIV-positive participants in all CD4 categories were more likely to have lost time from usual activities due to illness and have incurred healthcare expenditures. Those with CD4>500 had better economic outcomes than those with CD4 351–500, even among those not virally suppressed (p = 0.004) and not on ART (p = 0.01). Conclusions Data from a large population-representative sample of households in east Africa showed a strong association between the health of HIV-positive persons and economic outcomes. The findings suggest there may be economic benefits associated with maintaining high CD4 counts, both for HIV-positive persons and their HIV-negative household members. The association of high CD4 counts with improved outcomes is consistent with the hypothesis that early ART initiation can avert declines in employment and other economic outcomes. Prospective longitudinal evaluation is needed to assess the causal impact of early ART initiation on economic functioning of households."
https://openalex.org/W2810223831,"One feature of diabetes is the failure of pancreatic β cells to produce insulin, but the molecular mechanisms leading to this failure remain unclear. Increasing evidence supports a role for protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) in the development and function of healthy pancreatic β cells. Previously, our group identified the adaptor protein Nck1 as a negative regulator of PERK. Indeed, we demonstrated that Nck1, by directly binding PERK autophosphorylated on Tyr561, limits PERK activation and signaling. Accordingly, we found that stable depletion of Nck1 in β cells promotes PERK activation and signaling, increases insulin biosynthesis, and improves cell viability in response to diabetes-related stresses. Herein, we explored the therapeutic potential of abrogating the interaction between Nck and PERK to improve β-cell function and survival. To do so, we designed and used a peptide containing the minimal PERK sequence involved in binding Nck1 conjugated to the cell-permeable protein transduction domain from the HIV protein TAT. In the current study, we confirm that the synthetic TAT-Tyr(P)561 phosphopeptide specifically binds the SH2 domain of Nck and prevents Nck interaction with PERK, thereby promoting basal PERK activation. Moreover, we report that treatment of β cells with TAT-Tyr(P)561 inhibits glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis, whereas it enhances insulin production and secretion. Taken together, our results support the potential of sequestering Nck using a synthetic peptide to enhance basal PERK activation and create more robust β cells."

Corticosteroids, an anti-fibrogenic compound, have been used to treat early stage palmar fibromatosis, but the mechanism is unknown. We investigated the inhibitory mechanism effect of corticosteroids in the murine model of fibromatosis nodule as well as in cultured FSCs. Quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for markers of myofibroblasts (α-smooth muscle actin and type III collagen) were used to examine the effect of dexamethasone on myofibroblasic differentiation of FSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling and its downstream targets were examined using western blot analysis. TGF-β1 expression in FSCs before and after dexamethasone treatment was compared. In addition, inhibition of TGF-β1 expression was examined using RNA interference (RNAi) on FSCs, both in vitro and in vivo. Treating FSCs with dexamethasone inhibited FSCs’ myofibroblastic differentiation in vitro. Treating FSCs with dexamethasone before or after implantation further inhibited formation of fibromatosis nodules. Dexamethasone suppressed expression of TGF-β1 and pSmad2/3 by FSCs in vitro. TGF-β1 knockdown FSCs showed reducing myofibroblastic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, addition of TGF-β1 abolished dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of myofibroblastic differentiation. Dexamethasone inhibits the myofibroblastic differentiated potential of FSCs both in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of TGF-β1 expression in FSCs. TGF-β1 plays a key role in myofibroblastic differentiation."
