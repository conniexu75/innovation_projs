Deficiencies in this essential fatty acid are reportedly associated with neuronal function, cancer, and inflammation. Here, using new lipidomic analyses employing high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode-array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer, a novel series of endogenous mediators was identified in blood, leukocytes, brain, and glial cells as 17S-hydroxy-containing docosanoids denoted as docosatrienes (the main bioactive member of the series was 10,17S-docosatriene) and 17S series resolvins. These novel mediators were biosynthesized via epoxide-containing intermediates and proved potent (pico- to nanomolar range) regulators of both leukocytes reducing infiltration in vivo and glial cells blocking their cytokine production. These results indicate that DHA is the precursor to potent protective mediators generated via enzymatic oxygenations to novel docosatrienes and 17Sseries resolvins that each regulate events of interest in inflammation and resolution.

Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999Google Scholar). The tight control of the enzymes that regulate conversion of unesterified arachidonic acid to key classes of mediators, including prostaglandins, thromboxane, leukotrienes, and lipoxins highlights the importance of arachidonic acid as an essential fatty acid and precursor of these potent bioactive eicosanoids (2Samuelsson B. Dahlén S.E. Lindgren J.Å. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). The potential for dysregulation of each of the individual classes of eicosanoids has been suspect as important molecular events associated with several human diseases, including, inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. The control in physiologic systems of these lipid mediators is an ongoing area of intense investigation, because early results indicated that deficiency disease can be initiated by exclusion of fat from the diet (3Burr G.O. Burr M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1929; 82: 345Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and arachidonic acid was also uncovered as the precursor to prostanoids that play key roles in the regulation of parturition and renal function (4Samuelsson B.

Les Prix Nobel: Nobel Prizes, Presentations, Biographies and Lectures. Almqvist & Wiksell, Stockholm1982: 129-148Google Scholar). Results from recent studies indicate that arachidonic acid is not the only fatty acid precursor that is transformed to potent bioactive mediators in inflammation and resolution (6Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Both DHA1 and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the well-known ω-3 fatty acids present in fish oils, appear to be effective as dietary supplements in the treatment of a wide range of human disorders (8De Caterina R. Endres S. Kristensen S.D. Schmidt E.B. n-3 Fatty Acids and Vascular Disease. Springer-Verlag, London1993Google Scholar, 9Khair-El-Din T.A. Sicher S.C. Vazquez M.A. Wright W.J. Lu C.Y. J.

For example, ω-3 fatty acid supplementation is reported to have a beneficial impact in treating asthma, atherosclerosis, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders (for a recent review, see Ref. 12Calder P.C. Lipids. 2001; 36: 1007-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Of interest, the lack of ω-3 fatty acid consumption has also been shown to correlate with mental depression (13Hibbeln J.R. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Several clinical trials aimed at testing the therapeutic value of ω-3 supplementation have convincingly established that ω-3 fatty acids can display beneficial actions reducing the incidence and the severity of disease (14GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators. Lancet. 1999; 354: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). In many of these, aspirin therapy was also used in conjunction, although apparently unintentionally, along with the ω-3 supplementation (i.e. see Refs. 14GISSI-Prevenzione Investigators. Lancet. 1999; 354: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3741) Google Scholar and 15Marchioli R. Barzi F. Bomba E. Chieffo C. Di Gregorio D. Di Mascio R. Franzosi M.G. Geraci E.

Circulation. 2002; 105: 1897-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Recent results evaluating the impact of aspirin in the transformation of ω-3 in inflammatory exudates in vivo, namely acute inflammation and spontaneous resolution, demonstrate that DHA and EPA are each converted via independent pathways to potent bioactive local mediators. These new di- and tri-hydroxy-containing compounds derived from ω-3 fatty acids were termed “resolvins,” because they are (a) formed within the resolution phase of acute inflammatory response, at least in part, as cell-cell interactions products, (b) “stop” neutrophil entry to sites of inflammation, and (c) reduce exudates (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). These findings, together with earlier results (16Bazan N.G. Nestle Nutrition Workshop Series. 1992; 28: 121-133Google Scholar, 17Bazan N.G. Birkle D.L. Reddy T.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggest that ω-3 fatty acids, in addition to arachidonic acid, an n-6 fatty acid (2Samuelsson B. Dahlén S.E. Lindgren J.Å. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar, 4Samuelsson B. Les Prix Nobel: Nobel Prizes, Presentations, Biographies and Lectures. Almqvist & Wiksell, Stockholm1982: 153-174Google Scholar), can serve as precursors for potent bioactive molecules with distinct functions (22Serhan C.N. Curr. Med. Chem.-Anti-Inflammatory & Anti-Allergy Agents. 2002; 1: 177-192Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that the resolvins and related compounds identified might represent the active products responsible, at least in part, for the many reported beneficial responses obtained in clinical studies with patients given high doses of ω-3 supplementation (see Refs. 6Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar and 7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholarand references within). Another aspect for the many years of sustained interest in DHA lies in the fact that the brain is lipid-rich and that DHA is highly enriched in the membranes of brain synapses and in the retina (16Bazan N.G. Nestle Nutrition Workshop Series. 1992; 28: 121-133Google Scholar). DHA declines in brain neurons with age and may result in loss in mental function (20Salem Jr., N. Litman B. Kim H.-Y. Gawrisch K. Lipids. 2001; 36: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Also, it is now clear that DHA is required for fetal brain development and is held to be critical in the newborn for appropriate development and intelligence (23Salem Jr., N. Wegher B. Mena P. Uauy R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Hence, from these and many other recent studies (24Lands W.E.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 676: 46-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is now apparent that, in humans, DHA serves a critical role in both physiologic and pathophysiologic responses. Our recent finding that aspirin therapy can lead to the biosynthesis of unique series of 17R resolvins generated from DHA led us to question whether the significant roles reported for DHA in the many biological systems noted above were related to DHA conversion to potent local bioactive mediators. The reason for this line of thinking is that in most experimental systems, where the actions of either DHA or EPA were assessed either clinically or in animal models, the concentrations required to evoke beneficial actions are usually in the high microgram to high milligram range. In this context, it is difficult to envision direct and specific molecular actions responsible for the many beneficial outcomes from in vivo studies. Thus, with the coordinates (physical and biologic properties) in hand for the new aspirin-triggered 17R series resolvins obtained using lipidomics and bioassays (see Ref. 7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), we determined in the present experiments whether DHA is converted to bioactive mediators de novo. The present results indicate that (a) DHA is a precursor to a potent family of bioactive docosanoids that include novel docosatrienes as well as the 17S epimer resolvin series generated in human blood cells, mouse brain, and by human glial cells; (b) these compounds display potent actions on leukocyte trafficking as well as on glial cell functions down-regulating cytokines expression. Hence, our present results indicate that DHA is a precursor in novel biosynthetic pathways to previously unrecognized potent molecules. Zymosan A and soybean lipoxygenase (fraction IV) were purchased from Sigma Co. (St. Louis, MO). Docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, DHA) was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI); other synthetic standards, hydroxy fatty acids, and intermediates used for MS identification and fragment ion references were purchased from Cascade Biochem Ltd. (Reading, UK). Authentic docosanoids of known hydroxy-containing products from DHA used to characterize physical properties, i.e. LC-MS-MS diagnostic ions and MS-MS spectra, were 4S-hydroxy-5E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid (4S-HDHA), and the racemate 17R/S-hydroxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid (denoted 17R/S-HDHA) purchased from Penn Bio-Organics (Bellefonte, PA). For each, NMR analyses were used to establish stereochemistry (i.e. double-bond configurations). Using recombinant enzymes (i.e. COX-2, 5-LO, and others) and additional reactions, we prepared and isolated 10,17S-docosatriene, 10,17R-docosatriene, 7S,17S-diHDHA, 4S,17S-diHDHA, 4S,5,17S-triHDHA, 4S,11,17S-triHDHA, 7S,8,17S-triHDHA, and 7S,16,17S-triHDHA, similar to (6Serhan C.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25372-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Additional materials used in LC-MS-MS analyses were from vendors reported in (6Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar,25Clish C.B. Levy B.D. Chiang N. Tai H.-H. Serhan C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25372-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The reference materials were prepared by incubation of DHA and soybean lipoxygenase (Type IV) and/or 5-LO from potato using different ratios of substrate to enzyme that gave specific product profiles (see below). Each reaction condition used was optimized according to UV spectrometric monitoring and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode-array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer (LC-PDA-MS-MS, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). In brief, soybean lipoxygenase (260 kilounits, 14 mg of protein/ml, 360 kilounits/mg of protein, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was incubated with DHA (100 μg) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's PBS (phosphate-buffered saline with Ca+2/Mg+2, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. To obtain 17S-hydro(peroxy)-DHA (H(p)DHA), aliquots (2 ml) were removed at the initial 15-min interval. To obtain both di- and tri-HDHA, lipoxygenase (260 kilounits), and/or potato 5-LO was added to the remaining 17S-H(p)DHA incubations in one round-bottomed flask held at 2–4 °C. At 15-min intervals, product profiles were assessed using LC-PDA-MS-MS following NaBH4 reduction. The 17R series resolvins were prepared as in a previous study (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). 17S-H(p)DHA was prepared and incubated with hemoglobin (Sigma H7379A) to identify non-enzymatic transformation products. Incubations were carried out according to those used for hemoglobin-catalyzed transformation of 15S-hydro(peroxy)eicosatetraenoic acid (H(p)ETE) (26Sok D.-E. Chung T. Sih C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, 17S-H(p)DHA (30 μg/ml) was incubated with human hemoglobin (300 μg/ml) in PBS (pH 7.4, 37 °C) for 15 min. Incubations were terminated by acidification to pH 3.2 and taken for immediate solid-phase extraction (SepPak). Mono-, di-, and trihydroxy docosanoid reaction products were each separated by combined column chromatography (CC7) followed by solid-phase extraction. Products were identified and quantitated by LC-PDA-MS-MS lipidomic analysis. Human whole (venous) blood (10 ml) was collected with or without heparin from healthy volunteers (that declined taking medication for ∼2 weeks before donation; Brigham and Women's Hospital protocol 88-02642). Following collection, whole blood was immediately incubated with DHA (10μg) in a covered water bath for 40 min (37 °C). Human PMN were freshly isolated from the whole blood by Ficoll gradient and enumerated as in a previous study (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). PMN (30–50 × 106 cells/ml) were exposed to zymosan A (100μg/ml, Sigma) followed by addition of either 17S-hydroxy-DHA (3 μg/ml) or DHA (3 μg/ml). Cell suspensions were incubated for (37 °C, 40 min) in a covered water bath. For identification of epoxide-containing intermediates, isolated human PMN (30–50 × 106cells/incubation) were incubated with 17S-hydro(peroxy)-DHA and zymosan A (100 μg/ml) in Hanks' buffer containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 15 min). The incubations were immediately poured into 10 volumes of cold acidified (apparent pH 3.1) methanol and kept (30 min, 4 °C) before analysis. Lipidomic and lipid mediator profile analyses were performed as in previous studies (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 27Gronert K. Clish C.B. Romano M. Serhan C.N. Lianos E.A. Eicosanoid Protocols.

Human glial cells (DBTRG-05MG, ATCC) were cultured as in a previous study (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Media were removed from semiconfluent monolayers (∼75%) and replaced with Hanks' buffer (37 °C, 10 ml) containing HEPES, 10 mm, pH 7.4, and [1-14C]DHA (55 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., 10 μm), or unlabeled C22:6 (∼10 μm, Oxford Biomedical Research) was added in EtOH (5–10 μl). Cells were placed in an incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 90 min, and aliquots (100 μl) were removed at 30-min intervals and analyzed by scintillation counting to determine cellular [1-14C]DHA. At 90 min, buffer was removed and cells were washed with Hanks' buffer (10 ml, 37 °C). Hanks' buffer (10 ml, 37 °C) containing HEPES (10 mm, pH 7.4) and CaCl2 (1.6 mm) was added to the flasks, and cells were exposed to either zymosan A (100 ng/ml), calcium ionophore (A23187, 5 μm), or buffer (with vehicle, 0.01% EtOH) alone. Cells were placed in an incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 (37 °C for 30 min), and aliquots were removed at initiation and 30 min post agonist addition to assess the cellular release of [14C]DHA and 14C-labeled oxygenated products. After 30 min buffer was removed and immediately added to 2 volumes of MeOH (4 °C) and kept at −80 °C for >30 min. Cells were detached, lysed with 5 n NaOH and neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 8.0) to quantitate cell-associated 1-14C-labeled DHA and novel docosanoids carrying label. For the experiments aimed at determining the sites for DHA incorporation into major classes of phospholipids, triglycerides, and neutral lipids, incubations (37 °C, 30 min) were stopped with CHCl3/MeOH (2:5, v/v) and cells were detached. Lipids were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (29Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. 2nd Ed. Chapman & Hall, London1994Google Scholar), materials from the organic phase were suspended in chloroform, and the identity of lipid classes was established with authentic standards and standard procedures (29Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. 2nd Ed. Chapman & Hall, London1994Google Scholar). Phosphorimaging analysis was used for quantitation of the 14C content and demonstrated that 80–86% of the total cell associated DHA was in phospholipid and ∼11–18% in neutral lipid pools (range from two separate experiments). DHA was predominantly acylated into phosphatidylethanolamine (39–41%) and phosphatidylcholine (29–36%), findings that are consistent with studies in human platelets (30Fischer S. Schacky C.v. Siess W. Strasser T. Weber P.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), neutrophils (31Tou J.-s. Lipids. 1986; 21: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and a rat glioma cell line (32Garcia M.C. Kim H.-Y. Brain Res. 1997; 768: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Selected samples were taken for additional analysis and extracted, and methyl formate-eluted products were analyzed by PDA-MS-MS for identification as in Ref. 7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar. Reversed-phase HPLC radioprofiles were carried out using a 1100 series liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies) as done previously (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar,27Gronert K. Clish C.B. Romano M. Serhan C.N. Lianos E.A. Eicosanoid Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 119-144Google Scholar). Radioactivity in 60-s fractions was quantified with an LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman). Human recombinant COX-2 was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells (ATCC). The microsomal fractions (∼8 μl) were suspended in Tris (100 mm, pH 8.0) as done previously (33George H.J. Van Dyk D.E. Straney R.A. Trzaskos J.M. Copeland R.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). [1-14C]Docosahexaenoic acid (55 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., 10 μm) was added to rCOX-2 microsomal membrane suspensions followed immediately by arachidonic acid (C20:4, Cayman Chemical) at increasing concentrations or vehicle alone (0.5% EtOH). Suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with a solution (4 °C) containing ether:MeOH:citrate (30:4:1, v/v). The organic phase was collected and analyzed by thin layer chromatography at 4 °C using as a mobile phase the organic fraction of ethyl acetate:2,2,4-trimethylpentane:acetic acid:water (110:50:20:100, v/v) as in a previous study (34Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total and product-specific radioactivity were each quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Human rCOX-2 conversion of DHA (10 μm) to specific products was 95 ± 0.5% (n = 6) and was used as the 100% value to determine the impact of arachidonic acid on conversion of DHA. In the 6- to 8-week-old male FVB mice (fed laboratory rodent diet 5001 (Lab Diet, Purina Mills) containing 1.49% eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.86% DHA, and <0.25% arachidonic acid, inflammatory exudates were initiated by intra-pouch injection of recombinant mouse TNFα (100 ng/pouch, R&D Systems). Four hours later mice were sacrificed, in accordance with the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals protocol 02570, air pouch lavages were collected, and cells were enumerated. Inhibition of TNFα (100 ng/pouch) stimulated PMN infiltration, with intravenous tail injection of S series resolvins and docosatrienes (as prepared with biogenic synthesis; see below) was determined with pouch lavages taken at 4 h. To assess the impact of novel compounds in peritonitis, mice (FVB) were anesthetized with isoflurane and docosatrienes, andS series and R series of resolvins (suspended in 120 μl of saline) were administered intravenously and followed (∼1–1.5 min) by an intraperitoneal injection of zymosan A (1 mg) in 1 ml of sterile saline. Two hours after the intraperitoneal injections, mice were euthanized and peritoneal lavages were rapidly collected for enumeration. Cytosensor® analyses were evaluated using a Cytosensor® microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) and computer workstation as in previous work (35Chiang N. Gronert K. Clish C.B. O'Brien J.A. Freeman M.W.

Also, reverse transcription-PCR analyses of TNFα-induced IL1β was carried out according to a previous study (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Because brain and blood share many biochemical and signaling pathways in common (37Moore M.A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Serhan C.N. Fierro I.M. Chiang N. Pouliot M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3650-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we compared the profiles of bioactive docosanoids produced by murine brain, human blood, and leukocytes to those generated by glial cells. To this end, we first determined whether human blood generates bioactive docosanoids such as the recently described resolvins (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) by examining the transformation of DHA in human whole blood and endogenous products produced by murine brain on addition of agonists and utilizing LC-PDA-MS-MS-based lipidomic analysis. Fig.1A shows representative LC-MS selective ion monitoring for [M-1] at m/z 375 for trihydroxy-containing docosanoids and m/z 359 for dihydroxy- and m/z 343 for monohydroxy-containing docosanoids, respectively. These results demonstrate for the first time that, in addition to docosanoids with physical properties similar to those of the aspirin-triggered 17R series resolvins generated in resolving murine inflammatory exudates (7Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R. Mirick G. Moussignac R.-L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar), shown in Fig. 1, human blood converts DHA to 17S series resolvins as well as novel dihydroxy-containing docosanoids. LC-MS plots of selective ion chromatograms and mass spectra also showed the presence of novel dihydroxy-containing docosanoids. For example, the MS-MS spectrum of a dihydroxy-containing DHA is reported in Fig. 1B with prominent fragment ions consistent with the structure shown in the insert, namely 10,17S-dihydroxydocosahexaenoate and ions atm/z 359 (M-H), 341 (M-H-H2O), 323 (M-H-2H2O), 315 (M-H-CO2), 297 (M-H-H2O-CO2), and 277 (M-H-H2O-CO2-2H). Additional diagnostic ions consistent with the carbon 10 and carbon 17 alcohol-containing positions were observed at m/z 153, 163, 181, 189, 205, 217 (216-CO2+H), 243 (261-H2O+H), 261, and 289. The UV spectrum of this docosanoid gave a maximum absorbance wavelength (λmax) of 269 nm with shoulders at 260 and 279 nm indicating the presence of a conjugated triene chromophore (i.e. three conjugated double bonds) in the new structure. The configuration of the alcohol at position 17 was confirmed as being in predominately the S configuration using materials prepared with isolated lipoxygenases and DHA as substrate with co-elution experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). The predominant products, also observed from endogenous sources of DHA in isolated murine brain incubated with ionophore, were 10,17S-docosatriene and 4S,17S-diHDHA (n = 3, not shown). Taken together with the chromatographic behavior, these physical properties were consistent with the formation of 10,17S-diHDHA (docosatriene), a novel carbon 17 position-oxygenated product formed from DHA. We questioned whether these 17-hydroxy-carrying docosanoids from human whole blood and murine brain could be formed via 15-lipoxygenation, which is an enzymatic activity in human leukocytes and is induced during the resolution phase of acute inflammation (39Levy B.D. Clish C.B. Schmidt B. Gronert K. Serhan C.N. Nature Immunol. 2001; 2: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) and whether these new compounds were biosynthetically interrelated. Along these lines, earlier results with isolated soybean 15-lipoxygenase showed that this enzyme can rapidly transform DHA to 17S-HDHAin vitro (34Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that were confirmed during the course of the present experiments with isolated enzyme and LC-PDA-MS-MS analyses (n > 12, not shown). Results shown in Fig. 1demonstrate that human whole blood generated 17S-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (λmax of 237 nm and diagnostic MS-MS ion m/z 245) from DHA. This human product of whole blood was matched in physical properties to those of authentic 17S-hydroxydocosahexenoate produced via biogenic synthesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addit"

Mutation of the serine phosphorylation sites 116, 617, and 1179 to alanines affected the phospho-state of at least one other site, demonstrating cooperation between multiple phosphorylation events, whereas mutation of serine 635 to alanine did not cause compensation. Mutation of serines 116 and 617 to alanine promoted a greater protein-protein interaction with hsp90 and Akt and greater phosphorylation on serine 1179, the major site for Akt phosphorylation. More importantly, using alanine substitutions, Ser-116 is important for agonist, but not basal NO release, Ser-635 is important for basal, but not stimulated, Ser-617 negatively regulates basal and stimulated NO release, and Ser-1179 phosphorylation is stimulatory for both basal and agonist-mediated NO release. Using putative “gain of function” mutants (serine to aspartate) serines 635 and 1179 are important positive regulators of basal and stimulated NO release. S635D eNOS is the most efficacious, yielding 5-fold increases in basal and 2-fold increases in stimulated NO release from cells. However, S617A and S617D eNOS both increased NO release with opposite actions in NOS activity assays. Thus, multiple serine phosphorylation events regulate basal and stimulate NO release with Ser-635 and Ser-1179 being important positive regulatory sites and Ser-116 as a negative regulatory. Ser-617 may not be important for directly regulating NO release but is important as a modulator of phosphorylation at other sites and protein-protein interactions.

This has led to a large body of work focused on the regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS),1 the enzyme responsible for endothelial-derived NO production. Indeed, the regulation of eNOS activity is remarkably complex. Factors that may affect eNOS activity include post-translational modifications of the enzyme (1Pollock J.S. Klinghofer V. Forstermann U.

Of the known phosphorylation sites on eNOS, serine 1179 (Ser-1179) in bovine eNOS (Ser-1177 in human) has been characterized most extensively. Treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with a variety of stimuli, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adenosine-3′,5′-triphosphate (ATP), bradykinin, sheer stress, and acetylcholine results in phosphorylation at Ser-1179 and activation of the enzyme. In addition, several kinases that phosphorylate Ser-1179 have been identified, including AMP kinase (13Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A.

Ser-1179 phosphorylation has been shown to be critical for activation of eNOS. Phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser-1179 results in increased enzyme activity accompanied by an increase in NO production. Mutation of Ser-1179 to alanine prevents phosphorylation at this site resulting in decreased enzyme activity and NO production (6Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Additionally, substituting aspartate for serine at 1179, which mimics the phosphorylated state, results in enhanced eNOS activity and NO production further supporting the indispensable role of this site (6Fulton D.

Phosphorylation of threonine 497 (Thr-497) on bovine eNOS (Thr-495 in human) has also been documented (18Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

Thr-497 is basally phosphorylated and may be dephosphorylated in response to bradykinin stimulation (18Michell B.J. Chen Z. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

Dephosphorylation of Thr-497 results in increased enzyme activity; however, the relative contribution of Thr-497 to the regulation of NO production by eNOS has not been well established. Recently, three additional phosphorylation sites have been identified on eNOS: serine 116 (Ser-116) (21Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ.

Ser-116, like Thr-497, is basally phosphorylated and is dephosphorylated in response to certain stimuli in endothelial cells. Dephosphorylation of this residue on eNOS was reported to result in an increase in eNOS activity in ionophore-stimulated cells (22Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29669-29673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Ser-617 and Ser-635 residues are located within the autoinhibitory loop and are phosphorylated in response to endothelial cell stimulation by VEGF, ATP, and bradykinin, in addition Ser-635 is phosphorylated in response to shear stress (23Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

A recent report showed that mutation of Ser-635 to aspartate causes a 2-fold increase in maximal activity of the purified enzyme, an effect comparable to S1179D (23Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P.

However, previous studies demonstrated that S635D eNOS activity was similar to that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme when assayed in cell lysates from transfected cells and S635A produced equal or more NO compared with WT eNOS (6Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar,15Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-617 to aspartate was recently shown to increase calcium sensitivity without changing maximal enzyme activity of the purified enzyme (23Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42344-42351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Previous studies describing the role of these serine phosphorylation sites do so by examining eNOS enzyme activity of the purified enzyme or in detergent-solubilized cell lysates. However,in vitro NOS activity assays are performed with optimal calcium and cofactors present. Furthermore, activity assays of the purified enzyme are done in the absence of eNOS-associated proteins (caveolin-1, heat shock protein 90, etc.) and without phosphorylation at other sites and, therefore, do not always accurately reflect eNOS activity or the production of NO in live cells. For that reason, in this study we measured NO release from intact cells that express eNOS serine phosphorylation site mutants (either serine to alanine or serine to aspartate mutants) of each of these phosphorylation sites. In addition, we examined if mutation of a single phosphorylation site influenced the phosphorylation of the other regulatory sites. Finally, we determined the effect of the eNOS phosphorylation site mutations on the ability of the heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and the kinase, Akt, to co-associate with eNOS. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated and cultured as previously described (6Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). BAEC and COS-7 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. 2′-5′ ADP-Sepharose 4B was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-eNOS antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc., anti-phospho-eNOS Ser-1179 and anti-Akt antibody from Cell Signaling Technologies, and anti-hsp90 was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-phospho-eNOS Ser-116, Ser-617, and Ser-635 antibodies were generated as previously described (23Michell B.J. Harris M.B. Chen Z.P. Ju H. Venema V.J. Blackstone M.A. Huang W. Venema R.C.

Phosphorylation site mutants of eNOS were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, WT bovine eNOS was used as a template for the mutagenesis reaction. Primers containing the desired mutation were extended during temperature cycling byPfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The product was treated withDpnI to digest the parental DNA template and select for the synthesized DNA-containing mutations. The DNA was then transformed into XL1-Blue cells. Colonies were isolated from agar plates, grown for 8 h in LB-ampicillin and the plasmid isolated using a mini-prep kit (Qiagen). At least 4 clones for each mutation were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation. The sequences of the primers used to generate the eNOS phosphorylation site mutants were: S116A, 5′-ctgcagacccggcccGccccgggacctccac-3′; S116D, 5′-ctgcagacccggccgGAtccgggacctccac-3′; S617A, 5′-caagatccgcttcaacGCAgtctcctgctcagac-3′; S617D, 5′-caagatccgcttcaacGAcgtctcctgctcagaccc-3′; S635A, 5′-gcggaagagaaaggagGccagcaacacagacagtgc-3′; S635D, 5′-gcggaagagaaaggagGAcagcaacacagacagtgc-3′; and their respective reverse complements. All mutations were made using bovine eNOS cloned by Sessa et al. (2Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Zeng D. Durieux M.E. D'Angelo D.D. Lynch K.R. Peach M.J. J. Biol.

The next day the growth medium was aspirated and replaced with 2 ml of fresh growth medium. The cells were incubated for 24 h, and an aliquot of medium was taken for basal NO measurements, assayed as nitrite, the stable breakdown product of NO in aqueous medium. The cells were then incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium, and 30 min before stimulation the medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of fresh serum-free medium. After 30 min an aliquot of medium was taken for background nitrite measurement, and the cells were stimulated with 10 μm ATP and allowed to incubate for an additional 30 min. An aliquot of medium was again taken for nitrite measurement and the cells collected and lysed for protein assay and Western blot analysis. Nitrite levels were then measured using a Sievers NO analyzer as previously described. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 10 mm NaF, 1 mmvanadate, 1 mm pefabloc, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 20 μg of protein from cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blot analysis, or 750 μg of protein from cell lysates were partially purified using 2′-5′ ADP-Sepharose 4B and subjected to Western analysis as described previously (6Fulton D.

The activity of WT and mutant eNOS was determined in detergent solubilized lysates of transfected COS-7 cells by measuring the conversion of [14C]arginine to [14C]citrulline under Vmaxconditions as previously described (17McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We first set out to determine the specificity of the antibodies generated against phospho-eNOS Ser-116, Ser-617, and Ser-635. COS-7 cells were transfected with WT eNOS, S116A, S617A or S635A eNOS and then analyzed by Western blotting with the corresponding phosphospecific antibodies. Fig. 1 demonstrates that indeed these antibodies are specific for the phosphorylated sites on eNOS, since the antibodies recognized WT eNOS but not their corresponding phosphodeficient mutants. Previous work has documented the specificity of Ser-1179 phospho-Ab (26Fulton D. Fontana J. Sowa G. Gratton J.P. Lin M. Li K.X. Michell B. Kemp B.E. Rodman D. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

We next examined the effects of VEGF stimulation on phosphorylation of Ser-1179, Ser-116, Ser-617, and Ser-635. Serum-starved BAECs were treated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 1, 3, 5, 15, or 30 min and detergent-solubilized lysates incubated with 2′-5′ ADP-Sepharose 4B to partially purify eNOS and samples analyzed by Western blotting with the each of the phospho-Abs. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the putative Akt phosphorylation sites, Ser-1179 and Ser-617, are phosphorylated with similar kinetics, peaking at ∼5 min and returning to basal levels of phosphorylation by 30 min. Ser-116 is basally phosphorylated and rapidly dephosphorylated in response to VEGF, which recovered over time. Ser-635, a putative PKA phosphorylation site, displayed a more delayed increase in phosphorylation in response to VEGF reaching maximal phosphorylation at ∼30 min (the latest time point tested). These data are consistent with recent studies examining VEGF-induced eNOS phosphorylation (14Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T.

Next we examined ATP-mediated eNOS phosphorylation as prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor agonist. BAECs were treated with ATP (10 μm) for various times. Lysates were prepared and eNOS was partially purified by ADP Sepharose and subjected to Western blot analysis as before (Fig.3A). The pattern of phosphorylation for each of the phosphorylation sites varied temporally from VEGF-stimulated cells. Ser-1179 and Ser-617 were rapid and transiently phosphorylated with maximal phosphorylation at 3 min and dephosphorylation at 15 min. Ser-116 exhibited a more delayed dephosphorylation, first noticeable at 5 min, that continued decreasing for the duration of the experiment (30 min). Ser-635 was rapidly and transiently phosphorylated following a similar pattern to that of Ser-617 and Ser-1179 (Fig. 3B). Thus the kinetics of VEGF- versus ATP-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation are different, and ATP responses are similar to those obtained with bradykinin (22Kou R. Greif D. Michel T. J. Biol.

Recent studies have examined the effect of mutating eNOS phosphorylation site Ser-116 to alanine or Ser-617 or S635 to aspartate on in vitro NOS activity, either in cell lysates or with purified proteins, respectively for Ser-116 and Ser-617/635 (22Kou R.

In this study, COS-7 cells were transfected with WT, S116A, S617A, S635A, S116D, S617D, or S635D eNOS and assayed for NOS activity (Vmax conditions) in the cell lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.4A shows the effect of the serine to alanine mutation of these phosphorylation sites on NOS activity. S116A (36.46 ± 0.84 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein) and S635A (41.99 ± 1.56 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein) eNOS both showed an increase in NOS activity compared with WT (29.28 ± 1.33 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein). S617A eNOS (19.66 ± 0.20 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein) activity was significantly lower than WT. Mutation of S116 on eNOS to aspartate (Fig. 4B; 52.145 ± 3.285 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein) resulted in an increase in enzyme activity compared with WT eNOS (29.28 ± 1.33 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein). NOS activity of S617D eNOS (59.610 ± 0.33 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein) was 2-fold higher than WT eNOS, while S635D eNOS activity (32.56 ± 0.91 pmol of citrulline/min/mg of protein) was similar to WT eNOS. Thus, under Vmax conditions, S116A, S116D, S617D, and S635A were more active than WT, whereas S617A was less active, and S635D was comparable to WT. In vitro activity assays measuring the conversion of arginine to citrulline are performed with optimal calcium and cofactors present and do not always accurately reflect the production rate of NO in living cells since phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and regulated protein-protein interactions can all impinge upon eNOS activation/inactivation. Therefore, we examined the effect of mutating Ser-116, Ser-617, or Ser-635 to alanine, preventing phosphorylation at that site, on the ability of eNOS to produce NO in intact cells under basal (24-h accumulation) or stimulated (10 μm ATP, 30-min accumulation) conditions. WT and S1179A eNOS were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Fig. 5A shows that basal NO release from cells transfected with S617A (6.18 ± 0.22 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) showed a modest increase in NO release compared with WT eNOS (4.02 ± 0.163 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) while NO release from S1179A (0.631 ± 0.081 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein, as previously shown), and S635A (2.43 ± 0.35 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) eNOS were decreased. NO release from S116A eNOS (4.127 ± 0.237 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) transfected cells was similar to that of cells transfected with WT eNOS. The effects of mutation of Ser-617 and Ser-635 to Ala, were diametrically opposite in NOS activity versus NO release assays. Cell were then stimulated with ATP to examine agonist evoked NO release. ATP (10 μm) stimulated S116A and S617A eNOS (1.422 ± 0.143 and 2.265 ± 0.030 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) to produce moderately higher amounts of NO compared with WT eNOS (1.36 ± 0.12 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein), whereas NO release from S635A eNOS (1.42 ± 0.14 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) was similar to that of the WT enzyme (Fig. 5B) and that from S1179A eNOS (0.83 ± 0.08 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) diminished as previously shown (6Fulton D.

Mutation of serine or threonine phosphorylation sites to aspartate can sometimes, but not always, mimics the phosphorylated state of the protein, whereas alanine mutations clearly render the site phosphorylation defective but may also cause untoward conformational changes in proteins. Therefore, as another means of examining the role of each individual phosphorylation site in eNOS, we transfected COS-7 cells with WT, S1179D, S116D, S617D, or S635D eNOS and measured basal and ATP-stimulated NO release as before. Mutating Ser-1179 to aspartate has been previously shown to increase eNOS activity and NO release 2–4 fold when compared with WT and was used as a positive control in this study (6Fulton D.

Mutation of Ser-116 to aspartate (S116D eNOS) had no effect on basal NO production (3.552 ± 0.083 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein; Fig.6A), while exhibiting an increase under stimulated conditions (0.75 ± 0.015 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein; Fig. 6B) when compared with WT eNOS (basal, 3.05 ± 0.08 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein; stimulated, 0.52 ± 0.032 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein). The S617D mutant produced ∼50% more NO both basally (4.85 ± 0.162 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) and when stimulated for 30 min with ATP (0.87 ± 0.037 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein). Transfecting cells with the S635D mutant resulted in the most robust increase in NO production of any of the phosphorylation site mutants, including S1179D. Basal NO release from S635D was 5-fold higher (14.24 ± 0.28 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) and stimulated NO release was nearly double (0.99 ± 0.048 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) that of WT eNOS. The S1179D mutant produced significantly higher amounts of NO both basally and under stimulated conditions (basal, 6.28 ± 0.35 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein; stimulated, 1.32 ± 0.18 nmol of nitrite/mg of protein) as in earlier studies. Fig. 6Cdemonstrates, by Western blot analysis, that similar amounts of each of the eNOS constructs were expressed in these experiments. To determine whether phosphorylation at one site in eNOS effects phosphorylation at other sites, we transfected COS-7 cells with each eNO"

Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Although long considered to be inert structures, there is now increasing evidence that they play active and diverse roles in the life cycle of cells. Recently, they have been implicated in maintenance of intracellular cholesterol balance and transport of lipids through association with caveolin proteins (2Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Moreover, the lipid stored in droplets is utilized for specialized purposes in certain cell types. For example, steroid hormones in steroidogenic cells are produced from cholesterol ester stored in lipid droplets (3Freeman D.A. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14231-14238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); mammary epithelial cells release milk fat globules from their apical surface that are directly derived from aggregated lipid droplets (4Mather I.H. Keenan T.W. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); lipid droplets appear to be the primary source of fatty acids that are converted into triacylglycerols and incorporated into very low density lipoprotein in hepatocytes (5Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There is also a correlation between particular human diseases and accumulation of lipid droplets that suggests they are markers of pathological changes. Such diseases include atheroma, steatosis, obesity, and some cancers (6Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R. Keenan T.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 7Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biol.

More recently, it has been suggested that aberrant targeting of the Nir2 protein to lipid droplets may induce changes to lipid transport that could correlate with retinal degeneration seen inDrosophila mutants (8Litvak V.

However, analysis of the properties of surface proteins has received only limited attention. The most widely characterized lipid droplet-associated proteins are the perilipins, a family of polypeptides generated by alternative splicing from a single copy gene (14Lu X.Y. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and adipocyte differentiation-related protein (ADRP,1 also termed adipophilin) (6Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R.

Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of a variety of tissue culture cells also has revealed ADRP as a ubiquitous component of lipid droplets (6Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R. Keenan T.W.

Moreover, enhanced expression of ADRP is a useful marker for pathologies that are characterized by increased accumulations of lipid droplets (6Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hence, analysis of ADRP would provide valuable insight into the nature of proteins that associate with lipid droplets. In addition, ADRP offers potential for describing the characteristics of lipid droplets.In this study, we have fused green and yellow fluorescent proteins (EGFP and EYFP) to the human and mouse ADRP coding sequences and examined the ability of the fusion proteins to associate with lipid droplets in tissue culture cells. This system was employed to identify sequences in ADRP that are required for localization to lipid droplets. ADRP tagged with fluorescent proteins also was used to analyze the behavior of lipid droplets in live cells and their interaction with other intracellular compartments.DISCUSSIONADRP is a component of lipid droplets found in a broad range of cultured cells and tissues. Accordingly, it is a useful model protein to examine the properties of proteinaceous components of lipid droplets and the innate behavior of these organelles. In our study, we have employed fusion of both human and mouse forms of ADRP with EGFP to study both of these aspects.Analysis of the sequences required to direct hADRP to lipid droplets revealed that targeting signals are distributed throughout the polypeptide coding region (Fig. 8). In the context of our study, we define targeting as the process through which ADRP is directed to lipid droplets and then forms a stable association with the organelles. Therefore, reduced targeting efficiency could result from the inability of the tagged proteins to attach stably to lipid droplets, possibly through competition with endogenous ADRP. We found that removal of the N-terminal 28 amino acids impaired lipid droplet localization and a second targeting element was located between residues 139 and 220. Sequences that can contribute to efficient association with lipid droplets also were present in the C-terminal region from amino acids 221 to 437 but this segment of the protein alone was not capable of directing the protein to droplets. These regions of the protein do not form a contiguous targeting element because sequences between amino acids 61 and 130 can be removed with no significant impact on the efficiency of lipid droplet association. Our results indicate that removing one of these targeting sequences can impair but not abolish lipid droplet localization, suggesting that there is redundancy in the sequence requirements for efficient association. Thus, identification of indispensable sequences has not been possible. A recent study also indicated redundancy within the sequences that were necessary for directing perilipin to lipid droplets (28Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, simple targeting signals for peroxisomal membrane proteins have not been readily identified and it appears that more than one targeting element may reside within such proteins (29Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, sequence redundancy may be a general feature for directing proteins to the surface of organelles such as peroxisomes and lipid droplets.It has been proposed that ADRP can be separated into two domains, PAT-1 and PAT-2, based on sequence identity with other lipid droplet-associated proteins (14Lu X.Y. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PAT-1 is considered to consist of approximately the N-terminal 100 amino acids of the protein and the remaining C-terminal segment is PAT-2 (Fig. 8). Sequence identity between PAT-1 domains for lipid droplet proteins is greater than that for PAT-2. Indeed, using PAT-1 sequences, lipid droplet proteins have been identified putatively in Drosophila melanogaster andBombyx mori (14Lu X.Y. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our analysis shows that the N-terminal 28 amino acids of hADRP, which are necessary for efficient targeting, are contained within PAT-1. However, the other sequences that have been identified as important for efficient lipid droplet association are located in PAT-2. The region within perilipin that has been identified as important for localization to lipid droplets also lies in PAT-2 (28Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This indicates that the higher sequence identity in PAT-1 between lipid droplet-associated proteins such as ADRP and perilipin does not necessarily represent conserved targeting sequences. Hence, the sequences that direct these proteins to lipid droplets may be distinct. It has also been observed that a region in the PAT-1 domain of ADRP has sequence identity with a tandem repeat in the plasma membrane protein, S3–12 (20Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 30Scherer P.E. Bickel P.E. Kotler M. Lodish H.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our results show that removing this segment from ADRP has no effect on lipid droplet association (Fig. 8), leading us to conclude that any sequence identity with this tandem repeat is not related to targeting of ADRP.The discontinuous nature of the targeting sequences in ADRP differs from the characteristics of other lipid droplet-associated proteins apart from perilipin. Association of HCV core protein with lipid droplets requires a domain of about 55 amino acids that is present also in a related virus, GB virus-B but not in pesti- and flaviviruses that share the same genomic organization as HCV (11Hope R.G. McLauchlan J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Apart from a short stretch of amino acids, removal or substitution of amino acids along the length of the domain abolishes lipid droplet localization. In addition, plant oleosins have a central region of 85 amino acids that has all of the sequences required for efficient attachment in mammalian and plant cells; this central region is flanked by domains that appear to be dispensable for lipid droplet association (12Hope R.G. Murphy D.J. McLauchlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4261-4270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31van Rooijen G.J.H. Moloney M.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, the targeting sequences in the HCV core and plant oleosin proteins are hydrophobic, whereas no corresponding segments with similar characteristics are found in either human or mouse ADRP. This suggests that processes, which are different from those for the viral and plant proteins, may guide localization of ADRP to lipid droplets. In the case of HCV core, trafficking of the protein to lipid droplets involves initial targeting and cleavage of a precursor protein at the ER and core is found both at the ER membrane as well as at the surface of lipid droplets (32McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope R.G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is likely that transfer of core between the two organelles is facilitated by the attachment of lipid droplets to the ER, which we describe from our live cell studies. However, for ADRP, no staining of the ER is found by either indirect immunofluorescence or live cell analysis. The mechanism that controls partitioning of ADRP is presumably a reflection of differences between either components or compositions of lipid droplets and the ER that favor interaction with lipid droplets. In addition, the literature indicates that ADRP is synthesized on free and not ER-bound polyribosomes (20Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A similar situation has been demonstrated for the perilipins (33Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It may be that association of ADRP and perilipin with the ER is not favored to prevent fusion of lipid droplets with the ER after their formation.Lipid droplets often occur as clusters in a number of cell types. This may indicate that they form a connected network in which transfer of macromolecules between droplets could occur. FRAP is gaining wide use to determine the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins in organelles with continuous surfaces such as the ER, Golgi, and plasma membranes (Refs.34Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 35Nehls S. Snapp E.L. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J.M. Kenworthy A.K. Roberts T.H.

More recently, FRAP has revealed that clusters of mitochondria are functionally distinct and unconnected (38Collins T.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). From our data, ADRP does not rapidly diffuse between lipid droplets that are apparently in contact with each other. This suggests that droplets exist as discrete entities and that there is little or no transfer of surface proteins between them. As a consequence, there may be little turnover of ADRP at the surface of lipid droplets after their formation.Analysis of live cells offers advantages for determining the characteristics of lipid droplets. Lipid droplets are heterogeneous in size both between different cell types and even in individual cells. The factors that govern their size are not known but could be determined during their biogenesis. It is also possible that additional neutral lipid is added after formation, either through transfer from the ER or from other lipid droplets. In HuH-7 cells, lipid droplets were no greater than about 1 μm in diameter in live cells using GFP-ADRP as a marker. However, upon fixation and subsequent treatment with alcohol to stain lipid droplets with oil red O, their maximum size increased to 3 μm (data not shown). We propose that this discrepancy results from fusion of closely associated droplets and the size distribution in cells, which are stained using alcoholic solutions, is not authentic. Such an observation may have a bearing on the interpretation of lipid droplet size in cells that store large quantities of neutral lipid and in pathological conditions where lipid storage is assessed. For example, steatosis of the liver can be described as either micro- or macrovesicular depending on the diameter of lipid droplets (39Burt A.D. Mutton A. Day C.P. Semin. Diag. Pathol. 1998; 15: 246-258PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the presence of lipid droplets with larger diameters does not reflect their size in vivo and is an artifact of the fixation process.Formation of lipid droplets is considered to occur by a budding process at the ER (1Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 40Brown D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R446-R449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). From live cell studies, our results reveal that, following their biogenesis, droplets continue to attach to the ER membrane. As lipid droplets are a reservoir, their close association with the ER may be important for maintenance and expansion of the organelle during the cell cycle. Such an association also allows ready access to a storage reservoir under conditions where excess lipid is either synthesized or absorbed by cells. Thus, lipid droplets may be important to maintain lipid homeostasis and permit normal function of the ER in abnormal situations where lipid is either limiting or in excess. In HuH-7 cells, we observed that a proportion of lipid droplets had movements that were consistent with transient attachment to the microtubule network. Such trafficking was clearly distinct from the motion of droplets that were ER-associated. We presume that brief association of lipid droplets with microtubules indicates movement from one site on the ER to a second site. However, the factors that control lipid droplet association with microtubules are not known. We did not observe similar rapid movement in Vero cells. This cell type contains considerably fewer lipid droplets compared with HuH-7 cells and, because the proportion of lipid droplets that move rapidly in HuH-7 cells is low, it is possible that observations over longer time periods are necessary to identify microtubule-associated movement of lipid droplets in Vero cells. Alternatively, microtubule-related trafficking could be cell type-dependent. As well as acting as a source of lipid for membranes, lipid droplets have specialized functions in certain cell types, which may affect their interactions with cellular processes. For example, milk fat globules released by mammary epithelial cells are derived from lipid droplets secreted from the apical surface and it is proposed that movement of droplets to sites of secretion involve trafficking along microtubules (41Wu C.C. Howell K.E. Neville M.C. Yates J.R. McManaman J.L. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3470-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, hepatocytes are a primary source for the production of very low density lipoprotein, and triglycerides stored in lipid droplets provide much of the lipid content in these particles (5Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, this process is poorly understood but it may require mobilization of lipid droplets to regions of the ER where lipoprotein assembly occurs. Hepatocytes are the progenitor cells for the human hepatoma from which HuH-7 cells are derived and thus may maintain characteristics for the very low density lipoprotein assembly pathway that involve lipid droplets. Therefore, the association of lipid droplets with microtubules in HuH-7 cells may not be found more generally in other cell types.In summary, we have identified sequences within ADRP that are important for association with lipid droplets and have demonstrated that the protein can be utilized to examine the properties of these organelles. This has allowed analysis of the interaction between lipid droplets and other cellular processes. From our work and other studies where association with mitochondria, intermediate filaments (6Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R. Keenan T.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 42Francke W.W. Hergt M. Grund C. Cell. 1987; 49: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and peroxisomes (43Schrader M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have been observed, it appears that lipid droplets are not inert sites of lipid storage but actively interconnect with other organelles. Further studies on the consequences of these interactions will help to elucidate the full extent of the contribution of lipid droplets to cell metabolism. In mammalian cells, lipid droplets serve as storage organelles, consisting primarily of cholesterol ester and triacylglyerols (reviewed in Ref. 1Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Although long considered to be inert structures, there is now increasing evidence that they play active and diverse roles in the life cycle of cells. Recently, they have been implicated in maintenance of intracellular cholesterol balance and transport of lipids through association with caveolin proteins (2Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Moreover, the lipid stored in droplets is utilized for specialized purposes in certain cell types. For example, steroid hormones in steroidogenic cells are produced from cholesterol ester stored in lipid droplets (3Freeman D.A. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14231-14238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); mammary epithelial cells release milk fat globules from their apical surface that are directly derived from aggregated lipid droplets (4Mather I.H. Keenan T.W. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1998; 3: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); lipid droplets appear to be the primary source of fatty acids that are converted into triacylglycerols and incorporated into very low density lipoprotein in hepatocytes (5Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). There is also a correlation between particular human diseases and accumulation of lipid droplets that suggests they are markers of pathological changes. Such diseases include atheroma, steatosis, obesity, and some cancers (6Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R. Keenan T.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 7Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that aberrant targeting of the Nir2 protein to lipid droplets may induce changes to lipid transport that could correlate with retinal degeneration seen inDrosophila mutants (8Litvak V. Shaul Y.D. Shulewitz M. Amarilio R. Carmon S. Lev S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1513-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Indeed, lipid droplets may have important functions in viral and parasitic infections (9Barba G. Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Zs. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T.

The surface of lipid droplets has a proteinaceous layer that is thought to prevent fusion with any adjacent lipophilic surface. However, analysis of the properties of surface proteins has received only limited attention. The most widely characterized lipid droplet-associated proteins are the perilipins, a family of polypeptides generated by alternative splicing from a single copy gene (14Lu X.Y. Gruia-Gray J.

Although the TRAF2 TRAF domain binds ASK1, GCK, and the highly related kinase GCKR, the RING finger domain is needed for their activation. Here, we report that TNF activates GCKR and the SAPK pathway in a manner that depends upon TRAF2 and Ubc13, a member along with Uev1A of a dimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex. Interference with Ubc13 function or expression inhibits both TNF- and TRAF2-mediated GCKR and SAPK activation, but has a minimal effect on ASK1 activation. TNF signaling leads to TRAF2 polyubiquitination and oligomerization and to the oligomerization, ubiquitination, and activation of GCKR, all of which are sensitive to the disruption of Ubc13 function. These results indicate that the assembly of a TRAF2 lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chain by Ubc13/Uev1A is required for TNF-mediated GCKR and SAPK activation, but may not be required for ASK1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2041766504,"The membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has been identified as a major activator of MMP-2 – a process involving the formation of a trimolecular complex with TIMP-2. We previously identified the IGF-I receptor as a positive regulator of MMP-2 synthesis. Here, we investigated the role of IGF-IR in the regulation of MT1-MMP. Highly invasive Lewis lung carcinoma subline H-59 cells express MT1-MMP and utilize it to activate their major extracellular matrix degrading proteinase-MMP-2. These cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid vector expressing a luciferase reporter gene downstream of the mouse MT1-MMP promoter. IGF-I treatment increased luciferase activity in the transfected cells by up to 10-fold and augmented endogenous MT1-MMP mRNA and protein synthesis by up to 2–3-fold, relative to controls. MT1-MMP induction and invasion were blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin and by rapamycin, but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Overexpression of a dominant negative Akt mutant or of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue, PTEN, in these cells also caused a significant reduction in MT1-MMP expression and invasion. The results demonstrate that IGF-IR controls tumor cell invasion by coordinately regulating MMP-2 expression and its MT1-MMP-mediated activation and identify PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling as critical to this regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1973603326,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is characterized by lysosomal storage of cholesterol and gangliosides, which results from defects in intracellular lipid trafficking. Most studies of NPC1 have focused on its role in intracellular cholesterol movement. Our hypothesis is that NPC1 facilitates the egress of cholesterol from late endosomes, which are where active NPC1 is located. When NPC1 is defective, cholesterol does not exit late endosomes; instead, it is carried along to lysosomal storage bodies, where it accumulates. In this study, we addressed whether cholesterol is transported from endosomes to the plasma membrane before reaching NPC1-containing late endosomes. Our study was conducted in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that display the classical NPC biochemical phenotype and belong to the NPC1 complementation group. We used three approaches to test whether low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol en route to NPC1-containing organelles passes through the plasma membrane. First, we used cyclodextrins to measure the arrival of LDL cholesterol at the plasma membrane and found that the arrival of LDL cholesterol in a cyclodextrin-accessible pool was significantly delayed in NPC1 cells. Second, the movement of LDL cholesterol to NPC1-containing late endosomes was assessed and found to be normal in Chinese hamster ovary mutant 3-6, which exhibits defective movement of plasma membrane cholesterol to intracellular membranes. Third, we examined the movement of plasma membrane cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and found that this pathway is intact in NPC1 cells, i.e. it does not pass through NPC1-containing late endosomes.

Most studies of NPC1 have focused on its role in intracellular cholesterol movement. In normal cells, low density lipoproteins (LDL) are internalized and transported through the endocytic pathway where the cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed. The cholesterol that is released is transported to the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (4Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis has been that NPC1 facilitates the egress of free cholesterol from late endosomes, which are the location of functional NPC1 (5Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A.

When NPC1 is defective, the free cholesterol does not exit the late endosomes; instead, it is carried along the endocytic pathway to lysosomal storage bodies where it accumulates along with mutant NPC1 protein. In this study, we addressed whether cholesterol released by hydrolysis of LDL-derived cholesteryl linoleate (CL) is transported to the plasma membrane in its transit from early endosomes to NPC1-containing late endosomes and lysosomes. Our work was prompted by two recent studies. First, Cruz et al. (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported that LDL cholesterol is transported to the plasma membrane independently of NPC1. On reaching the plasma membrane, LDL-derived cholesterol is proposed to be specifically reinternalized and delivered to a compartment that is functionally distinct from lysosomes and contains NPC1. Cholesterol is then mobilized to other cellular destinations such as the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. It is the movement of cholesterol from these storage vesicles that is proposed to be defective in NPC1 cells (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Our study was conducted in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that display the classical NPC biochemical phenotype (11Dahl N.K. Reed K.L. Daunais M.A. Faust J.R. Liscum L. J. Biol.

We used three approaches to test our hypothesis that LDL-derived cholesterol en route to NPC1-containing late endosomes does not pass through the plasma membrane. First, we used cyclodextrins (CDs) to measure the arrival of LDL cholesterol at the plasma membrane and found that the arrival of LDL cholesterol in a CD-accessible pool was significantly delayed in NPC1 cells.

Third, we examined the movement of plasma membrane cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and found that this pathway is intact in NPC1 cells,i.e. passage through NPC1-containing organelles is not obligatory for this pathway.

Sixteen mg of recrystallized cholesterol was added to 10 ml of a 25-mm CD in medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. The solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter to remove excess cholesterol crystals, and the cholesterol-saturated cyclodextrin solution was diluted with an equal volume of 25 mm CD.

All cells were grown in a monolayer in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Stocks were cultured in H-5% NCS. On day 0, CHO cells were seeded into six-well plates (25,000 cells/well) in H-5% NCS. On day 1, cells were washed in balanced Hanks' salt solution and refed H-5% LPDS. On day 3 or 4, cells were refed H-5% LPDS and incubated with [3H]CL-LDL for various times at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in a medium containing no addition, 12.5 mm CD, or 25 mm CD/chol for 10–120 min. Cells were then washed with TBS, and lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2). The media were centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and lipids were extracted with petroleum ether. A chromatography standard was added (50 μg of cholesterol, 25 μg of cholesteryl oleate, and 1500 dpm of [14C]cholesterol) to cells and media. Labeled cellular lipids were analyzed by TLC with toluene/ethyl acetate (2:1). Radioactivity was measured with liquid scintillation counting in ReadySafe. After lipid extraction, monolayers were incubated with 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were taken for protein determination (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On day 0, cells were seeded into chamber slides in H-5% NCS. On day 3 cells were refed with H-10% LPDS. On day 4 cells were refed with H-10% LPDS, and the following additions were made: no addition, 50 μg/ml LDL, or 50 μg/ml LDL plus 20 μg/ml progesterone. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and filipin fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (14Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On day 0, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (10,000 cells/well) in H-5% NCS. On day 2, cells were refed H-5% LPDS. On day 3, cells were refed 1 ml of H-5% LPDS. Additions of 0.5 μCi of [3H]cholesterol in ethanol were made at staggered times. Cells were washed with TBS after which lipids were extracted, separated, and quantified as described previously (4Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from parental CHO cells and NPC1 mutants by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and Oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen). Primers were designed to amplify the hamster NPC1 cDNA on the basis of the mouse NPC1 cDNA sequence (19Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J.

Primers to amplify the 5′- and 3′-coding region of NPC1 were designed on the basis of the hamster NPC1 cDNA sequence, generously supplied by Chang (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Using the primer set (forward primer: 5′-ATGAGCGCGCGCCACCCGGCCCTG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CTAAAAATTGAGGAGCCGTTCTCGCTC-3′), a full-length NPC1 product was generated by PCR and sequenced by the Tufts University Core Facility. Sequences were assembled by using the AssemblyLIGN and MacVector programs. Mutations were identified by using BLAST 2. mRNA was isolated with the Oligotex Direct mRNA Minikit (Qiagen). Four μg of mRNA was loaded onto a formamide gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Ambion). A 32P-labeled 800-nucleotide NPC1 cDNA probe was generated by PCR amplification by using the primer set (forward primer: 5′-CATTTCCTTCATTGCTGAGAG-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GGCATTGAAAGAGACTGATCC-3′) and the Prime-It Random Labeling kit (Stratagene). The membrane was then stripped (2 h in 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% SDS at 70 °C) and reprobed with a32P-labeled β-actin cDNA (Ambion). Cells were seeded into Falcon chamber slides in H-5% NCS. Cells were transiently transfected at 60–70% confluency by using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) with a total of 0.7 μg DNA/chamber of human NPC1 (generously supplied by Jill Morris and Peter Pentchev, National Institutes of Health) or no DNA, along with pEGFP (Clontech). After 3 h cells were refed H-5% LPDS and incubated for another 48 h. Additions of 50 μg/ml LDL were made, and cells were incubated for an additional 16–24 h. Filipin fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (14Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal mammalian cells, LDL is taken up and the cholesteryl ester core is hydrolyzed in endocytic vesicles. The cholesterol that is released eventually reaches NPC1-containing organelles. What itinerary does cholesterol follow? Previous studies have concluded that LDL-derived cholesterol is transported to multivesicular late endosomes where active NPC1 resides (5Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Fig1A). NPC1-containing vesicles bud off of late endosomes, presumably carrying cholesterol and other cargo (6Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G.

Scott M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In NPC1 cells, the movement of cholesterol out of late endosomes is greatly delayed (11Dahl N.K. Reed K.L.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, cholesterol and other lipids accumulate in lysosomes along with dysfunctional NPC1 protein (23Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Watari M. Neufeld E.B. Patel S. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21861-21866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Some of the previous cholesterol transport studies relied on inefficient methods to assess the transit of LDL-derived cholesterol to the plasma membrane, such as spontaneous desorption of [3H]cholesterol from the plasma membrane and its entrapment in small unilamellar vesicles in the medium (11Dahl N.K.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Other studies examined LDL cholesterol sequestration in lysosomesversus transport to the plasma membrane after long incubation periods with [3H]CL-LDL and subcellular fractionation (11Dahl N.K. Reed K.L. Daunais M.A. Faust J.R. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Tokoro T. Butler J. Sokol J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). All of these studies found delayed arrival of LDL cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Most recently, cholesterol movement to the plasma membrane has been quantified by using CD, which can stimulate cholesterol efflux from cells (24Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and act as cholesterol shuttles (15Christian A.E.

Bittman R. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1475-1482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using CD that are complexed with varying levels of cholesterol, it is possible to manipulate the cholesterol content of cells ranging from net cholesterol enrichment to depletion (15Christian A.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) assessed LDL cholesterol movement in NPC1 cells using short incubation times and CD to measure the arrival of [3H]cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Their results indicated that the pathway of LDL cholesterol transport was more complex than suspected previously, involving LDL cholesterol movement to the plasma membrane before arrival in NPC1-containing organelles (Fig. 1B). Here we have evaluated this itinerary in CHO mutants 2-2 and CT60. Isolated in our laboratory and Chang's laboratory, respectively, these NPC1-defective mutants display the classical NPC disease phenotype (11Dahl N.K. Reed K.L. Daunais M.A. Faust J.R. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4889-4896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We compared the use of CD with CD/chol, which is 50% saturated with cholesterol, i.e. a shuttle system that samples the amount of cholesterol at the plasma membrane, presumably without disrupting the normal cholesterol trafficking pattern (15Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Wild-type CHO cells and mutants 2-2 and CT60 were incubated for 10–120 min at 37 °C with [3H]CL-LDL. During the incubation, the [3H]CL-LDL will be internalized and hydrolyzed and [3H]cholesterol will be released. To measure [3H]cholesterol arrival in the plasma membrane, cells were briefly exposed to media containing CD/chol, which acts as a shuttle to sample cholesterol as it arrives at the plasma membrane (15Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Cell-associated [3H]cholesteryl linoleate and [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesterol that had desorbed to CD/chol were quantified (Fig.2). We found that [3H]CL-LDL uptake was equivalent in all cells (Fig.2A), and similar amounts of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate were hydrolyzed at each time point (data not shown). No [3H]cholesterol appeared in media lacking CD/chol (data not shown). When cells were incubated for 10 min with [3H]CL-LDL and then exposed to media containing CD/chol for 10 min, we found no LDL-[3H]cholesterol in CD/chol-accessible pools. By 30 min of [3H]CL-LDL incubation, discernible LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol was found in the plasma membrane of wild-type cells but none in mutant 2-2 or CT60 cells. After 30 min, we observed a time-dependent increase in CD/chol- accessible [3H]cholesterol in wild-type CHO cells; however, very little LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol became accessible to CD/chol in mutant 2-2 or CT60 cells (Fig. 2, B andC). These data suggest that either LDL cholesterol does not move through the plasma membrane in NPC1 cells or that its appearance there is transient. Therefore, we next evaluated LDL-[3H]cholesterol transport following the protocol used by Cruz et al. (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this experiment, wild-type and mutant cells were pulsed for 1 h at 37 °C with [3H]CL-LDL and then incubated with either 25 mm CD/chol (as described above) or 12.5 mm CD alone (as used by Cruz et al. (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). Cell-associated [3H]cholesteryl linoleate and [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesterol that had desorbed to CD/chol or CD were quantified (Fig.3). All cells internalized equivalent amounts of [3H]CL-LDL during the 1-h pulse (data not shown). During the chase incubations, the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate was hydrolyzed to release free [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 3, A and C). In this experiment less [3H]cholesteryl linoleate hydrolysis occurred in CT60 than in CHO or 2-2 cells. However, the amount of LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol accessible to CD was calculated as a percentage of the available [3H]cholesterol. Under all conditions we found that LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol movement to the CD-accessible compartment was delayed by ∼60 min in mutant 2-2 or CT60 cells as compared with wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 3,B and D). After 60 min the rate at which LDL [3H]cholesterol appeared in a CD-accessible pool was equivalent in mutant and wild-type cells. A second strategy to test whether LDL cholesterol traffics through the plasma membrane en route to NPC1-containing organelles used a somatic cell mutant with impaired transport of plasma membrane cholesterol into the cell interior combined with pharmacological inhibition of NPC1. In such a cell model, LDL-derived cholesterol should not reach the NPC1-containing late endosomes if its transport pathway takes it through the plasma membrane, but the LDL cholesterol should accumulate internally if it passes through late endosomes on its way to the plasma membrane. We created such a cell model by treating mutant 3-6 with either progesterone or hydrophobic amines. Mutant 3-6 is a CHO cell line that exhibits defective transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the cell interior (14Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Progesterone and hydrophobic amines such as U18666A and imipramine inhibit LDL cholesterol egress from lysosomes, causing an NPC phenotype in cultured cells (27Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Rousson R. Bonnet J. Pentchev P.G. Louisot P. Vanier M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Parental CHO and mutant 3-6 cells were incubated for 4 h in H-10% LPDS containing no addition, 50 μg/ml LDL, or 50 μg/ml LDL plus 20 μg/ml progesterone (or 100 μm imipramine). Cells were then stained with filipin and inspected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). Parental CHO cells showed distinct plasma membrane fluorescence when given no addition and some additional punctate staining when given LDL. As expected, CHO cells given LDL plus progesterone displayed intense punctate perinuclear fluorescence indicative of lysosomal cholesterol storage. Mutant 3-6 cells were indistinguishable from parental CHO cells. They displayed distinct plasma membrane fluorescence when given LDL and punctate fluorescence when given LDL plus progesterone. CHO and mutant 3-6 cells treated with imipramine were identical to those treated with progesterone (data not shown). These results provide further support to our hypothesis that LDL cholesterol traffics through NPC1 vesicles before arriving at the plasma membrane. A third strategy to test this hypothesis is to determine whether plasma membrane cholesterol is transported through NPC1-containing organelles on the way to the endoplasmic reticulum. Cultured cells incubated with [3H]cholesterol adsorb the [3H]cholesterol and distribute it according to their cellular cholesterol pools. With time, [3H]cholesterol reaches acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum and is esterified. We incubated parental CHO cells and four mutant cell lines from the NPC1 complementation group with [3H]cholesterol for various times. Fig. 5 shows a time-dependent incorporation of [3H]cholesterol into [3H]cholesteryl esters in parental CHO cells and equivalent [3H]cholesterol ester formation in each of the mutant cell lines. This result is not consistent with plasma membrane cholesterol being transported through NPC1-containing organelles to the cell interior. To confirm genetic evidence that our cholesterol transport-defective CHO cells are NPC1 mutants, we cloned and sequenced the NPC1 cDNA from our parental CHO-K1 cells and four independently isolated cell lines, mutants 2-2, 4-4, 10-3, and 1-2. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of NPC1 from our CHO-K1 cells was identical to that reported previously (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The NPC1 mutations in the mutant cell lines were located by using a BLAST2 search after initial sequence analysis with AssemblyLIGN and MacVector programs. Mutant 2-2 contains a base-pair insertion of A at nucleotide 1335, resulting in a frameshift and premature translational termination after 450 amino acids (Fig. 6). Mutant 4-4 contains a base insertion of C at nucleotide 1946, which results in a frameshift and premature translational termination after 652 amino acids (Fig. 6). Mutant 1-2 contains no apparent mutations in the NPC1 coding region. It is possible that mutations exist in the 3′- or 5′-untranslated regions. We were unable to obtain the complete sequence for mutant 10-3. Northern blot analysis showed that parental and mutant cells express anNPC1 mRNA of comparable size. However, mRNA levels are reduced in mutant 2-2 and practically absent in mutant 10-3 (Fig.7). The lack of NPC1 mRNA in mutant 10-3 may explain our difficulty in sequencing a cDNA. A hallmark of NPC1 cells is the punctate filipin fluorescence, which denotes lysosomal cholesterol storage. To determine whether expression of the humanNPC1 cDNA (phuNPC1) was able to correct the filipin-staining pattern in our mutants, we performed co-transfection experiments with phuNPC1 and pEGFP, which expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Fig. 8shows that filipin-stained parental CHO cells have diffuse fluorescence, whether they are untransfected, expressing pEGFP or phuNPC1 plus pEGFP. The expression of pEGFP alone in mutant cells had no effect on filipin fluorescence; however, when mutant cells were transfected with pEGFP plus phuNPC1, the GFP-positive cells showed correction of the filipin staining. These results support the complementation and sequence analyses of our NPC1-deficient mutants. In this study, we have evaluated the fate of cholesterol released by LDL-cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in the endocytic pathway. It is generally accepted that in normal cells LDL cholesterol is rapidly transported to the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes, whereas in NPC cells LDL cholesterol ends up sequestered in terminal storage compartments along with glycosphingolipids. What is disputed is whether NPC1 facilitates the initial transport of LDL cholesterol to the plasma membrane, or whether LDL cholesterol is transported by other means to the plasma membrane and is then internalized to NPC1-containing organelles for further disposition (Fig. 1). The latter model calls for all plasma membrane cholesterol to be routed through the NPC1-containing organelles before arrival in other intracellular membranes (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We used three experimental approaches to evaluate these models in wild-type and NPC1-deficient CHO cell lines. First, CD/chol complexes were used to detect the arrival of LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol in the plasma membrane. We found that under all experimental conditions NPC1 mutants exhibited a distinct lag in the movement of LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol to the CD-accessible plasma membrane. We were unable to demonstrate any early transient appearance of LDL-[3H]cholesterol at the plasma membrane. We found the same qualitative results using either CD or CD/chol as cholesterol acceptors in the media, although CD/chol consistently promoted more [3H]cholesterol efflux from cells than an equal concentration of CD alone. This finding is consistent with the notion of CD/chol as a effective cholesterol shuttle and suggests that cholesterol transfer to the plasma membrane stimulates the reciprocal cholesterol movement. In the second approach, we tested specifically whether LDL-[3H]cholesterol passes through the plasma membrane before its arrival in the NPC1-containing late endosomes. We used mutant 3-6, which exhibits defective transport of plasma membrane cholesterol to internal membranes (14Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A classical genetic approach to this problem would be to perform epistasis analysis, in which an NPC1/3-6 double mutant would be evaluated. If LDL cholesterol passed through NPC1-containing organelles before arrival in the plasma membrane, then an NPC1/3-6 mutant would show lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol. However, if LDL cholesterol were transported to the plasma membrane and then to the NPC1-containing organelles, then an NPC1/3-6 double mutant would show no intracellular storage of cholesterol. An NPC1/3-6 double mutant is not available; however, we created an equivalent cell model using pharmacological agents that cause an NPC1 phenotype. We found that when 3-6 cells were treated with either progesterone or imipramine, incubation with LDL led to punctate filipin fluorescence that was indistinguishable from the classical NPC phenotype. This result is consistent with LDL cholesterol reaching the NPC1-containing late endosomes before reaching the plasma membrane. In the third approach, we evaluated whether plasma membrane cholesterol passes through NPC1-containing late endosomes en route to the endoplasmic reticulum. Lange et al. (30Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have estimated that in cultured cells the entire plasma membrane cholesterol pool cycles between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum with a half-time of 40 min; thus, delayed kinetics in cholesterol exiting the NPC1 organelles should be readily apparent. We found identical basal [3H]cholesterol esterification in wild-type and NPC1-deficient cells. These results are consistent with our previous finding that imipramine has no effect on plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol movement at concentrations that cause the NPC1 phenotype (4Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Together they indicate that the plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol transport pathway is intact and that the NPC1-containing late endosomes are not an obligate part of that pathway. An intact plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol transport pathway was also indicated in studies of cholesterol balance in the NPCnih mouse model of NPC disease. Xieet al. (31Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1278-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that cholesterol delivered via HDL to the adrenal was used as normal for cholesterol esterification and steroid hormone production, and that HDL-cholesterol delivered to the liver could apparently be secreted into the bile or converted to bile acids as normal in NPCnih mice. This activity of cholesterol delivered via HDL contrasted with cholesterol delivered via LDL or chylomicrons, which was sequestered within a metabolically inactive pool (31Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1278-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We can think of no apparent reason for LDL cholesterol to be released by non-NPC1-containing late endosomes/lysosomes and rapidly transported to the plasma membrane followed by quick retrieval and delivery to NPC1-containing organelles, as proposed by Cruz et al. (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). If this rapid transit does take place, it is not clear how those cholesterol molecules would be quantitatively retrieved. Does the retrieval mechanism distinguish between the newly delivered cholesterol molecules and the other plasma membrane pool(s), or are they delivered to a plasma membrane domain that does not diffuse laterally? One possibility is that the cholesterol detected by Cruzet al. (7Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) is actually an internal pool that is capable of being diverted to the plasma membrane by CD depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol content. Our hypothesis is that membrane lipid and receptor-bound cargo such as LDL is internalized and delivered to the endocytic recycling compartment (32Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). LDL is released from its receptor and sorted into early endosomes. LDL-cholesteryl ester hydrolysis likely begins when the LDL particle is in transit through the endocytic pathway. In multivesicular late endosomes, NPC1 facilitates the rapid transport of lipids, whether they arrived as constituents of the lipoprotein particles or of the vesicle membranes. NPC1-containing vesicles have been observed to bud from late endosomes, presumably carrying cholesterol and other cargo, and fuse with perinuclear and peripheral membranous compartments, although not the plasma membrane (20Ko D.C. Gordon M.D. Jin J.Y. Scott M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Cholesterol may be delivered via NPC1 to the endocytic recycling compartment (32Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) from which it recycles to the plasma membrane. When NPC1 is dysfunctional, cholesterol accumulates in terminal organelles because its acquisition by vesicular transport and lipoprotein uptake is greater than its dispersal by vesicular trafficking alone. We conclude that plasma membrane cholesterol can reach the endoplasmic reticulum by NPC1-dependent and NPC1-independent pathways. The NPC1-dependent pathway involves the movement of membrane lipids by vesicle trafficking through endosomes to the NPC1-containing late endosomes, where it is dispersed by NPC1. The NPC1-independent pathway is responsible for rapid cycling of cholesterol to the cell interior and back and represents the pathway that is defective in mutant 3-6. We thank Peter Pentchev for very helpful discussions, Jill Morris and Peter Pentchev for providing the human NPC1 cDNA, and T. Y. Chang for generously supplying the hamster NPC1 cDNA sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2142683403,"We employed a genetically defined human cancer model to investigate the contributions of two genes up-regulated in several cancers to phenotypic changes associated with late stages of tumorigenesis. Specifically, tumor cells expressing two structurally unrelated bone-related genes, osteonectin and osteoactivin, acquired a highly invasive phenotype when implanted intracranially in immunocompromised mice. Mimicking a subset of gliomas, tumor cells invaded brain along blood vessels and developed altered vasculature at the brain-tumor interface, suggesting that production of those two proteins by tumor cells may create a complex relationship between invading tumor and vasculature co-opted during tumor invasion. Interestingly, the same tumor cells formed massive spontaneous metastases when implanted subcutaneously. This dramatic alteration in tumor phenotype indicates that cellular microenvironment plays an important role in defining the specific effects of those gene products in tumor behavior. In vitro examination of tumor cells expressing either osteonectin or osteoactivin revealed that there was no impact on cellular growth or death but increased invasiveness and expression of MMP-9 and MMP-3. Specific pharmacologic inhibitors of MMP-2/9 and MMP-3 blocked the increased in vitro invasion associated with osteoactivin expression, but only MMP-3 inhibition altered the invasive in vitrophenotype mediated by osteonectin. Results from this genetically defined model system are supported by similar findings obtained from several established tumor cell lines derived originally from human patients. In sum, these results reveal that the expression of a single bone-related gene can dramatically alter or modify tumor cell behavior and may confer differential growth characteristics in different microenvironments.

Unfortunately, the phenotypic consequences of many changes in gene expression pattern between cancers and their corresponding normal tissues are largely unclear. To address this problem, we took a functional genomics approach by using a genetically defined glioma model system to investigate genes involved in the acquisition of malignant phenotype associated with late stages of tumorigenesis. Particularly, we were interested in genes whose expression is not associated with normal brain tissues or astrocyte cultures but which are nevertheless overexpressed in gliomas. Among those candidate genes, several bone-related genes were noticeably overexpressed in a high proportion of gliomas. Of note, two structurally unrelated genes, osteonectin and osteoactivin, have been found previously to be overexpressed in several other types of cancers, but their precise contribution to the development of specific cancer phenotype has yet to be elucidated. Osteonectin, also known as secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) or BM-40, is a 43-kDa extracellular matrix protein. Osteonectin was originally discovered as one of the most abundant non-collagenous components of bone, but it is also expressed in a number of other cell types that are involved in active remodeling of tissues (1Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary physiological role of osteonectin has been postulated to be an important modulator of cell-extracellular matrix interactions during the processes of tissue remodeling (2Brekken R.A Sage E.H.

Cancer. 1995; 64: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In gliomas, osteonectin is expressed in all tumor grades, usually at the tumor-brain margin and sites of neoangiogenesis (4Rempel S.A. Golembieski W.A. Ge S. Lemke N. Elisevich K. Mikkelsen T. Gutierrez J.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 1112-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that osteonectin expression may be involved in tumor cell invasion (14Golembieski W.A. Ge S. Nelson K. Mikkelsen T. Rempel S.A. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1999; 17: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased osteonectin expression in other tumor types is associated with a conversion to invasive and metastatic tumors and a correlation in some instances with elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1that is linked to increased tumor malignancy (11Porte H.

Importantly, reduced expression of osteonectin by an antisense approach was found to correlate with a reduction in tumor formation by melanoma cells (15Ledda M.F. Adris S. Bravo A.I. Kairiyama C. Bover L. Chernajovsky Y. Mordoh J. Podhajcer O.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise role of osteonectin in the pathological process of carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated, osteonectin overexpression is intimately correlated with the progression of tumorigenesis of multiple types of human cancers. Osteoactivin, also known as GPNMB or dendritic cell-associated, heparan sulfate proteoglycan-integrin ligand (DC-HIL), is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is localized to the cell surface and lysosomal membranes (16Shikano S. Bonkobara M. Zukas P.K. Ariizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8125-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), as well as in a secreted form (17Safadi F.F. Xu J. Smock S.L. Rico M.C. Owen T.A. Popoff S.N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 84: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Highly expressed in bone, the physiological function of osteoactivin is postulated to be involved in the regulation of osteoblast maturation (16Shikano S. Bonkobara M. Zukas P.K. Ariizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8125-8134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, osteoactivin is found to be overexpressed in melanomas (18Weterman M.A. Ajubi N. van Dinter I.M. Degen W.G. van Muijen G.N. Ruitter D.J. Bloemers H.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), gliomas (19Loging W.T. Lal A. Siu I.M. Loney T.L. Wikstrand C.J. Marra M.A. Prange C. Bigner D.D. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and cancers of the breast, stomach, and pancreas. 2NCBI SAGE Genie web site. Although the precise role of osteoactivin in cancer development remains unknown, it is tempting to suggest that the significant elevation of this bone-related protein in gliomas has a role in brain tumor progression. To determine the specific contributions of osteonectin and osteoactivin expression to human cancer development, we employed a genetically defined model system in which the genetic effects of increased gene expression could be directly linked to phenotypic changes of tumorigenesis. In this system, transformed human astrocytes by the sequential introduction of the simian virus-40 large T antigen, the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT), and oncogenic Ha-Ras display a phenotype mimicking that of low grade gliomas in the formation of non-invasive tumor mass in immune-compromised animals (20Rich J.N. Guo C. McLendon R.E. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3556-3560PubMed Google Scholar). The characteristics of this human tumor model system allowed us to test specifically the phenotypic changes associated with tumor progression derived from the expression of genes under investigation. Consequently, we found that expression of osteonectin or osteoactivin was associated with angiocentric intracranial invasion and increased production of MMPs by the tumor cells. Furthermore, osteonectin and osteoactivin expression caused the development of spontaneous metastases systemically when the tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously. Our results suggest that the expression of bone-related genes in advanced human cancers may represent a novel mechanism by which tumor cells acquire capabilities that are associated with the phenotypic changes in late stages of tumorigenesis dependent on tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the data strongly support the notion that the genetically defined model of human cancers (20Rich J.N. Guo C. McLendon R.E. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Counter C.M.

A genetically defined human glioma cell line was generated as described previously (20Rich J.N. Guo C. McLendon R.E. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3556-3560PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.5-kb cDNA fragment (a generous gift from Sandra Rempel, Henry Ford Hospital) and a full-length cDNA fragment of GPNMB (a generous gift from H. P. Bloemers, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) were each cloned into a retroviral backbone with a bleo selection marker. Cells underwent a positive selection with Zeocin (400 μg/ml, Invitrogen). U87MG, U251MG (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), and D54MG (Duke University Medical Center) were infected with a retrovirus expressing either a puromycin resistance gene or osteonectin and puromycin resistance. Selection was undertaken with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Early passage polyclonal cultures were used for all experiments. Cells were analyzed for the expression of osteonectin, growth factor receptors, and MMPs by Western analysis. A 10-cm plate was lysed, and 50 μg of total cellular protein was used for each sample. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and transferred to a PDVF membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% albumin. Primary antibodies for anti-osteonectin (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT), anti-GPNMB (gift of Carol Wikstrand, Duke University), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-tubulin (Sigma), anti-MMP-9 (Calbiochem), anti-MMP-3 (Calbiochem), anti-MMP-2 (Calbiochem), anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (gift of Carol Wikstrand, Duke University), anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PDGFRα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) (Calbiochem) antibodies were used. Secondary antibodies were either goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) or sheep anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were plated into 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well and labeled for the last 6 h with 4 μCi of [3H]thymidine, fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed in 0.2 N NaOH. [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA was measured with a scintillation counter. Each measurement was performed in triplicate. Cells were plated into 10-cm plates at a density of 5 × 105cells per well, serum-starved overnight after attachment, and then fed with media containing serum for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed once in phosphate buffered saline, and resuspended in RNaseA (100 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Samples were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. For these assays, 35-mm plates were prepared with a base layer of Dulbecco's minimal essential media with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) and 0.6% bacto agar (BD Biosciences). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells per plate in a mix of Dulbecco's minimal essential media with 10% calf serum and 0.4% bacto agar. Plated cells were fed once a week with 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential media plus 10% calf serum and 0.4% bacto agar. After 14 days, the plates were stained with 0.5 ml of 0.005% crystal violet. On each plate, colonies with more than 30 cells were counted. Each measurement was performed in triplicate. Intracranial tumor formation was tested with SCID-beige mice injected with 1 × 106glioma cells in 10 μl of Methocel (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, IL). Mice were sacrificed when they developed any neurological abnormalities. Brains were serially sectioned and examined by histopathology. Immunohistochemistry was performed on all tumors with hematoxylin and eosin, factor VIII, collagen IV, and Ki-67. Vascular characteristics of tumors were compared through an examination of vessel number and size in selected high power fields. Fields were selected to represent maximal tumor diameters without significant areas of necrosis. Internal organs were completely removed and evaluated grossly for macroscopic metastases. Selected livers and lungs were examined for microscopic metastases. SCID-beige mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were subcutaneously injected in the flank with 10 × 106 glioma cells per mouse in 100 μl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) (20Rich J.N. Guo C. McLendon R.E. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3556-3560PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were regularly checked for tumor formation. Tumor volume was calculated with the formula 0.5 × (length) × (width)2. Tumors were removed and examined by immunohistopathology. Mice that were noted to have significant weight loss were sacrificed regardless of primary tumor size. All internal organs including the brain were removed at the time of sacrifice and grossly examined for metastases. Selected lungs, livers, and brains were sectioned and examined for microscopic metastases. Kits were purchased from BD Biosciences and used according to instructions. Briefly, 2.5 × 104 tumor cells were incubated in selected conditions (serum-free media, 1% Me2SO control, 100 μm MMP-2 Inhibitor I (Calbiochem), 100 μmMMP-2/9 Inhibitor I (Calbiochem), or 100 μm MMP-3 Inhibitor II (Calbiochem)) and then allowed to attach and invade. Cells were fixed 22 h after plating. The invasion was calculated as a ratio of that shown by control (uncoated) inserts to that shown by Matrigel-coated inserts. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used in all analysis Differential gene expression analyses of primary brain tumors and normal brain by the SAGE technology have permitted the identification of numerous genes that are increased in expression in malignant gliomas, including osteonectin and osteoactivin (4Rempel S.A. Golembieski W.A. Ge S. Lemke N. Elisevich K. Mikkelsen T. Gutierrez J.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 1112-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Loging W.T. Lal A. Siu I.M. Loney T.L. Wikstrand C.J. Marra M.A. Prange C. Bigner D.D. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To understand the role of these two genes in the pathogenesis of gliomas, we determined the effects of overexpressing osteonectin or osteoactivin by using a genetically defined human glioma cell line (hereafter referred to as the THR glioma line) developed in our laboratory (20Rich J.N. Guo C. McLendon R.E. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. Counter C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3556-3560PubMed Google Scholar). When implanted intracranially in immune-compromised mice, THR cells display a non-invasive phenotype. This phenotype is in contrast to that of gliomas in patients that are universally invasive, suggesting that additional genetic alterations beyond those already present in this cell line are required to develop an invasive phenotype in vivo. Thus, the THR cells represent an ideal model system in which to study the contributions of specific genetic changes to late stages of glioma development. Through the use of a retroviral system with an independent selectable marker, we generated polyclonal THR glioma cells that ectopically expressed either osteonectin (Fig. 1 A) or osteoactivin (Fig. 1 B). Early passage cells were used in all experiments to minimize genetic changes associated with simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen expression. To determine the potential impact of osteonectin or osteoactivin expression on tumor development, we implanted these engineered THR cell lines intracranially in suspensions. In this nature environment, the genetically defined glioma cells formed large extra-axial masses with histologic features consistent with a malignant neural tumor including pseudopallisading necrosis (Fig. 1 C), regardless of whether the tumors expressed the vector, osteonectin, or osteoactivin. Tumors derived from vector control cells were located predominantly within the subarachnoid space, and rare foci superficially invaded the Virchow-Robin spaces but extended no deeper than the molecular layer of the superficial cerebral cortex. The Virchow-Robin spaces and vasculature remained delicate without expansion by tumor, increased numbers of vessels, or hypertrophy of the endothelium (not shown). However, in 23 of 33 mice implanted with the osteonectin-expressing glioma cells, tumors were located within the subarachnoid space and displayed a striking phenotype of invasion (Fig. 1 D), as well as expansion of the perivascular Virchow-Robin spaces by masses of tumor cells that extended into the deep layers of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1 E) similar to previous reports of glioma invasion in mouse models (24Laws Jr., E.R. Goldberg W.J. Bernstein J.J. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 11: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the tumors derived from vector control glioma cells, blood vessels associated with the tumors were increased in size and number (Fig. 1 F). These features readily contrasted with adjacent brain tissues not invaded by the tumor. Neoplastic cells in rare nests and single cells were seen adjacent to the Virchow-Robin spaces in the parenchyma, a finding that may represent either true invasion of brain parenchyma or formation of an angiocentric perivascular zone outside the limits of the pia-glial membrane. The prominent tumor associated vasculature was readily detected by immunohistochemical staining of the factor VIII antigen, which showed enhanced proliferation and endothelial hypertrophy of the osteonectin-expressing glioma tumors in comparison with the normal vasculature seen in adjacent brain, as well as the tumors derived from the vector control cells. Osteoactivin-expressing cells formed intracranial tumors in a fashion similar to those expressing osteonectin but with a lower rate of brain invasion (Fig. 1, D and G) and fewer associated vascular alterations (Fig. 1 H). Taken together, our data suggest that the expression of osteonectin and osteoactivin induce glioma invasion in the context of brain environment associated with penetrating blood vessels. Having documented the dramatic effects of osteonectin and osteoactivin expression on tumor invasion in xenograph experiments, we next investigated the mechanism by which these genes exert tumorigenic effects. Although in vitro systems are incomplete models of tumor invasion and metastasis as they lack normal stromal interactions, they allow selected analysis of potential changes at the cellular level, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. Previously, it was reported that osteonectin inhibits cell proliferation (25Bradshaw A.D. Francki A. Motamed K. Howe C. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and induces apoptosis in some ovarian carcinoma cell lines (26Yiu G.K. Chan W.Y. Ng S.W. Chan P.S. Cheung K.K. Berkowitz R.S. Mok S.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, we find that expression of osteonectin or osteoactivin in our THR glioma cells did not cause any significant changes in cell proliferation (Fig.2 A), apoptosis (Fig.2 A), or DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 B). Disruption of osteonectin expression has been linked to loss of IGF-1R expression (27Basu A. Rodeck U. Prendergast G.C. Howe C.C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar), but we found no differences in the expression levels of IGF-1R, PDGFR-α or -β, or EGFR between control and osteonectin-expressing cells (Fig. 2 C). Osteoactivin expression was associated with an increase in EGFR expression but a decrease in PDGFR-α expression and no change in PDGFR-β or IGF-1R expression (Fig. 2 C). In addition, the ectopic expression of osteonectin or osteoactivin in human astrocytes expressing SV40 T antigen and human telomerase catalytic subunit failed to provide a mitogenic stimulus to transform these cells in the absence of oncogenic Ras as measured by soft agar colony formation assays (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that osteonectin and osteoactivin expression is mainly associated with the acquired abilities by the tumor cells in invasion rather than tumor initiation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the impact of osteonectin and osteoactivin expression on tumor cell invasion in vitro. As shown in Fig.3, A and B, osteonectin or osteoactivin expression significantly increased cell invasion in all cell lines tested as measured by the Matrigel invasion assay. Constitutive expression of osteonectin or osteoactivin appeared to increase the ability of tumor cells to degrade components of the extracellular matrix and increased motility, a critical aspect of invasive cancers.Figure 3Osteonectin and osteoactivin expression is associated with increased invasion and expression of MMP-9 and MMP-3. As shown in A, Matrigel invasion assays were performed with the genetically defined THR glioma cell line, D54MG, U87MG, and U251MG, each engineered to express osteonectin (ON). The expression of osteonectin was clearly linked to increased invasion relative to vector control (VEC). *,p = 0.01. As shown in B, Matrigel analysis of glioma cells expressing osteoactivin with specific MMP-2, MMP-2/9, and MMP-3 inhibitors ablated the increase in invasion associated with osteoactivin expression (OA) relative to vector controls. CON, control. *, p = 0.01 relative to vector control; **, p = 0.01 relative to untreated osteoactivin-expressing tumor. As shown in C, Western analysis of a genetically defined glioma cell line with vector control (V), osteonectin, or osteoactivin expression revealed increased expression of gelatinase B (MMP-9) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) but minimal change of gelatinase A (MMP-2). As shown inD, Matrigel analysis of glioma cells expressing either vector control or osteonectin showed no change in invasion with an MMP-2/9 inhibitor, but an MMP-3 inhibitor ablated the increase in invasion associated with osteonectin expression (*, p = 0.01 relative to untreated). As shown in E, parental genetically defined THR glioma cells were treated with 50 μg/ml purified human osteonectin (Hematologic Technologies, Essex, VT). Conditioned media were collected simultaneously with either no osteonectin or after treatment with osteonectin for specific times. The media (50 μl) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for stromelysin-1 (MMP-3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further explore the mechanisms that mediate the invasive effects of osteonectin and osteoactivin, we examined the expression profiles of proteins intimately associated with tumor invasion, specifically the MMPs. As shown in Fig. 3 C, we found that osteonectin and osteoactivin expression significantly increased the production of MMP-9 and MMP-3 by the tumor cells with minimal changes in MMP-2 expression. To test whether this up-regulation of MMPs is directly linked to the invasive behavior of tumors expressing osteonectin and osteoactivin, we examined the effect of specific MMP inhibitors in the Matrigel invasion assay. Treatment of cells expressing osteonectin with an MMP-2/9 inhibitor had no effect (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that the increase in MMP-9 expression was not a major contributing factor to the changes in invasive behavior by the osteonectin-expressing tumor cells. However, MMP-3 inhibitor treatment substantially reduced invasion through Matrigel by the same tumor cells (Fig. 3 D), suggesting an important role for MMP-3 in mediating the in vitro invasive behavior of these cells. Consistent with this observation, treatment of parental THR cells with exogenous osteonectin induced the production of MMP-3 within 4 h (Fig. 3 E), whereas the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not change (data not shown). Similarly, invasion of Matrigel by THR cells expressing osteoactivin was also most sensitive to a blockage of MMP-3 activity, although this activity was partially inhibited by inhibitors specific for MMP-2 and MMP-2/9 (Fig.3 B). Taken together, the data suggest that osteonectin and osteoactivin may promote tumor invasion, at least in part, by increasing the production of specific MMPs. Since osteonectin and osteoactivin are expressed in other types of advanced cancers, we investigated the potential effects of these two genes on tumor progression in a different growth microenvironment. To do this, osteonectin-expressing and osteoactivin-expressing THR glioma cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of SCID-beige mice. The primary subcutaneous tumors derived from the glioma cells expressing osteonectin have an identical latency period (∼29 days) to a vector control cell line but grow to a larger volume (Fig.4 A). Tumors from the osteoactivin-expressing cell line display a longer latency (∼39 days) but subsequently grow to, on average, a larger size than vector controls (Fig. 4 A). Tumors expressing osteonectin and osteoactivin did not exhibit a difference in angiogenic features from the control cells (data not shown). Strikingly, both types of tumor cells developed massive spontaneous intrathoracic and/or intraperitoneal metastases (Fig. 4, B and C). Metastases were found in 50% (16 of 32) of mice injected with osteonectin-expressing glioma cells and 14% (3 of 15) of osteoactivin-expressing glioma cells (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the THR vector control cell line exhibited a single small, discrete metastasis in only 1 of 15 mice, and no metastases developed in 25 mice implanted with the THR parental cell line (not shown). Interestingly, the development of metastases was independent of primary tumor size. Three of 16 mice that developed metastases from osteonectin-expressing cells had no grossly evident subcutaneous tumors at the initial site of injection at the time of euthanasia. Therefore, the data suggest that the development of a metastatic phenotype from osteonectin-expressing glioma cells is associated with an early stage of tumor development inside the animals. Upon close pathological examination, we found that tumors derived from osteonectin-expressing glioma cells display a phenotype of solid and circumscribed neoplasms capable of invading the pancreas, peripancreatic soft tissues, subcutaneous tissues, and liver (Fig.4, E and F). Examination of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of tumors derived from osteonectin-expressing cells revealed a malignant phenotype of poorly differentiated neoplasm. Within the tumor mass, there were numerous areas of atypical mitoses and necrosis pseudopalisaded by neoplastic cells. Taken together, histological analyses of tumors derived from osteonectin-expressing cells revealed typical pathological features that are consistent with metastatic disease. Interestingly, we found that the metastasized tumors did not possess the features of prominently increased vasculature and hypertrophic endothelium that are often associated with the invasive brain tumors. Consistent with this observation, lymphatic/vascular invasion and perineural extension were not detected in the metastatic sites. To test whether the effects of osteonectin described above were cell line-specific, we investigated the behavior of tumor development by the human glioma cell lines D54MG, U87MG, and U251MG engineered to express higher levels of osteonectin (Fig. 4 G). Importantly, we found that ectopic expression of osteonectin by these glioma cell lines also induced spontaneous metastases when they were injected subcutaneously in the flanks of SCID-beige mice (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that osteonectin expression can induce a non-metastatic cancer cell line to adopt a metastatic phenotype with the alteration in the expression of only a single gene. Technological improvements now permit comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns in cancer specimens. The resulting data have created a wealth of information to be mined, but utilization of the data remains difficult due to a lack of functional information for specific genes. Here we demonstrate the use of a genetically defined human cancer model system to investigate the function of specific genes differentially expressed in human cancers. Previously developed model systems of cancer have included cell lines created from human tumors and murine models. Although each model system has been of great benefit to our understanding of the contributions that specific genetic alterations play in the development of specific phenotypes of cancer, each system has significant drawbacks. Human cell lines are generally derived from advanced cancers that have widespread genetic changes and genomic instability as well as changes from long passages in cell culture. Murine models permit genetic control but are labor-intensive and suffer from potential species-specific differences in the process of transformation and gene function (28Hamad N.M. Elconin J.H. Karnoub A.E. Bai W. Rich J.N. Abraham R.T. Der C.J. Counter C.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2045-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, a genetically defined human cancer model system offers a useful tool to determine the roles of specific genes in carcinogenesis, particularly the late stages of this multistep process. Using this system, we investigated genes that normally appear to be highly expressed in bone without presence in brain tissues but have significantly increased expression in human gliomas. Although the expression of both osteonectin and osteoactivin has been linked to tumor progression in previous studies, their precise contributions to late stages of tumorigenesis remain unclear. Through an ectopic expression strategy in this model system, we revealed that osteonectin expression induced a highly malignant phenotype with significantly increased brain invasion associated with vascular proliferation and spontaneous systemic metastasis, whereas osteoactivin expression resulted in a more modest increase in malignant phenotype with less frequent metastases and lower degrees of vascular change. Although the highly metastatic characteristics displayed by the tumor cells in our study do not fully replicate the precise behavior of gliomas in humans, the data strongly support the notion that expression of osteonectin and osteoactivin could significantly alter or modify tumor behavior. Considering the fact that these genes are also overexpressed in other types of human cancers that do display a metastatic phenotype, this finding is clearly relevant and significant to our understanding of the mechanism underlying metastasis associated with those types of human cancers. Furthermore, our results indicate that the cellular microenvironment potently modulates the phenotypic behavior of cancer cells that express those two genes since glioma cells expressing osteonectin, and to a lesser extent, osteoactivin, formed large spontaneous metastases with subcutaneous implantation but remained localized to the brain with intracranial implantation. The vascular and extracellular environment in the brain is radically different from that of other organs, with the presence of the blood-brain barrier, absence of lymphatics, and brain-specific extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions associated with neuronal and glial migration during development. These differences may partially account for the differential behavior of cells expressing osteonectin implanted in the brain versus other parts of the body. This finding strongly suggests that contributions to the development of specific tumorigenic phenotypes by the expression of specific genes are dependent on the specific characteristics of the microenvironment associated with tumor progression, adding another layer of complexity to the molecular mechanisms underlying late stages of tumorigenesis. Another potentially important finding is that osteonectin and osteoactivin appear to promote a specific invasive phenotype intracranially involving tumor cell invasion along pre-existent blood vessels in the Virchow-Robin spaces and development of altered vasculature at the brain-tumor interface. This phenotype mimics the behavior of a subset of human gliomas and many invasive medulloblastomas. Osteonectin has been reported to have an effect on angiogenesis through regulation of VEGF activity (29Vajkoczy P. Menger M.D. Goldbrunner R. Ge S. Fong T.A. Vollmar B. Schilling L. Ullrich A. Hirth K.P. Tonn J.C. Schmiedek P. Rempel S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In our studies, neither osteonectin nor osteoactivin induced significant changes in the vasculature as measured by vessel number or diameter within the primary tumors, whether formed subcutaneously or intracranially. In contrast, intracranial tumor cells expressing osteonectin and osteoactivin grow along penetrating blood vessels, and the blood vessels at the invasive front were markedly abnormal with vessel hypertrophy and hyperplasia. These results suggest that the production of osteonectin and osteoactivin by glioma cells may create a complex relationship between invading tumor and normal vasculature that may be co-opted during tumor invasion, consequently allowing expansion of the tumor mass without the induction of angiogenesis at a significant level. The malignant phenotypes mediated by osteonectin and osteoactivin likely involve multiple mechanisms at the molecular level, with the induction of MMP expression as an important component. The rapid increase in MMP-3 protein levels in response to osteonectin treatment by the THR tumor cells strongly suggests that osteonectin may regulate the production of this specific MMP through a more direct mechanism. Taken together, our results validate the use of a genetically defined human cancer model system in investigating the contributions of specific genes to late stages of tumorigenesis. This in vivosystem permits the application of a functional genomics approach in defining the specific activities of genes that have been identified to be abnormally expressed in human cancers, particularly those associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

We have now fully characterized a new member of the Class II HDAC family, HDAC9. The enzyme contains a conserved deacetylase domain, represses reporter activity when recruited to a promoter, and utilizes histones H3 and H4 as substrates in vitro and in vivo. HDAC9 is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern that partially overlaps that of HDAC4. Within the human hematopoietic system, expression of HDAC9 is biased toward cells of monocytic and lymphoid lineages. The HDAC9 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, some of which display distinct cellular localization patterns. For example, full-length HDAC9 is localized in the nucleus, but the isoform lacking the region encoded by exon 7 is in the cytoplasm. HDAC9 interacts and co-localizes in vivo with a number of transcriptional repressors and co-repressors, including TEL and N-CoR, whose functions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. These results suggest that HDAC9 plays a role in hematopoiesis; its deregulated expression may be associated with some human cancers.

Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is a complex consisting of 1.75 superhelical turns of DNA wrapped around a core histone octamer comprising two subunits each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (2Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 protrude from the nucleosome and interact with the negatively charged DNA phosphate backbone when in their highly basic, unmodified state (3Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). These tails contain specific amino acids that are targets for a variety of enzymes, producing diverse modifications including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation. Acetylation is thus far the most widely studied and involves substitution of the ε-amino group of specific lysines in a process catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases. This leads to a more acidic residue and an overall decreased affinity for DNA by the histone octamer. For the transcriptional machinery, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomal arrays presents a major physical obstacle in gaining access to the DNA template, and there has long been evidence that unwinding of nucleosomes because of the acetylation of histone tails plays an important role in the activation of transcription (4Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). As expected, enzymes that remove these modifications, histone deacetylases (HDACs),1 are important in gene silencing, and recent studies have implicated abnormal HDAC function in a number of human cancers (5Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). It is therefore important in studies of gene expression to address the mechanisms by which HDACs effect specific changes in chromatin structure. Thus far, 11 histone deacetylases that share homology through their deacetylase domains have been characterized, and they may be broadly divided into two classes on the basis of homology to the yeast HDACs RPD3 (Class I) and HDA1 (Class II) (6Gray S.G.

Class I HDACs are nuclear proteins that are generally small in size (40–55 kDa) and ubiquitously expressed (10Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At least with respect to HDAC3, association with the co-repressor appears to play a role in the regulation of its catalytic activity (34Guenther M.G. Barak O. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

HDAC9 contains 1069 amino acids and functions as deacetylase both in vitro andin vivo, and this activity is essential for its associated repression of gene expression. Furthermore, HDAC9 is alternatively spliced to generate multiple protein isoforms that may harbor distinct biological activities and may be associated with human cancer. One of these isoforms consists of the noncatalytic N-terminal region of HDAC9 (conserved in HDACs 4, 5, and 7) and has been previously identified inXenopus (MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR)) (35Sparrow D.B.

Tjian R. Science. 1985; 227: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Hematopoietic cell lines and the colon cancer cell line SW-620 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Adult peripheral blood was taken with informed consent, and the low density cells (<1.077 g/ml) were separated using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma AS) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% fetal calf serum (Sigma). For sorting, the cells were stained separately with either mouse monoclonal anti-CD19 (Dako) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 (Caltag-Medsystems) followed by enrichment of positive cells using the standard MACS system protocol (Miltenyi Biotec). Rat anti-mouse IgG1 beads were used to isolate CD19+ve cells and anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate beads for CD14+ve cells. Nonviable cells were excluded by the addition of the dye To-pro-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) to presorted cells. Enriched cells were analyzed and sorted to >99% purity using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS Vantage SE; B.D. Biosciences) at two wavelengths (using 530/30- and 660/20-nm band passes). Immunoprecipitations for histone deacetylase assays were essentially performed as described (16Fischle W. Emiliani S. Hendzel M.J. Nagase T. Nomura N. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11713-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 293T cells (5 × 107 cells) were transfected with PolyFect (Qiagen). One 10-cm dish was used per four HDAC assays. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in low stringency lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To control for expression of different constructs, concentrations of protein extracts were normalized with a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad), and Western blot analysis was performed with the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences) as described (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Extracts were precleared by incubation with protein 10% v/v protein A/G-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with 10% v/v M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by washing three times with low stringency lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl (high stringency), and twice with HDAC buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). For inhibition studies, the immunoprecipitated complexes were preincubated with trichostatin A (400 nm) in HDAC buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal sequences of histone H3 (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLC) and H4 (SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRC) were [3H]acetylated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), with 20,000 cpm used as substrate per reaction. The beads were resuspended in 200 μl of HDAC buffer containing acetylated peptide and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Histone deacetylase activity was determined after incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, according to the peptide manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells (5 × 107 cells) were transfected by CaPO4(Profection, Promega) with 5 μg of GAL4uasx5-Tk-Luc reporter plasmid plus 10 μg of expression vector containing heterologous fusions of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain with the indicated cDNAs. Immunoprecipitation of plasmid DNA plus associated histones was carried out ∼40 h after transfection according to a previously published protocol (48Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Histone-DNA complexes were cross-linked by the addition of 1% formaldehyde to the medium and incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. After lysis, the chromatin was sonicated to 0.2–1.0 kb and diluted 10-fold in IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors). Protein samples for Western blotting were taken prior to dilution; control samples for assaying input DNA were taken after dilution and de-cross-linked. Anti-acetylated histone H4 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used for the immunoprecipitation, and the DNA-histone complexes were collected overnight with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz). Sequences spanning the GAL4-binding site in the reporter were detected by semi-quantitative PCR using the forward primer 5′-ATTGCAGCTTATAATGGTTA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTCGAATTCGCCAATGACAA-3′. The number of cycles was determined empirically to give results that fall within the linear range of this particular PCR assay, and the reactions were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. Total RNA was extracted from purified cells and cell lines using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was made from total RNA by reverse transcription using Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen) or Omniscript (Qiagen) reverse transcriptases in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. HDAC9 cDNA was primed with 5′-TAAAACAGAGGCAGCAGGGGAAGAGTGAGT-3′ and HDAC9ΔCD/MITR cDNA was primed with 5′-TCAGATAATGACTTTAATTACAAATCCTGG-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was primed with random hexamers (Roche Diagnostics). 2 μg of total RNA was used per 20-μl reaction, and 2 μl of cDNA was used per subsequent PCR. The primer pairs were used for semi-quantitative PCR are shown in Fig.5 A. PCRs were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. A rabbit antiserum specific to the C terminus of human HDAC9 was raised using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1046–1060 of the protein (DVEQPFAQEDSRTAG), which was conjugated to diptheria toxoid (Mimotopes). This C-terminal region is not conserved in any other HDACs closely related to the HDAC9 protein. Antibodies to BCL-6 (d-9), GAL4 (DBD) (RK5C1), N-CoR (C-20), TEL (C-20), TEL (N-19), HDAC4 (H-92), HDAC5 (P-16), HDAC6 (H-300), and HDRP/MITR (G-15) (this antibody also recognizes full-length HDAC9 protein) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to Myc tag (9B11), HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC7 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, and anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies used in chemiluminescent detection of Western blots were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All of the GST fusion proteins were prepared using standard procedures (43Dong S. Zhu J. Reid A. Strutt P. Guidez F. Zhong H.-J. Wang Z.-Y. Licht J. Waxman S. Chomienne C. Chen Z. Zelent A. Chen S.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3624-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were synthesizedin vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega), following the supplier's directions. 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated with 1 μg of GST or a given fusion protein. The assays were performed in NETN buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed five times with H buffer (20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to Biomax film (Kodak). 10-cm dishes containing tsCOS cells were transfected with 2 μg each of expression constructs encoding N-CoR, TEL, and FLAG-tagged HDAC9 isoforms using PolyFect (Qiagen). After 36 h the cells were washed in PBS and harvested, and the immunocomplexes were isolated using the Catch and Release immunoprecipitation system (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitated HDAC9 isoforms were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Endogenously expressed proteins were co-immunoprecipitated as above and detected with affinity-purified anti-HDAC9 rabbit polyclonal antibody. COS-7 cells growing on coverslips were transfected using PolyFect (Qiagen). After 36 h, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min and washed three times for 5 min in PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and washed three times for 5 min in PBS. The cells were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 2% bovine serum albumin (Vector Laboratories) and 5% relevant serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Ltd.) for the secondary antibody to be used. The primary antibodies were diluted to the appropriate concentrations in blocking buffer, centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed three times for 15 min in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Ltd.) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times for 15 min in PBS and mounted on slides using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics Quantix) using Smartcapture 2 software (Digital Scientific). 104 REH cells in log phase growth were cytospun and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were subsequently processed as described above. The cell nuclei were stained with To-pro-3 iodide (Molecular Probes), and slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Affinity-purified anti-HDAC9 rabbit polyclonal antibody was used for detection, and imaging was performed on a Leica TCS-SP2 system. In vivo sumoylation assays were carried out using the nickel affinity pull-down technique (49Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Losson R. Desterro J.M.P. Hay R.T. Chambon P. Dejean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, tsCOS cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 2 μg each of expression constructs encoding F-HDAC9, F-HDAC9Δexon12, and polyhistidine-tagged SUMO-1 or -2 using PolyFect (Qiagen). After 36 h the cells were washed in PBS and harvested directly in 1 ml of guanidine lysis buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0), sonicated, and centrifuged. The cleared samples were incubated for 2 h with 20 μl (packed volume) of Talon nickel affinity beads (Clontech). The bound proteins were washed twice in lysis buffer, three times in urea buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.5), and once in cold PBS before being eluted by boiling in Laemmli loading buffer. 20% of each guanidine lysis sample was removed and precipitated for 15 min on ice with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged, washed in 100% ethanol, and resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with affinity-purified anti-HDAC9 rabbit polyclonal antibody. The GenBankTM (50Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J.

https://openalex.org/W2036311400,"The Delta protein is a single-pass transmembrane ligand for the Notch family of receptors. Delta binding to Notch invokes regulated intramembrane proteolysis and nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain. Delta is proteolytically processed at two sites, Ala(581) and Ala(593) in the juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains, respectively (Mishra-Gorur, K., Rand, M. D., Perez-Villamil, B., and Artavanis-Tsakonas, S. (2002) J. Cell Biol. 159, 313-324). Controversy over the role of Delta processing in propagating Notch signals has stemmed from conflicting reports on the activity or inactivity of soluble extracellular domain products of Delta. We have examined Delta proteolysis in greater detail and report that Delta undergoes three proteolytic cleavages in the region of the juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains. Only one of these cleavages, analogous to cleavage at Ala(581), is dependent on the Kuzbanian ADAM metalloprotease. The two additional cleavages correspond to the previously described cleavage at Ala(593) and a novel unidentified site within or close to the transmembrane domain. Delta processing is up-regulated in co-cultures with Notch-expressing cells and is similarly induced by p-aminophenylmercuric acetate, a well documented activator of metalloproteases. Furthermore, expression of a truncated intracellular isoform of Delta shows prominent nuclear localization. Altogether, these data demonstrate a role for Notch in inducing Delta proteolysis and implicate a nuclear function for Delta, consistent with a model of bi-directional signaling through Notch-Delta interactions."

Heparan sulfate promotes ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinase and regulates signaling. The goal of this study was to examine the contribution of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to glioma angiogenesis. Here we show that all brain endothelial cell HSPGs carry heparan sulfate chains similarly capable of forming a ternary complex with FGF2 and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1c and of promoting a mitogenic signal. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that glypican-1 was overexpressed in glioma vessel endothelial cells, whereas this cell-surface HSPG was consistently undetectable in normal brain vessels. To determine the effect of increased glypican-1 expression on FGF2 signaling, we transfected normal brain endothelial cells, which express low base-line levels of glypican-1, with this proteoglycan. Glypican-1 expression enhanced growth of brain endothelial cells and sensitized them to FGF2-induced mitogenesis despite the fact that glypican-1 remained a minor proteoglycan. In contrast, overexpression of syndecan-1 had no effect on growth or FGF2 sensitivity. We conclude that the glypican-1 core protein has a specific role in FGF2 signaling. Glypican-1 overexpression may contribute to angiogenesis and the radiation resistance characteristic of this malignancy. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is a potent angiogenic factor in gliomas.

Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2)1 is one of the most potent stimulators of angiogenesis in wound healing and tumor growth. FGF2 induces all the important components of blood vessel growth, including degradation of the extracellular matrix, endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and differentiation into vascular tubes. FGFs signal through transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, the FGF receptors (FGFRs) (1Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; (http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/3/reviews/3005)PubMed Google Scholar). Of the four known FGFRs, FGFR1 is the one most prevalently found on endothelial cells (2Bastaki M. Nelli E.E. Dell'Era P. Rusnati M. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Parolini S. Auerbach R. Ruco L.P. Possati L. Presta M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Stable binding of the FGF ligand to the receptor tyrosine kinase and sustained signaling require the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans (3Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 4Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The participation of HS polysaccharides in the ternary FGF receptor signaling complex is facilitated through HS-binding motifs on both the FGF ligand and the receptor tyrosine kinase (5Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). HS chains are characterized by complex sulfation patterns resulting in distinct protein-binding domains, although it is currently unclear how the assembly of such domains is regulated. Experimental evidence indicates that stimulatory as well as inhibitory moieties are embedded within HS chains and that their relative balance determines the net effect on FGF signaling (6Liu D. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. El Shabrawi Y. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 568-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cells have the ability to rapidly adjust their HS to respond to a changing microenvironment (7Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). HS proteoglycan (HSPG) alterations have also been reported to occur during malignant progression. Recently, we described HS alterations in breast carcinomas, resulting in increased FGF2 binding and enhanced ternary FGF receptor complex assembly (8Mundhenke C. Meyer K. Drew S. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 185-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In vivo, the vast majority of HS exists in covalent linkage to core proteins, the HSPGs. HSPGs can be divided into cell-surface forms (syndecans and glypicans) and secreted extracellular matrix forms (e.g. perlecan). Literature reports on which HSPGs promote FGF2 signaling are conflicting. One study identified perlecan as the sole stimulatory HSPG, whereas syndecans and glypicans were found to inhibit FGF signaling (9Aviezer D. Hecht D. Safran M. Eisinger M. David G. Yayon A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1005-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Others reported that syndecans and glypicans also promote FGF2 signaling (10Steinfeld R. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These divergent results suggest that HSPGs with different core proteins assume this role depending on cell type and functional context. The question of whether different HSPG core proteins produced by one cell type can carry HS chains with different effects (stimulatory versus inhibitory) on FGF2 signaling is currently unresolved. Published reports on the role of HSPGs in angiogenesis are sparse (11Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Quiescent as well as angiogenically active blood vessels contain ample amounts of FGF2. This suggests that FGF2-mediated angiogenesis is regulated by additional factors such as HSPGs. Perlecan has been described as a pro-angiogenic molecule (12Sharma B. Handler M. Eichstetter I. Whitelock J.M. Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) as well as an inhibitor of FGF2 signaling in blood vessels (13Nugent M.A. Nugent H.M. Iozzo R.V. Sanchack K. Edelman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6722-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Other investigators have attributed an exclusive role to syndecan-4 in FGF2-induced angiogenesis and ascribed a special role to the core protein of this HSPG (14Volk R. Schwartz J.J. Li J. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24417-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to examine the contribution of different brain endothelial cell HSPGs to FGF2 signaling and glioma angiogenesis. We found that despite the fact that all endothelial cell HSPGs have the potential to promote binding of FGF2 to FGFR1c through their HS chains and to promote signaling, specific HSPGs appear to carry out the function of principal FGF2 co-receptors in tumor angiogenesis. Specifically, glypican-1 is dramatically up-regulated in glioma vessels, leading to enhanced growth and endothelial sensitivity to FGF2 stimulation. Yeast-derived human recombinant FGF2 was kindly provided by Dr. Brad Olwin (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). Anti-syndecan-1 antibody (B-B4) was purchased from Serotec (Raleigh, NC).

This antibody reacts with unsaturated uronate/HS “stubs” generated by heparitinase treatment. Polyclonal rabbit anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) antibody was purchased from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). This antibody reacts with the Factor VIII·vWF macromolecular complex. Dr. Robert Auerbach (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) kindly provided mouse brain endothelial (MBE) cells (21Alby L. Auerbach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5739-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GM7373 immortalized bovine endothelial cells were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ) (22Presta M. Maier J.A. Ragnotti G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both cell types were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were from Cambrex Corp. (East Rutherford, NJ). Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVECs) were purchased from VEC Technologies (Rensselaer, NY). All human primary endothelial cells were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes in EGM-2 endothelial cell growth medium (Cambrex Corp.). Proliferation of adherent cells was measured with a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay (BrdUrd colorimetric, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated with FGF2 for 24 h with BrdUrd label added for the final 4 h. The urokinase assay was adapted from Presta et al. (22Presta M. Maier J.A. Ragnotti G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, GM7373 cells were treated with FGF2 for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication. Ten μg of protein from cell lysate were incubated with bovine plasminogen (40 μg/ml) and Spectrozyme PL chromogenic substrate (330 μm). Absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 10-min intervals. Human high-molecular mass urokinase served as a standard. All urokinase assay reagents were purchased from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). FR1c-11 cells (BaF3 cells transfected with the FGFR1c isoform; kindly provided by Dr. David Ornitz, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 10% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium as source of interleukin-3. For the growth assays, cells (20,000/well) were added to 96-well tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium lacking interleukin-3 and incubated with various combinations of FGF2 and HSPGs for 72 h. The tetrazolium compound-based CellTiter 96 aqueous cell viability/proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions at the end of the incubation period. A 2.5-kb mouse glypican-1 cDNA fragment (a generous gift from Dr. Guido David) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen). A 1.3-kb mouse syndecan-1 cDNA sequence was cloned into the pIRESneo3 mammalian expression vector (Clontech) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer. The internal ribosome entry site in this vector permits simultaneous expression of syndecan-1 and the selection marker neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo) from one mRNA. This vector was chosen because measurable syndecan-1 overexpression could not be achieved with the pcDNA3.1 vector. MBE cells were stably transfected with either construct or the respective empty vector using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). After selection with G418 (500 μg/ml), cell extracts were subjected to HSPG Western blot analysis with antibody 3G10 to determine the levels of HSPG core proteins. Proliferation assays were carried out on mixed transfected populations to avoid clonal selection bias. Total endothelial cell HSPGs were purified as described (8Mundhenke C. Meyer K. Drew S. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 185-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Yanagishita M. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For selective isolation of cell-associated and extracellular matrix HSPGs, we modified a procedure described by Elkin et al. (24Elkin M. Ilan N. Ishai-Michaeli R. Friedmann Y. Papo O. Pecker I. Vlodavsky I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1661-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 3 days in 150-mm dishes. After rinsing, the cell monolayer was dissolved in cold cell lysis buffer (20 mmNH4OH and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 10) for 1.5 min. After removal of the lysate, the remaining extracellular matrix layer was washed four times with Hepes-buffered saline and extracted with 3 ml of buffer containing 10 mmTris, 8 m urea, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmNa2SO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, pH 8.0, for 5 min on ice and scraped into a polypropylene bottle. All extractions were enriched for proteoglycans by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography as described (8Mundhenke C. Meyer K. Drew S. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 185-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). HSPGs were quantified by dot blotting after heparitinase digestion and stained with antibody 3G10 using commercially available HSPGs (Sigma) as standards. To examine the ability of HSPGs to bind to FGF2, the growth factor was biotinylated while bound to heparin-agarose to protect its HS-binding site and then immobilized on streptavidin-agarose beads. MBE cell HSPGs were incubated with immobilized FGF2 and eluted with 2 mNaCl. Fractionation of HSPGs according to their ability to promote binding of FGF2 to FGFR1 was performed as described (8Mundhenke C. Meyer K. Drew S. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 185-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All HSPG preparations were digested with heparitinase and chondroitinase to remove all glycosaminoglycan chains prior to analysis on a 3.5–15% (w/v) Tris borate-polyacrylamide gradient gel. The membranes were stained with anti-ΔHS antibody 3G10 or anti-core protein antibodies (see above). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) were used for chemiluminescent detection. Residual human tissue was obtained fresh from the surgical pathology laboratory, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Torrance, CA), snap-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Binding assays were carried out essentially as described previously (25Friedl A. Filla M. Rapraeger A.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 535-546PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chang Z. Meyer K. Rapraeger A.C. Friedl A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were first incubated with FGF2 (10 nm) and then with the soluble recombinant FGFR1c extracellular domain linked to alkaline phosphatase (referred to as FR1-AP; 30 nm) (3Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Immobilized FR1-AP was detected with monoclonal anti-AP antibody (Sigma) and visualized with Alexa 546-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antiserum (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Rabbit polyclonal anti-vWF antiserum (1:2000) was used to localize endothelial cells in tissue sections, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was applied as a nuclear counterstain. Syndecan-1 and -4 and glypican-1 staining was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues as described (8Mundhenke C. Meyer K. Drew S. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 185-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Staining for syndecan-2 and -3 was carried out on cryostat sections because antibodies 10H4 and 1C7 did not produce a detectable signal on paraffin sections. In addition, cryosections were stained for glypican-1 with antibody S1 to confirm the paraffin section results. Antibodies 10H4 (10 μg/ml), 1C7 (10 μg/ml), and S1 (5 μg/ml) were detected with Alexa 546-conjugated secondary antibody. Rabbit polyclonal anti-vWF antibody was used to localize endothelial cells in tissue sections (see above). All fluorescence microscopy was done using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a SPOT RT slider chilled CCD digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Growth responses at different concentrations were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Correlations between staining results were examined by regression analysis using the StatView statistics program. A number of studies on a variety of cell types have demonstrated that HS is necessary for stable binding of FGF2 to FGFRs and for signaling. To establish an HS requirement for FGF2 signaling in endothelial cells, we evaluated the effect of abolishing HS on the key angiogenic and FGF2-stimulated events mitogenesis and urokinase production. MBE cells show a robust proliferative response to FGF2. In GM7373 bovine endothelial cells, FGF2 prominently induces urokinase-type plasminogen activator, a crucial enzyme responsible for extracellular matrix degradation during angiogenesis (27Gualandris A. Lopez Conejo T. Giunciuglio D. Albini A. Sabini E. Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Presta M. Microvasc. Res. 1997; 53: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence points toward divergent signaling pathways involved in the regulation of these two cellular responses (22Presta M. Maier J.A. Ragnotti G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Functional HS was abolished by treatment with sodium chlorate, a competitive inhibitor of glycosaminoglycan sulfation (28Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorate treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of MBE cell proliferation (Fig.1 A) and complete suppression of urokinase production by GM7373 bovine endothelial cells (Fig.1 B). Importantly, these responses were recovered in either cell type when HS sulfation was restored with sodium sulfate or by providing soluble heparin as an HS substitute to the cells in culture. HS exists almost exclusively in covalent linkage to a heterogeneous group of core proteins. As a first step in determining which HSPGs participate in the FGF2 co-stimulator role, we measured HSPG expression in different endothelial cells. Microvascular MBE cells, primary HMVECs, and human umbilical and saphenous vein endothelial cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Removal of all glycosaminoglycan chains by treatment with heparitinase and chondroitinase allowed the detection of discrete bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. Visualization of all HSPGs was possible using an antibody (clone 3G10) directed against the HS stubs (anti-ΔHS) remaining on the core proteins after heparitinase digestion (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–4) (20David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The signal generated with this antibody would be expected to be a function of the amount of core protein and the number of HS attachment sites per molecule. However, the possibility of biased heparitinase activity or 3G10 reactivity against different HSPGs cannot entirely be excluded. With this semiquantitative method, we estimated that syndecan-2 and -4 were the most prevalent cell-surface HSPGs produced by all of the endothelial cell types examined, whereas syndecan-1 and -3 and glypican-1 represented minor HSPG fractions in some cell types or were undetectable in others. A relatively strong band representing the secreted extracellular matrix HSPG perlecan was also observed in all cells examined. The identity of most bands was established in MBE cell extracts using core protein-specific antibodies (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 7–9). Glypican-1 was identified in HMVEC extracts (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) for lack of a mouse-reactive antibody. We noted a slightly delayed migration of human syndecan-4 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4) compared with murine syndecan-4 (lane 1), likely due to the species difference. Overall, MBE cells produced the largest amount of HSPGs. Syndecan-2 was the predominant HSPG in microvascular cells (MBE cells and HMVECs), whereas syndecan-4 predominated in large vein endothelial cells (human umbilical and saphenous vein endothelial cells). FGF2-binding ability would be expected to be the minimal requirement for HSPGs to function as FGF2 co-stimulators. To detect any potential differences in FGF2 binding between endothelial HSPGs, we incubated purified MBE cell HSPGs with immobilized FGF2 and analyzed the HSPGs found in this complex. The spectrum of HSPGs that bound to FGF2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) was similar to that of the loading control (lane 1), indicating that all HSPG core proteins are decorated with FGF2-binding HS chains. No binding was detected when beads lacked FGF2 (Fig. 2 B,lane 5) or when heparin was added to the binding reaction as a competitive inhibitor (lane 7). FGF2 binding is likely necessary for HSPGs to stimulate signaling, but is clearly not sufficient. The ternary receptor complex, which is generally regarded as the active signaling complex, is expected to require additional HS motifs interacting with HS-binding sites on FGFR (5Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Because FGFR1 is reportedly the only FGFR expressed by MBE cells (2Bastaki M. Nelli E.E. Dell'Era P. Rusnati M. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Parolini S. Auerbach R. Ruco L.P. Possati L. Presta M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and FGFR1c the most prevalent FGFR1 isoform, 2D. Qiao and A. Friedl, unpublished data. HSPGs isolated from this cell type were incubated with immobilized FGFR1c in the presence of FGF2. HSPGs participating in this ternary complex were analyzed on gradient gels (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Again, the relative abundance of HSPGs found in the complex was similar to that found in the loading control (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), suggesting that all core proteins carry HS chains with a similar potential to promote FGF2 binding to FGFR1c. Complex formation was abolished by omitting FGF2 from the reaction (Fig.2 C, lane 3) or by digesting the HSPGs with heparitinase prior to binding (lane 2), demonstrating the requirement for the FGF2 ligand and for intact HS chains. The complexes were similarly resistant to a NaCl concentration of 600 mm, but dissociated progressively when exposed to NaCl concentrations between 1 and 1.4 m (Fig. 2 C, lanes 5 and 6). To exclude the possibility that FGF2 bound to recombinant FGFR1c independent of heparan sulfate in these experiments, we immobilized biotinylated FGF2 on streptavidin-coated plates and measured binding of FGFR1c. As expected, FGFR1c binding to immobilized FGF2 was highly dependent on the presence of heparin (data not shown). In summary, this series of in vitro experiments demonstrates that HS chains on all MBE cell HSPGs are similarly capable of binding FGF2 and of promoting binding of FGF2 to FGFR1c in a ternary complex. The formation of a high-affinity ternary FGF·receptor complex does not necessarily assure signal generation. It is possible that a dimerized receptor signaling complex requires additional structural features within HS not examined in the assays used so far. To examine potential differences in the ability of endothelial cell HSPGs to promote receptor activation, HSPGs were fractionated into functional classes using selective extraction protocols (adapted from Ref. 24Elkin M. Ilan N. Ishai-Michaeli R. Friedmann Y. Papo O. Pecker I. Vlodavsky I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1661-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The relative purity of cell-associated HSPGs (composed primarily of syndecans and glypican-1) and extracellular matrix HSPGs (composed primarily of perlecan) was tested by Western blot analysis (Fig.3 A). Purified HSPGs were carefully quantified by dot blotting using antibody 3G10 (data not shown). Their activity was tested using FR1c-11 cells, which are BaF3 murine lymphoid cells transfected with FGFR1c (3Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). FR1c-11 (and parent BaF3) cells lack endogenous HSPGs and therefore depend on an exogenous source of HSPGs for FGF2-induced mitogenesis. HSPG dose-response curves in the presence or absence of FGF2 did not differ significantly between cell-associated, extracellular matrix, and total HSPGs, indicating that HS chains on these different core proteins are similarly capable of promoting an FGF2 signal (Fig. 3 B). To examine whether vascular HSPG binding activities are altered in gliomas, we reconstituted the FGF2·HSPG·FGFR1 complex in situ on frozen or paraffin sections of human tissue samples. Biopsy samples from grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma multiforme) and non-neoplastic brain controls (temporal lobectomy samples and normal white matter adjacent to tumors) were compared. In these experiments, binding of soluble FGFR1c to HSPGs within the tissue was measured in the presence of FGF2. FGFR1c binding was notably increased in glioma vessels (Fig. 4, A andE) compared with normal brain vessels (Fig. 4, Dand H) in 7 of 11 cases examined (64%). No recognizable morphologic features distinguished FGFR1c “binding” from “non-binding” cases. The binding signal was abolished by enzymatic degradation of HS with heparitinase (Fig. 4, B andF), demonstrating HS dependence, or by omitting the FGF2 incubation step (Fig. 4, C and G). This result indicates either a qualitative or quantitative alteration of glioma vessel HSPGs in the majority of tumors. Paraffin sections stained with anti-HS stub antibody 3G10 demonstrated an increase in total HSPG content in glioma vessels compared with normal brain vessels (Fig.5, A and B), suggesting that increased vascular HSPG content rather than altered HS structure is responsible for the elevated binding activity. Regression analysis of individual cases revealed a significant association between FR1-AP binding and antibody 3G10 staining intensity (p= 0.047).Figure 5Immunohistochemical detection of HSPG core proteins in paraffin sections.

https://openalex.org/W2063674018,"The breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has been implicated to function in many nuclear processes, including DNA damage repair, recombination, transcription, ubiquitination, cell cycle checkpoint enforcement, and centrosome regulation. Utilizing a previously described interaction between BRCA1 and RNA helicase A (RHA), we have developed a dominant-negative approach to block BRCA1 function in human breast epithelial cells. Overexpression of a truncated RHA peptide that can bind to the BRCA1 carboxy-terminus prevents normal BRCA1 function, such as BRCA1 association with nuclear foci following DNA damage. Overexpression of this dominant-negative protein induces pleomorphic nuclei, aberrant mitoses with extra centrosomes, and tetraploidy. This model system allows us to observe changes to mammary epithelial cells that occur acutely following loss of BRCA1 function. Furthermore, inhibition of BRCA1 via overexpressing the RHA fragment coincides with a reduction in PARP-1 protein expression, suggesting a possible mechanism for BRCA1 in the maintenance of genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2042221330,"In the present study, we showed that SPA-1, a Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP), was bound to a cytoskeleton-anchoring protein AF-6. SPA-1 and AF-6 were co-immunoprecipitated in the 293T cells transfected with both cDNAs as well as in normal thymocytes. In vitro binding studies using truncated fragments and their mutants suggested that SPA-1 was bound to the PDZ domain of AF-6 via probable internal PDZ ligand motif within the GAP-related domain. The motif was conserved among Rap1 GAPs, and it was shown that rapGAP I was bound to AF-6 comparably with SPA-1. RapV12 was also bound to AF-6 via the N-terminal domain, and SPA-1 and RapV12 were co-immunoprecipitated only in the presence of AF-6, indicating that they could be brought into close proximity via AF-6 in cells. Immunostaining analysis revealed that SPA-1 and RapV12 were co-localized with AF-6 at the cell attachment sites. In HeLa cells expressing SPA-1 in a tetracycline-regulatory manner, expression of AF-6 inhibited endogenous Rap1GTP and β1integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin in SPA-1-induced conditions, whereas it affected neither of them in SPA-1-repressed conditions. These results suggested that AF-6 could control integrin-mediated cell adhesion by regulating Rap1 activation through the recruitment of both SPA-1 and Rap1GTP via distinct domains.

GTPase activating proteins in vitro transcription and translation GAP-related domain Ras/Rap1-binding domain N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine fibronectin wild type doxycycline Rap1 is a member of Ras family GTPases and is suggested to play roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Rap1 is activated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli through different kinds of specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which are coupled with various receptors or the second messengers via distinct interaction motifs (1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The amounts and duration of intracellular Rap1GTP, on the other hand, are controlled by specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).1 So far, two families of Rap1 GAPs are identified including rapGAPs (I and II) and SPA-1 family proteins (SPA-1, E6TP1/SPAR/SPA-Ls), which may have different tissue distribution profiles (2Rubinfeld B.

Whereas all the Rap1 GAPs share a highly conserved domain, called GAP-related domain (GRD), responsible for GAP catalytic activity, they additionally bear unique functional domains. For instance, rapGAP II has a Gαi-binding domain and is recruited to plasma membrane, inducing Rap1 inactivation there and concomitant increase in the basal Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-signaling in certain cells (7Mochizuki N.

Thus, overexpression of SPA-1 in T cells almost completely suppressed the immunological synapse formation with the specific antigen-presenting cells by inhibiting T cell-receptor-induced activation of LFA-1 (12Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have attempted to identify the molecules that are associated with SPA-1 in order to understand how the intracellular localization and the functions of SPA-1 are regulated. Here we report that SPA-1 is bound to AF-6, which has been isolated originally as a fusion partner of ALL-1 in human acute myeloid leukemia (13Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H.

Although these features imply that AF-6 may function as a molecular scaffold integrating the signals related to cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization, its exact functions remain to be seen. We provide evidence that AF-6 binds both SPA-1 and its specific substrate Rap1GTP via distinct domains and can control integrin-mediated cell adhesion by regulating Rap1 activation.

SPA-1 cDNA lacking GRD (ΔGRD SPA-1) and C3G cDNA bearing a CAAX box sequence at the C terminus (C3G-F) were reported before (9Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transfected into 293T or HeLa cells using a CaPO4 precipitation method or Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). cDNAs of truncated SPA-1 fragments, fragment 1 (residues 1–211), 2 (residues 212–532), 3 (residues 538–680), 4 (residues 681–1038), and 5 (residues 748–1038), were amplified by PCR and subcloned intoBamHI/XhoI sites of a pSP73 vector. PCR-amplified cDNAs of subfragments of SPA-1 GRD (fragment 2), G1 (residues 338–532), G2 (398–459), and G3 (residues 435–489) as well as the mutants of G2 fragment, M1 (V432A) and M2 (F433A) generated by a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Quick), were subcloned intoBglII/EcoRI sites of a pSP73 vector. A cDNA fragment of rapGAP I (residues 263–322) corresponding to the G2 fragment of SPA-1 was amplified by PCR and also subcloned into a pSP73 vector. cDNAs of a series of truncated AF-6 fragments, fragment 1 (residues 36–494), 2 (residues 495–909), 3 (residues 914–1129), and 4 (residues 1130–1612), as well as AF-6 and ΔPDZ AF-6 cDNAs were subcloned into KpnI and SalI sites of a pSP73 vector. In vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) of each cDNA was performed using TnTTMT7/SP6-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro binding assay was performed as follows. Cell lysate of the 293T cells transfected with pEF-BOS-AF-6 or pSRα-SPA-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-AF-6, anti-SPA-1, or preimmune IgG as a control followed by the precipitation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled IVTT products above were incubated with such conjugated beads for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were extensively washed, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed in regular SDS-PAGE or Tricine-buffered SDS-PAGE for smaller molecular mass IVTT products followed by autoradiography. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture), incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation, and then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). To detect intracellular Rap1GTP, cell lysates (0.8–1 mg of proteins) were incubated with a GST fusion protein of RalGDS-RBD coupled with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) on ice for 1 h, washed, and eluted with SDS sample buffer followed by immunoblotting with anti-Rap1 antibody. HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells were transfected with pEF-BOS AF-6 and selected with puromycin (Sigma) to establish a stable cell line (HeLa/Tet-SPA-1/AF-6). The latter cells were transfected transiently with T7-tagged RapV12 cDNA in a pSRα vector by using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). These cells were cultured on coverslips in the presence of Dox at an either inductive (0.1 ng/ml) or non-inductive (1 ng/ml) dose for 24 h. The cells were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeated with 0.5% Triton X-100/Tris-buffered saline, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-AF-6 or anti-Rap1 antibody followed by AlexaFluor 546 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). After washing, the cells were incubated further with biotinylated anti-SPA-1 or anti-T7 antibody followed by AlexaFluor 488 streptavidin or anti-mouse IgG. Normal rabbit or mouse IgG was used as a control for the corresponding primary antibody. The stained cells were analyzed using a confocal microscopy (Olympus). 96-Well flat-bottom plates were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. 293T or HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells were treated with trypsin/EDTA, washed, resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm Hepes, rotated in suspension for 2 h, and plated in triplicate onto FN-coated wells at 0.5 × 105 cells per well. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed gently by aspiration, and the remaining adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde followed by staining with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. After extensive washing with distilled water, dye was extracted with extract solution (50% ethanol in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5) and measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Molecular Devices). Absorbance in uncoated wells was subtracted from that in the FN-coated wells to show specific adhesion. Statistics analysis was done by Student's t test. By yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse spleen cell cDNA library using a full-length SPA-1 as bait, AF-6 was identified as a potential SPA-1-binding protein (data not shown). We therefore examined the association of SPA-1 and AF-6 by transient gene expression in 293T cells, which expressed only marginal SPA-1 and AF-6 if any. In the 293T cells co-transfected with SPA-1 and AF-6 cDNAs, SPA-1 (130 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-AF-6, and reciprocally AF-6 (∼200 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-SPA-1 antibody, although AF-6 tended to be degraded in overexpression system (Fig.1A). Neither protein was immunoprecipitated by control preimmune IgG. We then investigated whether the association of SPA-1 and AF-6 occurred physiologically in normal cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, thymocytes abundantly expressed both SPA-1 and AF-6 among normal lymphoid cells, and the endogenous SPA-1 and AF-6 were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-AF-6 and anti-SPA-1 antibodies, respectively, indicating that SPA-1 and AF-6 were associated physiologically in normal cells. It was estimated that around 40% of SPA-1 and 15% of AF-6 were associated with AF-6 and SPA-1, respectively, in normal thymocytes. To identify the domains involved in the association of SPA-1 to AF-6, binding of truncated SPA-1 fragments to AF-6 was examined in vitro. Among the fragments, a GRD fragment of SPA-1 (fragment 2, residues 212–532) was bound to the AF-6-coated beads, whereas none of the other fragments were bound (Fig.2A). Although not shown, fragment 2 was not bound to the control beads. Similar analysis was performed using truncated fragments of AF-6. As also indicated in Fig.2A, only a fragment containing the PDZ domain of AF-6 (fragment 3, residues 914–1129) was bound specifically to the SPA-1-coated beads. To confirm these results, we generated a GRD-deletion mutant of SPA-1 (ΔGRD SPA-1) and a PDZ-deletion mutant of AF-6 (ΔPDZ AF-6) by IVTT. As shown in Fig. 2B, ΔGRD SPA-1 and ΔPDZ AF-6 failed to be bound to the beads coated with AF-6 and SPA-1 respectively, whereas full-length proteins were bound to the partner proteins. These results strongly suggested that SPA-1 and AF-6 were associated via interaction between GRD of SPA-1 and PDZ domain of AF-6. We next intended to investigate whether the binding of SPA-1 and AF-6 occurred by PDZ-mediated protein interaction. By further truncation of a SPA-1 GRD fragment (fragment 2), it was shown that smaller fragments, G1 (residues 338–532) and G2 (residues 398–459), were bound to AF-6-coated beads, whereas another overlapping fragment G3 (residues 435–489) was not (Fig. 3B), suggesting the binding site was in the region between the residues 398 and 434. By using peptide libraries, it was reported that the AF-6 PDZ preferred a class 2 ligand motif (φ-X-φ, where φ is a hydrophobic residue), and a hydrophobic residue was also preferred at −1 position (20Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). In the G2 fragment, it was noticed that a stretch of residues at 432–434, IVF, fitted the predicted PDZ ligand motif, which was in a probable β-sheet immediately followed by a turn and a β-sheet as predicted by Chou-Fasman secondary structure prediction (Fig. 3A). To investigate possible involvement of this motif, we generated mutant proteins of G2, M1 (V433A), and M2 (F434A), by IVTT, and examined their binding to AF-6-coated beads. As shown in Fig. 3B, M1 was bound barely to AF-6-coated beads and M2 with markedly reduced efficiency as compared with G1, suggesting that both Val-433 and Phe-434 were required for the binding to AF-6 PDZ domain. Among known Rap1 GAPs, the motif was conserved (IVF for SPA-1 and E6TP1 and VVF for rapGAP), and a fragment of rapGAP I (residues 263–322) corresponding to G2 of SPA-1 was bound specifically to the AF-6-coated beads comparably (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3C, rapGAP I and AF-6 were co-immunoprecipitated in the 293T cells co-transfected with full-length rapGAP I and AF-6 cDNAs as well as in a renal cancer cell line endogenously expressing both rapGAP I and AF-6, suggesting that the binding to AF-6 was a shared feature of Rap1 GAPs. We next examined the intracellular localization of SPA-1 in relation to AF-6 by using HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells and those stably transfected with AF-6 (HeLa/Tet-SPA-1/AF-6), in which SPA-1 expression was repressed at the undetectable level in the presence of 1.0 ng/ml Dox while induced strongly in the presence of 0.1 ng/ml Dox within 24 h. In HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells cultured with 0.1 ng/ml Dox, SPA-1 was expressed diffusely at the cortical area as well as in the cytosol with little expression of AF-6 (Fig.4A). On the other hand, AF-6 was localized predominantly at the cell attachment sites with undetectable SPA-1 expression in the HeLa/Tet-SPA-1/AF-6 cells cultured with 1.0 ng/ml Dox (Fig. 4B). In HeLa/Tet-SPA-1/AF-6 cells additionally transfected with T7-tagged RapV12 and cultured with 1.0 ng/ml Dox, a significant proportion of RapV12 was co-localized with AF-6 (Fig. 4C). Strong nuclear staining by anti-T7 antibody was nonspecific, because it was detected in untransfected cells as well. When both SPA-1 and AF-6 were induced to express in HeLa/Tet-SPA-1/AF-6 cells in the presence of 0.1 ng/ml Dox, on the other hand, SPA-1 was co-localized with AF-6 at the cell attachment regions (Fig. 4D). It was noted that those cells expressing both SPA-1 and AF-6 tended to become slender, which was followed by the cell detachment from a dish in 2 days, much earlier than HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells (see below). As shown in Fig. 4E, SPA-1 was co-localized also with endogenous Rap1 under this condition. These results strongly suggested that both SPA-1 and Rap1GTP were recruited to the cell attachment sites by AF-6. A possibility that AF-6 recruited both SPA-1 and its substrate Rap1GTP was investigated more directly. 293T cells were transfected with SPA-1 and T7-tagged RapV12 with or without AF-6 cDNA, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated by anti-T7 antibody. In the absence of AF-6, SPA-1 was co-immunoprecipitated barely with RapV12 (Fig. 5A), conforming to a general consensus that the interaction of GAPs with the substrate was only transient (21Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the presence of AF-6, however, a significant proportion of SPA-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with RapV12 along with AF-6 (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, expression of ΔRBD AF-6, which failed to be co-immunoprecipitated with RapV12, hardly induced the co-immunoprecipitation of SPA-1 with RapV12 either (Fig. 4A). The results indicated that AF-6 could bind both SPA-1 and Rap1GTP simultaneously via distinct domains, leading to the efficient association of SPA-1 and Rap1GTP. We then examined the effect of AF-6 expression on the efficiency of Rap1 inactivation by SPA-1 in the cells. Expression of SPA-1 in 293T cells suppressed the amount of endogenous Rap1GTP generated by the transfection of C3G-F cDNA in a dose-dependent manner as reported previously (9Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additional expression of AF-6 significantly enhanced the Rap1 inactivation by SPA-1 (Fig. 4B). Thus, transfection of 0.3 μg of SPA-1 cDNA resulted in almost complete inhibition of Rap1GTP generation in the presence of AF-6, whereas 40% of Rap1GTP still remained in the absence of AF-6 (Fig. 4B). As also shown in Fig. 4B, the enhancing effect of AF-6 on the Rap1 inactivation by SPA-1 was reduced markedly by the deletion of the PDZ domain. We finally investigated functional effects of the association of SPA-1 and AF-6 on cell adhesion. 293T cells in suspension adhered to fibronectin (FN)-coated plates in a manner dependent on VLA4 andVLA5 (Fig.6A). Although expression of SPA-1 in 293T cells significantly inhibited the cell adhesion as reported before (9Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), that of AF-6, ΔRBD AF-6, or ΔPDZ AF-6 alone hardly affected the cell adhesion (Fig. 6A). However, co-transfection of AF-6 with SPA-1 cDNA resulted in the greater inhibition of cell adhesion than that of SPA-1 alone (Fig.6A). Neither ΔRBD AF-6 nor ΔPDZ AF-6 affected the SPA-1-induced inhibition of cell adhesion, suggesting that the effect of AF-6 was dependent on the association with SPA-1 and Rap1. Similar experiments were performed using HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells. HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells were transfected with a control vector, AF-6, or ΔPDZ AF-6 cDNA and cultured for 1 day in the presence of Dox at 1.0 or 0.1 ng/ml. At 1.0 ng/ml Dox, SPA-1 expression was almost completely repressed (Fig. 6B, left). Under this condition, expression of AF-6 or ΔPDZ AF-6 induced a slight increase in Rap1GTP, and the cell adhesion tended to be enhanced marginally although with statistical insignificance (Fig. 6B, right). When the cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1 ng/ml Dox, on the other hand, SPA-1 expression was induced, and concomitantly Rap1GTP was reduced, leading to the significant decrease in the cell adhesion (Fig.6B). Expression of AF-6 under this condition resulted in the much greater decrease in both cell adhesion and Rap1GTP level, whereas that of ΔPDZ AF-6 was without effect at all (Fig. 6B). These results suggested that AF-6 could contribute to the inhibition of β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion by enhancing the efficiency of SPA-1-mediated Rap1GTP inactivation. In the present study, we demonstrated that a Rap1 GTPase-activating protein SPA-1 was bound to AF-6. SPA-1 was co-immunoprecipitated specifically with AF-6 and vice versa not only in the 293T cells co-transfected with SPA-1 and AF-6 cDNAs but also in normal thymocytes, indicating that the association was physiological.In vitro binding studies revealed that the binding was mediated by the interaction between GRD of SPA-1 and the PDZ domain of AF-6. Most known PDZ-mediated protein interactions occur through recognition of short C-terminal PDZ ligand motifs of partner proteins (22Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 23Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). However, exceptional interactions of PDZ domain with internal motifs of partner proteins have been also reported (24Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25Cuppen E. Gerrits H. Pepers B. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol.

Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It was reported that neuronal nitric-oxide synthase was bound to a PDZ domain of syntrophin via the internal region, in which a PDZ ligand motif in a sharp β-finger structure of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase mimicked a C-terminal ligand motif as a pseudo-peptide (27Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It was reported that a class 2 ligand motif (φ-X-φ) with hydrophobic residues also at the −1 position was preferred by AF-6 PDZ domain by using peptide libraries (20Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). SPA-1 GRD contained a stretch of residues IVF (residues 432–434), which fitted the predicted ligand motif for AF-6 PDZ, and the mutations of Val-433 to Ala or Phe-434 to Ala markedly reduced the binding of a minimal fragment of SPA-1 (G2) to AF-6in vitro. Marginally retained binding activity of a F434A mutant fragment may be due to the residual activity of alanine as an anchoring residue. Chou-Fasman secondary structure prediction suggested that the motif was located in a β-finger-like structure. These results suggested, but did not prove, that the interaction of internal PDZ ligand motif in SPA-1 GRD with the PDZ domain of AF-6 mediated the specific binding of SPA-1 to AF-6. The motif was conserved in rapGAP and E6TP1, and present results indicated that rapGAP was bound to AF-6 comparably with SPA-1, suggesting that the binding to AF-6 was a shared feature of Rap1 GAPs. On the other hand, mutations of RKR at positions 421–423 to LIG, which attenuated the GAP catalytic activity in vivo, did not affect the binding of SPA-1 to AF-6 at all. 2L. Su, M. Hattori, and N. Minato, unpublished observations. In polarized epithelial cells, it was reported that AF-6 was localized at the cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion sites such as tight and adherens junctions, in which association with a tight junction protein ZO-1 might play a role (19Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The present results indicated that AF-6 expressed in non-polarized HeLa cells was located focally at the cell attachment sites to the matrix. On the other hand, SPA-1 expressed in HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells, which barely expressed endogenous AF-6, was detected diffusely at the cortical area as well as in the cytosol. In the HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells transfected with AF-6, however, SPA-1 was co-localized significantly with AF-6 at the cell adhesion sites. It was shown also that RapV12 was co-localized with AF-6 irrespective of the presence of SPA-1, conforming to the previous report (16Boettner B. Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that RapV12 was bound to AF-6. The present results further indicated that SPA-1 and Rap1V12 could be co-immunoprecipitated significantly in the presence of AF-6 but not of ΔRBD AF-6. Collectively these results strongly suggested that both SPA-1 and Rap1GTP (RapV12) could be recruited to AF-6 via independent binding sites, a central PDZ domain and a N-terminal RBD, respectively. It was reported that Ras GAP activity of a catalytic fragment of p120RasGAP was inhibited in vitro by an RBD fragment of AF-6 due to competitive binding of the two fragments to overlapping sites of RasGTP (15Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Independent binding of SPA-1 and Rap1GTP to the distinct domains of AF-6 may prevent such a possible interference with the GAP catalytic activity of SPA-1 by AF-6. Rather, it was shown that the GAP activity of SPA-1 in vivo was enhanced significantly in the presence of AF-6, indicating that AF-6 recruited SPA-1 and its substrate Rap1GTP into close proximity in the cells and facilitated the efficient catalytic interaction between them. We reported previously (9Tsukamoto N. Hattori M. Yang H. Bos J.L. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18463-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Katagiri K.

Minato N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that Rap1GTP activated β1 and β2 integrins and induced the integrin-mediated cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion, whereas SPA-1 could negatively regulate the cell adhesion by inactivating Rap1. The present results using HeLa/Tet-SPA-1 cells indicated that expression of AF-6, but not ΔPDZ AF-6, induced the decrease in Rap1GTP levels and significant inhibition of β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to FN in an SPA-1-induced condition, whereas AF-6 did not affect either of them in an SPA-1-repressed condition. These results have suggested strongly that AF-6 plays a role in the control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion by enhancing the efficiency of Rap1 inactivation by SPA-1 at the cell adhesion sites. Integrin-mediated cell adhesions are regulated dynamically during various cellular functions. In the immune system, for instance, leukocyte movement and migration involve a spatio-temporally organized regulation of cell adhesion (28Flaishon L. Lantner F. Hershkoviz R. Levo Y. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46701-46706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Abbitt K.B. Rainger G.E. Nash G.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 239: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Also, T cell activation in immune responses depends on the integrin-mediated intimate cell-cell interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting cells called immunological synapse, the extent and duration of which profoundly affect the modes and intensity of immune responses (30Sims T.N. Dustin M.L. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We reported previously (12Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that Rap1 activation and its regulation by SPA-1 played crucial roles in the immunological synapse formation through LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction. The present results indicated that AF-6 was expressed abundantly in the normal thymocytes partly in association with SPA-1, and our results 3K. Kometani, M. Hattori, and N. Minato, unpublished observations.using SPA-1 transgenic mice showed that Rap1 activation was essential for the differentiation and expansion of thymocytes in vivo. It thus seems possible that AF-6 plays a significant role in the fine control of integrin-mediated cellular functions via regulation of Rap1 activation in the immune as well as other systems.

ATP triggered the rapid release of prostaglandin E2(PGE2) by acting on P2Y2 receptors in rabbit articular chondrocytes. We have explored the signaling events involved in this synthesis. ATP significantly increased arachidonic acid production, which involved the activation of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) but not a secreted form of PLA2, as demonstrated by various PLA2 inhibitors and translocation experiments.

Finally, dominant-negative plasmids encoding p38 and ERK transfected alone into the cells impaired the ATP-induced release of PGE2 to about the same extent as both plasmids transfected together. These results suggest that PGE2 production induced by ATP requires the activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs.

Any dysregulation with increased degradation and/or inadequate synthesis leads to loss of tissue structure and function, as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RArheumatoid arthritisOAosteoarthritisMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular-regulated protein kinasep38 MAPKp38 mitogen-activated kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseMEK1/2MAPK/ERK kinasePGE2prostaglandin E2AAarachidonic acidIL-1βinterleukin-1βTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αPLA2phospholipase A2sPLA2secretory PLA2cPLA2cytoplasmic PLA2iPLA2Ca2+-independent PLA2BAPTA-AM1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl esterRB-2Reactive Blue 2BELbromoenol lactoneAACOCF3arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketoneP2Ymetabotropic receptorsPBSphosphate-buffered salineDNdominant negativeATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)RTreverse transcription1The abbreviations used are: RArheumatoid arthritisOAosteoarthritisMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular-regulated protein kinasep38 MAPKp38 mitogen-activated kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseMEK1/2MAPK/ERK kinasePGE2prostaglandin E2AAarachidonic acidIL-1βinterleukin-1βTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αPLA2phospholipase A2sPLA2secretory PLA2cPLA2cytoplasmic PLA2iPLA2Ca2+-independent PLA2BAPTA-AM1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl esterRB-2Reactive Blue 2BELbromoenol lactoneAACOCF3arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketoneP2Ymetabotropic receptorsPBSphosphate-buffered salineDNdominant negativeATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)RTreverse transcription and osteoarthritis (OA). The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) are implicated in this phenomenon. They act on chondrocytes to increase the production of the major cartilage-degrading proteinases, the matrix metalloproteinases, by inhibiting the synthesis of cartilage proteoglycans and type II collagen and by stimulating the release of reactive oxygen species and prostaglandins at the sites of inflammation (1Hedbom E. Haüselmann H.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ATP could be another key mediator, because it acts as an extracellular messenger in several systems. It affects many biological processes, including smooth muscle contraction, neurotransmission, the immune response, platelet aggregation, and inflammation (2Burnstock G. Williams M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 862-869PubMed Google Scholar). ATP can be released by healthy cells via anionic channels and vesicular secretion (3Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar) or after cell lysis due to trauma or inflammation (4Bodin P. Burnstock G. Inflamm. Res. 1998; 47: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, Graff et al.(5Graff R.D. Lazarowski E.R. Banes A.J. Lee G.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) demonstrated that chondrocytes continuously release ATP under resting conditions. In addition, the enhanced ATP release due to mechanical loading of chondrocytes suggests that ATP is involved in the pathogenesis of OA (5Graff R.D. Lazarowski E.R. Banes A.J. Lee G.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This is supported by the finding that the synovial fluids of patients affected by OA or RA contain high concentrations of ATP (6Ryan L.M. Rachow J.W. McCarty D.J. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 716-720PubMed Google Scholar). Leong et al. (7Caswell A.M. Leong W.S. Russell R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Leong W.S. Russell R.G. Caswell A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported that ATP triggered the degradation of cultured explants of bovine nasal cartilage and stimulated PGE2 production by articular chondrocytes. IL-1β and TNF-α both interact synergistically with extracellular ATP (9Leong W.S. Russell R.G. Caswell A.M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1993; 85: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Caswell A.M. Leong W.S. Russell R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, there are metabotropic (P2Y) receptors on the membranes of articular tissues. The P2Y2subtype was recently found on human articular chondrocytes (11Koolpe M. Pearson D. Benton H.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The production of PGE2 involves a cascade of three enzyme reactions. First, AA is liberated from its phospholipid storage sites by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2), it is then acted on by cyclooxygenases and finally by PGE synthase to produce PGE2. PGE2 stimulates the catabolism of chondrocytes, having antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects (12Miwa M. Saura R. Hirata S. Hayashi Y. Mizuno K. Itoh H. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An increased release of PGE2 might therefore modify the local balance between anabolism and catabolism, resulting in matrix degradation and cartilage destruction. Hence, by stimulating the release of PGE2 from articular chondrocytes, ATP could amplify the joint destruction in articular diseases. However, the intracellular pathways activated by ATP in articular chondrocytes remains largely unknown. The present study identifies the signaling cascade and intracellular events leading to the release of PGE2 stimulated by ATP in articular chondrocytes.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study demonstrate that ATP stimulates the rapid, transient release of PGE2 from rabbit articular chondrocytes in primary culture by acting on a P2Y2purinoceptor. Stimulation of the P2Y2 receptor led to the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and increases intracellular calcium. These three intracellular pathways act in concert to stimulate the cPLA2 enzyme, resulting in the liberation of AA, which is the rate-limiting step for the ATP-stimulated production of PGE2 (Fig. 7).Release of Endogenous ATP in Articular Chondrons in VivoATP appears to be an extracellular signal in a wide variety of systems, where it is involved in both physiological and physiopathological conditions (reviewed in Ref. 22Bodin P. Burnstock G. Neurochem. Res. 2001; 26: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). ATP is continuously released by chondrocytes at rest in articular chondrons (5Graff R.D. Lazarowski E.R. Banes A.J. Lee G.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and this release is increased by mechanical loads and constraints (5Graff R.D. Lazarowski E.R. Banes A.J. Lee G.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The concentrations of ATP increase into the synovial fluid during inflammation (6Ryan L.M. Rachow J.W. McCarty D.J. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 716-720PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of ATP reached at the site of release and in the vicinity of the surrounding cells is hardly to determine experimentally. In the nervous system where the action of ATP was extensively studied, a local extracellular ATP concentration reaching 40 μm in a diameter of 20 μm around the site of liberation was reported (23Troadec J.D. Thirion S. Nicaise G. Lemos J. Dayanithi G. J. Physiol. (London). 1998; 511: 89-103Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In synovial fluid the ATP concentrations occur up to 217 nm(6Ryan L.M. Rachow J.W. McCarty D.J. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 716-720PubMed Google Scholar). However, given the architecture of the chondrons where chondrocytes are organized in cluster surrounded by a complex pericellular matrix, it is likely that upper extracellular concentrations of ATP could be reached in the vicinity of the same or neighboring chondrocytes, allowing its paracrine and/or autocrine effect. The half-life of extracellular ATP in articular cartilage is a crucial parameter when considering its action on cartilage in vivo. ATP is rapidly hydrolyzed by the ecto-nucleotidases in the synovial fluid (24Park W. Masuda I. Cardenal-Escarcena A. Palmer D.L. McCarty D.J. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar); it has a half-life of 2–3 h in bovine articular chondrocytes (25Croucher L.J. Crawford A. Hatton P.V. Russell R.G. Buttle D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and 15 min in chondrocytes from chick embryo sternum (26Hatori M. Teixeira C.C. Debolt K. Pacifici M. Shapiro I.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although ATP is rapidly hydrolyzed in cartilage, the time course of the effects reported in this study appears to be compatible with ATP having a proinflammatory action in vivo. The release of PGE2 in response to ATP is rapid, starting just 2 min after exposure and reaching a maximum after 1 h. Also, ATP is hydrolyzed more slowly in synovial fluids from RA patients, suggesting that ATP has a stronger proinflammatory action in RA (24Park W. Masuda I. Cardenal-Escarcena A. Palmer D.L. McCarty D.J. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar).Stimulation of PGE2 Release by ATP via P2Y2Purinoceptor in ChondrocytesThe effects of the purinergic receptor antagonists demonstrated in this study indicate that a G-protein-coupled P2 receptor is involved in the PGE2production induced by ATP. A P2Y2 receptor may well be involved, because ATP and UTP are equally effective in causing PGE2 release in our model, and this pharmacological profile fits well with a P2Y2 receptor subtype (27Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by our detection by RT-PCR of P2Y2 transcripts. ADP stimulates partially the PGE2 release under our conditions. ADP is generally believed to be the most potent endogenous ligand for P2Y1 receptors and mostly ineffective on P2Y2 receptors (27Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we did not detect P2Y1 transcripts in rabbit chondrocytes by RT-PCR, confirming the findings of Koolpe et al. (11Koolpe M. Pearson D. Benton H.P. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in human articular chondrocytes. Thus, extracellular ATP releases PGE2 by activating a P2Y2-like purinergic receptor in rabbit articular chondrocytes.ATP as a Mediator of Articular Inflammation in VivoATP caused the fast, transient release of PGE2. Studies on the PGE2 concentrations in animal models of arthritis have demonstrated the importance of this prostanoid in arthritis progression (28Portanova J.P. Zhang Y. Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Gregory S.A. Isakson P.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed by studies on PGE receptor EP4−/− null mice, which showed a profound decrease in the intensity of the inflammation and in markers of joint destruction (29McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP and proinflammatory cytokines in articular tissue may well act synergistically and complementarily, because there is a true interplay between the classic inflammatory mediators and ATP in other systems. In astrocytes, P2Y modulates IL-1β-mediated signal transduction and fine-tunes the transcription of genes involved in inflammatory responses in the human central nervous system (30John G.R. Simpson J.E. Woodroofe M.N. Lee S.C. Brosnan C.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4134-4142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, IL-1β increases the transcription and function of P2Y2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells (31Hou M. Moller S. Edvinsson L. Erlinge D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2064-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in mammalian astrocytes (32John G.R. Scemes E. Suadicani S.O. Liu J.S. Charles P.C. Lee S.C. Spray D.C. Brosnan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11613-11618Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In our system, ATP rapidly stimulates PGE2 release, within 2–5 min, with a decline after 1 h. By contrast, IL1-β acts after a delay of several hours. The release of PGE2 from rabbit articular chondrocytes is maximally stimulated after incubation with IL1- β for 24 h (13Jacques C. Bereziat G. Humbert L. Olivier J.L. Corvol M.T. Masliah J. Berenbaum F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We believe that ATP plays a role in initiating the inflammatory process in the joint diseases.Releases of AA and PGE2 Induced by ATP Involve cPLA2 ActivationATP mobilizes AA in articular chondrocytes in parallel with the release of PGE2. The range of concentrations and the pharmacological profiles are consistent with the activation of a P2Y2-like receptor. Three subtypes of PLA2: sPLA2 (secretory PLA2), cPLA2 (cytoplasmic PLA2), and iPLA2(Ca2+-independent PLA2) could be implicated in the release of AA from its phospholipid storage sites (33Bingham 3rd, C.O. Austen K.F. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We find that cPLA2 is involved in the AA production evoked by ATP, whereas sPLA2 and iPLA2 are not. IL-1β increases the release of AA from rabbit articular chondrocytes via the IIA sPLA2 but not via cPLA2 (for instance see Ref. 13Jacques C. Bereziat G. Humbert L. Olivier J.L. Corvol M.T. Masliah J. Berenbaum F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, this involves the transcription of the type IIA sPLA2 gene and so needs a few hours. We proposed that ATP-induced cPLA2 activity, but not type IIA sPLA2 activity, triggered the early release of AA, relayed then by IL-1β-induced type IIA sPLA2 activity but not cPLA2 activity.Influence of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs on the ATP-dependent Activation of cPLA2 and PGE2 ReleaseThe activation of p38 MAPK by ATP in two different cell types has been reported recently (34Aimond F. Rauzier J.M. Bony C. Vassort G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39110-39116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Daniel J.L. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2283-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated the ATP-dependent activation of p38 MAPK in chondrocytes. ATP rapidly and transiently activated p38 MAPK, by acting on the P2Y2-like receptor borne by articular chondrocytes. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 totally abolishes the action of ATP on PGE2 release, strongly suggesting that p38 MAPK must be activated for ATP to stimulate PGE2 synthesis. The p38 MAPKs family can relay multiple inflammatory responses, because they are essential for the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 (for review see Ref. 36Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) or the induction of enzymes like inducible nitric-oxide synthase (37Abramson S.B. Attur M. Amin A.R. Clancy R. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2001; 3: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), cyclooxygenase 2 (38Thomas B. Thirion S. Humbert L. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Bereziat G. Berenbaum F. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and PGE synthase, 2K. Masuko-Hongo, F. Berenbaum, L. Humbert, C. Salvat, M. G. Attur, M. N. Dave, A. Sautet, M. B. Goldring, A. R. Amin, and S. Thirion, manuscript in preparation. particularly in RA tissues (39Kumar S. Blake S.M. Emery J.G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pharmacological evidence indicates that p38 MAPK is one of the most validated targets for the future treatment of RA (39Kumar S. Blake S.M. Emery J.G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and OA (40Pelletier J.P. Fernandes J.C. Jovanovic D.V. Reboul P. Martel-Pelletier J. J. Rheumatol. 2001; 28: 2509-2519PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of p38 MAPK by ATP demonstrated in this study strongly suggests that ATP regulates other key functions driven by p38 MAPK in articular chondrocytes, in addition to its action on PGE2 release.We show that the activation of P2Y2 receptors by ATP leads to the activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK in articular chondrocytes, as it does in other cell types (for review see Ref. 41Communi D. Janssens R. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase), the immediate upstream kinase of ERK1/2, totally inhibits the release of PGE2 by chondrocytes. Each specific MAPK inhibitor did not affect the activation of the other MAPK but did prevent significant activation of the whole cascade. Therefore, ATP causes the release of PGE2 in articular chondrocytes by activating both the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Because giving PD98059 and SB203580 separately or in combination caused no difference in the released amount of PGE2 or AA, and because overexpression of DN-MEK and DN-p38 separately or in combination inhibited in the same range the PGE2 release, we can infer that ERK1/2 and p38 act concomitantly rather than cooperatively to mediate the ATP-dependent activation of cPLA2 and release of PGE2, as in macrophages (42Hiller G. Sundler R. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and platelets (43Borsch-Haubold A.G. Ghomashchi F. Pasquet S. Goedert M. Cohen P. Gelb M.H. Watson S.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These effects might be due to each MAPK phosphorylating a different site among the several consensus sites on cPLA2 or to the integration of the phosphorylation of both MAPK by an upstream enzyme, which then activates cPLA2, as in cardiomyocytes (34Aimond F. Rauzier J.M. Bony C. Vassort G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39110-39116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, calcium chelation did not prevent the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs by ATP; therefore, the activation of the MAPKs is not due to increased intracellular calcium, as in HEK-293 cells (44Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) or in response to ATP in PC12 cells (45Swanson K.D. Reigh C. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19965-19971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP activates three distinct intracellular signaling pathways that act independently and simultaneously (Fig. 7).In conclusion, published data indicate that extracellular purines are a rapid intercellular communication signal in many systems, including articular tissue. A significant amount of ATP is released during inflammation and mechanical loading of cartilage under pathophysiological conditions. ATP contributes to the destructive process by activating signaling pathways involved in articular pathology, PGE2, AA, p38, and ERK1/2 MAPKs, especially in the early stage of the diseases. Although further in vitroand in vivo studies are necessary to reveal the complex role of ATP in cartilage metabolism, the modulation of signaling pathways triggered by extracellular ATP could clearly help to reduce the joint destruction that occurs in articular diseases. Articular cartilage is an avascular, aneural tissue consisting of chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix. Healthy cartilage is maintained in a state of dynamic equilibrium by matrix synthesis and matrix degradation by the chondrocytes.

Eight out of 25 samples analysed showed methylation of either the CpG dinucleotide, the CCWGG motifs or both. Relative to nonmethylated leukemia samples, TP53 expression levels were decreased in all methylated samples in which TP53 expression could be measured. Methylation of CpG and CCWGG motifs in the promoter of TP53 could represent a novel mechanism leading to functional impairment of this tumor suppressor gene in ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2092963155,"Abstract Nitric oxide is a ubiquitous free radical that plays a key role in a broad spectrum of signaling pathways in physiological and pathophysiological processes. We have explored the transcriptional regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) by Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), an Sp1-like zinc finger transcription factor. Study of serial deletion constructs of the iNOS promoter revealed that the proximal 0.63-kb region can support a 3–6-fold reporter activity similar to that of the full-length 16-kb promoter. Within the 0.63-kb region, we identified two CACCC sites (−164 to −168 and −261 to −265) that bound KLF6 in both electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Mutation of both these sites abrogated the KLF6-induced enhancement of the 0.63-kb iNOS promoter activity. The binding of KLF6 to the iNOS promoter was significantly increased in Jurkat cells, primary T lymphocytes, and COS-7 cells subjected to NaCN-induced hypoxia, heat shock, serum starvation, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/A23187 ionophore stimulation. Furthermore, in KLF6-transfected and NaCN-treated COS-7 cells, there was a 3–4-fold increase in the expression of the endogenous iNOS mRNA and protein that correlated with increased production of nitric oxide. These findings indicate that KLF6 is a potential transactivator of the human iNOS promoter in diverse pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2064466849,"Staphylococci, a leading cause of infections worldwide, have devised two mechanisms for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. One is production of β-lactamases, hydrolytic resistance enzymes, and the other is the expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP 2a), which is not susceptible to inhibition by β-lactam antibiotics. The β-lactam sensor-transducer (BlaR), an integral membrane protein, binds β-lactam antibiotics on the cell surface and transduces the information to the cytoplasm, where gene expression is derepressed for both β-lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 2a. The gene for the sensor domain of the sensor-transducer protein (BlaRS) of Staphylococcus aureuswas cloned, and the protein was purified to homogeneity. It is shown that β-lactam antibiotics covalently modify the BlaRSprotein. The protein was shown to contain the unusual carboxylated lysine that activates the active site serine residue for acylation by the β-lactam antibiotics. The details of the kinetics of interactions of the BlaRS protein with a series of β-lactam antibiotics were investigated. The protein undergoes acylation by β-lactam antibiotics with microscopic rate constants (k2) of 1–26 s−1, yet the deacylation process was essentially irreversible within one cell cycle. The protein undergoes a significant conformational change on binding with β-lactam antibiotics, a process that commences at the preacylation complex and reaches its full effect after protein acylation has been accomplished.

Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1997: 309-330Google Scholar). Among these organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has received notoriety since it is currently the scourge of hospitals. Staphylococci have acquired multiple drug resistance genes over the past few decades such that methicillin-resistant S. aureus can usually be treated only by glycopeptides, such as vancomycin (2Novick R.P. Schlievert P. Ruzin A. Microbes Infect. 2001; 7: 585-594Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), or by oxazolidinones, such as linezolid (3Fung H.B. Kirschenbaum H.L. Ojofeitimi B.O. Clin. Ther. 2001; 23: 356-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is disconcerting that variants of methicillin-resistant S. aureus that have become at least partially resistant to glycopeptide (4Walsh T.R. Blomström A. Qwärnström A.H.P. Wootton M. Howe R.A. MacGowan A.P. Diekema D.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 2439-2444Google Scholar) and oxazolidinone antibiotics are being identified (5Tsiodras S. Gold H.S. Sakoulas G. Eliopoulos G.M. Wennersten C.

Lancet. 2001; 358: 207-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar).β-Lactam antibiotics target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)1 for inhibition. Staphylococci have become resistant to β-lactam antibiotics by two parallel mechanisms. First, they produce β-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolytically destroy these antibiotics (6Bush K. Mobashery S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 456: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Kotra L.P. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Lewis A. Salyers A. Haber H. Wax R.G. Bacterial Resistance to Antimicrobials, Mechanisms, Genetics, Medical Practice and Public Health. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 123-159Google Scholar). Second, they have acquired a novel PBP (referred to as PBP 2a) that carries out the physiological functions of the four existing PBPs in staphylococci yet is not inhibited in vivo by any of the clinically used β-lactam antibiotics. The acquisition of the gene for PBP 2a in staphylococci took place only once from an unknown source (8Kreiswirth B. Kornblum J. Arbeit R.D. Eisner W. Maslow J.N. McGeer A. Low D.E. Novick R.P. Science. 1993; 259: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).The blaZ and mecA genes encode the staphylococcal β-lactamase and PBP 2a, respectively. Transcription of these genes is regulated by signal-transducing integral membrane proteins BlaR and MecR and their respective transcriptional repressor proteins BlaI and MecI. BlaR has a β-lactam-binding domain on the surface of the plasma membrane and a zinc protease domain in the cytoplasm (Fig.1) (9Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The β-lactam antibiotic acylates a specific active site serine on the cell surface domain, which transduces a signal to the cytoplasmic domain. The zinc-dependent cytoplasmic protease domain, which hydrolyzes the repressor proteins, precipitates transcription of the genes for the two resistance proteins. This proteolytic signaling pathway is unique in bacteria (10Archer G.L. Bosilevac J.M. Science. 2001; 291: 1915-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity the cell surface sensor domain of the BlaR protein (referred to as BlaRS hereafter). As an unusual feature, this protein is carboxylated at the side chain of an active site lysine (Lys-392; a carbamate on the side chain), which is critical for active site serine acylation by the β-lactam antibiotic. The kinetics of these processes are reported herein for the first time. Furthermore, binding of the antibiotic to BlaRS entails a significant conformational change, a process that is likely to play a role in the signal transduction mechanism from the cell surface to the cytoplasm.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe cloned the sensor domain of the signal transducer protein BlaR from S. aureus (spans amino acids 331–581), which we refer to as the BlaRS protein. The cloned protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli. The protein was purified to homogeneity in two chromatographic steps and was highly soluble (up to 26 mg/ml). We routinely obtain 50 mg of pure protein from one liter of growth medium. The C terminus of BlaR from Bacillus licheniformis has also been cloned (23Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayshi T. Lampen J.O. Ghysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 70: 107-114Crossref Google Scholar, 24Zhu Y. Curran I.H. Joris B. Ghysen J.M. Lampen O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Carboxylation of Lysine Side Chain in the BlaR ProteinThe BlaRS protein is related to the OXA family of β-lactamases, enzymes of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (24Zhu Y. Curran I.H. Joris B. Ghysen J.M. Lampen O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The active site peptide sequence of Ser-X-X-Lys, which is a known minimal motif for these proteins that undergo acylation at the serine residue, is present in both (25Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures for the OXA-10 β-lactamase (26Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,27Maveyraud L. Golemi D. Ishiwata A. Meroueh O. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reveal that the active site lysine is carboxylated on its side chain (i.e. the carbamate product of reaction with carbon dioxide). The side chain of lysine in the OXA-10 β-lactamase is sequestered in an unusual environment made up of five hydrophobic amino acid side chains (Phe-69, Val-117, Phe-120, Trp-154, and Leu-155) that is believed to lower the pKa of the lysine side chain such that it exists in the free base form that undergoes reaction with carbon dioxide (26Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The side chain of the carboxylated lysine and that of serine are in contact, and the former activates the latter for enzyme acylation by β-lactam antibiotics (26Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The requisite amino acids in the Ser-X-X-Lys motif and the five hydrophobic sites, among others, are conserved among the many OXA β-lactamases and the BlaR protein (25Massova I. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A pertinent question now is whether the sensor domain of the BlaR protein is also carboxylated at the corresponding lysine residue.A diagnostic test for carboxylation of the lysine side chain is by13C NMR, which detects a distinctive signal. The13C NMR experiment indicated that lysine carboxylation is seen in the BlaRS protein, as shown by the presence of a diagnostic resonance at 164 ppm (Fig. 2). The same experiment was carried out with the K392A mutant protein, and unexpectedly, we observed that the NMR signal at 164 ppm was not entirely eliminated (Fig. 2B). The integrations of the carbamate signals in Fig. 2 indicated that the wild type enzyme (Fig.2A) had approximately two carboxylated lysines to one in the mutant protein. Therefore, under the NMR experiment conditions, two lysines in the wild-type protein exist in the free base forms, which undergo carboxylation in the presence of the13C-labeled carbon dioxide, one of which is at position 392.Figure 2The 13C NMR spectra of the wild-type BlaRS (A) and the K392A mutant proteins (at 1 mm) (B) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, supplemented with 20 mmNaH13CO3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We resorted to binding of radioactive carbon dioxide to the BlaRS and the K392A mutant proteins. Analogously to the case of the OXA-10 β-lactamases, the expectation was that the active site carboxylated lysine would be stabilized by specific interactions. On the other hand, the other carboxylated lysine seen in the NMR experiment might have experienced carboxylation in an adventitious process and could be back-titrated by non-radioactive carbon dioxide. Here, each protein was incubated at pH 4.5 to facilitate the decarboxylation of lysine followed by reconstitution of the protein by the radioactively labeled carbon dioxide. The workup was made in the presence of non-labeled carbon dioxide. We were able to measure an average of 0.9 equivalents of radioactive label incorporated per each of the wild-type protein molecule. By the same procedure, no label was introduced into the K392A mutant protein. This argued that carboxylation of the protein was indeed at the Lys-392 position and that there may be another exposed lysine with reduced pKa in this protein that may be partiallyand unstably carboxylated under the conditions of the NMR experiment (i.e. high carbon dioxide concentration in the NMR tube). The cloned protein has a total of 31 lysine residues.In the case of the OXA-10 β-lactamase, proximity of one of the oxygen atoms of the lysine carbamate to Trp-154 was useful in quantitative fluorescence quenching studies of the interaction of carbon dioxide with the enzyme (26Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tryptophan 475 of the BlaR protein corresponds to Trp-154 of the OXA-10 β-lactamase, so we felt that the dissociation constant for carbon dioxide of the BlaRS protein may be evaluated by fluorescence analyses. The intrinsic fluorescence of BlaRS was quenched upon addition of sodium bicarbonate as the source of carbon dioxide in a saturable fashion. Data fit to Equation 1 revealed a Kd of 0.6 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 3). Considering that the physiological concentration of carbon dioxide is 1.3 mm (28Tien M. Berlett B.S. Levine R.L. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7809-7814Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), this indicates that BlaRS is fully carboxylated in vivo. It is significant to note that the K392A mutant protein did not give the tryptophan fluorescence quench, which is indicative of the fact that the dissociation constant that was evaluated for the wild-type protein was for carboxylation of residue 392 and is a further validation that this residue is indeed carboxylated in the wild-type protein. As will be described below, carboxylated Lys-392 is the active site base that activates the serine for protein acylation. This is now only the second example of a protein, after the OXA-10 β-lactamases (26Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), that uses the highly uncommon carboxylated lysine as a basic residue to facilitate reactions in the active site. The few other proteins having carboxylated lysine use the modified amino acid as metal ligand or for hydrogen bonding in the protein structure.Figure 3Relative quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of BlaRS protein (1 μm) versus total concentration of carbon dioxide (μm). Data were fit to a single binding site model as per the equation described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The collective information in the preceding paragraphs made possible the generation of a homology-based computational model for the sensor domain of the BlaR protein (Fig. 4). In comparison with the structure of the OXA-10 β-lactamase, the arrangements of the side chains of serine and the carboxylated lysine and the hydrophobic environment around the lysine, including the proximity of the carboxylated lysine and the tryptophan residue, are preserved.Figure 4A, stereo view of the computational model for the β-lactam binding site of the BlaR protein. A Connolly water-accessible surface (in green) was constructed around the hydrophobic pocket of the binding site residues. The side chains of the residues that make up the hydrophobic pocket are shown in orange-capped sticks. Carboxylated Lys-392 (shown in the middle of the Connolly surface), Ser-389, and Trp-475 are color-coded according to atom types and shown in capped-sticks representation (white,red, and blue correspond to carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, respectively). Hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxylated Lys-392 and Ser-389 and Trp-475 are represented with awhite dashed line. The protein is shown in a purple tube representation. In B, a similar perspective from the x-ray structure for the OXA-10 β-lactamase is given for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Kinetics of Interactions of β-Lactam Antibiotics and the BlaRS ProteinIn light of the information that the sensor domain of the BlaR protein has a carboxylated lysine, it is conceivable that the protein at the end of each individual purification protocol would be carboxylated to varying degrees, since the process is reversible. This point was documented by observing typically a 2-fold enhancement of the rate of interactions of the BlaRSprotein with β-lactam antibiotics by supplementation of the buffer with sodium bicarbonate (as a source of carbon dioxide). As argued above, the BlaR protein is fully carboxylated in vivo, and the fact that some of the carboxylation of the protein is reversed during the purification is an artifact. Therefore, we have supplemented the reaction mixtures for the kinetic studies with bicarbonate to generate the fully carboxylated and active form of the protein for all kinetic determinations.BOCILLIN FL, a fluorescent penicillin, was used to further study and analyze the mode of action of BlaRS protein. This molecule modifies BlaRS covalently, as would any β-lactam antibiotic, whereby the protein would migrate through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to allow quantitative detection by Fluorimager. Titration of the BlaRS protein with BOCILLIN FL revealed saturation and also indicated a one-to-one modification of the protein by the antibiotic. The wild-type and K393A mutant BlaRSproteins were acylated by BOCILIN FL, as revealed by Fluorimager. The K393A has a residual level of activity (see below) that accounts for this observation. In contrast, incubation of the S389A mutant variant with BOCILIN FL did not give a fluoregenic band. A previous study based on sequence analysis of the BlaR from B. licheniformis with a class D β-lactamase had suggested that residue Ser-389 (BlaR numbering according to S. aureus) might be the modification site by β-lactams (23Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayshi T. Lampen J.O. Ghysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 70: 107-114Crossref Google Scholar). The experiments reported herein clearly reveal Ser-389 to be the serine-active site residue that is acylated.The kinetics of interactions of several β-lactam molecules (three penicillins, three cephalosporins, and one carbapenem) with the BlaRS protein were investigated (TableI). Stopped-flow kinetics distinguished between a rapid enzyme acylation event and a substantially slower deacylation step. Acylation of the active site proceeded with microscopic rate constants (i.e. k2) of 1–26 s−1, which indicate rapid t1/2 values for acylation of 27–690 ms for the β-lactams that we studied. The deacylation rate constants (i.e. k3) for the same β-lactam molecules are listed in Table I, corresponding to t1/2 values of ∼12–240 min. The k3 for oxacillin would appear to be representative of most of the substrates studied, with a value of (4.8 ± 0.6) × 10−5 s−1, which corresponds to a t1/2 value of 240 min. In light of the fact that typical strains of S. aureus double their population sizes in 20–30 min under favorable growth conditions, this indicates that a single acylation event per each molecule of the β-lactam signal sensor-transducer protein accounts for the biological consequences per each generation of bacterial growth.Table IKinetic parameters of BlaRS with the β-lactam antibioticsSubstratek2k3Ksk2/Kss−1(s−1)×105μm(m−1s−1)× 10−5Nitrocefin26 ± 692 ± 1024 ± 911 ± 4FA-penicillin1.6 ± 0.18 ± 413 ± 21.2 ± 0.2Ampicillin1.0 ± 0.19 ± 123 ± 20.4 ± 0.1Oxacillin18 ± 14.8 ± 0.649 ± 53.7 ± 0.4Cefepime1.4 ± 0.112.6 ± 0.325 ± 30.6 ± 0.1Ceftazidime4.1 ± 0.59.1 ± 0.468 ± 160.6 ± 0.2Imipenem6 ± 110 ± 1183 ± 660.3 ± 0.1The rate constants were determined in the presence of 50 mmNaHCO3 at pH 7.0.

(See “Experimental Procedures” for more details.) Open table in a new tab It is a feature of the signal sensor-transducer protein that it is activated by all β-lactam antibiotics (29McKinney T.K. Sharma V.K. Craig W.A. Archer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6862-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with this information, the dissociation constants (i.e. Ks) for various β-lactam antibiotics are in the micromolar range, which are attainable in the milieu where the bacteria grow. The dissociation constants are practically in the same range for the three penicillins and three cephalosporins that we tested, whereas the carbapenem imipenem shows a higher value (Table I). The second-order rate constants (i.e. k2/Ks) for the encounter of the β-lactam molecules and the BlaRS protein were typically 104 to 106m−1 s−1, indicative of a very favorable process.As per the computational model and the foregoing evidence, we decided to evaluate the effect of Lys-392 on the kinetics of BlaRSacylation. In the case of the OXA-10 β-lactamase, the mutational change of the corresponding carboxylated lysine resulted in an inactive enzyme that did not experience acylation in the active site by the β-lactam antibiotics (26Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14280-14285Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly to the case of the OXA-10 β-lactamase, a mutational change of Lys-392 to Ala in BlaRS resulted in a protein that was severely impaired in acylation of the active site serine as evaluated for oxacillin (k2 = 0.0026 ± 0.0005 s−1 andKs = 43 ± 14 μm). The rate constant for acylation was attenuated for the mutant protein by 6730-fold with no change in Ks. Since the mutant protein has the same conformation as the wild-type protein by circular dichroic analyses (see below), the attenuation onk2 may be ascribed to poor activation of serine in the mutant protein.Conformational Change in the BlaRS ProteinSignal transduction from one side of the membrane to the other necessitates communication between the surface and the cytoplasmic domains. A means to this communication is by conformational change of the membrane-bound protein after binding to the β-lactam antibiotic. As shown in Fig.5, the BlaRS protein is prone to significant conformational change on binding to the β-lactam antibiotics. The conformational change commences upon binding to the β-lactam antibiotic at the preacylation complex and reaches its full extent on protein acylation. If the acyl-protein species is allowed to undergo its sluggish deacylation, the protein returns to the native conformation (data not shown). As indicated earlier, the K392A mutant variant of the BlaRS protein is severely deficient in the acylation step. This mutant variant would not experience acylation by β-lactam antibiotics during the course of the CD experiment. However, the non-covalent binding by a β-lactam antibiotic, for example by oxacillin (Fig. 5B), resulted in a discernable change in the CD spectrum of the protein (similar results were seen with the S389A mutant protein, which does not have the opportunity to give the acyl-protein species; see Supplemental Material). The minima at 208 and 222 nm, which are due to the helices, were enhanced, and the maximum at 195 nm, due to β-sheets, sharpened (Fig. 5B). These data argue for the enhancement of secondary structures (helicity and β-sheets) in the protein on non-covalent binding by the antibiotic. Upon acylation of the protein by oxacillin (Fig.5A), these effects were enhanced further, but the native state returned upon deacylation. Similar results and trends were noted for all β-lactam antibiotics shown in Table I (see Supplemental Material), so the effects of the conformational change on the BlaRS protein are shared by all of these antibiotics. In light of the fact that this conformational change is significant and is generally seen regardless of the nature of the β-lactam antibiotic, we believe that it is likely that it plays a role in the signal transduction process. However, we acknowledge the fact that in the whole cell context, other factors may play a role as well.Figure 5Circular dichroic spectra of the wild-type BlaR protein (2 μm, solid line) and the wild-type BlaRS protein (2 μm) incubated with oxacillin (30 μm, broken line) (A) of the K392A mutant variant of the BlaRSprotein (2 μm, solid line) and the K392A mutant (2 μm) incubated with oxacillin (30 μm, broken line) (B) and of the S389A mutant variant of the BlaR protein (2 μm,solid line) and the S389A mutant (2 μm) incubated with oxacillin (30 μm, broken line) (C). All the spectra were corrected for the small contribution from the antibiotic in the mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The essence of signal transduction is the switch between inactive and active forms of a given protein. In the case of the β-lactam signal sensor-transducer, a key question is how binding of the β-lactam antibiotic to the sensor domain facilitates signal transduction. Two classical models for signal transduction have been proposed (30Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D. Science. 2001; 291: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In one, ligand binding induces the formation of a new conformation in the protein. In the other, an equilibrium mixture of conformational states exists, and the ligand binding shifts the equilibrium in favor of the active form. The data presented here for the BlaR protein are consistent with either the induced-fit or the population shift model. It is conceivable that the protein switches its conformation on binding by the β-lactam antibiotic during the formation of the preacylation complex, which reaches its maximal effect after acylation of the enzyme in the active site (the induced-fit model). Alternatively, the CD spectrum of the native BlaR protein may be due to the distribution of several preexisting conformational states, which binding of the β-lactam antibiotics to one would shift the equilibrium in favor of the active structure (the population shift model). The discrimination between these two models for the case of the BlaR protein should await availability of structural information in the future.We have described in this report the dynamic nature of the sensor domain of the BlaR protein from staphylococci. This protein undergoes structural rearrangement on binding to a wide range of β-lactam antibiotics, the implications of which for the signal transduction event remain to be studied by structural biologists. We have shown that β-lactam antibiotics modify the protein covalently and essentially irreversibly within a bacterial population doubling time at Ser-389. The covalent modification of the sensor domain is facilitated by an uncommon carboxylated lysine at position 392 within the antibiotic binding site. The means by which the BlaR system carries out its signal sensing and transducing processes is unique to Gram-positive bacteria. We have provided herein insights into how this specific protein inS. aureus facilitates the manifestation of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, a process that remains a challenge in clinical treatment of infections caused by this organism. Staphylococci are the most common cause of bacterial infections in the United States (1Boyce J.M. Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1997: 309-330Google Scholar). Among these organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has received notoriety since it is currently the scourge of hospitals. Staphylococci have acquired multiple drug resistance genes over the past few decades such that methicillin-resistant S. aureus can usually be treated only by glycopeptides, such as vancomycin (2Novick R.P. Schlievert P. Ruzin A. Microbes Infect. 2001; 7: 585-594Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), or by oxazolidinones, such as linezolid (3Fung H.B. Kirschenbaum H.L. Ojofeitimi B.O. Clin. Ther. 2001; 23: 356-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is disconcerting that variants of methicillin-resistant S. aureus that have become at least partially resistant to glycopeptide (4Walsh T.R. Blomström A. Qwärnström A.H.P. Wootton M. Howe R.A. MacGowan A.P. Diekema D.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 2439-2444Google Scholar) and oxazolidinone antibiotics are being identified (5Tsiodras S. Gold H.S. Sakoulas G. Eliopoulos G.M. Wennersten C.

Staphylococci have become resistant to β-lactam antibiotics by two parallel mechanisms. First, they produce β-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolytically destroy these antibiotics (6Bush K. Mobashery S.

Here, we have applied advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques to study calpain subunit interactions in living cells using recombinant calpain subunits or domains fused to enhanced cyan and enhanced yellow fluorescent reporter proteins.

The family members can be classified as typical calpains, which are further divided into ubiquitous and tissue-specific calpains, and atypical calpains (reviewed in Ref. 1Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Ubiquitous calpains are heterodimers (molecular mass, ∼110 kDa) made up of a catalytic (molecular mass, ∼80 kDa; 80K) and a common regulatory (molecular mass, ∼30 kDa; 30K) subunit (2Ohno S. Emori Y.

Two calpain isoforms are known that share about 62% identical residues of their catalytic subunits but differ in the Ca2+concentrations required for activation in vitro; although μ-calpain is activated by 5–50 μm Ca2+, m-calpain requires 0.2–1 mm Ca2+concentrations for activation (4Dayton W.R. Schollmeyer J.V. Lepley R.A. Cortes L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 659: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Calpain activity is regulatedin vivo by phosphorylation (5Shiraha H. Glading A. Chou J. Jia Z. Wells A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2716-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and by the endogenous intracellular inhibitor, calpastatin (6Yamato S. Tanaka K. Murachi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The latter are widely distributed heat-stable proteins acting specifically on calpainsin vitro in the presence of Ca2+ (7Cong M. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Antin P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 660-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, calpain inhibition by kininogen domain II (8Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and growth arrest-specific factor 2 (9Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) has been reported. Upon exposure to Ca2+, ubiquitous calpains undergo in vitro limited autolysis of both subunits, which reduces Ca2+ requirement for activity (10Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Following initial autolysis at the N terminus of both subunits, further degradation of the large subunit eventually leads to a loss of enzymatic activity (11Dutt P. Arthur J.S. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Controversial hypotheses of the activation mechanism of calpainin vivo and the role of Ca2+ in this process have been presented (1Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Dutt P. Arthur J.S. Croall D.E. Elce J.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar). Important open questions in this regard are whether or not calpain activation results in dissociation of the large and small subunits and the probable role of autolysis. Recent crystal structures of full-length, Ca2+-free rat and human m-calpain (13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) confirmed that the catalytic subunit is organized in four domains, termed DI–DIV; the 30K subunit consists of domains DV and DVI (Fig. 1, Aand F). Compared with the structurally homologous papain, subdomains DIIa and DIIb are misplaced, with catalytic residues Cys105 and His262 located about 10 Å apart. Moreover, the substrate binding cleft is disrupted and open, which is incompatible with productive binding of peptide substrates. These features explain the inactivity of calpains in the absence of Ca2+. The crystal structure of Ca2+-bound DII domain discloses two Ca2+ ions that bridge subdomains IIa and IIb 1We follow the domain nomenclature proposed by Strobl et al. (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), illustrated in Fig. 1 A. In this nomenclature, the papain-like catalytic domain DII is further subdivided into two subdomains, DIIa and DIIb. 1We follow the domain nomenclature proposed by Strobl et al. (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), illustrated in Fig. 1 A. In this nomenclature, the papain-like catalytic domain DII is further subdivided into two subdomains, DIIa and DIIb. to form the catalytically competent active site, highlighting an important effect of calcium for calpain activity (15Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). There are, however, additional Ca2+-binding sites with important roles for activity. Domains DIV and DVI contain five EF hand motifs highly similar to those of the major intracellular Ca2+-binding protein, calmodulin. Accordingly, the first three N-terminal EF hands bind Ca2+ (16Blanchard H. Li Y. Cygler M. Kay C.M. Simon J. Arthur C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Calcium-mediated calpain activation was therefore proposed to result from Ca2+ binding to these domains, mainly to the third EF hand in DIV. Ion binding is expected to promote release of the N-terminal α-helix that anchors the catalytic and regulatory subunit, with concomitant displacement of DIIa toward DIIb (17Dutt P. Arthur J.S. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Elce J.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis points up the role of the synaptotagmin C2-like domain DIII, which harbors several acidic residues within a prominent solvent-exposed loop. This “acidic loop” is spatially adjacent to DIIb and engages in electrostatic interactions with the latter (14Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It was suggested, therefore, that Ca2+ binding to this loop could release subdomain IIb to move toward IIa, thus allowing formation of a functional catalytic center (the “electrostatic switch” hypothesis). Furthermore, it was proposed that the Ca2+ coordination spheres might be only incompletely formed by protein oxygen atoms and that additional ligands provided by negatively charged head groups of acidic phospholipids complete these coordination spheres. Indeed, acidic phospholipids such as phosphorylated phosphatidyl inositols reduce the Ca2+concentration required for autolysis in vitro (10Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Mellgren R.L. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and mutation of the acidic residue Glu504 of m-calpain significantly affects Ca2+ sensitivity of the enzyme (13Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Finally, DIII alone binds Ca2+ with an affinity comparable with that of DIV, which is increased 2–10-fold upon the addition of liposomes (20Tompa P. Emori Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Friedrich P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Conversely, Ca2+ significantly promotes phospholipid binding in a similar manner as observed with the C2 synaptotagmin domain. These findings suggest a connection between calpain activation and membrane translocation (see e.g. Ref.21Horikawa Y. Oda N. Cox N.J. Li X. Orho-Melander M. Hara M. Hinokio Y. Lindner T.H. Mashima H. Schwarz P.E. del Bosque-Plata L. Oda Y. Yoshiuchi I. Colilla S. Polonsky K.S. Wei S. Concannon P. Iwasaki N. Schulze J. Baier L.J. Bogardus C. Groop L. Boerwinkle E. Hanis C.L. Bell G.I. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). In the light of these findings, we have decided to study subcellular localization and subunit interactions of endogenous calpains and overexpressed human μ-calpain subunits and several engineered variants thereof, aiming to provide insight into the calpain activation mechanism in vivo. Firstly, we have followed the subcellular distribution of endogenous ubiquitous human calpains and calpastatin under resting and Ca2+-activated (ionomycin-induced) conditions. Next, we have overexpressed the active 80K subunit of human μ-calpain and its truncated variants DI-III, DI-IIb, and DIII, N- or C-terminally fused to ECFP,2in COS 7 and in LCLC 103H cells. Co-expression with 30K chimeras that incorporate EYFP allowed us to analyze the interactions between the 80K and 30K subunits in vivo using fluorescence energy transfer techniques (FRET). This technique is particularly suited to demonstrate intimate (below 80 nm) contact between reaction partners. Recent progress in fluorescence microscopy has made it possible to apply this technique to interaction analysis in living cells (22Selvin P.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 7: 730-734Google Scholar). At the same time, overexpression of the 80K-EYFP chimera in cells stably overexpressing a membrane marker, mem-ECFP, combined with co-localization analysis (23Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) supported the membrane association of this subunit. We provide evidence against dissociation of calpain subunits upon activation in vivo. Both endogenous and overexpressed calpain variants were localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of cells, respectively, except DI-IIb, which accumulated in the nucleus and even in nucleoli. Localization studies with five additional truncated or mutant variants of the DI-IIb construct identify the N-terminal helices of DI as a putative nuclear-targeting motif. The plasmid vectors pECFP-C1, pECFP-N1, pEYFP-C1, and pEYFP-N1 were purchased from Clontech; restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were from Roche Biochemicals and New England Biolabs. Antibodies anti-peptide 80K and anti-peptide 76K were produced by Biogenes on request. Commercially available antibodies used were anti-DII (804–051-R100, Alexis), anti-80K (MAB3104, Chemicon), anti-30K (MAB3083, Chemicon), anti-calpastatin (MA3–945, ABR), anti-living colors (8367–1, Clontech), and anti-calpain (laboratory stock). The fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-amc was purchased from Bachem. The calpain inhibitor, AC27P, and ionomycin were from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. All of the variants of human μ-calpain large subunit for expression in mammalian cells were constructed using as scaffold a self-prepared semi-synthetic gene, pUC18_80K DNA, or a variant thereof with the active site residue Cys115 mutated to alanine (pUC18_ [C115A]80K). 3D.

Variants DI-IV (Ser2–Ala711), DI-III (Ser2–Asp523), and DIII (Ile363–Gln527) were obtained via PCR, using primers listed in Table I. The DNA for variant DI-IIb (Ser2–Thr390) was obtained by digestion of pECFP_80K DNA with the restriction enzymesEcoRI and SacII. The small subunit DNA was amplified via PCR using as template a plasmid coding for the His-tagged 30K subunit3 (Table I). The DNA fragments were subcloned into the appropriate vectors, pECFP-N1 (80K-ECFP, [C115A]80K-ECFP), pECFP-C1 (ECFP-80K, ECFP-[C115A]80K, ECFP-DI-III, ECFP-DI-IIb, ECFP-DIII), pEYFP-N1 (30K-EYFP, 80K-EYFP, DI-III-EYFP), and pEYFP-C1 (EYFP-30K), after digestion with the indicated restriction enzymes (Table I). Competent TG1 cells were transformed with the ligation mixtures, and the resulting isolated plasmids with the correct sequences were used for further transfections. The variants ECFP-[K20P]DI-IIb, ECFP-[R48P]DI-IIb, and ECFP-[R376A,R377A]DI-IIb were prepared via PCR using as template pECFP_DI-IIb DNA according to the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit instructions (Stratagene) using the primers listed in Table II. Variants that either lack the two N-terminal helices (ECFP-Δ(Ser2–Leu55)DI-IIb) or consist of these two helices fused to ECFP (ECFP-(Ser2–Leu55)) were obtained by double-digesting pECFP_DI-IIb DNA with EcoRI/KpnI or KpnI/BamHI, respectively, followed by ligation into pECFP-C1 digested with the same pairs of enzymes. The identity of cloned DNAs was verified by sequencing both DNA strands.Table IPrimers used for the construction of large and small subunit variants of human μ-calpain fused to ECFP and EYFPPrimer1-aThe name of the primer includes the DNA restriction enzyme used for cloning (in italics).

Transfection was carried out using the FuGENE 6 Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the general protocol suggested by the manufacturer. COS 7 and LCLC 103H cells transiently overexpressing the corresponding construct were used in this study. For membrane targeting studies a LCLC 103H clone constitutively expressing the membrane marker mem-ECFP (Clontech) was transfected with 80K-EYFP and DI-III-EYFP DNAs. For localization experiments of ECFP-DI-IIb and variants thereof, a LCLC 103H clone expressing constitutively histone H2A coupled to EYFP was used. Histone H2A-EYFP and mem-ECFP expressing cell clones of LCLC 103H were obtained as described earlier (24Bestvater F. Knoch T.A. Langowski J. Spiess E. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (846, and 848–850): 844PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts from approximately 106 cells were prepared according to Ref. 25Muramatsu M. Hayashi Y. Onishi T. Sakai M. Takai K. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 88: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar. Briefly, pools of cells transfected with the corresponding constructs were either kept untreated or incubated with the ionophore for 30 min before cell lysis and fractionation. The protein content was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoretically resolved on SDS-Tris-glycine (12.5%) gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed against the indicated antibodies; the resulting complexes were detected with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG from New England Biolabs using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cell lysates were preincubated with the antibody anti-80K, bound to protein G-agarose (Roche Diagnostics), and eluted according to Ref. 12Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in SDS-Tris-glycine (12.5%) gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected with anti-calpain, a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both large and small calpain subunits. The cells were cultured on 4.2-cm-diameter coverslips (Langenbrinck) or in Lab-Tec™ II cover glass chambers (Nunc) and used for microscopical studies 24–72 h after transfection with the indicated constructs. Prior to observation, the coverslips were mounted in perfusion chamber holders (PeCon) that were kept at 34–36 °C and 5% CO2 during observation. The microscope (Axiovert S100 TV, Zeiss) was equipped with objectives Fluor 40/1.3 oil Ph2, Apochromat 40/1.2 W korr, or Neofluar 63/1.25 oil Ph3, filter wheels, and shutters (Ludl); Orca 4742–95 CCD camera (Hamamatsu), and controlled by OpenLab software (Improvision). Filter systems for ECFP, EYFP, and FRET were from Chroma Technologies (excitation (Ex): 435/10 nm and 515/10 nm; single band: dichroic mirror (DM)ECFP 455 nm, emission (Em)ECFP 480/40 nm and DMEYFP 530 nm, EmEYFP 560/40 nm; doubleband: DMECFP 475 nm, EmECFP 470/30 nm, DMEYFP 556 nm, EmEYFP 555/40 nm; and FRET: DM 460 nm, Em 535/30 nm). All of the observations were carried out in the corresponding growth medium. The images were captured before and after the addition of ionomycin to 2 μm end concentration during 30 min in 5-min intervals. To obtain optical section series a Piezo electric motor (Physical Instruments) was used to drive the C-Apochromat 40× objective in appropriate steps. The images were processed by deconvolution, and false color look-up tables were applied to them for the final presentation. Co-localization was analyzed by the respective Openlab™ software module, which operates on a pixel-by-pixel comparison of pairs of images (23Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on glass coverslips and stained according to Becton Dickinson Transduction Laboratories protocol using the indicated antibodies. For fluorescence microscopy, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with PermaFluor (Immunotech) and inspected in the microscope (LSM 410, Zeiss) equipped with the objective Fluor 63/1.4 oil Ph2. The images were acquired using LSM410 software version 3.95 (Zeiss). For cytoskeletal immunostaining (F-actin), the cells were preincubated with ALEXA633-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The second antibodies used were ALEXA488 anti-mouse and anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), detected at excitation 488 nm, beam splitter FT 488/543, and emission 515–525 nm. F-actin was visualized with the same beam splitter at excitation 633 nm and emission >665 nm. The image parameters were 512 × 512 pixels, pinhole 20. The cells were prepared as for epifluorescence microscopy. The microscope (Leica TCS SP) was equipped with objectives, Fluor 40/1.3 oil Ph2 and Neofluar 63/1.25 oil Ph3, and the following filter sets: ExECFP 453 nm, EmECFP 495/60 nm; ExEYFP 514 nm, EmEYFP 585/70 nm. The images were taken before and after the addition of 2 μm ionomycin during 30 min in 5-min intervals. The imaging parameters were 512 × 512 pixels, pinhole 1. Other relevant parameters are given with the respective images. All of the images were processed with a 3 × 3 median filter.

The specificity of calpain cleavage was evaluated by preincubating culture cells with 50 μmAC27P (28Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C. Omura S. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) for 1 h before treatment with 2 μmionomycin. Free Ca2+ concentrations in COS 7 cells were determined before and after the addition of 2 μm of ionomycin, as previously described (27Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Spiess E. Salvesen G.S. Machleidt W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27217-27226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of endogenous calpain and calpastatin was characterized by immunocytofluorescence microscopy using the monoclonal antibodies anti-DII (specific for μ-calpain large subunit residues Gly245–Phe265), anti-30K, and anti-calpastatin, respectively. Prior to Ca2+ mobilization, both calpain subunits and calpastatin are homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm, with a slight preponderance around the nuclear region (Fig. 2). Also, calpastatin accumulated in the nuclei (Fig. 2 C). After the addition of ionomycin, fluorescence labeling caused by calpain detection increased at cell membranes (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas calpastatin did not relocalize to membranes under calcium-stimulating conditions (Fig. 2 C). For expression in mammalian cells, DNA fragments coding for the human μ-calpain 80K subunit (residues Ser2–Ala711) or its truncated variants Ser2–Asp523 (DI-III), Ser2–Thr390 (DI-IIb), and Ile363–Gln527 (DIII), as well as the active site mutant [C115A]80K were ligated into vector pECFP-C1 to generate chimeric proteins N-terminally extended with ECFP. DNAs coding for the wild type and active site-mutated large subunit were ligated into pECFP-N1 to produce variants C-terminally tagged with ECFP, respectively. 80K and DI-III were also fused to the N terminus of EYFP. Similarly, the 30K DNA was ligated into pEYFP-C1 or pEYFP-N1 to allow expression of chimeric constructs with EYFP attached to the N or C terminus of the small subunit, respectively (see Fig. 1 F for a schematic representation of the variants). First, we determined whether fusion of enhanced fluorescence protein at either terminus of the 80K calpain subunit influences the protein expression level. LCLC 103H cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for either the individual large subunit (pECFP_80K, p80K_ECFP) or small subunit chimeras (p30K_EYFP and pEYFP_30K) or co-transfected with all possible combinations of chimeric 80K and 30K constructs. The cells were lysed 72 h after transfection, and the cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blot using anti-DII antibody (Fig.3 A). All of the variants were successfully overexpressed, but the expression levels of variants in which ECFP is fused to the N terminus of the 80K subunit were systematically lower than those of the C-terminal fusions (Fig.3 A). The latter species were therefore selected for subsequent cellular localization studies. Of note, the 80K subunit of endogenous calpain was also detected in mock transfected cells (Fig.3 A). Addition of a calcium ionophore to cells leads to an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration with concomitant generation of calpain activity (27Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Spiess E. Salvesen G.S. Machleidt W. J. Biol.

Fura-2 measurements of intracellular calcium concentrations were carried out in living cells before and after addition of 2 μm ionomycin. In both cell lines, the addition of ionomycin caused a fast transient increase (“burst”) in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration before equilibrium was reached (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, we observed remarkable differences regarding (i) the peak values of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (between 800 nm and 1.6 μm in LCLC 103H cells (27Gil-Parrado S.

S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 39673–39678). However, the mechanism of the inhibition by Slp4-a has never been elucidated at the molecular level and is still a matter of controversy. In this study, I discovered an unexpected biochemical property of Slp4-a, that Slp4-a, but not other Rab27 effectors reported thus far, is capable of interacting with both Rab27A(T23N), a dominant negative form that mimics the GDP-bound form, and Rab27A(Q78L), a dominant active form that mimics the GTP-bound form, whereas Slp4-a specifically recognizes the GTP-bound form of Rab3A and Rab8A and does not recognize their GDP-bound form. I show by deletion and mutation analyses that the TGDWFY sequence in SHD2 is essential for Rab27A(T23N) binding, whereas SHD1 is involved in Rab27A(Q78L) binding. I further show by immunoprecipitation and cotransfection assays that Munc18-1, but not syntaxin IA, directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of Slp4-a in a Rab27A-independent manner. Expression of Slp4-a mutants that lack Rab27A(T23N) binding activity (i.e. specific binding to Rab27A(Q78L)) completely reverses the inhibitory effect of the wild-type Slp4-a on high KCl-dependent neuropeptide Y secretion in PC12 cells. The results strongly indicate that interaction of Slp4-a with the GDP-bound form of Rab27A, not with syntaxin IA or Munc18-1, is the primary reason that Slp4-a expression inhibits dense core vesicle exocytosis in PC12 cells.

Slp homology domain glutathione S-transferase guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) horseradish peroxidase neuropeptide Y solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor Granuphilin-a was originally identified as a protein that is abundantly expressed on insulin-containing vesicles in pancreatic β-cells (1Wang J.

Expression of Slp4-a (or Slp4-b/granuphilin-b, an alternatively spliced isoform of Slp4-a lacking the C2B domain) has recently been shown to inhibit regulated secretion in endocrine cells (2Torii S.

In this study, I show by means of neuropeptide Y (NPY) cotransfection assay combined with deletion, mutation, and chimeric analyses that the SHD of Slp4-a is an exception and binds both the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Rab27A, and that the Slp4-a·GDP-Rab27A complex has an inhibitory effect on high KCl-dependent NPY secretion in PC12 cells. Based on these results, I propose that binding of Slp4-a to GDP-Rab27A inhibits a specific GTP/GDP exchange cycle required for dense-core vesicle exocytosis. The chromosome locations and genome sequences of the mouse slac2-b gene (GenBankTM accession numberAC079869; chromosome 9) and slp5 gene (XM_141661; chromosome X) were obtained by data base searching (standard BLAST search) using a human Slac2-b sequence and Slp5 cDNA sequence, respectively, as a query (9Kuroda T.S.

NPY-T7-GST secretion assay in PC12 cells was essentially performed as described previously (5Fukuda M. Kanno E. Saegusa C. Ogata Y. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, PC12 cells (6-cm dish) were cotransfected with pShooter-NPY-T7-GST and pEF-T7-Slp, pEF-T7-Slac2, or pEF-BOS, a vector control by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's notes (31Fukuda M. Katayama E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since the expression levels of recombinant T7-tagged proteins varied among the Slp (or Slac2) family, the amounts of pEF-T7-Slp (or Slac2) plasmids used for transfection were varied so that similar amounts of T7-tagged proteins would be expressed in total cell lysates of PC12 cells. Three days after transfection, cells were stimulated with high KCl buffer (56 mm KCl, 95 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °C. Released NPY-T7-GST was recovered by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed by immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands on x-ray film was quantified by Lane Analyzer (version 3.0) (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and normalized by total expressed NPY-T7-GST. T7-tagged Slp4-a mutants, HA-tagged Rab27A, and/or various FLAG-tagged proteins (Rab3A, Rab8A, Rab27A, syntaxin IA, SNAP-25, VAMP-2, or Munc18-1) were coexpressed in COS-7 cells (32Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ogata Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

The amounts of pEF-FLAG vectors used for transfection were varied so that similar amounts of FLAG-tagged proteins would be expressed in total cell lysates of COS-7 cells. For instance, because Rab27A(T23N) protein seemed to be unstable in COS-7 cells, a 5 times greater amount of pEF-FLAG-Rab27A(T23N) plasmids was used for transfection than pEF-FLAG-Rab27A(Q78L) or the wild-type pEF-FLAG-Rab27A to achieve the same protein expression levels (see Fig. 2A, top panel). Direct interaction of GST-Slp4-a with FLAG-Munc18-1 was also assessed as described previously (10Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The blots shown in this paper are representative of at least two or three independent experiments. The SHD basically consists of two α-helical regions (named SHD1 and SHD2), separated by two zinc finger motifs (Fig. 1A), and SHD1 alone (but not SHD2 and the zinc finger motifs) functions as an autonomous specific GTP-dependent Rab27A/B-binding site in Slac2-a (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The only exception is the Slp4-a SHD, because it can also interact with Rab3A and Rab8A (4Coppola T. Frantz C. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Hirling H. Regazzi R. Mol. Biol.

Why and how the Slp4-a SHD recognizes Rab3A and Rab8A in addition to Rab27A, however, had never been elucidated, although this information is important to understanding the physiological function of the Rab3A·Slp4-a and the Rab8A·Slp4-a complex. Deletion and mutation analyses clearly showed that three subdomains of the Slp4-a SHD (SHD1, SHD2, and zinc finger motifs) contribute differently to the recognition of Rab3A, Rab8A, and Rab27A (Fig. 1, A and B). The SHD1 of Slp4-a (i.e. GST-SHD1) functions as a specific Rab27A-binding site, the same as the Slac2-a SHD (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the SHD1 + zinc finger motifs (i.e. ΔSHD2) function as a Rab3A-binding site, and the whole SHD is required for recognition of Rab8A. Since deletion of the SHD1 of Slp4-a (i.e. ΔSHD1) completely abrogated binding activity toward all three Rabs (Fig. 1B), the zinc finger motifs and the SHD2 of Slp4-a themselves are not an autonomous Rab binding domain, the same as the Slac2-a SHD (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Next, I investigated the GTP/GDP dependence of the Rab binding activity of the Slp4-a deletion mutants. To my surprise, the entire SHD of Slp4-a bound both the dominant active form (Q78L; mimics GTP-bound state) and the dominant negative form of Rab27A (T23N; mimics GDP-bound form), despite the fact that the SHD1 alone (or the ΔSHD2) recognizes only the dominant active form (Fig. 1C, comparelanes 5 and 6). By contrast, however, the Slp4-a SHD specifically recognized the GTP-bound form of both Rab3A and Rab8A (i.e. dominant active form) but not their GDP-bound forms (i.e. dominant negative forms), the same as rabphilin (Figs. 1C (lanes 1–4) and 2B). The interaction between SHD and Rab27A(T23N) was found to be a unique event in Slp4-a (asterisk in Fig. 2A), because, except for Slp4-a, all of the Rab27-binding proteins reported thus far specifically recognize Rab27A(Q78L) and do not recognize Rab27A(T23N) (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and2). Based on the results of deletion analysis of the Slp4-a SHD, I hypothesized that the SHD1 alone can function as a GTP-Rab27A-binding site, the same as the Slac2-a SHD1 (i.e.RBD27, Rab-binding domain specific for Rab27 isoforms) (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), that the SHD2 is involved in an auxiliary GDP-Rab27A binding, because the SHD2 alone does not recognize Rab27A at all, and that the zinc finger motifs are not necessary for Rab27A recognition. To verify this hypothesis, I performed Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.3A). When one of the conserved amino acids among the SHD1 of the Slp and Slac2 families (Glu-14, Ile-18, Val-21, or Asp-32 of Slp4-a) (5Fukuda M. Kanno E. Saegusa C. Ogata Y. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was replaced by Ala, the mutant Slp4-a SHD1 (T7-GST-Slp4-SHD1) completely abolished Rab27A binding activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–5), indicating that the Slp4-a SHD1 is critical for GTP-Rab27A binding, the same as the Slac2-a SHD1 (33Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When the TGDWFY sequence in the SHD2 was mutated to AGAAAY, the mutant Slp4-a(A4) specifically bound Rab27A(Q78L) but did not bind Rab27A(T23N) (Fig.3C, lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, mutation of the zinc finger motifs (C102A/C105A) of Slp4-a had no effect on interaction with either Rab27A(T23N) or Rab27A(Q78L) (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4) but has been shown to reduce the Rab3A binding activity (4Coppola T. Frantz C. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Hirling H. Regazzi R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the SHD1 and the SHD2 of Slp4-a are involved in recognition of GTP-Rab27A and GDP-Rab27A, respectively. Since appropriate GTP/GDP exchange (or GTPase activity) of Rab proteins is generally believed to be essential for expression of their function and Rab effectors are also generally believed to bind the GTP-bound, activated form of Rab prote"

Glu-14 is the only charged membrane-embedded residue in EmrE and is evolutionarily highly conserved. This residue has an unusually high pK and is an essential part of the binding domain, shared by substrates and protons. The occupancy of the binding domain is mutually exclusive, and, as such, this provides the molecular basis for the coupling between substrate and proton fluxes. Systematic cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the residues in the transmembrane segment (TM1), where Glu-14 is located, reveals an amino acid cluster on the same face of TM1 as Glu-14 that is part of the substrate- and proton-binding domain. Substitutions at most of these positions yielded either inactive mutants or mutants with modified affinity to substrates. Substitutions at the Ala-10 position, one helix turn away from Glu-14, yielded mutants with modified affinity to protons and thereby impaired in the coupling of substrate and proton fluxes. Taken as a whole, the results strongly support the concept of a common binding site for substrate and protons and stress the importance of one face of TM1 in substrate recognition, binding, and H+-coupled transport.

The four transmembrane segments in EmrE are tightly packed in the membrane without any continuous aqueous domain, as was shown by cysteine scanning experiments (13Steiner Mordoch S. Granot D.

These results suggest the existence of a hydrophobic pathway through which the substrates are translocated. Glu-14, the only membrane-embedded charged residue is highly conserved in the SMR family (11Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This residue has an unusually high pK and is an essential part of the binding domain, shared by substrates and protons (1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S.

The occupancy of the binding domain is mutually exclusive, and, as such, this provides the molecular basis for coupling of substrate and proton fluxes. In TM1, where Glu-14 is located, a certain helical periodicity of sequence conservation is observed in the SMR family: (F/Y)L7 XXA10(I/G)11 XXE14(I/V)X(A/G/W)17(T/A/S/N)18 XX(L/M) (11Ninio S.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3422-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting the functional importance of one face of the helix. Hsmr, a homologue from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum, built from over 40% valine and alanine residues supplies further support for this contention. In Hsmr, the Ala and Val residues are clustered in domains that do not seem important for activity, and this dramatic phenomenon seems to reflect the outcome of an evolutionary process leading to the replacement of all residues not essential for function with either valine or alanine. In the TM1 of Hsmr, the face opposite Glu-14 is built almost entirely of Ala residues (12Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We therefore experimentally probed the role of the residues in the same face of the helix as Glu-14 in substrate recognition and in stabilization of the negative charge in the membrane. We scanned these residues using site-directed mutagenesis and identified a cluster of five amino acids that play a role in substrate and H+recognition and/or translocation. Substitutions at most positions yielded either inactive mutants or mutants with modified affinity to substrates. Substitutions at the Ala-10 position, one helix turn away from Glu-14, yielded mutants with wild type substrate binding properties but with modified affinity to protons. As a consequence, the mutants are impaired in the coupling of the proton gradient to substrate fluxes. The current study provides further insight into the coupling mechanism and stresses the importance of one face of TM1 in substrate recognition, binding, and H+-coupled transport.

Mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction, using the overlap extension procedure as described by Hoet al. (19Ho S.F. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). For most of the mutations, a set of two overlapping oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation was constructed. The outside primers were those used for EmrE (20Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The templates used were EmrE-His, CLS-EmrE-His, or CAMY-EmrE-His. In mutations at positions Tyr-6, Leu-7, Ala-10, Ile-11, Ala-13, and Glu-14, only two outside primers were used, and the forward one contained the desired mutation. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were prepared incorporating a unique restriction site to facilitate mutant identification, and, in several cases, this required an additional conservative mutation. Mutated DNA was identified by the acquisition of the new restriction site. All of the PCR-amplified products were sequenced to ensure that no other mutations occurred during the amplification process. E. coli JM109 cells transformed with either pT7-7-EmrE-His, pT7-7 (vector), or with the various mutants were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB-Ampicillin medium. 5 μl of serial dilutions of the culture were spotted on a series of LB-Amp plates with various EmrE substrates (200 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 100 μg/ml acriflavine, and 0.1 mmmethyl viologen) or on a plate with no addition. Growth was analyzed after overnight incubation at 37 °C. E. coli TA15 cells transformed with plasmid pT7-7 were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium A supplemented with glycerol (0.5%), thiamine (2.5 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). When the culture reached anA 600 = 0.9, it was transferred to 42 °C for 15 min to induce the T7 polymerase. Then the culture was shifted back to 30 °C. 2 h later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended with buffer containing sucrose (250 mm), dithiothreitol (0.5 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (10 mm), MgSO4(2.5 mm), and DNase (15 μg/ml) (Sigma) and broken by a French press. The membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation at 213,500 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended in the above buffer without dithiothreitol and without DNase. The membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Reconstitution was performed essentially as described (21Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 400 μl of membranes (containing 120 μg of EmrE-His protein) were solubilized in 2 ml of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5 (Na-buffer), 1.5% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM), with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After removal of unsolubilized material by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min), imidazole was added to 20 mm, and the EmrE-His protein was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (1 h, 4 °C). The beads were washed with at least 4 ml of Na-buffer, containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Glycon GmbH), 30 mm imidazole, and 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with 500 μl of the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and mixed with 375 μl of E. coli phospholipids mix (10 mg of phospholipids, 1.2%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 15 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Eluted protein and phospholipids were sonicated together in a bath type sonicator until clear and diluted in buffer containing 0.19 mNH4Cl, 0.015 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Prior to the assay, the proteoliposomes were thawed at room temperature and sonicated lightly until clear. Tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) binding was assayed essentially as described (1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (10 μl/assay) (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) were washed twice in distilled water and once in 0.08% DDM/Na-buffer. Membranes, solubilized in 0.8% DDM/Na-buffer, were added to the washed beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound material was discarded, and EmrE-His bound to beads was washed once with 0.08% DDM/Na-buffer. Buffer containing 5 nm [3H]TPP+ (27 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with shaking. In each experiment, the values obtained in a control reaction, with 25 μm unlabeled TPP+, were subtracted. Separating the beads from the supernatant by pulse centrifugation stopped the binding reaction. The bead fraction was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 450 μl of 0.08% DDM/Na-buffer containing 150 mm imidazole in order to release the EmrE-His and [3H]TPP+ bound to it from the beads. After spinning down the beads, the [3H]TPP+-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. All binding reactions were performed in duplicates. Each experiment was performed at least twice. Uptake of [14C]methyl viologen into proteoliposomes was assayed at 25 °C by dilution of 3 μl of the ammonium chloride-containing proteoliposomes (100 ng of EmrE-His) into 200 μl of an ammonium-free solution (20Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The latter contained 41 μm [14C]- methyl viologen (12.7–32.3 mCi/mmol; Sigma), 140 mm KCl, 10 mmTricine, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris (pH 9.5). At given times, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution, filtering through Millipore GSWP filters (0.22 μm) and washing with an additional 2 ml of solution. The radioactivity on the filters was estimated by liquid scintillation. In each experiment, the values obtained in a control reaction, with 15 μm nigericin, were subtracted from all experimental points. The reaction was measured in triplicates. Each experiment was performed at least twice. [14C]Methyl viologen was added (2 mm, 32.3 mCi/mmol; Sigma) into 60 μl of freshly thawed proteoliposomes (2 μg of EmrE-His) before sonication. After sonication, 3 μl of proteoliposomes (100 ng of the protein) were diluted into 200 μl of a solution containing 10 mmTricine, 5 mm MgCl2, 190 mmNH4Cl, 15 μm nigericin, and 10 mmTris (pH 8.5). At given times, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of the same ice-cold solution, filtering through Millipore GSWP filters (0.22 μm), and washing with an additional 2 ml of solution. The radioactivity of the filters was estimated by liquid scintillation. In each experiment, the values obtained after 3 h were subtracted from all experimental points. The kinetics of efflux at 15 °C was measured in duplicates. Each experiment was performed at least twice. In TM1, a relatively short 18-amino acid segment starting at Y4 and ending at M21, a periodical pattern of conservation is observed, with most of the conserved residues on the same face of the helix of the essential Glu-14 (11Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Torres J. Arkin I.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3422-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In Hsmr, an Smr protein from the archaeon H. salinarum, the face of TM1 opposite to Glu-14 is composed mostly of Ala residues (12Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings suggested a central role of the residues in one face of TM1, and to experimentally probe it we performed a cysteine-scanning mutational analysis. The Cys-less-EmrE (CAMY-EmrE-His) protein displays significant transport activity and therefore provides a good starting point for generation of mutant proteins with single Cys insertions in replacement for residues in the proximity of Glu-14. Here we report the results obtained after replacing 12 amino acids in TM1. The activity of each of the mutant proteins has been tested both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the resistance conferred by each of the proteins was assessed by testing the ability of cells expressing them to grow under otherwise nonpermissive conditions. This was achieved in solid media containing either ethidium bromide (200 μg/ml), acriflavine (100 μg/ml), or methyl viologen (0.1 mm) in which 5 μl of logarithmic dilutions (103 to 105) of an overnight culture were spotted. Cells carrying the vector plasmid without any insert cannot grow in these media at any of the dilutions tested. Cells expressing either EmrE-His or CAMY-EmrE-His were able to grow at each of the dilutions. This assay provides a highly dynamic range to qualitatively analyze the activity of the mutants generated. The different strains clearly fall into two categories: those that grow in all three dilutions and those that do not. We arbitrarily assign a score of 1 to those strains capable of growing at dilutions higher than 103 (Fig. 1). Lack of growth at dilutions of 103 or less is defined as zero and is due to a nonfunctional transporter. This assay depends on the activity of EmrE, but no absolute quantitation can be made, because the levels of expression of EmrE do differ among the various mutants. Notwithstanding this limitation, several important conclusions can be made (Fig. 1). Six mutant proteins are incapable of conferring any measurable resistance: L7C, A10C, I11C, E14C, G17C, and T18C. They are located on the same face of the helix as Glu-14, and, in general, these are the locations of the conserved residues (Fig. 1). All of the other mutants tested are capable of conferring some degree of resistance to the various toxic compounds tested. The fact that such a large number of residues are nonpermissive is remarkable, since in several proteins, including other domains in EmrE, it has been previously observed that many residues can be replaced without loss of phenotypic complementation (13Steiner Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the conservation pattern observed, suggested that residues in the vicinity of Glu-14 are important for function, and we therefore studied the various mutants in detail. All of the mutant proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography to assess expression levels and were then assayed for their ability to catalyze partial reactions of the transport cycle. Substrate binding was evaluated in the detergent-solubilized transporter using [3H]TPP+, a high affinity substrate (1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All of the mutants tested, including the ones incapable of conferring resistance, expressed to similar levels (not shown); however, the ability to bind [3H]TPP+differed considerably among the various mutants. As expected, Y6C, L12C, A13C, V15C, I16C, and M21C, proteins that conferred resistance in the in vivo assay described above, were capable of binding [3H]TPP+ to levels at least 50% of that of the EmrE-His control or CAMY-EmrE-His (Fig.2 A). Whereas L7C, E14C, and G17C displayed no measurable binding activity (Fig. 2 B) (1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), other mutants bound [3H]TPP+ to various degrees (Fig. 2 C), and their binding was further analyzed. Mutant proteins with substitutions at three positions, 10, 11, and 18, bound TPP+ (Fig. 2 C), although they did not confer resistance (Fig. 1). I11C bound 1.6 pmol of TPP+/μg of EmrE, about one-tenth of the TPP+ bound by the wild type under standard conditions (Fig. 2 C). Further analysis of these results revealed that the reason for this decreased binding at 2.5 nm TPP+ is due to a decrease in affinity to 20 ± 2 nm, as compared with 1.9 nm for the wild type protein (10Rotem D. Sal-Man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further probe this location, Ile-11 was replaced with Gly, a residue found in many of the other homologues (Fig. 1). However, I11G was even less active than I11C (TableI).Table IBinding activity of substitutions with amino acids other than cysteineMutantsTPP+boundpmol/μg EmrEA10G13.87 ± 0.01A10S0.27 ± 0.05A10V0.04 ± 0.06A10L0.27 ± 0.08A10P0.54 ± 0.01I11G0.13 ± 0.19E14D10.00 ± 1.45T18A0.78 ± 0.48T18G0.49 ± 0.41T18S1.60 ± 0.38The experiment was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was repeated twice in duplicates.

The average and the average deviations are presented. T18C showed low but consistent binding activity. Since it is partly conserved (Fig. 1), we constructed the T18S, T18A, and T18G mutations, amino acids present in this position in other homologues. These proteins did not confer resistance either (Fig. 1) and showed little binding activity except for T18S that bound about 1.1 pmol/μg EmrE (Table I). In this case too, the affinity to TPP+ was 21 ± 2 nm, 10 times lower than that displayed by the wild type protein. Changes in the affinity to substrate measured in detergent-solubilized preparations affect also transport rates measured in reconstituted proteoliposomes. The T18S and I11C mutants, which display a lower affinity to TPP+, have moderate levels of uptake. Purified EmrE-His or mutant proteins were reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and the transport activity was measured. The ΔpH-driven [14C]methyl viologen uptake into proteoliposomes is shown in Fig. 3 A. In this experiment, an artificial pH gradient is generated, and substrate transport against a concentration gradient is measured at a concentration of 41 μm (K m for the wild type protein = 260 μm) (11Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmrE-His rapidly accumulate substrate, and uptake levels off thereafter. The results for T18S are shown in Fig.3 A, where uptake after 5 min reaches a level of about 30% of EmrE-His. The results with I11C are not shown, but they are practically identical. This relatively lower accumulation capacity correlates well with the lower uptake rates and constant passive leaks. Lower transport rates are also detected in the downhill efflux assays (Fig. 3 B). In these experiments, proteoliposomes are loaded with a high concentration of radioactively labeled substrate and diluted into an identical medium with no substrate. To prevent possible generation of proton gradients, the ionophore nigericin is added to the medium. The lower rates catalyzed by T18S (Fig. 3 B) and I11C (not shown) are evident although these experiments are carried out at 2 mm methyl viologen, a relatively high concentration. A strikingly different behavior was detected with mutants at position 10. A10C bound 5 pmol of TPP+/μg of EmrE, about 40% of the EmrE-His (Fig. 2 C). A protein in which the replacement was with a smaller amino acid, A10G, bound 14 pmol of TPP+/μg of EmrE to the same levels as EmrE-His (Table I). Any other replacement at this position, A10S (an amino acid detected in this position in a few of the other homologues), A10L, A10V, and A10P resulted in inactive proteins. The results described for Cys and Gly substitutions at position 10 suggested the possibility that these mutants bind substrate with high affinity but display a modified affinity to H+. The dependence of the binding and release of substrate on the ability of Glu-14 to release and bind protons is an essential element of the coupling mechanism (25Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TPP+ binding to wild-type EmrE requires deprotonation of Glu-14, whereas binding to E14D mutant is practically pH-independent in the range 6.5–8.5 (1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Shortening of the Glu side chain to Asp decreases the pK a of the carboxyl to around 5, compared with the unusually high pK a of about 7.5 in the EmrE-His (1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the E14D mutant catalyzes downhill efflux of substrate but cannot utilize the proton electrochemical gradient to drive uphill substrate accumulation (25Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this work, we tested whether mutants of TM1 modify the pK a of Glu-14 as judged from the pH dependence of TPP+ binding. [3H]TPP+ binding was measured at pH 6.5, and the values obtained for each mutant are shown in Fig. 4 as a percentage of the corresponding [3H]TPP+ binding at pH 8.6. The results demonstrate that most of the mutants bind less than 10% [3H]TPP+ at this pH, similar to what was previously shown for wild type EmrE (26Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Strikingly, A10C and A10G display binding levels at pH 6.5 almost as high as at pH 8.6. These data indicate that the nature of the amino acid at position 10 influences the pK of Glu-14 and suggest a close interaction with Glu-14. Since, as mentioned above, the pH dependence of binding reflects the coupling between proton and substrate fluxes, transport functions of A10C and A10G were investigated. Similar to what was observed with E14D, the two mutants with pH-independent binding, A10C and A10G, have no uptake activity. The ΔpH-driven [14C]methyl viologen uptake into proteoliposomes was assayed as described above and shown in Fig. 3 A. Whereas proteoliposomes reconstituted with EmrE-His rapidly accumulate substrate, those with either A10C or A10G showed no accumulation whatsoever. The same proteoliposomes were used to assay the ability of the various mutants to catalyze H+-independent downhill efflux. A10C displays a high rate of downhill efflux of [14C]methyl viologen (40 pmol/s/μg of EmrE), comparable with that detected for EmrE-His (Fig. 3 B). This behavior is very similar to that reported for E14D, a mutant that catalyzes downhill efflux but is incapable of utilizing the proton electrochemical gradient (25Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, both E14D and A10C have a more moderate pH dependence of the efflux rate than that of the wild type (not shown). Strikingly, A10G has a much lower efflux rate than A10C, although it binds TPP+ with similar affinity. The efflux rate is 6.4 pmol/s/μg of EmrE, about 10% of that observed with the wild type protein. To test whether the return of the unloaded transporter is impaired, exchange was tested by the addition of saturating concentrations of unlabeled methyl viologen to the medium as in Ref. 25Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. The exchange rate was only slightly higher than the efflux rate (data not shown). Thus, whereas mutants A10C and E14D behave very similarly, the A10G mutant displays a novel behavior. All three bind TPP+ in a pH-independent mode and are, therefore, affected in the proton coupling mechanism. However, A10C and E14D efflux the substrate down its electrochemical gradient, but A10G has very slow downhill efflux activity. This suggests that it cannot undergo the conformational change(s) necessary for substrate transport following binding. Systematic cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the neighbors of residue Glu-14 in TM1 revealed an amino acid cluster surrounding Glu-14 that is part of the substrate-binding domain. Several types of mutants were obtained (Fig. 5): 1) wild type phenotype, wild type substrate binding (positions shown ingray: Tyr-6, Leu-12, Ala-13, Val-15, Ile-16, and Met-21); 2) negative phenotype, no substrate binding (Leu-7 and Gly-17); 3) negative phenotype, substrate binding with lower affinity (Thr-18 and Ile-11); and 4) negative phenotype, wild type substrate binding, modified affinity to H+, uncoupled transport (A10). The residues that yielded proteins with wild type phenotype and bound the substrate TPP+ to wild type levels were located on the face of the helix opposite of Glu-14 (Leu-12, Ala-13, Val-15, and Ile-16) or far enough from Glu-14 on the same face (Tyr-6 and Met-21). We conclude that these domains are not involved in either one of the functions required for catalysis of transport. These results provide experimental support for the prediction put forward based on the lack of conservation of residues in these positions (11Ninio S. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A remarkable and very graphic demonstration of the evolutionary argument was provided with the analysis of the sequence of Hsmr, the archaeal homologue of EmrE. Hsmr displays a remarkable amino acid composition of over 40% valine and alanine residues. The distribution of valine and alanine residues within the transmembrane domains of Hsmr is not random. Many of these abundant residues appear to be clustered in structural domains that are not essential for activity. This resembles the result of an alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiment, pointing out instantaneously the residues that are important for the function of the protein and therefore cannot be replaced with valine or alanine. In TM1 of Hsmr, all residues in the face opposite that of Glu-14 are either alanine or valine (12Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Only two of the cysteine substitutions in TM1 that were phenotypically inactive were also inactive in the binding assay. Those were the mutations of the highly conserved Leu-7 or the less conserved Gly-17. Mutations at either one of two positions 11 and 18 decreased the affinity to substrate about 10-fold (Fig. 5). At the relatively conserved position 11, Gly is found in quite a number of homologues. However, the I11G mutation was completely inactive. On the other hand, cysteine replacement at this position generates a protein with a modified affinity. The I11C protein can also utilize the pH gradient to transport methyl viologen against its concentration gradient. At position 18, replacement of Thr with Cys or Ala, another residue found at this position in other homologues, yielded an inactive protein. Replacement with Ser, another hydroxyamino acid, generated a protein with a decreased affinity to TPP+ but capable of accumulating methyl viologen in a process driven by a pH gradient. Interestingly, although capable of energy-driven transport, neither I11C nor T18S can confer resistance to the tested drugs. We reason that because of their decreased affinities, neither one can lower the concentration of the toxic compounds below the cytotoxic levels. Most revealing were the replacements at position 10 (Fig. 5). The Cys substitution yielded a protein with a modified affinity to H+ as judged from the pH independence of TPP+binding in the range 6.5–8.6. We previously showed that the pH dependence of TPP+ binding is a reflection of the pK of the carboxyl at position 14 (1, 21). Thus, TPP+ binds to EmrE after H+ release from Glu-14, and it is released from the binding site upon protonation of Glu-14. This property provides the basis of coupling between H+ and substrate movements (14Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,26Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A protein with a pK below the “physiological” range cannot utilize pH gradients for substrate accumulation, but it catalyzes downhill transport at rates similar to that of wild type. This was previously shown for an E14D mutation and is now shown for substitutions at position 10. To analyze the mechanism by which this occurs, several other replacements were engineered. A10S, isosteric to Cys, yielded an inactive protein; hydrophobic replacements A10V and A10L were ineffective, as was also A10P, a smaller residue that may introduce a kink and confers some rigidity to the helix. A very interesting behavior was detected in the A10G mutant. Similarly to A10C, TPP+ binding to A10G displays high affinity but is pH-independent. As a consequence, the protein does not catalyze ΔpH-driven accumulation. Surprisingly, however, A10G is impaired also in efflux and exchange rates. The exchange reaction, unlike downhill transport, involves only translocation of the substrate-transporter complex (see Ref. 25Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar for kinetic scheme). Since the affinity of A10G to TPP+ was practically identical to that of the wild type as were the rates of TPP+ release from the protein (measured as in Ref. 1Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar; not shown), the results, taken as a whole, suggest that A10G is impaired in the translocation step of the substrate-transporter complex. The environment around Glu-14 is chemically unique as judged by its unusually elevated pK a. Recent advances in the structural analysis of multidrug recognizing transcription factors suggest that these proteins possess large hydrophobic binding sites and bind their substrates through a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (27Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Godsey M.H. Zheleznova Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40169-40172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Negative charges in these hydrophobic domains are stabilized by hydrogen bonding to other residues such as the hydroxyls in tyrosines (29Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In EmrE, we have suggested that the negative charge of Glu-14 may be stabilized in part by interaction with the corresponding residue of a neighboring monomer (14Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The effects of Ala-10 substitutions on the pK of Glu-14 may be due to changes in the nature of this interaction; Cys is bulkier than Ala and may push apart the two helices. The smaller Gly residues may allow greater flexibility and may thus decrease the time that Glu-14 residues in two neighbor monomers interact. Any other replacements at position 10 yielded nonfunctional proteins, suggesting again a central role for Ala-10. A close interaction between a carbonyl moiety with a high pK a and a neighbor Ala has been suggested in the case of subunit c of the H+/ATPase. In this protein, it has been suggested that two Ala residues together with an Ile and an Asp interact to form the H+ binding site in the subunit c-oligomer (30Fillingame R.H. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results described in this work strongly support the predictions from the analysis of evolutionary conservation and the amino acid sequence of Hsmr. They provide compelling evidence for the involvement of a cluster of amino acids around Glu-14 in substrate and H+ recognition in EmrE."

We used a degenerate phosphopeptide library synthesized on 35-μm TentaGel beads and fluorescence-activated bead sorting to determine the sequence specificity of the peptide-binding sites of the SH2 domains of STAT1 and STAT3. The large bead library allowed not only peptide sequencing of pools of beads but also of single beads. The method was validated through surface plasmon resonance measurements of the affinities of different peptides to the STAT SH2 domains. Furthermore, when selected peptides were attached to a truncated erythropoietin receptor and stably expressed in DA3 cells, activation of STAT1 or STAT3 could be achieved by stimulation with erythropoietin. The combined analysis of pool sequencing, the individual peptide sequences, and plasmon resonance measurements allowed the definition of SH2 domain binding motifs. STAT1 preferentially binds peptides with the motif phosphotyrosine-(aspartic acid/glutamic acid)-(proline/arginine)-(arginine/proline/glutamine), whereby a negatively charged amino acid at +1 excludes a proline at +2 and vice versa. STAT3 preferentially binds peptides with the motif phosphotyrosine-(basic or hydrophobic)–(proline or basic)–glutamine. For both STAT1 and STAT3, specific high affinity phosphopeptides were identified that can be used for the design of inhibitory molecules.

The binding of these extracellular signaling polypeptides to specific cell surface receptors typically results in receptor homo- or heterodimerization and consecutive activation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases of the Jak family. Activated Jak kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the intracellular domains of the receptors (1Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). STATs then bind with their SH2 domains to these receptor-docking sites. The Jak kinases phosphorylate the STATs on a single tyrosine located carboxyl-terminal to the SH2 domain (2Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is the decisive activation event, resulting in STAT dimer formation through mutual SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions. STAT dimers translocate into the nucleus, bind to response elements in gene promoters, and enhance the transcription of these target genes (3Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 4Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 5Heim M.H. J.

The different STAT proteins are activated by distinct cytokines and growth factors, and each STAT protein activates a distinct set of target genes (5Heim M.H. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 75-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 7Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The specific coupling of the different STAT family members to cytokine receptors is crucial for the generation of diverse intracellular signals by different cytokines.The molecular mechanisms and rules that form the basis of the selective binding of STAT family members to cytokine receptors are only partly understood. Specificity is not controlled by the Jaks but rather by the ability of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor complexes to recruit specific STATs through binding of their SH2 domains. Elegant experiments have demonstrated that such receptor “docking” sites can be transferred from one receptor to the other and that such chimerical receptors will then activate additional STAT family members (8Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Conversely, swapping of STAT SH2 domains can change the receptors to which the chimerical STATs are recruited (9Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Further experiments have confirmed that the highly specific phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction is the basis for the specific activation of STATs by cytokines (10Hemmann U. Gerhartz C. Heesel B.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).Over the last years, most of the cytokine receptor docking sites for STATs have been identified by mutational analysis of intracellular receptor domains (reviewed in Ref. 5Heim M.H. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 75-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, attempts to define binding motifs specific for the different STAT proteins through the analysis of several dozens of such docking sites had only modest success. The number of known receptor docking sites is not large enough to allow definitions of the peptide-binding motifs for the different STAT SH2 domains.Analysis of crystal structures of phosphotyrosine peptides bound to SH2 domains has shown that amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine make extensive contacts with the SH2 domain (14Waksman G.

Purified SH2 domains of several signaling molecules were incubated with libraries composed of degenerate phosphopeptides, followed by isolation and sequencing of mixtures of high affinity binding peptides. The results of such pool sequencing experiments can be used to define binding motifs specific for the different SH2 domains. The approach is very powerful in screening large numbers of different peptides, but an important caveat has to be kept in mind. The prediction of optimal phosphopeptide motifs assumes that selection at each position is independent of the adjacent amino acids. However, it is highly conceivable that adjacent amino acids strongly influence each other. In this case, pool sequencing approaches are prone to predict incorrect optimal peptide motifs.STAT SH2 domains have not yet been analyzed by phosphopeptide library experiments. We have published previously (20Muller K. Gombert F.O. Manning U. Grossmuller F. Graff P. Zaegel H. Zuber J.F. Freuler F. Tschopp C. Baumann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16500-16505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) a phosphopeptide screening method using fluorescence-activated bead sorting. Here we have analyzed the binding properties of STAT1 and STAT3 SH2 domains with an improved library approach using a phosphopeptide library synthesized on 35-μm TentaGel beads that allowed single peptide sequencing as well as pool sequencing of high affinity peptides. The novel large bead library method was validated through systematic affinity measurements by surface plasmon resonance of selected library peptides. Furthermore, selected peptides were studied in vivo. They were attached to a truncated erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) that lacks intracellular phosphotyrosine-docking sites, and the chimeric receptors were stably expressed in DA3 cells that have no endogenous EpoRs. Stimulation of transfected cells with erythropoietin (Epo) resulted in a specific activation of STAT1 or STAT3.Based on the combined analysis of single peptide and pool sequencing results, we predict optimal binding motifs for STAT1 and for STAT3. Furthermore, affinity measurements by surface plasmon resonance identified high affinity peptides specific for STAT1 or STAT3 that can be used as models for the rational design of specific inhibitory molecules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSubcloning, Expression, and Purification of STAT1, STAT1t, and STAT3The portion of the human STAT1 gene encoding residues 135–712 was amplified by PCR (Vent polymerase; New England Biolabs). An NdeI restriction site was introduced by the 5′ primer and the FLAG epitope followed by a stop codon, and theBamHI restriction sites were introduced by the 3′ primer. The product was cloned into the NdeI/BamHI restriction sites of the pET20b Escherichia coli expression vector and sequenced (Novagen). Growth and induction of transformed E. coli (BL21DE3(pLysS)) was performed as outlined in the instruction manual. About 50% of induced protein remained soluble and were subsequently isolated. Cells were collected by centrifugation (20 min; 4 °C; 20,000 × g) and resuspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (100 ml/30 g of cells: 20 mm Hepes/HCl, 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 mm DTT, 100 units/ml DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), CompleteTM protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), pH 7.6). Cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freezing/thawing. Lysis was allowed to complete at 4 °C while stirring slowly for 1 h. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 21,000 rpm at 4 °C. 0.1% polyethyleneimine (Sigma) was added to the supernatant; the solution was mixed gently and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. 50 mm NaCl was added to the supernatant containing the soluble STAT1 before it was applied to anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads and purified according to the instructions from the manufacturer. FLAG fusion protein was eluted by competitive elution with 3 column equivalents of FLAG peptide, 3 times for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. As the FLAG peptide did not interfere with subsequent experiments, no further purification steps were necessary. The purified proteins were stored at −70 °C. All buffers used during protein purification contained 2 mm DTT and were chilled, thoroughly degassed, and flushed with N2 before use. The protein concentration of the purified STAT1t was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The purity of purified STAT1t was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) staining.Complementary DNAs encoding human full-length STAT1 and murine full-length STAT3 lacking the last stop codons were amplified by PCR (Vent polymerase), and an XhoI restriction site was introduced by the 5′ primer. The FLAG epitope followed by a stop codon and the PacI site was introduced by the 3′ primer. The products were sequenced and subsequently cloned into theXhoI/PacI restriction sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK8 (Clontech) and subsequently co-transfected into Sf21 insect cells using the Clontech/BacPAK6 DNA kit as outlined in their instruction manual. Single plaques were picked and checked for proper STAT1 and STAT3 recombinant virus expression by PCR and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody, respectively. The positive clones were further amplified in TN5 insect cells for subsequent expression and purification. TN5 insect cells in suspension culture (500,000 cells/ml) were infected with 1 multiplicity of infection of recombinant virus and harvested by centrifugation (1500 × g, 15 min) 32 (STAT1) or 48 h (STAT3) post-infection. The cells were lysed in 10 ml/1 × 108cells ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Mes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 0.02% NaN3, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 20 mm DTT, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), pH adjusted to 7.0 with Tris) with a Dounce homogenizer (2 times for 10 strokes). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 50 mm NaCl was added to the supernatant before it was applied to Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads. Further purification and analysis of the final preparation were performed as described above for STAT1t, except that for STAT3 the elution buffer contained 20 mmTris, 20% glycerol, 300 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40.The Grb2-SH2 domain-GST fusion protein was expressed and purified as described (20Muller K. Gombert F.O. Manning U. Grossmuller F. Graff P. Zaegel H. Zuber J.F. Freuler F. Tschopp C. Baumann G. J. Biol.

Fmoc amino acids including Fmoc-Tyr (PO(OH)2) were obtained from Novabiochem and Propeptide (Vert-Le-Petit, France). 6 equivalents of Fmoc-protected amino acid (0.4 m solution in DMF) were coupled by in situ activation with 6 eq of benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (0.4 m in DMF) and 12 eq ofN-methylmorpholine (0.8 m in DMF) for 1 h 30 min at room temperature. The complete synthesis of the library was carried out according to the “split and pool synthesis” method described by Lam et al. (22Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), where at each coupling stage each amino acid is coupled individually in separate reactors. After completion of the coupling, the contents of all reactors were combined, washed with DMF 6 times, N-deprotected with 20% piperidine/DMF 2 times for 30 min, and washed with DMF 6 times. The wet slurry of beads was transferred into a polypropylene bag. The bag was then closed with a thermic sealing device. The bag was placed on a plane surface and gently treated with a rubber-coated roller of 3 cm width for efficient deaggregation and mixing of the beads needed in the “split and pool” process. The beads were then removed from the bag, washed with DMF, and divided into the reactors for the next coupling step. Side chain deprotection was carried out with 90% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% water and 5% triisopropylsilane as scavengers at room temperature for 3 h. The beads were washed with trifluoroacetic acid/water, 95:5, tetrahydrofuran, DMF, 0.5m N-ethyldiisopropylamine in DMF, DMF, isopropyl alcohol, and finally ethanol. Each bead carrying peptides of only one type of sequence covalently linked via a branched spacer of Lys-Gly-ε-aminohexanoic acid to the polymer. The library beads were resuspended in ethanol, passed through a cell strainer of 0.1-mm mesh size (BD Biosciences, Falcon catalog number 2360), and stored at −20 °C.Synthesis of Phosphotyrosine Library PL407 and of the Non-phosphorylated Tyrosine Library PL409-10The synthesis of the libraries PL407 and PL409-10 was performed as described for the library PL408-2br, except that 5.7 and 5 g, respectively, of aminomethyl-functionalized TentaGel M30102 (RAPP Polymere GmbH) with a diameter 10 μm was used. After the coupling steps, the beads were directly mixed by stirring the wet slurry in DMF without applying the deaggregation method with a roller described for the library PL408-2br. The structure of the library PL407 wasXXXY*XXXXX-Ahx-NH-bead and for library PL409-10XXXXXYXXXXXX-(Ahx)2-NH-bead, whereas Y is tyrosine, Y* is phosphotyrosine, X includes all of the natural amino acids except cysteine, and Ahx is the spacer ε-aminohexanoic acid.Incubation of the STAT1, STAT1t, and STAT3 with the Libraries PL407 and PL409-10Different concentrations of FLAG-tagged purified STAT1, STAT1t, or STAT3 proteins were incubated with 250 μg of beads (600 beads/μg) in a total volume of 100 μl of incubation buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, sterile-filtered, pH 7.2) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, washed 4 times with cold incubation buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of incubation buffer, and incubated once more with 1 μl of anti-FLAG-M2 FITC fluorescently tagged antibody (0.22 mg/ml) for 1 h in the dark on ice mixed occasionally by vortexing. Anti-FLAG-FITC antibody was produced by labeling mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (IntegraBiosciences, Eastman Kodak, catalog number IB13025) with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, F-1906), and a molar dye to protein ratio = 3.6 was obtained. The beads were washed again with cold incubation buffer and transferred to Micronics tubes for analysis on a FACsort (BD Biosciences) with a modified sample uptake needle of 275-μm inner diameter. All tubes were coated for at least 1 h with 100% FCS.Incubation of STAT1 with PL407 for Sorting25 mg of PL407 beads (600 beads/μg) were incubated in 10 ml of incubation buffer with 8 nm STAT1 overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were washed in incubation buffer and incubated in 2.5 ml of the same buffer with 5.5 μg of FITC-labeled anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h.Sorting of Beads of the PL407 Library after Incubation with STAT1The beads of the library PL407 incubated with STAT1 and fluorescent antibodies were analyzed and isolated on the cell sorter Elite ESP (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 150-μm nozzle at a sheet pressure of 4.4 pounds/square inch and a droplet frequency of 7.3 kHz and one droplet collection mode aborting coincident events. Fluorescence was measured at channels FL1 at 530 nm wavelength in peak area logarithmic detection mode, and forward and side scatter were measured in peak area linear detection mode. The gating for the sort was a forward and side scatter region corresponding for non-aggregated, monomeric beads linked by “and” with a FL1 histogram region. The combined gating was set to select for isolation the highest fluorescent events amounting to about 1.7% of total events. Event rate was held at about 250 beads/s. The beads were collected in tubes previously coated with 100% fetal calf serum for 1 h.Incubation of STAT1t and STAT3 with Library PL408-2br30 nm of purified STAT1t or STAT3 proteins were incubated with 30 mg of beads (25,000 beads/mg) in a total volume of 2 ml of incubation buffer overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Beads were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, washed 4 times with cold incubation buffer, resuspended in 1 ml of incubation buffer, and incubated once more with 8.8 μg of anti-FLAG FITC antibody for 1 h in the dark on ice mixed occasionally by vortexing. The beads were left settling; the supernatant was removed, and PBS was added. A 50-μl aliquot was used for a control analytical run (data not shown). All tubes were previously coated for at least 1 h with 100% FCS.Sorting of Beads of the PL408-2br Library after Incubation with STAT1t or STAT3The beads of the library PL408-2br incubated with STAT proteins and fluorescent antibodies were analyzed and isolated on a cell sorter Elite ESP (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) using a 150-μm nozzle at sheet pressure of 5.2 pounds/square inch and a droplet frequency of 9.1 kHz and a two-droplet collection mode aborting coincident events. Fluorescence was measured at two channels, FL1 at 530 nm and FL2 at 575 nm wavelength simultaneously in linear peak detection mode. The sample beads to be sorted were kept in suspension by continuous slow vortexing. The Elite settings were peak linear for forward scatter, FL1 and FL2, and logarithmic integral for side scatter. The gating for the sort included a forward scatter/side scatter region linked by “and” with an FL1/FL2 region. An FL1/FL2 region was chosen instead of a simple FL1 histogram region for better discrimination between FITC fluorescence versus autofluorescence of beads. The gating was set to select for isolation the highest fluorescent events amounting to about 0.3% of total events for STAT1t and 0.5% for STAT3, respectively. Event rate was held at about 100 beads/s. The beads were collected in tubes coated with 100% fetal calf serum for 1 h.Peptide SequencingLibrary beads were analyzed on a HP G1000A system (Hewlett-Packard). A newly optimized chemistry method, double couple 3.0, was used to enhance chemical efficiency, minimize lags, and increase yield. In the sample cartridge the biphasic column was modified. 20% of the packing material from the bottom part (SAX) of the column was removed to create enough space for the small polyvinylidene fluoride strips (Immobilon P, Millipore) on which the single bead was deposited for handling and analysis. Pool sequencing of the sorted library beads was performed as described above for single bead sequencing, except that about 650 beads were loaded in the sample cartridge. The results from pool sequencing were modified by a linear correction in cycles 2–12 for the observed lag from the previous cycle by forcing the contents to zero for all amino acids in cycle 6, the position of phosphotyrosine. The corrected amountC x,n (amino acid n at cycle X) was obtained from the original value A x,n by the formula: C x,n = A x,n −A x −1, n ×A 6, n /A 5, n. These values were normalized with the detected, lag-corrected amounts of each amino acid from sequencing the original and not the sorted library PL408-2br. Then the relative amounts of the amino acids of the pool were calculated for each cycle.Calculation of Probabilities for Common SequencesThe probability P(n) that in the three positions +1, +2, and +3 of the 54 sequences obtained from beads (Tables I and II), n sequences would be found per chance in common with the 17 different sequences in the same positions from natural docking sites (Table IV) is shown in Equation 1 and was calculated with software Mathematica4 (Wolfram, Inc.).

https://openalex.org/W2050318141,"Activation of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) inhibits cell growth and induces differentiation in both adipocyte and epithelial cell lineages, although it is unclear whether this occurs through common or cell-type specific mechanisms. We have identified four human colon cancer cell lines that do no undergo growth inhibition or induce markers of differentiation after exposure to PPARγ agonists. Sequence analysis of the PPARγ gene revealed that all four cell lines contain a previously unidentified point mutation in the ninth α-helix of the ligand binding domain at codon 422 (K422Q). The mutant receptor did not exhibit any defects in DNA binding or retinoid X receptor heterodimerization and was transcriptionally active in an artificial reporter assay. However, only retroviral transduction of the wild-type (WT), but not mutant, receptor could restore PPARγ ligand-induced growth inhibition and differentiation in resistant colon cancer cell lines. In contrast, there was no difference in the ability of fibroblast cells expressing WT or K422Q mutant receptor to undergo growth inhibition, express adipocyte differentiation markers, or uptake lipid after treatment with a PPARγ agonist. Finally, analysis of direct PPARγ target genes in colon cancer cells expressing the WT or K422Q mutant allele suggests that the mutation may disrupt the ability of PPARγ to repress the basal expression of a subset of genes in the absence of exogenous ligand. Collectively, these data argue that codon 422 may be a part of a co-factor(s) interaction domain necessary for PPARγ to induce terminal differentiation in epithelial, but not adipocyte, cell lineages and argues that the receptor induces growth inhibition and differentiation via cell lineage-specific mechanisms.

The induction of terminal cellular differentiation is a complex process requiring the initiation of a gene expression pattern that ultimately results in both cell cycle withdrawal and the expression of a set of proteins that are necessary to carry out the specialized function of the differentiated cell. Transcription factors often serve as driving forces for cellular differentiation. For example, muscle cell differentiation is critically dependent on the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (1Arnold H.H. Winter B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Expression of MyoD family members initiates a cascade of temporal-specific gene expression patterns ultimately leading to growth arrest and differentiation. Cancer is essentially a state of de-differentiation in which the malignant cells do not undergo the normal maturation process that leads to cessation of cell growth. The ability of transcription factors to initiate terminal differentiation pathways has been exploited as a form of differentiation therapy for cancer that can serve as an alternative to more toxic chemotherapeutic regimens. For example, ligand activation of the retinoic acid receptor α-promyelocytic leukemia fusion protein using all-trans retinoic acid has been successfully used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (2Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Miller Jr., W.H. Scheinberg D.A. Itri L.M. Hittelman W.N. Vyas R. Andreeff M. Tafuri A. Jakubowski A. et al.N. Engl. J.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, PPAR response element; RXT, retinoid X receptor; WT, wild-type; FBS, fetal bovine serum; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HA, hemagglutinin; luc, luciferase; CEA, carcino-embryonic antigen; PGJ2, prostaglandin J2. is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is capable of initiating terminal differentiation pathways. PPARγ and related subtypes PPARα and PPARδ are members of the nuclear hormone receptor gene superfamily (3Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar) that form functional heterodimers with members of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family of nuclear receptors (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). PPARs play fundamental roles in metabolic homeostasis, primarily as regulators of fatty acid storage and catabolism (5Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Putative endogenous ligands for PPARγ include both polyunsaturated fatty acids and the eicosanoids 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGJ2 (6Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), but their respective roles in PPARγ signaling in vivo remains unclear. High affinity synthetic ligands that selectively activate PPARγ include the thiazolidinediones, a class of insulin sensitizing drugs currently in use for the treatment of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus (9Willson T.M. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PPARγ appears to play a dominant role in the differentiation of adipocytes. Early experiments established that ectopic expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts resulted in conversion of the cells to adipocytes (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). More recent studies using mice null for the PPARγ gene have confirmed this essential role in adipogenesis (11Rosen E.D. Sarraf P. Troy A.E. Bradwin G. Moore K. Milstone D.S. Spiegelman B.M. Mortensen R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 12Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). The cellular response induced by PPARγ during adipogenesis involves both cell cycle withdrawal and the expression of lipogenic-related genes such as the fatty acid-binding protein aP2 (13Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The growth arrest pathway is characterized by a G1 cell cycle arrest and the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p18 and p21 (14Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). PPARγ has also been shown to restrict S phase entry by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of E2F/DP (15Altiok S. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that PPARγ can induce differentiation pathways beyond adipocytes. For example, activating ligands of PPARγ inhibit the proliferation rates of epithelial cells derived from breast, prostate, stomach, and lung (16Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M.

In the colon, levels of PPARγ mRNA are nearly equivalent to that found in adipocytes (20Fajas L. Auboeuf D. Raspe E. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Saladin R. Najib J. Laville M. Fruchart J.C. Deeb S.

Consistent with this expression pattern, exposure of cultured human colon cancer cells to PPARγ agonists induces growth inhibition associated with a delay in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and an increase in several markers of cellular differentiation (22Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S. Fletcher C. Spiegelman B.M. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 7: 7Google Scholar). Whether the anti-neoplastic, pro-differentiation effects of PPARγ ligands in the colon operate in vivo is not clear. Agonists of the receptor will reduce pre-malignant intestinal lesions in rats treated with the carcinogen azoxymethane (25Tanaka T. Kohno H. Yoshitani S. Takashima S. Okumura A. Murakami A. Hosokawa M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2424-2428PubMed Google Scholar) but slightly increase colon polyps in Adenomatous polyposis coli mutant mice that are predisposed to intestinal adenomas (26Saez E. Tontonoz P. Nelson M.C. Alvarez J.G. Ming U.T. Baird S.M. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 27Lefebvre A.M. Chen I. Desreumaux P. Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Geboes K. Briggs M. Heyman R. Auwerx J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, Sarraf et al. (28Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) have reported that 8% of primary colorectal tumors contained a loss of function point mutation in one allele of the PPARγ gene, emphasizing that the receptor is likely to have a tumor suppressive function in the colon. Four unique mutations in PPARγ were identified in the study; one resulted in a truncated protein that lacked the entire ligand binding domain whereas the other three mutations caused defects in the binding of either synthetic or natural ligands. Although activation of PPARγ will initiate pathways leading to growth arrest in both colon epithelial and adipocyte lineages, it is unknown whether this occurs through similar or distinct mechanisms. For example, in both cell types activation of the receptor eventually leads to a G1 arrest and an increase in cell-specific differentiation markers. Does this occur through the initial regulation of identical target genes in both cell types, and does PPARγ require common co-regulator interactions in both instances? Here we report the detection of an identical exonic mutation (K422Q) in the PPARγ gene in four distinct colon cancer cell lines that are refractory to the decrease in cell growth or increase in differentiation markers normally induced by activators of PPARγ. Only introduction of the WT, but not mutant, receptor was able to restore PPARγ ligand sensitivity in the resistant colon cancer cell lines. In contrast, there was no difference in the ability of WT or K422Q receptor to induce adipocyte differentiation. Analysis of direct PPARγ target genes in colon cancer cells expressing the WT or K422Q mutant allele suggests that the mutation may be non-functional because of an inability of the apo-receptor to basally repress certain target genes. These results argue that codon 422 may be a part of a co-factor(s) interaction domain necessary for PPARγ to induce terminal differentiation in epithelial, but not adipocyte, cell lineages. Receptor Ligands—All synthetic PPAR ligands were from GlaxoSmithKline and dissolved in Me2SO. 15-DeoxyΔ12,14-PGJ2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Cell Culture—The HCT 15, COLO 205, HCT 116, HT-29, and NIH 3T3 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. 293-EBNA cells were purchased from Invitrogen. The MOSER S cell line was a gift from M. Brattain (University of Texas Health Sciences, San Antonio, TX). The MIP 101 and Clone A cell lines were a gift from L. B. Chen (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The HCA-7 cell line was obtained from S. Kirkland (University of London, London, United Kingdom). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), l-glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with constant humidity. For all experiments in which a receptor ligand was added, cells were grown in the above media except regular 10% FBS was replaced with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (Hyclone). Plasmids—Full-length WT PPARγ was cloned into pBLUESCRIPT KS+. This was used as a template to generate PPARγ K422Q using oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis (Muta-Gene; Bio-Rad). Both WT and K422Q PPARγ were cloned into pCDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) for use in transient transfection and EMSA experiments. HA-tagged WT and K422Q PPARγ were generated by PCR using Pfu Turbo Taq polymerase (Stratagene) and the proper non-tagged cDNA as a template. The 5′ primer contained a XhoI site, the full-length HA epitope, and a partial region of PPARγ starting at codon 2. The 3′ primer contained a HpaI site and a partial region of PPARγ starting at codon 479 (stop codon). Each amplicon was digested and cloned into the XhoI/HpaI site of the retroviral expression vector pMSCVpuro (Clontech). All plasmids were sequenced to avoid unwanted mutations. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Centrifuged lysates (50 μg) from each cell line were fractionated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinlylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% powdered milk. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-HA antibody clone HA.11 (1:1000; Babco), monoclonal anti-PPARγ (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and monoclonal anti-keratin 18 and 20 antibodies (1:1000; NeoMarkers). This was followed by incubation with donkey anti-mouse horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:50,000 for 1 h. Detection of immunoreactive polypeptides was accomplished using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Mutation Detection—Mutations in the PPARγ gene in the COLO 205, MIP 101, and Clone A cell lines were detected using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing as described previously (28Sarraf P.

PPARγ mutations in the HCT 15, MOSER S, HT-29, HCT 116, and HCA-7 cell lines were detected by automated dideoxy sequence analysis of PCR products that span the coding region of PPARγ1 using primers sets described previously (30Yen C.J. Beamer B.A. Negri C. Silver K. Brown K.A. Yarnall D.P. Burns D.K. Roth J. Shuldiner A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Cell Growth Measurements—The day after initial seeding, cells were exposed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal stripped FBS and either 0.1% Me2SO or the indicated ligand. Cells were exposed to fresh medium and compound every 48 h. Cells were counted after 6 days of treatment using a Coulter counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—CV-1 cells (5.0 × 105/well in 24-well plates) were transfected with a mix containing 0.66 μg/ml PPRE3-tk-luciferase (PPRE3-tk-luc) (a gift of R. Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), 0.010 μg/ml pRL-SV40 (Promega), and 0.66 μg/ml pCNDA3.0/PPARγ WT or pCDNA3.0/PPARγ K422Q in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 h. HCT 15-pMSCV, HCT 15-PPARγ WT, or HCT 15-PPARγ K422Q cell lines were transfected with 0.66 μg/ml PPRE3-tk-luc, 0.010 μg/ml pRL-SV40, and 0.66 μg/ml pCDNA3.0. In each case, FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was added to the transfection mix at a lipid:DNA ratio of 3.5:1. The transfection mix was replaced with complete medium containing either vehicle or the indicated ligand. After 24–36 h, cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were determined using a luminometer (MGM Instruments) and normalized to the relative light units from Renilla luciferase using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). EMSA—EMSAs were done based on methods reported by Schulman et al. (31Schulman I.G. Shao G. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3483-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PPAR and RXR receptors were synthesized using a T7 Quick TNT in vitro transcription/translation kit (Promega). 1.0 μl of the PPAR receptor and 0.10, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.0 μl of RXRα were added to a final reaction buffer volume of 20 μl that contained 1× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 2.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 7.5% glycerol), 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.02 pmol of an 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a PPRE derived from the acyl-CoA oxidase promoter (GTCGACAGGGGACC AGGACA A AGGTCA CGTTCGGGAGT). After 20 min of incubation, the reactions were resolved on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels. Viral Infection of Cell Lines—Phoenix-Ampho cells (purchased from ATCC with prior approval of G. Nolan (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA)) were transiently transfected with pMSCVpuro, pMSCV/HAPPARγ WT, and pMSCV/HA-PPARγ K422Q using FuGENE 6 at a lipid:DNA ratio of 3.5:1. Approximately 72 h post-transfection, viral supernatants were collected, filtered, supplemented with 2 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma), and used to infect exponentially growing HCT 15 or NIH 3T3 cells. After 48 h, cells were split 1:5 into media containing 4 μg/ml (HCT 15 cells) or 2 μg/ml (NIH 3T3 cells) puromycin (Sigma) to select for infected cells. After selection, all stable cell lines were grown in media containing 2 μg/ml puromycin prior to any experiments. Flow Cytometry—HCT 15-pMSCV, HCT 15-PPARγ WT, and HCT 15-PPARγ K422Q cell lines were treated with 0.1% Me2SO or the indicated receptor ligand for 48 h. The DNA content of nuclei was determined by staining nuclear DNA with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) followed by measuring the relative DNA content of nuclei using a Facsort fluorescence-activated sorter (BD Biosciences). The proportion of nuclei in each phase of the cell cycle was determined using MODFIT DNA analysis software (BD Biosciences). Tumor Growth in Athymic Mice—Athymic mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal flanks with 5 × 106 cells of the HCT 15 cells expressing WT or K422Q PPARγ in a volume of 0.10 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Dosing was started 10–15 days post-injection for each cell line when the mean tumor volumes were ∼75 mm3. Mice were then orally gavaged five times/week with either vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose in 0.05 n HCl) or 10 mg/kg of rosiglitazone (in a total volume of 0.10 ml per mouse). Rosiglitazone was formulated daily by first dissolving the compound in 0.1 n HCL that had been pre-warmed to 40 °C followed by the addition of an equal volume of 1% methylcellulose. The size of each tumor was determined by direct measurement of tumor dimensions. The volume was calculated according to the equation (V = [L × W2] × 0.5), where V = volume, L = length, and W = width. Adipogenesis Assay—Virally infected NIH 3T3 cells were exposed at confluence to dexamethasone (1 μm) for 24 h followed by treatment with vehicle or rosiglitazone for 7 days with media changed every 48 h. Cells were then fixed and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma). Northern Hybridization Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (32Gupta R.A. Tan J. Krause W.F. Geraci M.W. Willson T.M. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13275-13280Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The indicated cell lines were treated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 2.0 μm rosiglitazone. Total RNA (20 μg) from each sample was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-NX nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were pre-hybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in Ultrahyb (Ambion). Hybridization was conducted in the same buffer in the presence of a 32P-radiolabeled cDNA fragment of the indicated gene. Blots were washed 4 × 15 min at 50 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and once for 30 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to a phosphorimager, screen and images were analyzed using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System and Optiquant software (Hewlitt-Packard). Synthesis of cDNA Probes for Northern Blots—A partial cDNA fragment for adipophilin was generated by PCR with M13 forward and reverse primers using a sequence-validated human IMAGE cDNA clone (Research Genetics) as a template. Partial cDNA fragments for Gob-4 and TSC-22 were generated using reverse transcriptase PCR and gene-specific primers corresponding to base pairs (each from the translational start site) 283–550 for Gob-4 and 1–425 for TSC-22. The template for these PCR reactions was a random primed cDNA library of MOSER S colon carcinoma cells treated with either 0.1% Me2SO or 1 μm rosiglitazone. The Gob-4 PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the TSC-22 product was cloned into pPCR-Script (Stratagene). All plasmids were sequenced to confirm gene identity. The aP2 cDNA fragment was obtained from Youfei Guan (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). PPARγ Ligand Sensitivity and PPARγ Gene Mutations in a Panel of Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines—In our initial survey of the biological response of human colorectal carcinoma cells to PPARγ agonists, we noticed that some cell lines were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of PPARγ ligands. A panel of eight cell lines (four sensitive and the four that were resistant) was chosen for further study. All eight cell lines expressed relatively equivalent levels of PPARγ protein (Fig. 1). The ability of the high affinity, PPARγ subtype-selective agonist rosiglitazone to induce growth inhibition in each of the eight lines was tested. Four of these cell lines (MOSER S, HCT 116, HCA-7, and HT-29) were growth-inhibited in the presence of a PPARγ agonist, whereas the other four (HCT 15, MIP 101, Clone A, and COLO 205) were not affected (Table I).Table IPPARγ ligand sensitivity and PPARγ receptor mutations in a panel of human colorectal cancer cell linesCell line% GrowthaCell lines were treated for 6 days with 0.1% Me2SO or 1.0 μm rosiglitazone, and the number of cells was counted using a Coulter counter.

Open table in a new tab There are a number of explanations for why a particular cell line could be resistant to activators of PPARγ despite expressing robust levels of the receptor. Because somatic loss of function mutations have been identified in a subset of colorectal tumors, we sought to determine whether PPARγ ligand resistance in the four cell lines could be because of a loss of function mutation in the PPARγ gene. All four resistant lines contained a monoallelic point mutation in the PPARγ gene at codon 422 resulting in a change from lysine (Lys) to glutamine (Gln) (K422Q); this mutation was not found in the four sensitive cell lines (Table I). The correlation between the K422Q allele and lack of sensitivity to PPARγ ligands provided suggestive, but not definitive, evidence that this mutation caused the HCT 15, MIP 101, Clone A, and COLO 205 cell lines to be resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of PPARγ ligands. Characterization of K422Q Mutant Allele—No previous studies documenting the sequence of the PPARγ gene in various malignancies or from individuals at risk for diabetes or obesity have reported mutations at codon 422 of the receptor. Lys-422 lies within the ninth α-helix (H9) of the ligand binding domain of the receptor. Crystallographic studies of PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers suggest a role for H9 in receptor dimerization (33Gampe R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, these studies found no direct role for Lys-422 in any polar interactions found at the dimer interface. X-ray crystallography of PPAR homodimers revealed Lys-422 to be located at the receptor surface and exposed to solvent, suggesting the possibility of involvement in co-factor interactions (Fig. 2A) (34Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Lys-422 is conserved in the PPARγ cDNAs from all species reported in the NCBI Entrez nucleotide data base, including the six different species shown in Fig. 2B. However, Lys-422 is not conserved in either PPARα or PPARδ, both of which encode a Gln at the homologous amino acid (Gln-413 and Gln-386, respectively) (Fig. 2B). Because codon 422 of PPARγ in the resistant cell lines is mutated to an amino acid (Gln) that is normally present in the homologous positions of WT PPARα and PPARδ, it is unlikely that the K422Q mutation disrupts an important structural interaction common to all three PPARs. In fact, it may be that the Lys at position 422 present in WT PPARγ is responsible for an interaction unique to the γ subtype. As no obvious function has been ascribed to Lys-422, we first characterized what effects the K422Q mutation might have on WT receptor activity. There was no difference in the DNA binding activity of WT PPARγ/RXRα or K422Q PPARγ/RXRα on a PPRE from the acyl-coA oxidase promoter (Fig. 2C). Identical results were observed using RXRβ and RXRγ (data not shown). Transcriptional activity was assayed in cells transfected with either receptor cDNA and the PPRE3-tk-luc reporter vector that contains a luciferase cDNA downstream of three tandem repeats of the PPRE from the acyl-coA oxidase gene (35Kliewer S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2046753939,"In single-chain insulins (SCIs), the C terminus of the insulin B-chain is contiguous with the N terminus of the A-chain, connected by a short bioengineered linker sequence. SCIs have been proposed to offer potential benefit for gene therapy of diabetes (Lee, H. C., Kim, S. J., Kim, K. S., Shin, H. C., and Yoon, J. W. (2000) Nature 408, 483–488) yet relatively little is known about their folding, intracellular transport, or secretion from mammalian cells. Because SCIs can be considered as mutant proinsulin (with selective shortening of the 35-amino acid connecting peptide that normally includes two sets of flanking dibasic residues), they offer insights into understanding the role of the connecting peptide in insulin biosynthesis. Herein we have explored the relationship of the linker sequence to SCI biosynthesis, folding, and intracellular transport in transiently transfected HEK293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells or in stably transfected AtT20 cells. Despite previous reports that direct linkage of B- and A-chains produces a structure isomorphous with authentic two-chain insulin, we find that constructs with short linkers tend to be synthesized at lower levels, with a significant fraction of molecules exhibiting improper disulfide bonding. Nevertheless, disulfide-mispaired isoforms from a number of different SCI constructs are secreted. While this suggests that a novel folded state goes unrecognized by secretory pathway quality control, we find that misfolded SCIs are detected at higher levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells with artificially activated unfolded protein response mediated by inducible overexpression of active ATF-6. Such a maneuver allows analysis of more seriously misfolded mutants with further foreshortening of the linker sequence or loss (by mutation) of the insulin interchain disulfide bonds.

Although information contained in the sequence of these chains is sufficient for formation of the native molecule (1Tang J.G. Tsou C.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2Hua Q.X. Chu Y.C. Jia W. Phillips N.F. Wang R.Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43443-43453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), insulin is normally synthesized in pancreatic β cells as a longer, single-chain prohormone (proinsulin) in which the B- and A-chains are linked via the “connecting peptide” (C-peptide),1 a 31-amino acid sequence flanked by dibasic amino acids (3Steiner D.F. Kemmler W. Clark J.L. Oyer P.E. Rubenstein A.H. Steiner D.F. Freinkel N. Handbook of Physiology. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1972: 175-198Google Scholar). Thus by definition within proinsulin, the C-peptide brings the B- and A-chains together such that initial folding and disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can occur intramolecularly (4Steiner D.F. Rubenstein A.H. Science. 1997; 277: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However it has been shown that, at least in vitro, simply linking the B- and A-chains together sequentially, without any C-peptide, also will result in a normally folded “miniproinsulin” (5Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bing X. Markussen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Burke G.T. Wang S.H. Wang R.Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It can be argued alternatively that the primary importance of the C-peptide spacer sequence is that it provides suitable flexibility for presenting the dibasic cleavage sites (4Steiner D.F. Rubenstein A.H. Science. 1997; 277: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for endoproteolysis by prohormone convertases (7Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Such cleavage is of enormous biological significance, since an insulin-like molecule in which the N terminus of the A-chain is tethered directly to the C terminus of the B-chain is devoid of activity on insulin receptors (because of inability of the B-chain C terminus to be displaced, thereby disturbing proper contact of other key residues with the receptor). Nevertheless, the fact that such a bioengineered “direct linkage” construct can traverse the secretory pathway of AtT20 cells, become stored in granules, and be released to the medium upon secretagogue stimulation (8Powell S.K. Orci L. Craik C.S. Moore H.P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in conjunction with the aforementioned findings (5Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bing X. Markussen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Burke G.T. Wang S.H. Wang R.Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), would seem to argue that a linker peptide is dispensable at least for achieving a native insulin protein structure. Single-chain insulins (SCIs) are insulin analogs in which the C-peptide of proinsulin has been replaced by an artificial linker peptide whose length and sequence is controlled by bioengineering. Unlike the direct linkage construct noted above, some SCI constructs clearly have potent biological activity on insulin receptors (9Lee H.C. Kim S.J. Kim K.S. Shin H.C. Yoon J.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), making these constructs of potential interest for gene therapy of type 1 diabetes where a replacement insulin gene might encode a product that does not require endoproteolytic activation for expression in non-β cells. (Such genetic manipulation seems reasonable given that C-peptide of proinsulin is not particularly well conserved during evolution (10Steiner D.F. Chan S.J. Welsh J.M. Kwok S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 463-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and is shorter in guinea pig by two residues, in duck by five residues, and in dog by eight residues (11Permutt M.A. Cooperstein S.J. Watkins D. The Islets of Langerhans. Academic Press, New York, NY1981: 75-95Crossref Google Scholar)). However, to our knowledge, there is only very limited information regarding the folding of SCIs in the context of the ER leading to intracellular transport and secretion from mammalian cells. In the course of recent studies on the role of B-chain point mutations in insulin trafficking in the secretory pathway (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we were surprised to discover that H10D, a point mutation that is known to improve the thermodynamic stability of insulin, nevertheless causes insulin disulfide bond mispairing in the ER of mammalian (and yeast) cells, underscoring differences in disulfide bond formation in vitro and in vivo (13Fassio A. Sitia R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have expanded our analysis to re-examine the role of the linker peptide on insulin biosynthesis. The evidence to be presented suggests that, contrary to previous beliefs, there is a requirement for a linker peptide in order for insulin to form all three native disulfide bonds in mammalian cells in vivo. As the presence of these disulfide bonds is required for full insulin potency (15Sieber P. Eisler K. Kamber B. Riniker B. Rittel W. Marki F. de Gasparo M. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hua Q.X. Gozani S.N. Chance R.E. Hoffmann J.A. Frank B.H. Weiss M.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), such an investigation provides new guidance for the design of SCIs for gene therapy of diabetes and also sheds light on the role of the C-peptide in insulin biosynthesis. Polyclonal anti-insulin was made in guinea pigs (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Secondary antibodies and peroxidase conjugates were from Jackson ImmunoLaboratories (West Grove, PA); Zysorbin was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and protein A-agarose was from Sigma. [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (Expre35S35S) were purchased from New England Nuclear (New Bedford, MA). Methionine/cysteine-deficient mammalian cell culture media, brefeldin A, and stock chemicals were from Sigma. The pRSV-InsDC plasmid (encoding a preproinsulin mutant in which the B-chain is directly contiguous with the A-chain, lacking any C-peptide) was obtained from Dr. H. P. Moore (University of California, Berkeley, CA), and this was subcloned to pcDNA3 and was used as double-stranded DNA template. All of the artificial linker sequences or other point mutations were prepared by PCR mutagenesis using the four-primer method. In brief one primer pair encodes a restriction site at one end and the desired mutation sequence at the other end. The second primer pair contains the desired mutation sequence encoded on the reverse orientation primer (21–24-base overlap in sequence with the first pair) and encodes a second restriction site at the opposite end. The PCR products of the first two rounds of PCR were then used as template for a final PCR reaction using the external flanking primers encoding the restriction sites, and this product was subcloned initially into the pGEM T-vector, sequenced for confirmation of each mutation, and finally subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. CHO-Lac cells (originally called CHO-3.6lac, which stably express the Lac-transactivator under control of the CMV immediate-early promoter) were obtained from Dr. M. G. Roth (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) (17Lucocq J. Manifava M. Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and maintained in the same medium plus 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Two plasmids, called pCGN.ATF61–373 (N-terminal HA tag) and pCGN-ATF61–670 were obtained from Dr. R. Prywes (Columbia University, New York, NY). The first of these plasmids encodes the peptide MASSYPYDVPDYASLGGPSR containing a single HA tag (underlined) immediately upstream of ATF6 residue 1 with a stop codon following residue 373 and a 3′-BamHI site beginning nine nucleotides downstream. However, upon sequencing of this construct we identified a point mutation encoding a M313I substitution. To correct the point mutation, we used pCGN-ATF61–670 as template and PCR-amplified a fragment from an internal KpnI site and a newly engineered TAG stop codon after amino acid 373 followed by BamHI, and we used this amplified product to replace the KpnI-BamHI fragment of ATF61–373 (N-terminal HA tag). Another PCR was performed to add 5′-NotI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites flanking the insert. Finally, a NotI-XhoI digest allowed subcloning the corrected ATF61–373(N-terminal HA tag) into pCMV3RLuc in which the luciferase insert was excised by NotI-XhoI digestion. This plasmid contains 450 bases of repeated Lac repressor binding sites immediately downstream of the CMV promoter and upstream of the inserted cDNA of interest. The final plasmid called pCMV3R.HA-ATF6cyt was transfected into CHO-Lac cells, and stable clones were selected with G418 at 800 μg/ml. The clone used in these experiments, CLA14, is characterized more fully in a forthcoming study. 2J. Ramos-Castañeda, M. Liu, P. Arvan, manuscript in preparation. HEK293 cells and CHO cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. AtT20 cells were grown in the same medium plus 10% NuSerum (BD Biosciences). CLA14-CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5.5 mm glucose) plus 400 μg/ml G418 and 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA 1 day after seeding (at ∼70% confluence) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in OptiMEM for 5 h at 37 °C and then recovered overnight in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, with a change to normal growth medium at 20–24 h and assays of protein expression at 40–48 h. Cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium and chased in complete medium for the times indicated. Where indicated, brefeldin A (BFA) was included during labeling and chase at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. At the end of the chase, medium was collected and the cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Cell lysates and chase media were treated with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), precleared with Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with guinea pig anti-insulin plus additional Zysorbin. Immunocomplexes were sedimented at 12,000 ×g for 1 min, and pellets were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and once in high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4). The samples were then analyzed by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE system (18Schagger H. vonJagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) with previously noted modifications (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); samples were allowed to enter the gel at 50 V for 1 h and then run at 100 V overnight without cooling. (As described previously, the gel solutions were not routinely de-gassed before use (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, after the experiments for this paper were completed we discovered that a small but variable degree of thiol reoxidation can occur in vitro for our samples during the running of the gel itself, and this can be effectively decreased by de-gassing the gel solutions.) Insulin gels were fixed initially in 20% trichloroacetic acid without alcohol, then in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid plus 50% methanol, then incubated briefly with water, and finally either phosphorimaged or incubated with 1m sodium salicylate for 20 min and exposed to XAR film at −70 °C. It has been reported that the insulin B-chain guides folding and disulfide bond formation within the A-chain (19Hua Q.X. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Hu S.Q. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12299-12311Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Guo Z.Y. Shen L. Feng Y.M.

Nevertheless, we found surprising the recent result that certain B-chain point mutations, including ones known to provide thermodynamic stability to insulin that has been folded in vitro (such a substitution of insulin HisB10 by Asp), induce insulin disulfide mispairing within the secretory pathway in vivo (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we have primarily used analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE to assess insulin disulfide maturation, which is generally recognized to occur within the endoplasmic reticulum (22Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20417-20423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), focusing primarily on the length of the linker peptide contained within SCIs. In an initial series of constructs, we created “artificial C-peptides” from five to nine residues in which the linker sequence begins and ends with a Met residue, flanking a stretch of glycine residues. When these SCI constructs were expressed in transiently transfected 293 cells, they exhibited nearly ideal behavior under nonreducing and reducing conditions, although the migration was slower (higher) under reducing conditions, reflecting a more open rod-like conformation expected in SDS-PAGE upon dissolution of the disulfide bonds (right half of each gel shown in Fig.1). We prepared additional constructs in which the linker sequence was foreshortened either to four, three, or two Gly residues or in which the B-chain had direct linkage to A-chain with no linker whatsoever. The SCI constructs with short Gly-containing linkers showed diminished incorporation of [35S]Met/Cys label at least in part because of absence of methionines from the linker sequence; however, it was clear that these constructs were also synthesized at low levels, as indicated by the fact that even direct linkage of B- and A-chains with no C-peptide showed a reproducibly stronger signal upon transient expression (left half of each gel shown in Fig. 1). Moreover, while each of the foreshortened linker constructs showed nearly ideal behavior under reducing conditions, they showed a far more complex pattern, with more than one band of anomalous mobility (indicating non-ideal behavior) under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). These data are highly reminiscent of disulfide mispairing observed upon introduction of B-chain point mutations in SCIs or proinsulin (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although not exhaustively explored in this study, when the linker was short, small sequence changes did affect the nonreducing SDS-PAGE mobility of the predominant isoform of insulin. As shown in Fig.2, an MGGM tetrapeptide linker resulted in most SCI molecules migrating with a mobility that was only slightly slower (higher) than authentic insulin (either biosynthetically labeled from βTC-3 cells or iodinated standard), whereas an SCI with the GGGG tetrapeptide linker (in addition to being synthesized weakly) was higher still, despite a virtually identical molecular mass. On the one hand, some of the slower nonreducing SDS-PAGE mobility of SCIs could be directly attributed to the presence of the linker peptide, as demonstrated by an experiment in which an immunoprecipitated SCI bearing a nine-residue linker sequence was either partially digested or not digested with CNBr (Fig.3). Without CNBr digestion, the reduced SCI shifts up (to a slower mobility), precisely as in Fig. 1. After partial CNBr digestion, two bands are recovered upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE: the upper band precisely co-migrates with the undigested species, while the lower band precisely co-migrates with the two-chain insulin standard (lane marked I). Upon reduction with DTT, the upper band co-migrating with undigested SCI shifts up whereas the lower band co-migrating with two-chain insulin shifts down (in Fig. 3, the identical gel exposure is shown twice; on the left are the original data, while the right shows superimposedarrows clarifying this interpretation). The upward shift of the upper band is consistent with disulfide reduction allowing the uncleaved SCI protein to assume a rod-like open conformation, whereas the downward shift of the lower band is consistent with dissociation of the two chains from the cleaved SCI (as is also shown in Fig. 3 for authentic insulin standard). Thus, for SCIs shown with linkers longer than four or five residues (such as in Fig. 3), the difference in mobility on nonreducing SDS-PAGE from that of authentic two-chain insulin can be attributed entirely to the presence of the linker itself, without invoking any insulin structural perturbation. On the other hand, for direct linkage of the B- and A-chains (Fig. 2), it appeared that the slow (high) mobility observed for the major species could only be explained by disulfide malformation. We considered the possibility that upon shortening the C-peptide, one or more insulin disulfide bonds might fail to form (resulting in free thiols) versus actual disulfide mispairing. Previously we found that introduction of selected B-chain point mutations caused similar abnormal upward mobility shifting upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE but without reactivity to alkylating agents that modify free thiols (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this report, using an SCI with a seven-residue linker as template, we elected to individually mutate each of the three conserved cysteine pairs in the hopes of identifying their relative contributions to protein biosynthesis, secretion, and especially to nonreducing SDS-PAGE mobility. Loss of the insulin disulfide bond between the sixth and eleventh positions of the A-chain by mutation of these Cys residues to Ser (C43S, C48S) caused no loss of recombinant protein production, no loss of recombinant protein secretion and no detectable mobility shift of the predominant insulin species identified by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.4A). By contrast, deletion of the disulfide normally existing between B-chain residue 19 and A-chain residue 20 (Fig. 4B, C19S, C56S) caused decreased production of the recombinant protein, being retained intracellularly rather than being secreted, as well as a slower (higher) SCI band mobility by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The foregoing data demonstrate that presence of the intra-A-chain disulfide bond is not required for formation of the fast-migrating compact form detected electrophoretically nor in secretion of the SCI; however, it must be emphasized that this does not exclude that A6 or A11 might be involved in disulfide mispairing for SCIs bearing a foreshortened C-peptide (23Qiao Z.S. Guo Z.Y. Feng Y.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2662-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By contrast, the B19-A20 disulfide bond is important for protein biosynthesis, formation of the compact form detected electrophoretically, and secretion. (As described further (below), the B7-A7 disulfide bond is also important for protein biosynthesis and secretion.) We examined secretory kinetics both for an SCI bearing a seven-residue linker and apparently normal disulfide bonding and for an SCI bearing direct linkage of B- and A-chains with apparent disulfide mispairing (see Figs. 1 and 2). In pulse-chase experiments with35S-labeled amino acids, both newly synthesized constructs showed an apparent secretory half-time of 30 min (Fig.5A). At 3 h of chase, ∼90% of both constructs had been secreted, whereas no secretion of either construct was detected at this time in cells treated with brefeldin A (Fig. 5B). The data indicate that both the properly and improperly disulfide bonded forms of SCI traverse the secretory pathway of 293 cells. Identical results were also obtained in CHO cells (and AtT20 cells, see below). Several SCI constructs bearing different linkers were exposed to in vitro disulfide reshuffling conditions using a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione at a 10:1 ratio. In Fig. 6A, an SCI with a nine-residue linker (that is potently bioactive on insulin receptors) 3M. Liu and P. Arvan, manuscript in preparation. was compared with direct linkage of B- and A-chains. After exposure to the glutathione mixture, the SCI with a nine-residue linker showed relatively modest changes in mobility upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, whereas for the direct linkage, the major species refolded to a form with a substantially faster gel mobility. This downward mobility shift of the directly linked chains does not reflect a proteolytic cleavage between B- and A-chains because upon re-reduction of the product with 100 mm DTT the predominant species once again shifted back to a slower migrating form, similar to the behavior of the control SCI with a nine-residue linker (Fig. 6A, last two lanes). A modification of the direct linkage construct was also tested in which Thr-30 of the B-chain was replaced with methionine. (Cleavage with CNBr to yield a two-chain form of the B30Met direct linkage construct (not shown) yields a nonreduced band with persistently slower mobility from that of authentic two-chain insulin despite virtual amino acid identity providing further confirmation that the anomalous gel mobility stems from disulfide mispairing.) The T30M mutation caused essentially no change in the dramatic ability of the direct linkage construct to reshuffle its disulfide bonds to the more compact form or to reduce them subsequently with DTT (Fig. 6B). In addition, as shown in Fig. 6B, disulfide reshuffling conditions did not show such dramatic mobility changes for the SCI bearing a seven-residue linker with deletion of the A6-A11 disulfide bond (a construct first introduced in Fig. 4A), further supporting the idea that the two interchain disulfide bonds formed properly despite absence of the intra-A-chain disulfide. One might expect that unlike the disulfide reshuffling conditions provided by a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione, creation of free sulfhydryl groups in SCIs by reduction with DTT, followed by addition of iodoacetamide (IAA) to irreversibly modify those sulfhydryls, would result exclusively in reduced and carboxymethylated SCIs with no possibility of disulfide re-formation. However, for some cysteine-containing polypeptides it has been shown that upon addition of alkylating agent, thiol-disulfide rearrangement occurs on the same time scale as alkylation; thus, a kinetic competition exists between the two reactions (24Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 25Chang J.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, we recently reported that in vitro reshuffling of insulin disulfide bonds in some SCIs occurs for a fraction of the molecules upon adding IAA immediately after DTT treatment (12Zhang B.-y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the main gel of Fig.7, cells bearing either the direct linkage construct or the presence of four- or seven-residue linkers underwent pulse-chase (1 h label, 1 h chase) with both cell lysate and chase media collected. While the production of the SCI bearing a four-residue (-GGGG-) linker was poor as before, the protein encoded by each construct was secreted. Each sample was then split in half and boiled in SDS gel sample buffer containing or not containing 20 mm DTT, and this was followed by incubation with 50 mm IAA for 30 min at 37 °C. The SCI bearing a seven-residue linker appeared as if it were only partially reduced, trifurcating into three major species, the lowest (fastest) of which co-migrated with the original samples that had been treated with IAA only. However, despite the appearance of partial reduction, this more likely represents complete reduction followed by re-formation of disulfide bonds in a fraction of the molecules as both the four-residue linker and direct linkage constructs also trifurcated after DTT/IAA treatments, in this case clearly reoxidizing in part to species more compact (faster migrating) than those contained in the original samples. In a separate experiment shown in the two lanes on theright of Fig. 7, we found that after the trifurcation of the species from the direct linkage construct following reduction in DTT and partial reoxidation in IAA (lane marked D/I, with a result identical to that shown in the main gel forDTT/IAA treatments), the faster migrating forms shifted back yet again to a slower migrating form upon re-reduction with 100 mm DTT. Taken together, the foregoing data (Figs.6 and 7) provide definite proof that the anomalous mobility"

This iron-dependent degradation requires the presence of a 73-residue degradation domain, but its functions have not yet been established. We now show that the domain can act as an iron sensor, mediating its own covalent modification. The domain forms an iron-binding site with three cysteine residues located in the middle of the domain. It then reacts with molecular oxygen to generate a reactive oxidizing species at the iron-binding site. One cysteine residue is oxidized to dehydrocysteine and other products.

In mammals, the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)1 mediate the coordinate expression of proteins that participate in iron metabolism (1Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). When iron stores are low, the IRPs bind to an RNA stem-loop structure known as an iron-responsive element (IRE) located in either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated region of mRNA. If the IRE is close to the cap site, binding of the IRP blocks initiation of translation, causing a decrease in the level of the protein encoded by that mRNA. Conversely, when the IRE is located in the 3′-untranslated region of the transferrin receptor transcript, binding of the IRP stabilizes the mRNA by decreasing susceptibility to nuclease attack, causing an increase in the level of the protein encoded by the mRNA (3Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mammals have two known IRPs, IRP1 and IRP2, with the tissue roles of each still being defined. IRP1 contains an iron-sulfur center, whereas IRP2 does not. The general mechanism by which each IRP is regulated is distinct (1Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When cellular iron stores are low, IRP1 lacks a functional iron-sulfur center and binds to its IRE targets. When iron stores are sufficient, IRP1 regains its full iron-sulfur center, loses the ability to bind to IRE, and functions as a cytosolic aconitase. The cellular levels of IRP1 are unaffected by iron status in most cell types. In contrast, IRP2 protein and IRE binding activity are readily detected when iron stores are limited but are low or absent when iron stores are sufficient (4Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The decrease in IRP2 protein occurs as a consequence of rapid degradation by the proteasome; synthesis of the protein is constitutive and does not vary substantially with iron status. The sequences of the two IRPs are similar except that IRP2 contains one domain not present in IRP1, and this domain is both required and sufficient to confer susceptibility to iron-dependent degradation. Deletion of the degradation domain produces an IRP2 whose levels no longer vary with iron status. Conversely, insertion of the degradation domain into IRP1 renders it susceptible to iron-triggered degradation (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We showed previously that IRP2 is oxidatively modified and ubiquitinylated in vivo, after which it is degraded by the proteasome (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The oxidation requires oxygen and leads to the introduction of carbonyl groups into the protein, a hallmark of site-specific, metal-catalyzed oxidations (7Levine R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The oxidative modification of IRP2 is also mediated in vitro by a model metal-catalyzed oxidation system consisting simply of a reducing agent (dithiothreitol (DTT)), oxygen, and a redox-cycling cation (iron) (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The in vitro oxidatively modified IRP2 is a substrate for ubiquitinylation, whereas the native form is not. Oxidative modifications are capable of converting native proteins from proteasome-resistant to proteasome-sensitive substrates. For example, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is oxidized at prolines to generate hydroxyproline (8Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The reaction is mediated by an iron- and oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase that functions as an oxygen sensor. Metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins may also occur non-enzymically, and the modified proteins are usually much more susceptible to digestion by the proteasome (11Rivett A.J. Levine R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In metal-catalyzed oxidation, the residue that is modified lies at or very near a binding site for the divalent cation, supporting site-specific generation of a reactive oxidizing species (12Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). All amino acids are susceptible to metal-catalyzed oxidation of their side chains, but histidine, arginine, lysine, and proline are particularly sensitive. We hypothesized that the degradation domain of IRP2 contains an iron-binding site that has evolved to mediate its oxidative modification when both iron and oxygen are present. We found that this was the case and that the covalently modified residue was a cysteine. Oxidation generated multiple products, including dehydrocysteine and aminomalonic acid, the shorter homologue of aspartic acid. Full-length IRP2 with a C-terminal Myc tag was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified with an RNA affinity column as described (13Allerson C.R. Martinez A. Yikilmaz E. Rouault T.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the 63-residue peptide (P138–200) was obtained by PCR using 5′-ggagaattccatatggcaatacagaatgcaccaaatcc-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-cgaggatccctacaggatgggtgtattctcaatc-3′ as the reverse primer. It was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the NdeI and BamHI sites. Site-specific mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All three single cysteine to alanine mutants were constructed, C168A, C174A, and C178A. Then all three combinations of double mutants were constructed along with the triple mutant with the three cysteines changed to alanines. Wild-type or mutant plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Each construct was sequenced to confirm that the desired sequence was obtained. For expression the constructs were transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) (Novagen) and induced by 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 15 min. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and debris was removed by centrifugation, again at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The peptide was concentrated and partially purified by precipitation with 70% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in 1m ammonium sulfate and centrifuged again. The supernatant was applied to a phenyl-5PW column, 0.75 × 7.5 cm (Tosoh Biosep, Montgomeryville, PA), which was equilibrated with 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1 m ammonium sulfate. A decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient, 1 to 0 m, eluted the bound material. Fractions containing the IRP2 peptide were identified by 18% acrylamide SDS-PAGE electrophoresis or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). These were applied to a C18 reverse-phase column (Vydac 218TP5205, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was accomplished with a linear gradient of acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, increased at 1%/min. Fractions containing the recombinant peptide were pooled, dried by vacuum centrifugation (Savant SpeedVac, Holbrook, NY), dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, 6 m guanidine HCl, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 7.2, and then dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Masses of the wild-type and mutant peptides were measured by electrospray mass spectrometry (Agilent 1100 series HPLC-MSD, Palo Alto, CA). Measured masses were within 0.6 atomic mass units of that calculated from the sequence. We also determined the cysteine content by amino acid analysis of the alkylated peptide with and without treatment with DTT. These were the same, confirming that the cysteines were fully reduced. As in our earlier study (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), full-length IRP2 or recombinant peptide was oxidatively modified by exposure to a model metal-catalyzed oxidation system consisting of iron, DTT, and oxygen from air. Except when indicated otherwise, 30 μm peptide was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.2, in room air with 10 mm DTT and 5 μm ferric chloride. The reaction was stopped by the addition of the chelator diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid to 2 mm. Anaerobic experiments were conducted in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products 7150–000, Grass Lake, MI) in an atmosphere of 97% nitrogen, 3% hydrogen. Oxygen content was ≤1ppm. Protein or peptide were alkylated by making the solution 6m in guanidine HCl (by the addition of 1 gm/ml solid), 5 mm DTT, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Incubation at 37 °C for 30 min assured reduction of disulfides, and then iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. After 30 min of additional incubation, excess alkylating agent was scavenged by adding an additional 10 mm DTT and allowing the solution to stand for 5 min. If the protein or peptide was not alkylated, reduction of thiols was accomplished by incubation with 2 mmTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 37 °C for 30 min followed by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2–3 before HPLC-mass spectral analysis. Peptides were alkylated and then desalted with C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) before amino acid analysis. Alkaline hydrolysis in 5 m NaOH, 3% thiodiglycol was carried out at 155 °C for 45 min (14Levine R.L. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 236: 499-502Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After cooling, the solution was neutralized with 25% acetic acid. Acid hydrolysis and amino acid analyses were performed as described (15Reddy V.Y. Desrochers P.E. Pizzo S.V. Gonias S.L. Sahakian J.A. Levine R.L. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4683-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyamidomethylcysteine was converted to carboxymethylcysteine during the acid hydrolysis, and the latter is known to be partially degraded during hydrolysis. The average loss in 30 separate analyses of native peptide was 21%, similar to the 15% that we measured for the cysteines in the proteins lysozyme and glutamine synthetase. To correct for the loss, we normalized the value obtained with native peptide to the expected value of 3.0. The measured mass of the native, alkylated peptide was equal to that calculated from its sequence, confirming that three cysteines were present per peptide molecule. Lys-C (Wako, Richmond, VA) digestion was performed at 37 °C in 50–100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, in the presence of 0.5–1.0 mm EDTA using a 1:40–1:50 ratio of enzyme to protein or peptide. The reaction was stopped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid. Before application to the reverse phase column (Vydac 218TP5205, Hesperia, CA), the solution was made 6 m in guanidine HCl by the addition of 1 g/ml solid salt. To avoid suppression of the mass spectrometer by the guanidine, the sample was applied to the column with an HPLC pump separate from the analytical HPLC-mass spectrometer. Chromatographic separation and electrospray mass spectrometry were performed as previously described (16Taggart C. Cervantes-Laurean D. Kim G. McElvaney N.G. Wehr N. Moss J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27258-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectra were deconvoluted with the software provided by the instrument manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, Chemstation Version 9). Total recovery of recombinant peptide and products was calculated from the area of the chromatogram at 210 nm, and recovery of the native form was calculated from its absolute abundance in the total ion chromatogram. For sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry, full-length IRP2 was allowed to undergo oxidative modification at 4 °C, alkylated, and then digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. The loop peptide was purified by reverse phase chromatography and then digested with trypsin, with the progress monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Digestion conditions were the same as for Lys-C except that 1 mmammonium carbonate replaced Tris/EDTA as the buffer to facilitate the MALDI-TOF monitoring. When intermediate peptides appeared, the reaction was stopped by acidification, and the resultant peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography as described above. The purified peptides were subjected to sequencing by tandem mass spectroscopy on a Micromass QTOF2 mass spectrometer equipped with their CapLC (Waters, Milford, MA). Data were processed with the Micromass MassLynx and MaxEnt software. We showed earlier that a model metal-catalyzed oxidation system (iron/DTT/oxygen) was capable of oxidatively modifying the full-length IRP2, rendering it susceptible to ubiquitinylation (6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We have now utilized this model system in studies aimed at determining the site of oxidative modification. The ∼110,000-Da protein was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C to generate a peptide collection for mapping by reverse phase HPLC and mass spectroscopy. In a protein as large as IRP2, covalent modifications may be difficult to detect because of the complexity of its peptide map. However, the UV chromatogram did reveal one peak that consistently changed upon exposure to the complete iron oxidizing system (Fig. 1), but not if iron or oxygen were omitted nor if the chelator DPTA was added. The mass spectrum of the peak from non-oxidized protein showed a peptide of mass 5629.8, identifying it as peptide P165–216 (calculated mass = 5630.4), overlapping part of the 73-residue degradation domain encompassing residues 137–209 (5Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Edman sequencing confirmed the identification. The gradient for the chromatogram in Fig. 1 was optimized to separate this degradation domain peptide from others, although it still co-eluted with P697–714 (measured mass = 2173.1; calculated = 2173.5). Nevertheless, the peptide map of IRP2 exposed to 1 μm iron, 10 mm DTT, air clearly showed a shoulder that eluted earlier than the main peak. The mass of the peptide in the shoulder was 5627.7, whereas those in the main peak were 5629.7 and 2173.1. Thus, the model metal-catalyzed oxidation system induced a covalent modification with a mass decrease of 2 atomic mass units. This was not due to disulfide formation because the Lys-C peptide digest was reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine or DTT before injection into the HPLC. When cysteine is alkylated with iodoacetamide the resulting carboxyamidomethylcysteine gains 57 atomic mass units. Alkylation of IRP2 should convert the degradation peptide P165–216 from mass 5630.4 to mass 5858.6 because it contains 4 cysteines. The measured mass of the native IRP2 was 5858.2, whereas that of the modified peptide was 5799.3. This is 59 atomic mass units less than the native peptide. This deficit implies that the oxidized residue can no longer be alkylated by iodoacetamide. Further characterization of the iron-dependent modification was hampered by the difficulty of obtaining sufficient material from the full-length IRP2. Increasing the concentration of iron or the time of exposure to the oxidizing system led to poor recovery of the degradation peptide, perhaps because of aggregation of the oxidized products (see “Discussion”). In addition, the peptide of interest constitutes only 5% of the total IRP2. We therefore produced a recombinant peptide with the sequence of residues 138–200 from the degradation domain, including the 3 cysteine residues in the middle of the domain. It was purified to homogeneity as assessed by SDS gel electrophoresis, reverse phase chromatography, and both MALDI-TOF and electrospray mass spectrometry. Exposure of this peptide to the iron/DTT/oxygen model system induced the same changes as observed in the full-length IRP2. Recovery of material was typically 93–95% in one major peak and ∼2% in a small peak eluting 2–3 min before the major peak. Before exposure to the oxidizing system the mass spectrum was homogeneous with the mass that of the native peptide. After exposure, the mass spectrum became heterogeneous, containing both residual native peptide and products. The most prominent product, representing ∼5% of the starting material, was again 59 atomic mass units less than the native peptide when alkylated (native = 6694 atomic mass units; modified = 6635 atomic mass units) and 1–2 atomic mass units less when not alkylated. 2With the recombinant peptide the native and oxidatively modified forms coelute from the HPLC whether alkylated or not. The mass resolution of our mass spectrometer is not sufficient to reproducibly resolve the two peptides when not alkylated (native = 6523.4; modified = 6521.4) so that we usually observed a single, weighted average of the two masses. As with the full-length protein, these results indicate that oxidative modification converts a cysteine to a product that is 2 atomic mass units less than cysteine and which can no longer be alkylated by iodoacetamide. Although the mass spectrum became heterogeneous, the native form was always readily deconvoluted so that we could determine the fraction of the peptide that was still native. After a 2-h exposure to the oxidizing system, virtually all of the peptide was modified. Amino acid analysis of this and the native peptide confirmed the loss of one cysteine; no other modifications were detected (TableI). Loss of the cysteine residue required only micromolar concentrations of iron (TableII). Examination of the time course of the oxidation revealed that loss of the native mass coincided with loss of the cysteine residue (Fig. 2). Neither loss of cysteine nor change in mass occurred if the incubation was performed anaerobically nor if iron was chelated by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (see Table IV). Thus, the IRP2 degradation domain is susceptible to iron and oxygen-dependent oxidative modification of a cysteine residue.Table IAmino acid analysis of recombinant peptideResidueTheoryControlOxidizedNormalized ratioAsp66.186.401.062Glu76.766.611.003Cys33.002.210.758Ser66.155.960.995Gly99.729.741.028Thr44.064.021.017Arg32.943.021.055Ala33.133.091.016Val10.890.840.971Phe11.151.131.004Ile32.412.441.038Leu65.595.741.054Mean1.000S.D.0.081Mean −2 S.D.0.838Mean +2 S.D.1.162We analyzed the results by ratio normalization as described (11Rivett A.J.

The efficiency of direct oxidation of cysteine was high, as shown in Fig. 2. However, close examination of the chromatogram of the peptide exposed to the iron-oxidation system revealed a small peak eluting ∼3 min earlier than the major peak, whose area was ∼2% of the area of the major peak. Although this peak was thus barely visible in the UV chromatogram, the mass spectrometer readily established the identity of peptides in the peak (Table III). They resulted from cleavage of the parent peptide on the amino side of each cysteine. This observation establishes that the three cysteine residues are located at the site of free-radical generation, and thus, likely participate in the binding of iron. In addition to cleavage at each cysteine residue, the peptide bonds at Lys-160 and Lys-165 were also susceptible to hydrolysis, indicating that they are also at or near the iron-binding site. In the course of purifying IRP2 from rat liver, Guoet al. (17Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted the presence of two forms, ∼104-kDa full-length and 83 kDa. The lower molecular mass form was sequenced and found be the product of clipping between Ser-192 and Gln-193, which we have not yet observed in our studies of the recombinant peptide.Table IIIPeptides formed by oxidative cleavageObserved massResiduesC-terminal amidationCalculated massCleavage site3,064.5138–167Yes3,064.6Pro-167–Cys-1683,768.4138–173Yes3,768.4Thr-173–Cys-1744,228.7138–177Yes4,228.9Ser-177–Cys-1782,146.1138–159No2,146.4Leu-159–Lys-1602,727.1138–164No2,727.2Lys-164–Lys-165Masses were determined by deconvolution of the spectra from the total ion chromatogram. Open table in a new tab Masses were determined by deconvolution of the spectra from the total ion chromatogram. For cleavage at each of the three cysteine residues, the masses of the product peptides were 1 atomic mass unit less than would occur with simple peptide bond hydrolysis. This is the expected result for peptide bond cleavage by reactive oxygen species after the α-amidation mechanism (18Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Colton C. Gilbert D.J. Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Systems. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 657-675Google Scholar), likely proceeding through formation of dehydrocysteine followed by peptide bond cleavage (19Patchornik A. Solar S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1206-1212Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Patchornik A. Solar S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1212-1217Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the lysines gave peptides with masses expected for peptide bond hydrolysis, indicating cleavage via a mechanism other than α-amidation (10Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The model metal-catalyzed oxidation system consists of micromolar concentrations of iron, oxygen from air, and millimolar concentrations of DTT. We investigated whether all were necessary for oxidation of the peptide (Table IV). Oxygen and iron are required for the reaction. DTT is not required, although its presence stimulated the reaction. To assess the function of the cysteine residues, we constructed site-specific mutants in which all combinations of one, two, or all three cysteine residues were changed to alanine. The seven mutants were tested for susceptibility to iron-mediated modification. Mutation of 1 cysteine decreased the rate of oxidative modification by over 50%, and mutation of 2 cysteines decreased the rate even further (Fig. 3). There was no detectable difference in susceptibility among the single mutants nor the double mutants, again consistent with the suggestion that all three cysteine residues chelate the iron cation. The triple mutant has no cysteine residues, and only the native mass was detected in the main peak after exposure to the metal-catalyzed oxidation system. However, ∼1% iron-dependent peptide bond cleavage could still be observed. The cleavage sites included Lys-160 and Lys-165, as in the wild-type peptide (Table III). We occasionally observed cleavage at other residues as well, most commonly between Phe-190 and Ser-191. We hypothesized that the initial step in the oxidative modification would be conversion of cysteine to dehydrocysteine (Fig. 4), which incidentally is also 2 atomic mass units less than cysteine. The alkene form of dehydrocysteine is a thiol, which would be alkylated by iodoacetamide (21Baldwin J.E. Bradley M. Adlington R.M. Norris W.J. Turner N.J. Tetrahedron. 1991; 47: 457-480Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When we followed the time course of a tryptic digestion of the alkylated, oxidatively modified peptide, we detected partially digested peptides that were 2 atomic mass units less than the mass calculated for the native peptide. These were not seen when the digestion went to completion, generating relatively low molecular weight final products. This observation suggested that dehydrocysteine might be relatively stable in a larger peptide but not in smaller ones. We therefore performed a partial tryptic digestion of the alkylated, oxidatively modified peptide. Products were separated by reverse phase chromatography and then subjected to"

Here we report the purification to homogeneity of the yeast CCR4 protein and the analysis of its substrate specificities. CCR4 deadenylated a 7N+23A substrate (seven nucleotides followed by 23 A residues) in a distributive manner. Only small differences in CCR4 activity for different A length substrates were observed until only 1 A residue remained. Correspondingly, the Km for a 25N+2A substrate was found to be at least 20-fold lower than that for a 26N+1A substrate, although their Vmax values differed by only 2-fold. In addition, the total length of the RNA was found to contribute to CCR4 activity: up to 17 nucleotides (not necessarily poly(A)) could be recognized by CCR4. Poly(U), poly(C), and poly(G) were also found to be 12–30-fold better inhibitors of CCR4 compared with poly(A), supporting the observation that CCR4 contains a non-poly(A)-specific binding site. Surprisingly, even longer substrates (≥45 nucleotides) stimulated CCR4 to become a processive enzyme, suggesting that CCR4 undergoes an additional transition in the presence of such substrates. CCR4 also displayed no difference in its activity with capped or uncapped RNA substrates. These results indicate that CCR4 recognition of its RNA substrates involves several features of the RNA that could be sites in vivo for controlling the rate of specific mRNA deadenylation.

These results indicate that CCR4 recognition of its RNA substrates involves several features of the RNA that could be sites in vivo for controlling the rate of specific mRNA deadenylation. leucine-rich repeat The regulation of eukaryotic gene expression occurs at multiple levels, including the control of mRNA stability. The poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of eukaryotic mRNA plays a major role in controlling mRNA and protein levels (1Zhao J. Hyman L Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, deadenylation of the poly(A) tail is the first step required for decapping and 5′ to 3′ degradation of the mRNA sequence (2Colgan D.F. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 3Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Not only does rapid deadenylation lead to degradation of the mRNA and the shutoff of protein synthesis, but deadenylation itself reduces the efficiency of translation of mRNA (4Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In yeast, mRNAs are deadenylated by first shortening the poly(A) tail to ∼15 nucleotides, after which the 5′-cap is removed. Sequences within the RNA body play a role in controlling the rate of poly(A) removal as well astrans-acting proteins, including presumably the deadenylase itself (5Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 6Muhlrad D. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2100-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In yeast, the CCR4 protein, as part of the CCR4-NOT complex, has been shown to be responsible for cytoplasmic deadenylation (7Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R.

Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The CCR4 protein contains three major functional domains: an N-terminal activation domain, a central leucine-rich repeat (LRR)1 domain that binds CAF1, and a C-terminal exonuclease III-like domain (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Draper M.P. Liu H.Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell.

The exonuclease III-like domain comprises the apparent CCR4 deadenylase function based on mutagenic studies (8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and others (8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have shown that CCR4 is a 3′–5′-RNase and a single-strand DNA-specific DNase that acts in a distributive manner with strong preferences for poly(A) substrates. The CCR4 protein is enzymatically active even in the absence of the CAF1 protein and other components of the CCR4-NOT complex. In addition, point mutations of the putative catalytic residues in the exonuclease domain of CCR4 abrogate its in vitro and in vivo activities (8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These observations strongly indicate that the CCR4 protein is the catalytic subunit of the mRNA deadenylase family of proteins, although CAF1 may display some deadenylase activity under certain conditions (10Daugeron M.-C. Mauxion F. Seraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Model studies have indicated that alterations in deadenylation rates will have the greatest effects on changes in RNA degradation (13Cao D. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1192-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated the substrate preferences and enzymatic properties of CCR4 to understand the role CCR4 plays in selecting its mRNA substrates. We found that CCR4 prefers RNA substrates with at least 2 A residues at their 3′-ends. However, it was most efficient with substrates that were at least 17 nucleotides in length, although these sequences need not necessarily be poly(A). Inhibition studies further support a non-poly(A)-specific binding site for CCR4. Moreover, longer RNA substrates (at least 45 nucleotides) converted CCR4 to a processive enzyme. In addition, CCR4 by itself displayed no preference for capped substrates. These results suggest that the distributive-to-processive transition for CCR4 and the ability of CCR4 to contact a certain length or type of sequence may be sites by which other factors may regulate CCR4 deadenylase activity in vivo. The full-length CCR4 open reading frame was cloned into a modified pYES2/CT vector (Invitrogen). The resultant CCR4 gene under the control of theGAL1 promoter contained an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. Expression of CCR4 was in strain KY803-1a-1 (MATα leu2-1 PET56 trp1-1 ura3-52 gal2 gcn4-1 ccr4::ura3). Commercially synthesized RNA oligonucleotides are described in TableI. The RNA substrates were generally labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 spin columns. The capped and uncapped 50N+5A and 50N+30A substrates (pT3-L3(A5) and pT3-L3(A30)) were synthesizedin vitro as previously described (14Astrom J. Astrom A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Poly(A) polymerase was used to attach radioactive 3′-AMP to the RNA substrates as described (7Tucker M.

Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The yeast culture containing FLAG-CCR4-His6 fusion protein was grown in a selective medium with 4% glucose to A = 1.0 and then shifted to 4% galactose/raffinose for growth to A= 1.5. The cells were washed and lysed in Tris acetate buffer (buffer A: 50 mm Tris HOAc (pH 7.9), 150 mm KOAc, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) plus a protease inhibitor mixture. After clarification of the crude lysate (15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min), the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were subsequently incubated with washed Ni2+-agarose beads (with buffer A) for ∼4 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the Ni2+-agarose beads were washed extensively with buffer A containing 50 mmimidazole, and then the bound proteins were eluted with same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer A (with 5% glycerol) for 24 h with two changes of buffer. The dialyzed proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h. After extensive washes with buffer A, the FLAG beads were washed once with buffer B (buffer A without Nonidet P-40). To remove the background proteins, the beads were then incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in buffer B containing 100 μg/ml nonspecific hemagglutinin competitor peptide (YPYDVPDYA, Research Genetics). After a pre-elution step, the bound FLAG fusion proteins were eluted twice with buffer B containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer B (with 5% glycerol) for 24 h with two changes of buffer. The purified proteins were then quantified using the Bradford assay. The CCR4 protein was further identified by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The following assay conditions were used for in vitro deadenylation: 50 mm Tris HOAc (pH 7.9), 0.01 mm MgCl2, 20 mmKOAc, 0.10 units of RNase inhibitor, 10% glycerol, 1–100 μm RNA substrate, and the indicated amount of purified CCR4. The RNA substrates were radiolabeled as previously indicated (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The reaction volume was 30 μl, and the incubations were performed at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Five-μl aliquots of the reaction were removed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of formamide/EDTA buffer. Reaction products were resolved by subsequent electrophoresis on 8 m urea and 16% polyacrylamide (19:1 (v/v) acrylamide/bisacrylamide) sequencing gels. The products were analyzed and quantified using PhosphorImager software. To determine the kinetic parameters for the distributive activity of CCR4, experiments were performed with radiolabeled 26N+1A, 25N+2A, and 22N+5A RNA oligonucleotides using purified CCR4 protein. The enzyme concentration was adjusted to obtain linear reaction rates (at least up to 1 h). Five μl of sample volume were removed at appropriate times following incubation at 37 °C. The products were fractionated using a Tris borate/EDTA-polyacrylamide sequencing gel, on which the poly(A)-excised products were distinguished as discrete bands. The reaction rate was determined by measuring the quantity of substrate remaining after 5 min for the 26N+1A and 25N+2A substrates, for which the predominant products were 26N and 25N+1A, respectively. For the 22N+5A substrate, the distributive rate was determined from the total amount of deadenylation that occurred in 5 min after quantitating the abundance of the 22N+5A, 22N+4A, 22N+3A, 22N+2A, and 22N+1A products. For this analysis at low substrate concentration (see Fig.3B, lower panel), we assumed that the relative rate of deadenylation of the 5A substrate to the 1A product was uniform based on our analysis showing uniform changes in abundance of each of these products with time (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar; data not shown). At substrate concentrations >5 μm, the predominant reaction was 22N+5A to 22N+4A (see Fig. 3B, lower panel). To determine Km and Vmaxvalues, each kinetic experiment contained up to eight different substrate concentrations. Each substrate was analyzed in duplicate (sometimes in triplicate), and the experiments were conducted at least three times. The values obtained were fitted by linear regression analysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation and used to determine, from the intercepts, Vmax andKm constants (TableII).Figure 2Distributive action of CCR4.Left panel, radiolabeled 7N+23A RNA substrate (0.48 μm) was incubated with 30 ng of partially purified CCR4 under the optimum assay conditions, and aliquots were taken at the times indicated.

The representative value is the mean ± S.E. The amount of purified CCR4 was 0.3 ng for 22N+5A and 25N+2A and 3 ng for 26N+1A in a reaction volume of 30 μl. The Kcat values for 22N+5A and 25N+2A were 1.4 × 102 and 3.5 × 102 s−1, respectively. The relative rates of the distributive deadenylation reaction were determined for the 2A substrates as described above, for the 5A substrates by quantitating the total amount of deadenylation that occurred within 5 min, and for the 20A substrates by determining the total amount of deadenylation that occurred within 1 min. For the 20A substrates, within 1 min, little of the completely deadenylated substrate is found; and a substantial amount of the 20A substrate remains, with only 19A, 18A, and 17A substrates being predominantly formed. Therefore, quantitating the total amount of deadenylation within 1 min provides a reasonable estimate of the 20A reaction rate, given that very little difference in 20A, 19A, and 18A reaction rates have been observed (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We optimized the conditions for CCR4 deadenylation in vitro using a radiolabeled 22N+5A RNA substrate. We reported previously (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that the exonuclease activity of CCR4 is dependent upon Mg2+. Here we found that CCR4 displayed a very low Mg2+ optimum (0.01–0.1 mm) (Fig.1). Other divalent cations such as Mn2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ were inactive with CCR4 (data not shown). The monovalent K+ (17 mm), pH (7.9), and temperature (37 °C) optima were also obtained (Fig. 1). The Na+ optimum was also found to be low (20 mm) (data not shown). Moreover, we did not find any difference in these optimum conditions when we compared the partially purified CCR4 preparation (single-step FLAG purification) (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with a pure CCR4 enzyme preparation (see below) (data not shown). We initially analyzed the activity of the CCR4 protein on a 7N+23A RNA substrate. A time course of CCR4 deadenylation of this substrate (Fig.2) revealed that CCR4 clearly acted in a distributive manner. A plot of the relative abundance of each of the RNA species as a function of time showed that, as CCR4 catalyzed deadenylation, the abundance of the different species formed a nearly symmetric bell-shaped curve. This type of profile is consistent with CCR4 displaying no large differences in its binding and/or catalysis for substrates containing poly(A) tails from 23 A residues to at least 5 A residues (Fig. 2). Our previous results indicated, however, that CCR4 had major difficulty in deadenylating a substrate with only 1 terminal A residue (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Careful analysis of the curves in Fig. 2 does indicate, however, a slight spreading of the abundance of the product toward shorter poly(A) lengths, suggestive of a slowing of the reaction rate with shorter substrate lengths (see below). To address whether CCR4 exhibited a binding or catalytic deficiency with the 1A substrate, we purified CCR4 to homogeneity prior to analyzing its kinetic parameters. To facilitate purification of the CCR4 protein from yeast, the CCR4 gene fused with FLAG and His6 epitopes was overexpressed in a strain deleted for CCR4. The resultant fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity by a two-step affinity chromatographic procedure from yeast strain KY803-1a-1 (ccr4) (Fig.3A, lane 2). Using radiolabeled 26N+1A and 25N+2A RNA substrates, we determined the apparent Km and Vmax for each substrate with CCR4. Typical reactions as a function of substrate concentration are displayed in Fig. 3B. With the 25N+2A RNA substrate, CCR4 displayed a Km of 5.4 μm and a Vmax of 2.1 μm/min. Whereas the Vmax value for the 26N+1A substrate was comparable to that for the 25N+2A substrate (2.2 μm/min), its Km was increased by 20-fold. The inability of CCR4 to efficiently deadenylate an RNA substrate with 1 A residue (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) can be attributed to a decreased apparent binding ability of the 1A substrate. We also determined an apparent Km of 3.5 μm and aVmax of 0.86 μm/min for the 22N+5A substrate, which are similar to those found for the 25N+2A substrate. The substrate specificity of CCR4 was further investigated using different lengths of non-adenylated nucleotides bearing constant length poly(A) tails of 2, 5, and 20 A residues. The relative activity of CCR4 was determined using a concentration of the RNA molecules of 0.31 μm, which was significantly below the Km for the 25N+2A and 25N+5A RNA substrates. A typical reaction is displayed in Fig.4 (A–C) for RNA substrates containing 2, 5, and 20 A residues at their 3′-ends, respectively. Table IIIsummarizes the relative reaction rates for the substrates analyzed. Several observations can be made from the changes in relative activity for CCR4 distributive deadenylation as a function of the length of the non-poly(A) region of the RNA substrate. First, for the 2A and 5A substrates, increasing the N length from 6 to 12 nucleotides substantially enhanced the reaction rate by 2–3-fold. In contrast, increasing the N length further from 12 to 25 nucleotides increased the relative activity by only 1.4–1.7-fold (Table III). Second, once the total RNA length became ∼17–26 nucleotides, no major differences in the distributive reaction rate were observed for different N lengths irrespective of the poly(A) length (Fig.5). Third, 12N+5A was as active with CCR4 as 12N+20A, indicating that the length of the poly(A) sequencesper se does not alter CCR4 activity. These observations suggest that CCR4 is able to recognize a certain length of RNA substrate (at least 17 nucleotides) and that the A content is not necessarily important for this recognition. These results are also in agreement with those shown in Fig. 2, where a slight spreading of the distribution of 7N+23A products indicated a slight slowing of the reaction rate at shorter substrate lengths.Figure 4Assays analyzing effects of non-poly(A) RNA length on CCR4 deadenylase activity.A, 2A RNA substrates.

The relative rates of deadenylation were standardized against 22N+5A, which was set at 100, and were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values obtained represent the mean ± S.E. of triplicate analysis, except for 6N+2A and 25N+20A (duplicate analysis). It is shown in Fig. 4C(lanes 2–6) that a significant portion of the 25N+20A substrate was converted directly to the 25N+1A product. These data suggest that CCR4 can also act in a processive manner. Because it is also possible that the 25N+1A product was created by an endonucleolytic cleavage occurring at the 1A–2A phosphodiester bond, we 3′-end-labeled the 25N+20A substrate with poly(A) polymerase and reconducted the CCR4 deadenylation reaction. As shown in Fig. 4D, at time 0, an additional 3–33 A residues were added to the 25N+20A substrate. Deadenylation of this substrate by CCR4 under conditions in which CCR4 displayed a processive reaction with the 25N+20A substrate (Fig.4C; data not shown) or a 50N+10A substrate (data not shown) indicated that the poly(A) tail was being removed without the concomitant endonucleolytic cleavage at the 1A–2A phosphodiester that would have resulted in a range of 22–52 poly(A) products (marked withasterisks in Fig. 4D). Similarly, using anin vitro synthesized 50N+30A substrate uniformly labeled with A (14Astrom J. Astrom A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), no 29A endonucleolytic product was observed following CCR4 processive deadenylation that resulted in a 50N+1A product (data not shown). These data confirm that CCR4 can act in a processive manner. CCR4 behaved as a processive enzyme to a much greater extent with the 25N+20A substrate than with the 12N+20A substrate (Fig. 4C,lanes 7–12), indicating that the total length of the RNA substrate is important for CCR4 processivity and not just the A tail length. No processivity was observed with the 7N+23A substrate (Fig.2), although for the 6N+20 substrate displayed in Fig. 4C(lanes 16–18), a very small amount of 6N+1A substrate was formed as a result of an apparently processive reaction. Similarly, CCR4 reacted with the 50N+5A RNA substrate in a processive manner (Fig. 6, lane 6), indicating that it is not the length of the poly(A) sequence that dictates the distributive-to-processive transition for CCR4. In fact, CCR4 acted primarily in a processive manner with the 50N+5A, 50N+10A, and 50N+30A substrates (Fig. 6; data not shown), suggesting again that the total length of the substrate, not its poly(A) length, dictates the distributive-to-processive transition for CCR4. We conclude that CCR4 can act as a processive enzyme in the presence of RNA substrates with lengths of at least 45 nucleotides. No difference in CCR4 reaction rate or ability to act in a processive manner was observed with capped and uncapped 50N+5A RNA substrates (Fig.6). 2R. Parker, personal communication. It should be noted that the apparent faster rate of conversion with uncapped versuscapped substrates shown in Fig. 6 was not borne out by other experiments. Similar results were obtained with capped and uncapped 50N+30A RNA substrates (data not shown). To investigate further the CCR4 deadenylase activity specificity for its RNA substrate, we analyzed the effect of various competitive inhibitors on CCR4 poly(A) removal. The above described deadenylation assay using the 22N+5A RNA substrate was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of 5′-AMP, 5′-GMP, 5′-UMP, 5′-CMP, poly(A), poly(U), poly(G), and poly(C). Table IV shows that UMP was an ∼2-fold better inhibitor than AMP, CMP, and GMP. We also observed that the KI of inhibition for ATP (1.2 pm) was much lower than that for AMP (data not shown). However, as was previously observed for the poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN) deadenylase (15Astrom J. Astrom A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18154-18159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this inhibition was shown to result from the chelating effect of ATP with Mg2+ ions, which thereby prevented the catalytic potential of the CCR4 enzyme (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed that poly(U), poly(C), and poly(G) were much more inhibitory than poly(A), consistent with our above conclusion that the CCR4 protein may be able to recognize a certain length of the RNA substrate and that the poly(A) sequence is of little importance to this recognition.Table IVIn vitro deadenylation assay conducted in the presence of inhibitorsInhibitorKI5′-AMP80 μm5′-GMP80 μm5′-UMP45 μm5′-CMP80 μmPoly(A)33 μg/mlPoly(G)1.6 μg/mlPoly(C)2.6 μg/mlPoly(U)1.2 μg/mlThe rate of enzymatic activity was calculated by the rate of disappearance of the 22N+5A substrate (0.48 μm) using the standard deadenylation assay conditions with purified CCR4.KI is the concentration required for 50% inhibition as determined by PhosphorImager quantitation.

In this study, we report on the substrate specificities of the yeast CCR4 deadenylase. Several features of its substrate recognition were identified. First, as previously indicated (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), CCR4 acted in a distributive fashion to deadenylate a 7N+23A substrate. With other substrates of comparable or shorter length, CCR4 was also a distributive enzyme; yet we observed that, with substrates 45 nucleotides or longer, CCR4 could act in both a processive and distributive manner. The ability to be a processive enzyme was also independent of the length of the poly(A) region of the substrate. One model that could account for this distributive-to-processive transition is that CCR4 binds better to longer substrates and therefore remains attached for a longer period of time. This model is unlikely, however, in that no difference was observed in the relative distributive activity with RNA substrates longer than 17 nucleotides (Figs.4C and 5), implying that CCR4 even with longer substrates displays no differences in inherent affinity for the substrate. An alternative model is that CCR4 itself undergoes a transition in the presence of longer substrates such that a pool of CCR4 can now act in a processive fashion. The oligomeric structures of the highly processive λ-exonuclease and poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN) deadenylase (16Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Kovall R. Mathews B.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) suggest that one such transition may be for CCR4 to become oligomeric. Perhaps longer RNA substrates provide the structure that accelerates this process by, for instance, providing significantly long enough sequences to which multiple CCR4 proteins can attach. Second, we found that, as a distributive enzyme, CCR4 preferred substrates with lengths of at least 17 nucleotides. The decreases in reactivity with shorter substrates appeared to be a result of CCR4 decreased binding affinity, as the substrate concentrations used in these experiments were significantly below the Km of binding. The length of the poly(A) sequence did not alter these preferences, confirming observations of others2 and ours 3P. Viswanathan, J. Chen, Y.-C. Chiang, and C. L. Denis, unpublished data. that CCR4 cannot specifically bind to poly(A). Whether this binding preference results from a sequence-specific recognition is not known. However, inhibition studies with poly(U) and poly(G) indicated that these compounds were 20–40-fold better inhibitors of the CCR4 distributive reaction than was poly(A). CCR4 might display sequence specificity for non-poly(A) sequences that might be enriched with U or G. Given that poly(A) sequences in yeast are up to 70–80 nucleotides in length, one model suggests that only the extreme 3′-end of the poly(A) tail and the 3′-untranslated region sequences are bound by CCR4, with most of the poly(A) sequence looped out and not in contact with CCR4. Third, either as a distributive or processive enzyme, CCR4 was deficient in removing a single terminal A residue from the mRNA (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This requirement for 2 A residues at the 3′-end was shown to be the result of a much higher (20-fold) Km for the 1A substrate than for the 2A substrate. CCR4 can remove the terminal A residue and can also remove C or other nucleotides, albeit at very slow rates (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fourth, CCR4 itself did not display any difference with capped or uncapped substrates, suggesting that other proteins interacting with CCR4 aid its recognition of capped mRNA (8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These substrate specificity analyses suggest the following model for CCR4 recognition of its RNA substrate. CCR4 binds to at least 2 terminal A residues, presumably in its active site. It also displays recognition for at least another 15 nucleotides; whether they are completely contiguous to these 2 A residues is not known. Finally, CCR4 may change its conformation or alter its oligomeric structure with substrates of even greater length (≥45 nucleotides) to become a processive enzyme. Preliminary modeling of CCR4 binding to a 17-mer RNA based on the structure of the exonuclease III family protein HAP1 (18Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de la Fortella E. Mol C.D. Trainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 19Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Trainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 20Nguyen L.H. Barsky D. Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) indicates that the C-terminal catalytic domain of CCR4 would not easily accommodate binding to RNA of such length. However, other regions of CCR4, especially its LRR, could be involved in RNA binding. Given that two other LRR-containing proteins require their LRR domain for contacting their cognate RNA substrates (21Liker E. Fernandez E. Lzaurralde E. Conti E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), it is quite possible that the LRR of CCR4 directly or indirectly facilitates CCR4 recognition of its substrate. These features of CCR4 recognition of its substrates may, of course, be targets for control of the deadenylation process. Regulating the ability of CCR4 to bind specific mRNA or to transition to its processive state would greatly influence its enzymatic activity. The CAF1 protein and other components of the CCR4-NOT complex do not appear to be likely regulators of these features. For example, partially purified preparations of CCR4 that contain the complete CCR4-NOT complex (9Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) do not display significant differences in deadenylation compared with the purified protein in terms of requiring at least 17 nucleotides or in the transition to processivity. Othertrans-acting proteins such as PUF3 and PAB1 could control these processes (7Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 23Olivas W. Parker R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The role of the other components of the CCR4-NOT complex may be to confer additional regulatory aspects to the deadenylation process. These could include binding to the mRNA cap structure or recognition of additional specific RNA sequences not present in our model RNA substrates used in this study. Previous studies on the deadenylation of several mRNAs in vivo (5Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 7Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 8Tucker M. Staples R.R. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Muhlrad D. Parker R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) clearly indicate that the rate of deadenylation can vary considerably for different mRNAs. Careful analysis of thesein vivo deadenylation studies indicates thatPGK1, which deadenylates slowly, does so in a distributive manner (5Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In contrast, faster deadenylated mRNAs such asMFA2, STE3, COX17, andGAL10 deadenylate with a combination of both processive and distributive processes (5Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 7Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 23Olivas W. Parker R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This is an expected result given that processivity would allow the more rapid accumulation of product compared with the comparatively slow distributive reaction. Because CCR4 can display both distributive and processive activities, future studies will need to address how regulating these processes relates to the observed differences in mRNA deadenylation. In addition, the previously observed initially slow deadenylation of all mRNAs up to loss of the first 10 A residues (5Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) followed by more rapid deadenylation of the bulk of the poly(A) tail suggests an additional site at which CCR4 deadenylation may be controlled.

To identify genes involved in β-HIVS-induced apoptotic process, we performed cDNA array analysis and found that β-HIVS suppresses the expression of the gene for a polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) that is involved in control of the cell cycle. When U937 and HL60 cells were treated with 10−6 M β-HIVS for 0.5 h, both the amount of PLK1 itself and the kinase activity of this enzyme were decreased. By contrast, Bcr–Abl-positive K562 cells were resistant to the induction of apoptosis by β-HIVS and this compound did not suppress the kinase activity of PLK1 in these cells. However, simultaneous treatment of K562 cells with both β-HIVS and STI571, which selectively inhibits the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity of Bcr–Abl, strongly induced apoptosis. Moreover, β-HIVS increased the inhibitory effect of STI571 on PTK activity. Treatment of K562 cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) specific for PLK1 sensitized these cells to the β-HIVS-induced fragmentation of DNA. These results suggest that suppression of the activity of PLK1 via inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity by β-HIVS might play a critical role in the induction of apoptosis."

However, for a large number of them, only the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences have been clarified, with little information available concerning their functions and tissue distributions. It is conceivable to assume that there are many unknown transporters among these unknown/unannotated genes. Although some transporters have been isolated recently using the nucleotide sequences in the expressed sequence tag data bases, most of them are members of known transporter families (3Allikmets R.

Based on this hypothesis, we constructed an mRNA data base of male rat kidney and screened unknown genes in the data base by measuring the uptake of various compounds using Xenopus oocytes. Consequently, we found a novel Na+-dependent glucose transporter (rNaGLT1)1 that transports α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (α-MeGlc) in an Na+-dependent manner. Glucose is reabsorbed in renal proximal tubules by several hexose transporters (9Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F10-F18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, two Na+-dependent glucose transporters, SGLT1 (10Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and SGLT2 (11You G.

Invest. 1994; 93: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), with high and low affinity for their substrates, respectively, have been isolated from intestine or kidney. SGLT2 is predominantly expressed in the S1 segment of proximal tubules, whereas SGLT1 is present in the S3 segment. It is generally accepted that SGLT1 and SGLT2 work cooperatively during the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubules. Although the severe glucose/galactose malabsorption disease is caused by a single missense mutation of the SGLT1 nucleotide sequence in the small intestine, slight glycosuria is observed in patients with this disease (13Turk E. Zabel B. Mundlos S. Dyer J. Wright E.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that SGLT1 may play a small part in the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney (9Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F10-F18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there are few studies suggesting mutations of SGLT2 accompanying a severe inherited disease. It has been speculated that Fanconi's syndrome or primary renal glycosuria involves a malfunction of renal glucose transporters. Although Santer et al. (14Santer R. Schneppenheim R. Dombrowski A. Gotze H. Steinmann B. Schaub J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) have suggested the involvement of GLUT2 in Fanconi's syndrome, the mechanisms inducing renal glycosuria remain largely to be clarified (9Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F10-F18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the cDNA cloning of a novel Na+-dependent glucose transporter (rNaGLT1) that would play a critical role in the tubular reabsorption of glucose. α-[U-14C]MeGlc (11.7 GBq/mmol),d-[1-14C]galactose (2.07 GBq/mmol), andd-[U-14C]mannose (11.6 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).d-[1-3H]Mannitol (629 GBq/mmol), [3H]digoxin (584.6 GBq/mmol), 1-[3H]methyl-4-phenylpyridinium acetate (2886 GBq/mmol), [6,7-3H]estrone sulfate (1609 GBq/mmol), [14C]glycylsarcosine (1.848 GBq/mmol), andl-[3H]leucine (1573 GBq/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. d-[3H]Glucose (566.1 GBq/mmol), 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG; 925 GBq/mmol), and l-[2,5-3H]histidine (1628 GBq/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). [9-3H]Quinidine (740 GBq/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). [14C]Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (2.55 GBq/mmol) was a gift from Bayer AG (Leverkusen-Bayerwerk, Germany). Phlorizin, α-MeGlc, d-glucose, l-glucose,d-galactose, d-mannose, d-fructose, and d-mannitol were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Phloretin and 2-DG were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Total RNA was extracted from the kidneys of 9-week-old male rats (n = 6) by the guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl ultracentrifugation method. The poly(A)+ RNA was purified by chromatography on an oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (15Saito H. Masuda S. Inui K.-i. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20719-20725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The cDNA library was constructed using the λZaP Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After conversion from phage to plasmid, 1000 colonies were randomly chosen from this cDNA library and sequenced using the RISA-384 multicapillary DNA sequencing system (Shimadzu, Kyoto) from the 5′-end with primer T3. The resulting sequences were submitted to a BLAST search of the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank and the Protein Data Bank. Four-hundred unknown clones from the rat kidney cDNA library were subjected to a BLAST search. These clones were screened for the transport activity of nine compounds using Xenopusoocytes. Rat nephrons were microdissected as described previously (16Masuda S. Saito H. Nonoguchi H. Tomita K. Inui K.-i. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the left kidneys of 7-week-old rats weighing 140–160 g were perfused and removed. Slices were cut along the medullary axis and incubated with collagenase. The tubules were microdissected to obtain the following structures: glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, proximal straight tubule, medullary thick ascending limb, cortical thick ascending limb, cortical collecting duct, outer medullary collecting duct, and inner medullary collecting duct. After microdissection, 20 glomeruli and 8 mm of each dissected tubule segment were transferred into tubes to isolate total RNA using an RNeasy® minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany). Total RNA from the dissected tubules or poly(A)+ RNA from rat tissues (brain, heart, lung, liver, small intestine, spleen, kidney cortex, and kidney medulla) was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), followed by RNase H (Invitrogen) digestion. These single-stranded DNA fragments were amplified with primer sets specific for rNaGLT1, rSGLT1, rSGLT2, and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (rGAPDH), as shown in TableI.Table IOligonucleotide sequences of PCR primers used for the determination of glucose transporters and rGAPDH by RT-PCR and Northern blottingPrimerSequencePositionsrNaGLT1 (AB089802) Forward5′-TGGGACCCACATTTCCAGAC-3′279–298 Reverse5′-TCTGAGGCGGCTTCAAAGGATC-3′736–757rSGLT1 (D16101) Forward5′-ATGGACAGTAGCACCTTGAGCC-3′170–191 Reverse5′-TAGCCCCAGAGAAGATGTCTGC-3′647–668rSGLT2 (U29881) Forward5′-CATTGTCTCAGGCTGGCACTGG-3′851–872 Reverse5′-GGACACTGCCACAATGAACACC-3′1289–1310rGAPDH (M17701) Forward5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′131–150 Reverse5′-GGAAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGC-3′705–724RT-PCR and Northern blotting were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Positions are from the rat sequence in the GenBank TM/EBI Data Bank, and the accession numbers are indicated. Open table in a new tab RT-PCR and Northern blotting were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Positions are from the rat sequence in the GenBank TM/EBI Data Bank, and the accession numbers are indicated. Five micrograms of total RNA from rat kidney or 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from the eight tissues was electrophoresed on 1% denaturing agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred onto Hybond® N+nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The transferred RNAs were linked to the nylon membrane by a UV cross-linker. The quality of the RNA was assessed by ethidium bromide staining. After transfer, the blots were hybridized under high stringency conditions (50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (20 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA = 3 m NaCl, 0.2 mNaH2PO4, and 0.02 m EDTA, pH 7.4), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 10 μg/ml herring sperm DNA at 42 °C) with rNaGLT1, rSGLT1, rSGLT2, and rGAPDH cDNA fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (29.6 TBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Each probe was obtained by RT-PCR amplification of rat kidney total RNA as described above (TableI). After hybridization, the blots were washed three times with 2× SSC (20× SSC = 3 m NaCl and 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 10 min and then twice with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min. The dried membranes were exposed to the imaging plates of a Fujix BIO-imaging BAS-2000 II analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). To compare the expression levels of rNaGLT1 and rSGLT1 or rSGLT2, the experimental conditions (such as the quantity of labeled probes, the wash conditions, and the exposure time) were kept uniform. Polyclonal antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the intracellular domains near the C terminus (LPLDRKQEKSINSEGQ) of rNaGLT1. The peptide was synthesized with cysteine for its N terminus (purity of 92.0% upon high performance liquid chromatography; Sawady Technology Co., Ltd., Tokyo). A male Japanese White rabbit (2 kg) was immunized with 0.2 mg of conjugates emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. Booster shots of conjugates emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant were injected every 2 weeks until the antibody was obtained. After each booster shot, blood was collected, and antibody production was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To verify the specificity of antibody against rNaGLT1 protein, Xenopusoocytes injected with rNaGLT1 cRNA were used in the immunohistochemical analysis. Capped cRNA from rNaGLT1 was transcribed fromNotI-linearized pBK-CMV containing rNaGLT1 cDNA with T3 RNA polymerase as described previously (17Uwai Y. Okuda M. Takami K. Hashimoto Y. Inui K.-i. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with water (50 nl) or rNaGLT1 cRNA (25 ng). Three days after injection, oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed oocytes were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo) and rapidly frozen at −20 °C. Tissues were cut into 12-μm-thick sections, mounted on glass slides, and covered with 10% goat serum for 1 h. The covered sections were incubated with anti-rNaGLT1 serum (1:500 dilution) with or without preabsorption by the synthesized antigen peptide (50 μg/ml) for 1 h and then incubated with Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h. These sections were examined with a BX-50-FLA fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo) at magnification ×100. Images were captured with a DP-50 CCD camera (Olympus) using Studio Lite software (Olympus). Crude plasma membrane fractions were prepared from rat kidney cortex as reported previously (18Ogihara H. Saito H. Shin B.C. Terada T. Takenoshita S. Nagamichi Y. Inui K.-i. Takata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The brush-border and basolateral membrane fractions were obtained from rat renal cortex as described previously (19Inui K.-i. Okano T. Takano M. Kitazawa S. Hori R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi K. Nakamura N. Terada T. Okano T. Futami T. Saito H. Inui K.-i. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1037-1042PubMed Google Scholar). To carry out immunoblot analysis, the membrane fractions were solubilized in sample buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris, and 20% glycerol) in the presence or absence of 50 mm dithiothreitol and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond®) by semidry electroblotting for 35 min. The blots were incubated with the purified antibody (1:4000 dilution) and detected on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and cyclic diacylhydrazides (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm the specificity of the antibody, the antibody was absorbed with an excess amount of peptide (5 μg/ml) used as immunogen and processed similarly. Real-time PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700TM sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) as described previously (21Motohashi H. Sakurai Y. Saito H. Masuda S. Urakami Y. Goto M. Fukatsu A Ogawa O Inui K.-i. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 866-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific primers, the TaqMan probe, and the target sequence for real-time PCR are listed in TableII. The cDNA fragments of the target sequences were generated by RT-PCR with specific primers from rat kidney total RNA. Each PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformed into competent DH5α cells (Invitrogen). The concentrations of the purified plasmid DNA were measured by spectrophotometry, and corresponding copy numbers were calculated. Serial dilutions of the respective plasmid DNA were used as standards to make calibration curves. PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 5 μl of cDNA sample, 1 μm each primer, 0.2 μm TaqMan probe, and 10 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). rGAPDH mRNA was also measured as an internal control with TaqMan® rodent GAPDH control reagents (Applied Biosystems).Table IINucleotide sequences of the primers and probes used for real-time PCRPrimerPositionsrNaGLT1 (AB089802) Forward5′-CCGGTGTCTCATTTGGTGTTCT-3′526–547 Reverse5′-ACCCAAGGCGAAACTGAAGTG-3′618–638 TaqMan probe5′-ACAAAGGAGCCCCACATATTCAGGCCTT-3′589–616rSGLT1 (D16101) Forward5′-CGAGGAGGACCCTAAAGATACCA-3′1912–1934 Reverse5′-GAACAGGTCATATGCCTTCCTGA-3′1977–1999 TaqMan probe5′-TGAAATAGATGCAGAAGCCCCCCAGAAGG-3′1936–1964rSGLT2 (U29881) Forward5′-AAAATACGGCAGGAAGGAACTG-3′2117–2138 Reverse5′-GACAAATTGGCCACCATCTTG-3′2193–2213 TaqMan probe5′-CCAGTCCATTTGATTGGTTGTCACTTCCC-3′2163–2191Real-time PCR was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Positions are from the rat sequence in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank, and accession numbers are indicated.

Xenopus oocytes were injected with water (50 nl) or rNaGLT1 cRNA (25 ng). Three days after injection, the uptake experiment was initiated by incubating oocytes at 25 °C in 500 μl of uptake buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing α-[14C]MeGlc or radiolabeled sugar analogs (37 kBq/ml) in the presence or absence of unlabeled inhibitors for 1 h unless otherwise indicated. Uptake in the absence of Na+ or at a lowered Na+ concentration was measured by substituting NaCl with choline chloride and by adding valinomycin. The uptake reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold uptake buffer, followed by washing the oocytes five times with 2 ml of the buffer. After the wash, each oocyte was dissolved with 300 μl of 10% SDS. Radioactivity was determined by adding 3 ml of ACSII (Amersham Biosciences) to each solubilized oocyte in a liquid scintillation counter. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed statistically by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's t test. Data from quantitative RT-PCR analysis were analyzed statistically using Student's pairedt test with Bonferroni's correction. A single cDNA clone encoding rNaGLT1 was isolated from the rat kidney cDNA library and sequenced. The rNaGLT1 cDNA consists of 2173 bp with an open reading frame encoding a 484-amino acid protein (calculated molecular mass of 51.7 kDa) and a poly(A)+tail. Fig. 1A shows the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis of rNaGLT1 (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). Membrane-spanning regions and the N-terminal orientation were predicted using the TMpred program (31Hoffmann K. Stoffel W. Biol.

Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). 3Available at www.sosui.proteome.bio.taut.ac.jp. On the basis of physicochemical properties (i.e. hydrophobicity, charges, and distribution) of amino acid residues and their sequences, an 11-transmembrane-spanning region model of rNaGLT1 was developed (Fig.1B). The topology of rNaGLT1 includes five extracellular and five intracellular loops; the N terminus is oriented extracellularly; and the 34-amino acid C terminus is oriented toward the cytoplasm. The amino acid sequence of rNaGLT1 shares <22% homology with known SGLT and GLUT glucose transporters and might belong to a new family of membrane transporters. Comparison of the amino acid sequence using the BLAST program revealed that rNaGLT1 shares a high degree of amino acid homology with three hypothetical proteins, of which only primary structures were clarified without any functional characterization (Table III). Compared with known proteins, rNaGLT1 is slightly homologous to the multidrug efflux transporter and the glucose/galactose transporter ofXylella fastidiosa in part (Table III). In addition, the rNaGLT1 amino acid sequence does not contain any conserved domain when searched against the Smart 4Available at smart.embl-heidelberg.de/. and Pfam 5Available at pfam.wust1.edu/.libraries.Table IIIComparison of rNaGLT1 with hypothetical proteinsGene nameSpeciesLength (AA)HomologyAccession No.%Hypothetical protein XP 137057Mouse51161XM137057Putative novel protein similar to bacterial nitrite extrusion proteinMouse36662BAB25402Hypothetical protein XP 166307Human51857XP166307Multidrug efflux transporterBacillus halodurans40922NP242641Glucose/galactose transporterX. fastidiosa42624NP298898Homology was compared using GENETYX-MAC version 10.1.

We examined the tissue distribution of rNaGLT1 mRNA transcripts by Northern blot analysis (Fig.2A). Under high stringency conditions, a full-length rNaGLT1 probe was hybridized with mRNA transcripts from rat kidney cortex and medulla. For PCR analysis of rNaGLT1 mRNA expression, a set of specific primers for the cDNA of rNaGLT1 was used. As shown in Fig. 2B, a PCR product of the expected size for rNaGLT1 was found in rat brain, liver, lung, kidney cortex, and kidney medulla. To examine the distribution of rNaGLT1 in the kidney, we performed RT-PCR analysis of the microdissected nephron segments. With RT and subsequent PCR and Southern blotting, a signal with the predicted size of 468 bp for rNaGLT1 was detected in the proximal convoluted and straight tubules (Fig. 3). Faint signals with the same size were detected in the medullary thick ascending limb and cortical collecting duct. Similarly, rSGLT1 and rSGLT2 were also detected primarily in the proximal convoluted and straight tubules (Fig. 3). To clarify the membrane localization of rNaGLT1 protein, we performed immunoblot analysis of rNaGLT1 in rat kidney crude membranes, brush-border membranes, and basolateral membranes using affinity-purified antibody against rNaGLT1. Under nonreducing conditions without dithiothreitol, an immunoreactive protein with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa was strongly expressed in the brush-border membrane fraction, slightly expressed in the crude membrane fraction, and faintly expressed in the basolateral membrane fraction (Fig. 4A). Under reducing conditions with 50 mm dithiothreitol, a signal was detected at ∼50 kDa in the brush-border membrane fraction (Fig.4B). The band in the crude membrane fraction was slightly larger than that in the brush-border membrane fraction. The immunoreactive bands in the brush-border and crude membranes were completely abolished when the antibody was preabsorbed with the antigen peptide (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that the positive bands observed in the brush-border and crude membranes were specific for rNaGLT1. The oocytes expressing rNaGLT1 displayed strong signals along the plasma membranes and weak signals in the cytoplasm, although oocytes injected with water exhibited no labeling of the membranes or cytoplasm (Fig.5, A and B). In addition, the signals were completely abolished when the antibody was preabsorbed with the antigen peptide (50 μg/ml) (Fig.5C).Figure 5Expression of rNaGLT1 proteins inXenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with water (50 nl; A) or in vitro transcribed rNaGLT1 cRNA (25 ng/oocyte; B and C). Three days after injection, oocytes were fixed, frozen, sectioned, and stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A andB, the affinity-purified antiserum for rNaGLT1 was used as the primary antibody. C, the affinity-purified antiserum preabsorbed with the antigen peptide (50 μg/ml) of rNaGLT1 was used. Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG was used for detection of bound antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the transport function of rNaGLT1, the accumulation of various sugar analogs was measured in Xenopus oocytes injected with rNaGLT1 cRNA (Fig. 6). The uptake of α-MeGlc and d-glucose was significantly increased, but the other analogs tested showed little or no uptake in rNaGLT1 cRNA-injected compared with water-injected oocytes. The substrate specificity of rNaGLT1 was tested by inhibition experiments in which inhibition of the uptake of α-[14C]MeGlc (2 mm for 1 h) was determined in the presence of various sugar analogs (30 mm), phlorizin (25 μm), or phloretin (50 μm) (Fig. 7). α-MeGlc, d-glucose, and phlorizin completely inhibited the uptake. The uptake of α-[14C]MeGlc was strongly inhibited by 2-DG and slightly inhibited by fructose and phloretin, whereas l-glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, galactose, and mannose had little or no effect.Figure 7Effects of sugar analogs, phlorizin, and phloretin on α-[14C]MeGlc uptake by Xenopus oocytes. The uptake of α-MeGlc (2 mm, 37 kBq/ml) by oocytes was measured for 1 h at 25 °C in the absence and presence of sugar analogs (30 mm), phlorizin (50 μm), or phloretin (25 μm).

Based on Eadie-Hofstee plot analysis, the apparent Km andVmax values for α-MeGlc were calculated to be 3.71 ± 0.09 mm and 136.3 ± 17.0 pmol/oocyte/h, respectively. The Na+ dependence of α-MeGlc uptake in rNaGLT1-injected oocytes was examined by measuring α-[14C]MeGlc uptake as a function of extracellular [Na+] with the membrane voltage clamped to zero (equal internal and external [K+] in the presence of 7 μm valinomycin). In the rNaGLT1 cRNA-injected oocytes, the α-MeGlc uptake was stimulated by the extracellular Na+ in a concentration-dependent manner, although the uptake was not saturated at Na+ concentrations between 0 and 96 mm (Fig. 8B). Hill plot analyses using the data in Fig. 8 (A and B) gave coefficients of 1.06 and 1.00, respectively, indicating that the Na+/glucose coupling ratio for rNaGLT1 is 1:1 (Fig. 8,C and D). The results of Northern blotting of rNaGLT1, rSGLT1, and rSGLT2 in the kidney cortex or medulla are shown in Fig.9. The relative quantity of rNaGLT1, rSGLT1, and rSGLT2 was estimated by densitometry. rNaGLT1 mRNA was expressed more abundantly in the cortex than in the medulla, and its expression level was higher than that of rSGLT1 or rSGLT2. To compare the expression levels of rNaGLT1 and rSGLT mRNAs precisely, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig.10). The mRNA levels of rNaGLT1 both in the cortex (Fig. 10A) and medulla (Fig.10B) were significantly higher than those of rSGLT1 or rSGLT2.Figure 10Quantification of rNaGLT1, rSGLT1, and rSGLT2 mRNAs in the kidney cortex (A) and medulla (B) by real-time PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted from rat kidney cortex (A) and medulla (B), and the extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed.

It is known that there are high and low affinity types of Na+-dependent glucose transporters, whose Km values are 0.35 and 6 mm, respectively, in rabbit kidney (23Turner R.J. Moran A. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: F406-F414PubMed Google Scholar). rNaGLT1 was suggested to be one of the low affinity-type Na+-dependent glucose transporters because the characteristics of rNaGLT1 are similar to those rSGLT2 in several ways, as follows: 1) its mRNA was abundantly expressed in the kidney cortex and primarily in the proximal convoluted and straight tubules (Figs. 2 and 3); 2) rNaGLT1 was expressed in the brush-border membranes of proximal tubules (Fig. 4); 3) galactose was not recognized as its substrate (Fig. 6); and 4) the coupling ratio of sodium to glucose was 1:1 (Fig. 8) (11You G. Lee W.S. Barros E.J. Kanai Y. Huo T.L. Khawaja S. Wells R.G. Nigam S.K. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29365-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Despite such similarity to rSGLT2, rNaGLT1 shares a low degree of amino acid sequence homology with SGLTs or GLUTs. Our previous report demonstrated that the Vmax for low affinity-type Na+-dependent glucose transport activity in renal brush-border membrane vesicles was significantly decreased in the 5/6 nephrectomized rats, an animal model of chronic renal failure, compared with the sham-operated controls, although the expression level of SGLT2 mRNA was maintained in 5/6 nephrectomized rats (24Takahashi K. Masuda S. Nakamura N. Saito H. Futami T. Doi T. Inui K.-i. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F1109-F1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy of low affinity-type glucose transport in the 5/6 nephrectomized rats remains unknown and could be accounted for by rNaGLT1. Therefore, rNaGLT1 would be another low affinity-type Na+-dependent glucose transporter and belongs to a new gene family in view of its structure. A signal corresponding to rNaGLT1 was recognized in the crude membrane fraction, and it was concentrated further in the brush-border membrane fraction by immunoblot analysis under nonreducing conditions (Fig.4A). This indicates that rNaGLT1 was localized in the brush-border membranes of the proximal tubule. However, a faint band was also detected in the basolateral membrane fraction. The basolateral membrane fraction was purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (18Ogihara H. Saito H. Shin B.C. Terada T. Takenoshita S. Nagamichi Y. Inui K.-i. Takata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although this method is useful for obtaining the basolateral membrane fraction, slight contamination of brush-border membranes cannot be avoided. Therefore, the faint band shown in the basolateral membrane fraction might be due to the contamination of brush-border membranes. The approximate molecular mass of the rNaGLT1 signal is 97 kDa (Fig. 4A). This is markedly larger than the molecular mass predicted from the amino acid sequence (51.7 kDa). However, when the crude and brush-border membrane fractions were reduced by dithiothreitol, a signal was detected at ∼50 kDa, which is comparable to the predicted size of rNaGLT1 (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that rNaGLT1 might form homodimer or a complex with other proteins. rNaGLT1 mRNA was expressed abundantly in the kidney cortex (Fig.2), and its level was ∼3-fold higher in the cortex and 5-fold higher in the medulla compared with rSGLT2 mRNA (Fig. 10). Similar to rSGLT2, the uptake activity of α-[14C]MeGlc in rNaGLT1 cRNA-injected oocytes is 2.5–4-fold higher than that in water-injected oocytes (11You G. Lee W.S. Barros E.J. Kanai Y. Huo T.L.

The low glucose uptake activity shown in rNaGLT1-expressing oocytes might be accounted for by the non-saturable extracellular concentration of Na+, for which the apparentKm was estimated as 202 mm, and/or by poor ability to express rNaGLT1. The inhibitory effects of glucose analogs on the uptake of α-MeGlc in rNaGLT1-injected oocytes are almost comparable to those of rSGLT2, except for phloretin and 2-DG (Fig. 7) (11You G. Lee W.S. Barros E.J. Kanai Y. Huo T.L. Khawaja S. Wells R.G. Nigam S.K. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29365-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Kanai Y.

In general, phloretin and 2-DG are known to inhibit GLUT-mediated glucose transport (25Cheung P.T. Hammerman M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F711-F718PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, phloretin slightly inhibits glucose transport in rat renal brush-border membrane vesicles (27Kinne R. Murer H. Kinne-Saffran E. Thees M. Sachs G. J. Membr. Biol. 1975; 21: 375-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, as the concentration of 2-DG (30 mm) induces ATP depletion and cytotoxicity (28Sridhar R. Stroude E.C. Inch W.R. In Vitro (Rockville). 1979; 15: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the inhibition of α-MeGlc uptake by 2-DG might be caused by a nonspecific disturbance of the activity. Taken together, the decrease in rNaGLT1-mediated uptake in the presence of phloretin and 2-DG is considered not to contradict previous findings of renal Na+-dependent glucose transport. The rNaGLT1 mRNA was detected only in the kidney cortex and medulla by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the amplified products corresponding to rNaGLT1 were detected not only in the kidney, but also in the brain, lung, and liver by RT-PCR analysis. rNaGLT1 mRNA was expressed primarily in the kidney, but rNaGLT1 itself or its homolog also might be expressed slightly in several other tissues. Previous reports showed that the brain and lung, as well as the intestine and kidney, possess activity for Na+-dependent glucose transport (29Lee W.J. Peterson D.R. Sukowski E.J. Hawkins R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1552-C1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Oelberg D.G. Xu F. Shabarek F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It remains to be clarified whether rNaGLT1 or its analog takes part in glucose transport in such tissues or not. In this study, we successfully isolated rNaGLT1 from a rat kidney mRNA data base constructed by the random sequencing technique. This might be the first demonstration of the cloning of a novel transporter by the random sequencing of a cDNA library coupled with the functional expression technique. Although many genes have recently been submitted to public data bases such as the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EMBL Data Bank, ∼40% of the genes in the rat kidney data base are unknown. In addition, theoretically, a clone from the random sequence data base is expressed abundantly in vivo (6Takenaka M. Imai E. Kaneko T. Ito T. Moriyama T. Yamauchi A. Hori M. Kawamoto S. Okubo K. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 562-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Takenaka M. Imai E. Nagasawa Y. Matsuoka Y. Moriyama T. Kaneko T. Hori M. Kawamoto S. Okubo K.

The physiological role of rNaGLT1, especially in correlation with SGLTs and GLUTs, remains to be clarified. Studies using diabetic and nephropathic animal models or gene knockout animals might be useful for the determination of the pathophysiological role of rNaGLT1."
https://openalex.org/W1978111168,"There is increasing experimental evidence demonstrating that many lipocalins bind to specific cell surface receptors. However, whereas the binding of lipocalins to their lipophilic ligands has now been characterized in much detail, there is a lack of knowledge about the nature of lipocalin receptors, the physiological role of receptor binding, and the molecular mechanism of ligand delivery. We previously identified a novel human membrane protein (lipocalin-1-interacting membrane receptor (LIMR)), which interacts with lipocalin-1 (Wojnar, P., Lechner, M., Merschak, P., and Redl, B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20206–20212). In the present study, we investigated the physiological role of LIMR and found this protein to be essential for mediating internalization of lipocalin-1 (Lcn-1) in NT2 cells, leading to its degradation. Whereas control NT2 cells rapidly internalized 125I-Lcn-1 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Lcn-1, NT2 cells that were made LIMR deficient by cDNA antisense expression greatly accumulated Lcn-1 in the culture medium but did not internalize it. Because sequence and structure analysis indicated that proteins similar to LIMR are present in several organisms and at least two closely related orthologues are found in human and mouse, we suggest LIMR to be the prototype of a new family of endocytic receptors, which are topographically characterized by nine putative transmembrane domains and a characteristic large central cytoplasmic loop.

There is increasing evidence that this group of proteins is involved in a variety of physiological processes including retinoid, fatty acid, and pheromone signaling; immunomodulation; inflammation; detoxification; modulation of growth and metabolism; tissue development; apoptosis; and even behavior processes (1Flower D.R.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), there is a major lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which lipocalins exert their biological effects. It is well accepted that many, if not all, of these proteins are able to bind to specific cell receptors (9Flower D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), although only two of these receptors have been identified thus far (10Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A.

Due to limited data concerning the structure of the lipocalin receptors themselves, the molecular mechanisms beyond this receptor binding are very unclear at the moment. One hypothesis is that the holo-lipocalin releases its ligand upon receptor binding, and this ligand diffuses through the cell membrane to interact with an intracellular fatty acid-binding protein or an intracellular receptor. There is also some evidence that lipocalins undergo internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Another plausible mechanism might be that the lipocalin-receptor interaction creates a direct signal inducing various physiological processes (9Flower D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have recently identified and characterized LIMR,1 a novel human 57-kDa cell membrane protein (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which interacts with Lcn-1, a lipocalin member produced by a number of secretoric glands and tissues and known to bind a variety of lipophilic compounds (12Redl B.

Because we found expression of LIMR in the human NT2 cell line (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we used an antisense gene knockout technology to investigate the role of this receptor in the mechanism of ligand delivery in more detail. The results of our study clearly demonstrated that LIMR is essential for cellular internalization of Lcn-1. Thus, it has to be classified as a novel endocytic receptor. Because sequence and structure analysis indicated that proteins similar to LIMR are present in several organisms and at least two closely related orthologues are found in human and mouse, we suggest LIMR to be the prototype of a new family of endocytic receptors. Human NT2 precursor cells were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and human T-47D breast cells (ATCC HTB-133) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and other cell culture materials were purchased from PAA Laboratories Inc. (Parker Ford, PA). NT2 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient mixture F-12K supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in 75-cm2 culture dishes under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. T-47D cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mml-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 0.2 unit/ml bovine insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum. To construct a vector expressing LIMR antisense RNA, a cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 332–2349 (1917 nucleotides) of LIMR (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers to which XbaI/XhoI restriction enzyme cutting sites were attached (5′- CTAGCGTCTAGAATGGAAGCACCTGACTAC-3′ and 5′- TTTATCTCGAGTCAGGTGGTCCAAAGCCC-3′). The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with XbaI/XhoI restriction enzymes, and ligated with XbaI/XhoI-digested vector pOPRSVI/MCS (Stratagene) in an antisense orientation. The resulting plasmid (pOPRSVI-AS-LIMR) was verified by DNA sequencing. A religated plasmid backbone pOPRSVI/MCS was used as a transfection control. Stable transfection of NT2 cells was carried out using MBS Mammalian Transfection Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were selected in culture medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Twenty-five days after selection, individual G418-resistant colonies were subcloned. Five subclones of LIMR antisense- and mock-transfected cells were analyzed by immunoblotting analysis and immunofluorescence for LIMR expression. Purified Lcn-1 was labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using IODO-BEAD Iodination Reagent as described by the supplier (Pierce). To remove excess Na125I or unincorporated125I2 from the iodinated protein, dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline was performed using dialysis cassettes (Pierce). The proteins had specific activities ranging from 0.33 to 0.99 GBq/mg. FITC-labeled Lcn-1 (FITC-Lcn-1) was prepared by incubating purified Lcn-1 (5 mg/ml) with 5 mg/ml FITC (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, for 20 h at 4 °C. Unconjugated FITC was removed by gel filtration on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown on coverslips for 18 h at 37 °C in complete medium (minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml G418 for AS-NT2 cells; RPMI 1640 medium for T-47D cells). The cells were washed once with serum-free medium and incubated for 3 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C. FITC-labeled Lcn-1 was added (final concentration, 50 μg/ml each) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. To remove cell surface-bound ligand that had not been internalized, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 50 mm glycine, 150 mmNaCl, pH 3.0, for 2 min. The cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 100% ice-cold acetone for 5 min, and analyzed with a ×63 objective on a Carl Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope. The images were resized and saved as 8-bit.tif files by using the commercially available software MetaMorph® Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp., Visitron GmbH, Germany). Cells were seeded into 2.0-cm2wells and grown to 90% confluence with ∼3 × 105cells attached/cm2. The cells were then washed with maintenance medium (MEM) and incubated in the same medium containing125I-labeled Lcn-1 (5 nm) at 4 °C for 2 h. Afterward, cells were washed three times with cold MEM (0.5 ml), warmed up to 37 °C by the addition of prewarmed MEM, and incubated at 37 °C for selected intervals. At each time point, the cells were washed once with ice-cold MEM and treated with a solution containing trypsin (0.5 mg/ml), proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml), and 5 mmEDTA in MEM for 15 min at 4 °C to strip cell surface proteins (15Kounnas M.Z.

The cell suspension was then centrifuged, and the radioactivity associated with cell pellets (defining internalized125I-labeled Lcn-1) was measured. For determination of degradation rate, cells were incubated with 5 nm125I-Lcn-1/well, and the culture medium was collected at various times. The radioactivity appearing in the cell culture medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid was corrected for non-cellular-mediated degradation by subtracting the amount of degradation in control wells lacking cells and was taken to represent degraded ligands. Conventional immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using LIMR-specific primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:100 and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies (DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark). Cell membranes were prepared using the Mem-Per Mammalian Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After transfection with pOPRSVI-AS-LIMR or a control vector, NT2 precursor cells were selected using G418. The presence of the antisense plasmid in genomic DNA was verified by PCR using plasmid-specific primers (data not shown). In a first step, the expression of LIMR in plasmid-transfected and control cells was investigated by Western blot analysis. As indicated in Fig.1 A, no significant expression of LIMR could be detected in AS-NT2 cells. To confirm this result, we performed immunofluorescence analysis using LIMR-specific antibodies. Whereas the control cells showed a clear and specific staining of the cell membrane, a highly reduced staining was observed with the antisense-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). We used ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) to compare the immunofluorescence intensity of pOPRSVI-AS-LIMR-transfected cells and control NT2 cells. We found that the fluorescence intensity of the signal corresponding to the expression of LIMR was reduced by more than 80% in antisense-transfected cells relative to the intensity of the LIMR signal in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C). As described previously, NT2 precursor cells produce a small amount of Lcn-1 present in the medium under the conditions used (17Lechner M. Wojnar P. Redl B. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To test whether there is an effect on the presence of Lcn-1 in the medium of LIMR-deficient cells, we compared this medium with medium from an equal amount of wild type or mock-transfected cells by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, a significant increase in the presence of Lcn-1 was found in the medium of LIMR-deficient cells compared with the controls. This result gave us a first indication that there was an accumulation of Lcn-1 that was probably associated with a block in endocytosis, similar to that described for major urinary protein in megalin-deficient mice (10Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and that LIMR might be an essential factor for Lcn-1 endocytosis. To determine whether LIMR functions to mediate endocytosis of Lcn-1, we compared the ability of NT2 control cells and LIMR-deficient cells to internalize Lcn-1. To visualize the uptake, FITC-Lcn-1 was added to the cultured cells. The cells were fixed and examined by fluorescence microscopy. As demonstrated in Fig.3, fluorescence was seen in discrete granules of the NT2 cells but not in LIMR-deficient cells. To confirm these results and to study the kinetics of endocytosis, cells were incubated in the presence of 125I-Lcn-1 for 2 h at 4 °C to allow binding of radiolabeled ligand. After washing and incubation for various times, the radioactivity associated with the cell pellet was counted. As indicated in Fig.4 A, the bound radioactivity was internalized within 2 h in the NT2 control cells. In contrast to NT2 control cells, no significant uptake of 125I-Lcn-1 could be found in AS-NT2 cells (Fig. 4 A), thus demonstrating that LIMR is essential for endocytosis of Lcn-1 and supporting the result obtained with FITC-Lcn-1. Uptake of 125I-Lcn-1 in NT2 control cells was followed by successive degradation, as indicated by the increasing amount of radioactivity that was secreted into the cell culture medium and soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid (Fig. 4 B). To investigate whether Lcn-1 internalization is a specific feature of NT2 cells or a more general mechanism, we tested another cell line. Because it is known that both LIMR and Lcn-1 are expressed in mammary gland (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Lacazette E. Gachon A.M. Pitiot G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 22: 289-301Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we searched for human breast cells expressing LIMR. It is evident from immunostaining using LIMR antibodies that human T-47D cells (19Keydar I. Chen L. Karby S. Weiss F.R. Delarea J. Radu M. Chatcik S. Brenner H.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1979; 15: 659-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) express LIMR (Fig.5 A). Therefore, this cell line was tested for uptake of FITC-Lcn-1. Fig. 5 D demonstrates that incubation with FITC-Lcn-1 resulted in an intracellular immunostaining similar to that obtained with NT2 cells. Thus, it is evident that Lcn-1 is also internalized by T-47D cells. LIMR was described to be a novel protein with no significant similarity to known proteins (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, we found a number of thus far uncharacterized genes with statistically significant deduced amino acid similarities (Fig.6). These include two proteins from Mus musculus, an uncharacterized protein (GenBankTM accession number AK003656) with an amino acid sequence identity of 94.46% and the Lmbr1 protein with an identity of 57.91% (GenBankTM accession numberAF190665). Dif14 from Homo sapiens (GenBankTMaccession number AF402318), the human counterpart to M. musculus Lmbr1, shows 58.32% identity to LIMR. In addition, putative proteins from Fugu rubripes (GenBankTMaccession number AF056116), Caenorhabditis elegans(GenBankTM accession number NM066446), Drosophila melanogaster (GenBankTM accession number AF132157),Anopheles gambiae strain PEST (GenBankTMaccession number AAAB01008807), Dictyostelium discoideum(GenBankTM accession number AC116982), andArabidopsis thaliana (GenBankTM accession numberAY035091) were found to show amino acid sequence identities of 56.26%, 28.96%, 42.51%, 42.09%, 20.33% and 9.89%, respectively. Interestingly, a detailed comparison of the N terminus of LIMR, which was found by phage-display to be the Lcn-1-interacting domain (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol.

Within this region, there is an amino acid identity of only 12.5% between human LIMR and human Dif14, whereas the overall identity is 58.32%. A similar result is also found comparing the mouse LIMR and the orthologous Lmbr1, with an identity of 37.5% within the N terminus and 57.91% with the entire protein.Figure 6Sequence comparison of LIMR orthologous proteins.

All of them consist of nine transmembrane regions with an outside N terminus and a C terminus orientated toward the cytoplasm. Most noteworthy, all of these proteins contain a large central intracellular loop consisting of 90–150 amino acids. Due to the highly conserved topography and the fact that, at least in human and mouse, two distinct orthologues are present, we propose this group of proteins to be a novel family of membrane proteins. Because LIMR, which is suggested to be the prototype of this protein family, is essential for endocytosis of Lcn-1, it might be speculated that all of these proteins function as endocytic receptors. A prerequisite for understanding the physiological function of lipocalins is some knowledge about the mode of delivering the bound ligands. There is increasing evidence that many lipocalins bind to specific cell receptors. Receptor binding has been demonstrated for α-1-microglobulin (25Wester L. Michaelsson E. Holmdahl R. Olofsson T.

J. 1996; 317: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although this is still a controversial area, there is considerable evidence that retinol-binding protein (RBP) binds to its target cells via specific surface receptors (34Bavik C.O. Eriksson U. Allen R.A. Petersson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14978-14985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sundaram M. Sivaprasadarao A. DeSousa M.M. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol.

Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family (36Saito A. Pietromonaco S. Loo Ak-C. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9725-9729Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, with the exception of megalin, none of these cell receptors has been isolated or characterized on a molecular level. We have recently isolated a novel human cell membrane protein, LIMR, which interacts with Lcn-1 (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lcn-1 is a lipocalin member produced by a number of human secretory glands and tissues that is known to bind a variety of ligands, including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, cholesterol, retinol, retinoic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and arachidonic acid and its peroxidation products (12Redl B. Holzfeind P. Lottspeich F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20282-20287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Glasgow B.J. Abduragimov A.R. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Faull K.F. Hubbell W.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Several biological functions have been proposed for this lipocalin, but its main function seems to be clearance or detoxification of lipophilic, potentially harmful compounds (14Redl B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Lechner M. Wojnar P. Redl B. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have therefore suggested LIMR to be directly involved in this process. However, the exact role of LIMR had to be established. The data presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that LIMR mediates cellular uptake of Lcn-1, thus it has to be characterized as a novel endocytic receptor. In general, several models have been discussed for the ligand transfer from lipocalins to the cell interior, including releases of the ligand upon receptor binding and transport or diffusion through the cell membrane or internalization of the lipocalin-ligand complex by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Another model suggests that the lipocalin-receptor interaction creates a direct signal inducing various physiological processes (37Noy N. Blaner W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6380-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Most experimental data concerning the uptake mechanism of lipocalin ligands came from studies on RBP and its physiological ligand, retinol. Although there are some conflicting reports, it seems that there is a cell type-specific difference in the release of retinol from RBP to the cell interior. In retinal pigment epithelial cells and placental brush-border membranes, it was suggested that RBP remains external to the cell, with only retinol internalized (38Chen C.C. Heller J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5216-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sivaprasadarao A. Boudjelal M. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore the RBP receptor is supposed to act as a channel for retinol. By contrast, in hepatocytes and epithelial kidney cells, RBP was clearly demonstrated to undergo internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation, thereby releasing the retinol (40Senoo H. Strang E. Nilsson A. Kindberg G.M. Berg T. Ross N. Norum K.R. Blomhoff R. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1229-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Malaba L. Smeland S. Senoo H. Norum K.R. Berg T. Blomhoff R. Kindberg G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15686-15692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Megalin seems to be involved in the epithelial endocytic uptake of RBP (42Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytic uptake mediated by megalin was also demonstrated for major urinary protein (10Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), a lipocalin member that binds small natural odorants and is highly secreted by the liver and filtered by the kidney into the urine of adult male mice and rats (43Cavaggioni A. Mucignat-Caretta C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although both LIMR and megalin are involved in endocytic uptake of lipocalins, there is no structural similarity between these proteins. Whereas megalin has the typical structure of the low density lipoprotein receptor family consisting of a large extracellular domain containing different ligand-binding clusters, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (44Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), LIMR consists of a short extracellular domain, nine transmembrane domains interrupted by a large intracellular loop, and an intermediate-length cytoplasmic tail (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Considering that Lcn-1 binds physiological ligands of a number of different chemical classes, cellular internalization of the whole protein-ligand complex would be superior to a mechanism where the ligand is delivered to a receptor. However, as indicated by the results obtained with RBP, it seems that internalization of the protein-ligand complex is also preferred by a lipocalin that is very specific for binding of retinol. In addition, α-1-acid glycoprotein is another lipocalin that was found to be endocytosed by a specific receptor (26Fernandez-Luna J.L. Leyva-Cobain F. Mollinedo F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, internalization of the whole lipocalin-ligand complex seems to be the preferential mechanism. Whether LIMR is a specific lipocalin receptor or rather a multifunctional receptor, similar to megalin, remains to be proven by additional studies. However, in contrast to megalin, which consists of a large ligand binding cluster (45Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), the N-terminal ligand binding domain of Lcn-1 is small, indicating some specificity. In this context, the low amino acid similarity within the N-terminal region of LIMR, which contains the Lcn-1 binding domain, and that of human Dif14 supports this suggestion. It is novel, but not unexpected, that there are a number of genes encoding LIMR orthologous proteins in other organisms, includingM. musculus, F. rubripes, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, C. elegans, andD. disccoideum. Partial cDNA sequences with significant similarities were also found in expressed sequence tag databases fromMacaca mulatta (GenBankTM accession numberBQ807894), Bos taurus (GenBankTM accession number BE685341), Sus scrofa (GenBankTMaccession number BE014550), Rattus norvegicus(GenBankTM accession number BF565677), andXenopus laevis (GenBankTMaccession number BQ732574). Most interestingly, in the human, there is another LIMR orthologous protein called Dif14, encoded on chromosome 7q36 (46Clark R.M. Marker P.C. Kingsley D.M. Genomics. 2000; 67: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas LIMR is encoded on chromosome 12p11 (11Wojnar P. Lechner M. Merschak P. Redl B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20206-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As in human, in mouse there are also two closely related proteins; one is highly similar to human LIMR, whereas the other, Lmbr1, is more similar to human Dif14. Human and mouse Dif14/Lmbr1 is of considerable interest in genetics because it was suggested to be involved in preaxial polydactyly, one of the most frequently observed congenital limb malformations, whereby a disruption of the Dif14/Lmbr1 gene was speculated to be the basis of this malformation (46Clark R.M. Marker P.C. Kingsley D.M. Genomics. 2000; 67: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 47Clark R.M. Marker P.C. Roessler E. Dutra A. Schimenti J.C. Muenke M. Kingsley D.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 715-726PubMed Google Scholar). However, more consistent with the function of an endocytosis receptor, as proposed here, recent work demonstrated that misexpression of a cis-acting regulator located within the same respective intron of the Dif14/Lmbr1 gene is the basis for preaxial polydactyly and that the Lmbr1 gene is incidental to the phenotype (48Lettice L.A. Horikoshi T. Heaney S.J. van Baren M.J. van der Linde H.C. Breedveld G.J. Joosse M. Akarsu N. Oostra B.A. Endo N. Shibata M. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Shinka T. Nakahori Y. Ayusawa D. Nakabayashi K.

The fact that there are orthologous proteins in one and the same organism that are encoded by different chromosomes prompted us to define these proteins as a novel family of putative endocytic receptors. Thus far, this family may be grouped into two branches. According to the amino acid similarities and the deduced dendrogram of a CLUSTAL-W-PHYLIP analysis, the first group consists of H. sapiens LIMR, M. musculus AK003656, and the putative proteins from F. rubripes (AF056116), D. melanogaster (AF132157), and C. elegans(NM066446), whereas the second group consists of H. sapiensDif14, M. musculus Lmbr1, and probably the proteins fromA. gambiae strain PEST (AAAB01008807), D. discoideum (AC116982), and A. thaliana (AY035091).

The two proteins have a similar domain structure and highly homologous catalytic domains, making them an excellent comparative model for understanding the structural basis of substrate recognition by the MMP family. Although the two MMPs exhibit some overlap in substrate recognition, our recent work showed that MMP-2 can cleave a set of peptide substrates that are only poorly recognized by MMP-9 (Chen, E. I., Kridel, S. J., Howard, E. W., Li, W., Godzik, A., and Smith, J. W. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 4485–4491). Mutations at the P2 position of these peptide substrates dramatically reduced their selectivity for MMP-2. Inspection of the corresponding S2 pocket of the substrate-binding cleft of the protease reveals that MMP-9 contains an Asp, whereas MMP-2 contains Glu. Here, we test the hypothesis that this conservative substitution has a role in substrate selectivity. Mutation of Glu412 in MMP-2 to Asp significantly reduced the hydrolysis of selective substrates, with only a minor effect on hydrolysis of non-selective substrates. The predominant effect of the mutation is at the level of kcat, or turnover rate, with reductions reaching as high as 37-fold. The residues that occupy this position in other MMPs are highly variable, providing a potential structural basis for substrate recognition across the MMP family.

T Kreis R.V. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix, Anchor and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 503-562Google Scholar). The MMPs are involved in a wide range of normal biologic processes and have been linked to a number of pathologic events (2Greenwald R.A. Zucker S. Golub L.M.

Because of the associations with disease, a number of synthetic MMP antagonists have been developed and tested in human clinical trials (2Greenwald R.A. Zucker S. Golub L.M.

Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 178-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). One reason for the lack of success probably relates to the relatively broad spectrum of inhibition by the compounds that were tested. For example, the first compound to enter the clinic, Marimastat, has a similar affinity for at least five MMPs. The lack of selectivity of most of the small molecule MMP inhibitors can be traced to the fact that they were designed to exploit features common to all MMPs. These include a zinc ion and the catalytic glutamic acid (9Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar), and especially, the deep S1′ pocket (10Grams F. Reinemer P. Powers J.C. Kleine T. Pieper M. Tschesche H. Huber R. Bode W. Eur. J.

With these ideas in mind, one of the objectives of the present study was to identify regions of the MMP catalytic pockets that contribute to substrate distinction and that could be exploited for the future design of highly selective MMP antagonists. Information on substrate selection by the MMPs could also help explain the unique biological roles of these proteases. MMPs are no longer looked upon as proteases whose action is limited to the destruction of collagen and gelatin in basement membranes. Rather, the MMPs are involved in the control of a number of events where proteolysis must be exerted in a precise manner. For example, MMPs can activate other MMP zymogens (proMMPs) by hydrolyzing propeptide bonds (16Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). They also influence that activity of the serine proteases by selectively degrading their macromolecular inhibitors such as serpin α1-proteinase inhibitor (17Liu Z. Zhou X. Shapiro S.D. Shipley J.M. Twining S.S. Diaz L.A. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 2000; 102: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). MMPs can also influence that action of growth factors by activating and releasing them for their functions (18Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Some MMPs potentiate the action of growth factors by selectively degrading growth factor-binding proteins (19Imai K. Hiramatsu A. Fukushima D. Pierschbacher M.D. Okada Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). All of these functions are presumed to involve a relatively high degree of selectivity among the MMPs for their physiologic substrates. There are also circumstances in which closely related MMPs are present in the same locale but have different roles. For example, both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are expressed within tumors, but only one participates in the angiogenic switch (20Bergers G. Brekken R. Mcmahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). Similar distinctions in the role of these MMPs have also been observed in platelet function (21Fernandez-Patron C. Martinez-Cuesta M.A. Salas E. Sawicki G. Wozniak M. Radomski M.W. Davidge S.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1730-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and in cell migration (22Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that MMP-2 and MMP-9 operate by cleaving distinct substrates. Despite the expanding awareness of selective hydrolysis by the MMPs, the structural basis for such selectivity is still not well understood. In a prior report, we used substrate phage display to gain an in-depth understanding of the substrate recognition properties of MMP-2. We identified a surprising number of highly selective substrates for MMP-2 (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the selective substrates could be segregated into three subfamilies based on their sequences. However, within each family, the P2 residue of substrate was key to selectivity for MMP-2 over MMP-9. The S2 pocket, which interacts with the P2 residue in substrate, is remarkably similar in both enzymes (14Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), save for the presence of Glu412 in MMP-2, which is replaced by an Asp in MMP-9. In fact, our modeling work suggested that Glu412 of MMP-2 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of the selective substrates, a bond that cannot be formed by the shorter Asp in MMP-9. Here we test the importance of the Glu/Asp alteration in substrate recognition. Mutation of Glu412 to Asp has a significant influence on the substrate recognition by MMP-2. The substitution causes a significant reduction inkcat/Km for peptide substrates that are selective for MMP-2 over MMP-9. The reduction inkcat/Km is predominantly driven by a reduction in kcat or the rate of turnover of these substrates. Interestingly however, this Glu/Asp substitution had far less of an effect on substrates that were recognized equally well by the two MMPs. In these cases, only a minor reduction in kcat (and correspondingly,kcat/Km) was observed. The deleterious effect of the Glu/Asp substitution on hydrolysis of selective substrates was also observed on EphB1, a protein substrate that we have found to be selectively cleaved by MMP-2 in vitro. The results of the Glu412/Asp mutation provide further proof that selective and non-selective substrates for MMP-2 dock via different contact points within the catalytic cleft. Altogether, the findings of this report substantiate the hypothesis that Glu412 in the S2 subsite of the MMP-2 is a key residue in conferring hydrolysis of selective substrates. The study also raises the interesting hypothesis that selectivity between MMP-2 and MMP-9 arises because MMP-9 is a “slower” protease than MMP-2. Ilomastat was purchased from AMS Scientific (Concord, CA). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Tissue culture media and reagents were from Irvine Scientific (Irvine, CA). All other reagents, chemicals, and plastic ware were from Sigma or Fisher. The complexes between MMP-2 and the peptide substrates were modeled using the Sybyl package from Tripos (www.tripos.com). The coordinates of MMP-2 are from the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank accession number 1qib). For docking, the initial structure of each peptide was built in an extended conformation within the catalytic cleft of the protease. Since the binding pocket of the enzyme is known, and some interactions between the protein and site around P1′ of the substrate are obvious, these interactions were used as restrictions in the modeling procedure. The anchoring restrictions included a hydrogen bond between the NH group of P1′ and the oxygen atom of Ala165, the hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of P1′ and the NH group of Ala165, the interaction between the side chain of P1′, and the hydrophobic patch of MMP-2 comprised of Val198 and its surroundings. The substrate was first placed at the binding cleft at a position favoring the formation of bonds making up these restrictions. Under these constraints, the initial conformation of the substrate resembled an antiparallel औ-strand lying against the neighboring औ-strand in the catalytic cleft of MMP-2. Then a conformation search of the substrate was performed with only two restrictions: (i) P1′ was maintained as the anchor point and (ii) the center (Cα atom) of P1′ remained fixed during the modeling. Since there are no known correlations between the conformation of substrate on opposite sides of the P1′ position (the anchoring point), the conformational searches of the N terminus and C terminus were run separately. To reduce the complexity of computation, the searches were done in torsion angle space, where the bond length and bond angles of the whole substrate remained fixed. The model of substrates within the cleft of MMP-9 were generated in a similar manner, except that the structure of MMP-9 was first modeled on the crystal structure of MMP-2 as described previously (23Chen E.I.

The mutations of Glu412 to Asp in the MMP-2 catalytic domain was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). Oligonucleotides used for generating mutated MMP-2 were 5′-AAG CTT ATG GAG GCG CTA ATG GCC CG-3′ and 5′-CGC CAT GGG GCT GGA TCA CTC CCA AGA CCC-3′. Each pair of oligonucleotides was annealed to the denatured template plasmid encoding the catalytic domain of MMP-2. Subsequently, the mutated MMP-2 was generated by PCR amplification of cDNA from these complexes. The mutations were verified by sequencing the newly generated catalytic cDNA. The mutated MMP-2 was subcloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cDNA encoding the mutated catalytic domain of MMP-2 was used to transfect HEK 293 cells. Individual antibiotic-resistant clones were isolated with cloning discs, expanded, and then screened by reverse transcription-PCR and zymography. The mutated catalytic domains of MMP-2 were purified from conditioned medium by the method described previously (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The purity of the mutant MMP-2 was greater than 907 judging by silver-stained acrylamide gels. The purified mutant MMP-2 was stored at −70 °C at concentrations of ∼0.3 mg/ml. For kinetic studies, the mutated MMP-2 was activated and active site-titrated as described previously (23Chen E.I.

The kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis were measured using a fluorescamine incorporation assay (24Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The method for determining the Km and kcatof peptide hydrolysis was described previously (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recombinant fusion proteins between EphB1, EphB2, and the Fc domain of IgG were purchased from R&D systems Inc. The fusion proteins (1.8 ॖm) were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 280 nm of wild type MMP-2, wild type MMP-9, or MMP-2E412D. Following incubation, samples were resolved by 107 SDS-PAGE, and samples were visualized by Coomassie staining. Previously, we observed that the residue at the P2 position within peptide substrates has a major role in determining the selectivity of the peptide for MMP-2 versusMMP-9 (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A key distinction between MMP-2 and MMP-9 is the substitution of a Glu for an Asp within the S2 subsite, and we suggested that this substitution could account for differences in substrate recognition. To test this hypothesis, we mutated Glu412 to Asp in a construct encoding the catalytic domain of MMP-2. The mutated MMP-2 was expressed in HEK 293 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutated MMP-2 was expressed at levels similar to wild type MMP-2 and could be purified by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose. To ensure that kinetic parameters were accurately calculated, the amount of properly folded MMP was quantified by active site titration with the small molecule inhibitor, Ilomastat, as described under “Experimental Procuedures.” Both proteins had similar levels of catalytic activity per mg of purified protein. We measured the ability of wild type and MMP-2E412D to hydrolyze non-selective peptides substrates that contain the PXXL motif (TableI). Only minor changes were observed in the kcat/Km values for peptides such as C15 and m1A11, which display no selectivity between MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Table I). In contrast, however, the E412D mutation had significant and consistent effects on the hydrolysis of a panel of peptides that were found previously to be selective for MMP-2 (Table II). Each of the selective peptides has a higherkcat/Km ratio for MMP-2 than for MMP-9. In all cases, the mutation of Glu to Asp caused a decrease in the kcat/Km such that the ratio for the mutant falls between the value for MMP2 and MMP-9. This observation is consistent with the fact that the E412D mutation alters the structure of the catalytic pocket to more closely resemble that of MMP-9.Table IHydrolysis of non-selective peptide substrates by MMP-2E412DPeptideSequenceMMP-2MMP-2E412DMMP-9kcat/Kmkcat/Kmkcat/Kmm−1s−1m−1s−1m−1s−1m1A11SGKIPRR ↓ LTA3.8E + 043.7E + 042.5E + 04C15SGKGPRQ ↓ ITA8.4E + 045.1E + 045.4E + 04The hydrolysis of synthetic peptides by each MMP was quantified using procedures outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” For each protease, hydrolysis was measured across a concentration range of peptide.

Each measurement was repeated at least three times and the relative error forkcat/Km and forkcat independently less than 107. Interestingly, the primary effect of the mutation seemed to be at the level of kcat, a parameter that was decreased for all of the selective peptides. Decreases inkcat ranged from 3 to 36-fold, in most cases approximating the values we have measured for MMP-9. In contrast, the effects of the E412D mutation on Km were less consistent. We observed this parameter to increase and decrease depending on the peptide being tested. Consequently, the E412D mutation in the S2 pocket appears to primarily affect the rate of substrate turnover. One peptide was identified that has an increasedkcat/Km ratio for the E412D mutant of MMP-2. This peptide, A13R, was originally synthesized and characterized in our prior report on substrates selective for MMP-2 (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The parent peptide, A13, contains the SX ↓ L motif that is selective for MMP-2, but A13R contains the RX ↓ L sequence and is cleaved better by MMP-9. Here, we compared the rate of hydrolysis of the A13R peptide with all three of the MMPs (Fig.1). In three independent replications of this experiment, the rate of peptide hydrolysis by MMP-9 and by MMP-2E412D was higher than that of wild type MMP-2. This finding provides further support for the idea that mutation of Glu412 to Asp shifts the substrate recognition of MMP-2 closer to that of MMP-9. Because the hydrolysis of this peptide by MMP-2E412D is better than that of wild type MMP-2, the observation also excludes the possibility that the mutation within MMP-2 simply causes general diminution in proteolytic activity. The EphB1 receptor tyrosine kinase contains the SXL motif and is selectively cleaved by MMP-2 (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In fact, we found that this protein is generally resistant to hydrolysis by MMP-9. Here we tested the ability of MMP-2E412D to hydrolyze EphB1 (Fig. 2). The EphB1 fusion protein was incubated with equimolar amounts (280 nm) of wild type MMP-2, mutated MMP-2, and MMP-9 for 4 h. The quantity of each protease was measured by active site titration prior to initiating the experiment. The extent of hydrolysis of EphB1 was gauged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The EphB1-Fc fusion protein was almost quantitatively cleaved by MMP-2 (Fig. 2, lane 2). As expected, MMP-9 had no effect on the migration of the protein, indicating a lack of hydrolysis (Fig. 2, lane 4). Interestingly, the hydrolysis of the EphB1-Fc fusion protein by MMP-2E412D fell between that of wild type MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 2, lane 3). This result is consistent with the observations made with the panel of peptide substrates and corroborates the conclusion that the E412D mutation shifts the phenotype of the protease away from that of MMP-2 and toward that of MMP-9. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are considered to be close homologs because of their unique domain structure and their high sequence similarity and because they both have gelatinase activity. Nevertheless, the two proteases clearly have distinct biological functions. In many instances, the two proteases have different effects even when they are analyzed in the same biological system (21Fernandez-Patron C. Martinez-Cuesta M.A. Salas E. Sawicki G. Wozniak M. Radomski M.W. Davidge S.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1730-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Consequently, it follows that MMP-2 and MMP-9 are likely to cleave different substrates. We have recently begun to examine differences in the way that MMPs recognize peptide substrates. This analysis places focus on structural and functional distinctions at the catalytic cleft, a region that has generally been overlooked as a feature that can distinguish one MMP from another. In fact, early comparisons of peptide substrates for MMP-2 and MMP-9 showed that they each cleaved the same set of collagen-like peptide substrates (25Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.X. Moore W.G. Navre M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a finding that indicates structural and functional similarity at the catalytic pocket. Nevertheless, we recently made the observation that MMP-2 and MMP-9 recognize distinct sets of peptide substrates (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We found that both MMP-2 and MMP-9 hydrolyze peptides with the canonical recognition motif PXXXHy, as originally described by Netzel-Arnett et al. (25Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.X. Moore W.G. Navre M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but we also found MMP-2 to uniquely recognize three additional sets of peptide substrates. Like the canonical motif, the three other families of substrates all contain a hydrophobic residue at the P1′ position, but they lack the characteristic proline at P3. In an extension of this study, we found that the substrates selective for MMP-2 could be converted to substrates for MMP-9 by inserting Arg into the P2 position (23Chen E.I. Kridel S.J. Howard E.W. Li W. Godzik A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This finding underscored the significance of the P2 position within substrate and strongly suggested that the corresponding S2 subsite within the catalytic clefts of MMP-2 and MMP-9 must interact differently with substrate. Interestingly, the S2 subsite contains one of the few differences between the catalytic clefts of the two MMPs; Glu412 of MMP-2 is replaced by Asp410 in MMP-9. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that this conservative substitution accounts for the distinct substrate recognition profiles of the two enzymes. We swapped this residue by mutating each protease. Although we were able to express the mutated MMP-2, the mutant MMP-9 could not be expressed (see below). Consequently, most of our discussion focuses on results obtained with the mutant of MMP-2. The mutated MMP-2 was expressed to high levels in HEK 293 cells, could be purified on gelatin-agarose affinity columns, and exhibited gelatinase activity in zymography gels. In addition, the E412D mutant hydrolyzed substrates with the canonical PXXXHy recognition motif to essentially the same degree as wild type MMP-2. This is to be expected since MMP-9, which displays the Asp rather than Glu at this position, also hydrolyzes this subfamily of substrates with high efficiency. In conjunction with the fact that the mutation is conservative and represents a sequence found in the closest homolog, these observations allow us to exclude the possibility that substitution of Glu for Asp at position 412 causes a general diminution of catalysis by forcing improper folding. The E412D mutation had substantial effects on the hydrolysis of peptide substrates that are selective for MMP-2. The mutation significantly reduced the kcat/Km ratio for all of the MMP-2-selective substrates. Reductions to thekcat/Km ratio were primarily driven by reductions to the turnover rate, kcat, which was reduced in every case. Changes in both directions were observed for Km, so the E412D mutation has no uniform influence on binding affinity. The E412D mutation also extended to larger protein substrates. We recently demonstrated that the extracellular domain of the EphB1 receptor tyrosine kinase is cleaved by MMP-2, but not by MMP-9. The ability of the E412D mutant of MMP-2 to cleave EphB1 fell in between that of wild type MMP-2 and MMP-9, indicating the mutation shifted the function of the protease closer to that of MMP-9. This is taken as another indication that the Glu412/Asp410 alteration has a role in substrate distinction. Altogether the results of this study suggest a structural basis for the role of the S2 subsite in substrate recognition and catalysis. In large part, our results support the idea that the S2 subsite can engage in two types of interactions that depend on the composition of the substrate (Figs. 3 and4). When Arg is present at P2, substrates show selectivity for MMP-2 and MMP-9 over other MMPs (26Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this case, the Arg in the substrate extends far enough into the S2 subsite to interact favorably with the side chains of both Asp in MMP-9 or the Glu in MMP-2 (Fig. 3). Because Arg at this position decreases Km (26Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we suggest that the salt bridge that Arg forms with the side chains of Glu or Asp increases binding affinity for the protease (Fig. 3). A second type of interaction at the S2 subsite is likely with the peptides that lack Arg and are selectively cleaved by MMP-2. In the absence of Arg at P2, only the Glu of MMP-2 extends far enough into the S2 pocket to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone of bound substrate (Fig. 4A), a concept that is generally supported by our mutational studies. The corresponding Asp in MMP-9 fails to extend far enough into the pocket to make a similar contact (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, our findings also suggest that a switch to this binding mode in MMP-2 changes the overall effect of the S2 subsite on substrate recognition. Rather than playing a role in binding affinity, the hydrogen bond between Glu412and the backbone of bound substrate influenceskcat, indicating that it helps to properly position the substrate for optimal catalysis.Figure 4Substrates lacking Arg at P2 are selective for MMP-2. The model shows MMP-2 (A) and MMP-9 (B) bound to the B74 substrate, which is selective for MMP-2. The distinct interactions at the S2 subsite are highlighted with a circle. Glu412 within MMP-2 is capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the backbone of substrate. In contrast, the side chain of Asp410 in MMP-9 cannot extend far enough into the cleft to make this bond.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although our findings strongly support the role of the Glu412/Asp410 substitution in determining substrate recognition by the two MMPs, this mutation alone was not sufficient to completely convert the recognition profile of MMP-2 to that of MMP-9. Consequently other factors must be involved. These are likely to include cooperativity among other subsites where subtle differences exist or a global difference in the shape of the catalytic pocket that is governed by sequence differences outside of the catalytic cleft. A resolution to this particular issue will require a three-dimensional structure for MMP-9. The importance of the residue corresponding to Glu412 in the S2 subsite may extend across the MMP family. Most of the residues surrounding the S2 subsite are strictly conserved among all MMPs (Fig. 5). The two histidines that flank the subsite and the glycine in the center of the subsite are conserved across all family members. In contrast, the position taken by Glu412 in MMP-2 is highly variable. It is occupied by acidic residues, large hydrophobic residues, and in some cases, glycine (Fig. 5). The distinctions among these residues are likely to have an influence on substrate recognition by each MMP. Certainly an analysis of the analogous substitution within MMP-9 would be informative. However, we were unable to express this mutant, although we tested a number of different host cell types. Although the inability to express this mutation may seem surprising given the extensive homology between MMP-2 and MMP-9, there may be a mechanistic basis for this observation. It is well established that the MMPs require the propeptide, which inserts into the catalytic cleft via a cysteine switch, for proper folding (27Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 28Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). We suspect that this mutant of MMP-9 cannot be expressed because it interferes with the insertion of the propeptide into the catalytic cleft during synthesis. This hypothesis is based on inspection of the crystal structure of MMP-2 with the propeptide inserted into the cleft. In MMP-2, Glu412 extends up from the floor of the cleft to within 3–4 angstroms of the side chain of Asn109. In MMP-9, the corresponding residues are Arg (longer than Asn) and Asp (shorter than Glu). The Arg in the propeptide of MMP-9 would be expected to extend further into the catalytic cleft than Asn. Such positioning would likely be favorable with Asp in the S2subsite. However, mutation of Asp410 to Glu, which would extend further into the cleft, is likely to interfere with insertion of Arg in the MMP-9 propeptide. Such interference would be likely to prevent proper folding of the mutated MMP-9 and cause its degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2055232500,"Studies of cardiac muscle gene expression and signaling have been hampered by the lack of immortalized cardiomyocyte cell lines capable of proliferation and irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle. With the goal of creating such cell lines, we generated transgenic mice using cardiac-specific <i>cis-</i>regulatory elements from the mouse <i>Nkx2.5</i> gene to drive the expression of a simian virus 40 large T-antigen (TAg) gene flanked by sites for recombination by Cre recombinase. These transgenic mice developed tumors within the ventricular myocardium. Cells isolated from these tumors expressed cardiac markers and proliferated rapidly during serial passage in culture, without apparent senescence. However, they were unable to exit the cell cycle and failed to exhibit morphological features of terminal differentiation. Introduction of Cre recombinase to these cardiac cell lines by adenoviral delivery resulted in the elimination of TAg expression, accompanied by rapid cessation of cell division, and increase in cell size without an apparent induction of cellular differentiation. Incubation of cells lacking TAg in serum-deficient media with various pharmacological agents (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or bone morphogenetic protein-2/4) or constitutively active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I and/or calcineurin led to the formation of sarcomeres and up-regulation of cardiac genes involved in excitation-contraction coupling. The combination of TAg expression under the control of an early cardiac promoter and Cre-mediated recombination allowed us to derive an immortal cell line from the ventricular myocardium that could be controllably withdrawn from the cell cycle. The conditional expression of TAg in this manner permits propagation and regulated growth termination of cell types that are otherwise unable to be maintained in cell culture and may have applications for cardiac repair technologies."

This association with a protein involved in meiotic and mitotic recombination and DNA double-stranded break repair suggests a similar role for BRCA2. Further support for a role in DNA repair comes from the observation that cells expressing a wild type BRCA2 BRC4 domain show hypersensitivity to γ-irradiation, an inability to form RAD51 radiation-induced foci, and a failure of radiation-induced G2/M, but not G1/S, checkpoint control (8Chen C.F.

Moreover, cells expressing mutant BRCA2 are more sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage than cells expressing wild type BRCA2 (9Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Animal models have also been used to demonstrate an association between BRCA2 and the DNA damage response.Brca2-null mouse embryos that do not survive past day 8 of embryogenesis are highly sensitive to γ-irradiation (7Sharan S.K.

Similarly, mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines derived from viable brca2 −/− animals are highly sensitive to DNA damage induced by a number of agents (10Patel K.J. Yu V.P. Lee H. Corcoran A.

BRCA2 has also been directly implicated in homologous recombination and gene conversion using CAPAN-1 BRCA2 mutant cell lines and homozygous mutant brca2 embryonic stem cells (12Moynahan M.E.

Randrianarison V. Marot D. Cabannes J. Perricaudet M. Feunteun J. Sarasin A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5548-5552PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, the C terminus of BRCA2 has been shown to bind directly to single-stranded DNA and to promote strand transfer and RAD51 loading onto DNA during homologous recombination (15Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The finding that BRCA2 was involved in the response to DNA damage led to the hypothesis that DNA damage might result in the induction of BRCA2 expression. However, the opposite has proven true. Specifically, BRCA2 mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines after exposure to various DNA-damaging agents including adriamycin (ADR)1and camptothecin (16Andres J.L. Fan S. Turkel G.J. Wang J.A. Twu N.F. Yuan R.Q. Lamszus K. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Fan S. Twu N.F. Wang J.A. Yuan R.Q. Andres J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize this response to DNA damage better we investigated whether ADR and other DNA-damaging agents affected BRCA2 promoter activity and BRCA2 mRNA and protein levels. Here we show that ADR down-regulates theBRCA2 promoter in a p53-dependent manner by inhibiting binding of a USF transcription factor complex to the minimalBRCA2 promoter. In addition, we demonstrate that ADR alters BRCA2 mRNA and protein stability in a p53-dependent manner, resulting in a significant reduction in BRCA2 mRNA and protein levels. This suggests that BRCA2 levels are regulated tightly in response to DNA damage. The preparation of a series of pGL3 luciferase reporter constructs (Promega) containing partial fragments of theBRCA2 promoter has been described previously (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the wild type p53 cDNA (wtp53) was provided by Wilma Lingle. CMV-USF1 and USF2-VP16 expression constructs were provided by Michele Sawadogo and Howard Towle, respectively. An R273L dominant negative p53 mutant construct (dnp53) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wtp53 construct using the QuikChange kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers for the site-directed mutagenesis were 5′-GGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCTTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAGGACAGGCACAAACAAGCACCTCAAAGCTGTTCC-3′ (reverse). Plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies, and the presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HCT116/p53+/+ and HCT116/p53−/− cells were provided by Junjie Chen. HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells were provided by Wafik El-Deiry. MCF7/pCMV and MCF7/E6 cells were provided by Scott H. Kaufmann. All other cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells, human colon carcinoma SW480 cells, HCT116/p53+/+cells, HCT116/p53−/−, cells and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human osteosarcoma p53-null Saos2 cells were propagated in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 15% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. T47D, MCF7/pCMV, and MCF7/E6 breast adenocarcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MCF-10A cells were maintained in MEGM (Clonetics). Transient transfections were performed in six-well plates using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 0.5–2.0 μg of BRCA2 promoter luciferase reporter construct and 0.1 μg of pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase control vector (Promega). For ADR (Sigma) treatment experiments, cells were transfected, grown for 24 h, and exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, or 10 μm ADR for 1 h in standard medium. The cells were washed with serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C in fresh culture medium for another 24 h or the indicated time. Because less than 10% of any cell type exhibited a toxic response to 5 μm ADR, drug toxicity had no effect on the outcome of the study. In cotransfection experiments, cells were also transfected with 0.5 μg of wtp53, dnp53, USF1, USF2-VP16, or pcDNA3.1 control. Protein lysates were prepared from the cells, and luciferase activities were measured as described previously (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Renillaluciferase activity from a cotransfected pRL-TK control vector was used for normalization. In some lower dose experiments cells were exposed to 0.7 μm ADR for 24 h, or the indicated time, in standard medium and processed immediately. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing bp −10 to −35 of the BRCA2 promoter and either a wild type or mutated USF binding site (−20 to −13) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used in EMSAs (18Wu K.

Double-stranded DNA probes were purified from the reaction mixture using a Bio-Gel P-100 column (Bio-Rad), incubated with whole cell extract from MCF7 cells, and separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (18Wu K.

Supershift assays using anti-USF1 (Santa Cruz), and anti-USF2 (Santa Cruz) antibodies were also performed as described previously (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, wtp53, or dnp53 expression constructs or exposed to 5 μm ADR for 1 h. After further incubation for 24 h, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated. RNA samples (1.5 μg/lane) were used for Northern blotting as described previously (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, and then lysed at 4 °C for 1 h in EBC buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Equal aliquots of cell lysate (30–100 μg/lane) were electrophoresed through 7 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after incubating for 15 min at 65 °C in 1× loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) and blocked in TBST with 5% bovine albumin (fraction V) (ICN Biomedicals). Membranes were blotted with anti-BRCA2 (Ab2, Oncogene Research), anti-USF1 (Santa Cruz) or anti-p53 (Santa Cruz) antibodies and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). MCF7 cells treated with ADR were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and fixed in ice-cold 95% ethanol at −20 °C for 12 h. The fixed cells were permeabilized and stained with 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 40 μg/ml propidium iodide at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were processed with VERITY ModFit software, version 5.2, for DNA distribution analysis. MCF7 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma) and 5 μm ADR for 1 h. Medium was removed, and cells were incubated further in the presence or absence of α-amanitin. Total RNA was extracted from the cells by standard methods after different periods of incubation. Total cDNA was prepared by oligo(dT) priming of 1 μg of RNA template from each time point using the cDNA preamplification kit (Invitrogen). The amount of BRCA2 mRNA present in the cells at each time point was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR using oligonucleotide primer pairs from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the BRCA2 cDNA. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The BRCA2 forward primer was 5′-CAAGCAGATGATGTTTCCTGTCC; BRCA2 reverse, 5′-AGAACTAAGGGTGGGTGGTGTAGC; BRCA2 forward, 3′-GCAGTGAAGAATGCAGCAGA; BRCA2 reverse, 3′-CAATACGCAACTTCCACACG; GAPDH forward, CAACTACATGGTTTACATGTTC; GAPDH reverse, GCCA- GTGGACTCCACGAC. PCR products were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, stained with Sybr Green, and scanned on a PhosphorImager. MCF7 cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide and 5 μm ADR for 1 h. Medium was removed, and cells were incubated further in the presence of cycloheximide. Total protein was extracted from the cells by standard methods after different periods of incubation, and Western blotting with the BRCA2 Ab-2 antibody was performed. The intensities of Western blot signals were quantitated by densitometry using NIH Image software, version 1.62. ADR has recently been shown to down-regulate BRCA2 mRNA levels in human breast cancer cells such as MCF7 (16Andres J.L. Fan S. Turkel G.J. Wang J.A. Twu N.F. Yuan R.Q. Lamszus K. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To address whether the reduction in BRCA2 mRNA levels by ADR is dependent on BRCA2 promoter regulation, MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with aBRCA2 promoter reporter gene construct (pGL3Prom) (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and exposed to various concentrations of ADR for 1 h. After removal of the drug and further propagation for 24 h, cell lysates were harvested for luciferase reporter assays. As shown in Fig.1 A, ADR treatment reducedBRCA2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, with 5 μm ADR down-regulating the promoter activity by 85%. Similar effects of ADR treatment on theBRCA2 promoter were detected in both MCF10A normal breast epithelial cells (Fig. 1 B) and U2OS osteosarcoma cells (data not shown). Continuous exposure of MCF7 cells to lower doses of ADR (0.7 μm) for 24 h also reduced promoter activity by 60% (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, treatment of MCF7 cells with 5 μm ADR for 1 h resulted in a gradual reduction in promoter activity over time (Fig. 1 D). Thus, ADR appears to repress the BRCA2 promoter in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in both tumor and normal cell lines. To confirm that the ADR-dependent repression was specific to the BRCA2 promoter and was not a result of a generalized effect on gene transcription, several other reporter constructs were evaluated using luciferase assays. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with reporter constructs containing the Rous sarcoma virus, CMV, nuclear factor-κΒ, and β-galactosidase promoters and treated with 5 μm ADR. No repression of these promoters was observed (data not shown), suggesting that ADR specifically represses the BRCA2 promoter. ADR is a potent DNA-damaging agent that induces p53 accumulation and p53-dependent cell death in wtp53-expressing cell lines (19Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Given that ADR regulates theBRCA2 promoter and induces p53, we investigated whether ADR down-regulates the BRCA2 promoter in a p53-dependent manner. Initially, BRCA2 reporter assays were performed in p53-positive U2OS and p53-null Saos2 osteosarcoma cells in an effort to address the role of p53 in regulation of the promoter while minimizing tissue-specific differences. Treatment with either 5 μm ADR for 1 h or 0.7 μm ADR for 24 h did not affect BRCA2 promoter activity in Saos2 cells, whereas inhibition of the promoter was observed in U2OS cells (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, ADR treatment of matched p53-null (HCT116/p53−/−) and p53 wild type (HCT116/p53+/+) HCT116 cells resulted in repression of the BRCA2 promoter in p53 wild type cells but not in p53-null or mutant cells (Fig. 2 B). In addition, reporter assays were performed in MCF7 cells stably expressing either the human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 gene (MCF7/E6) or a CMV vector control (MCF7/CMV). The E6 protein stimulates degradation of p53 through a ubiquitin pathway (20Kessis T.D. Slebos R.J. Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Plunkett B.S. Han S.M. Lorincz A.T. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), resulting in very low levels of p53 expression in these cells. Reduced levels of p53 in MCF7/E6 cells was verified by Western blotting (data not shown). A decrease inBRCA2 promoter activity in response to ADR treatment was only detected in the MCF7/CMV cells (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data suggest that repression of BRCA2promoter activity by ADR is dependent on the presence of wtp53. Given that ADR-associated repression of the BRCA2promoter is dependent on p53, it seemed likely that p53 could regulate the BRCA2 promoter independently of ADR treatment. To address this hypothesis a series of BRCA2 promoter reporter assays was performed in MCF7 and Saos2 cells transiently transfected with wtp53, dnp53, or a pcDNA 3.1 vector control. Wtp53 expression in MCF7 (Fig. 2 D) and Saos2 cells (Fig. 2 E) reduced BRCA2 promoter activity 10-fold relative to a vector control, and transfection of increasing concentrations of wtp53 into these cells resulted in dose-dependent repression of the promoter (data not shown). In contrast, ectopic expression of the dnp53 mutant markedly up-regulated the BRCA2 promoter (Fig.2 D). This apparent induction of promoter activity is likely caused by dnp53-associated inactivation of endogenous p53 and consequent relief of repression. Thus, wtp53 appears to have a specific inhibitory effect on the BRCA2 promoter. To evaluate further the relevance of p53 to the ADR response, we repeated these reporter assays in the presence of ADR. As before, ADR treatment caused significant down-regulation of BRCA2promoter activity in vector-transfected MCF7 cells, but had no effect in Saos2 cells (Fig. 2, D and E). However, when wtp53-transfected MCF7 cells were treated with ADR a 40-fold down-regulation of the promoter, or 2-fold greater repression than with wtp53 expression alone, was observed (Fig. 2 D). The lack of a synergistic effect between ADR and wtp53 expression is further support for the concept that wtp53 and ADR influence theBRCA2 promoter through a common signaling pathway. We also evaluated whether other DNA-damaging agents associated with induction or stabilization of wtp53 were capable of repressing the BRCA2 promoter. MCF7 cells were treated with 30 μg/ml mitomycin C (MMC), 10 ng/ml actinomycin D, 5–10 μm camptothecin, 10 J/m2 UV irradiation, and 2–10 Grays of γ-irradiation, and luciferase assays were performed. MMC and actinomycin D repressed the BRCA2 promoter similarly to ADR, whereas the other agents had no apparent effect. In contrast, none of the agents had an effect on the BRCA2 promoter in the p53-null Saos2 and p53 mutant T47D cell lines (Fig. 2 F). These data suggest that only certain DNA-damaging agents can repress the BRCA2 promoter and that the effect is uniformly dependent on the presence of wtp53. To confirm an in vivo effect of ADR and wtp53 on endogenous BRCA2 expression, BRCA2 mRNA levels were measured in MCF7 and Saos2 cells treated with 5 μm ADR. BRCA2 expression was decreased substantially in MCF7 cells but was not affected in Saos2 cells after ADR treatment (Fig.3 A). Similarly, ectopic expression of wtp53 resulted in decreased BRCA2 expression in MCF7 and Saos2 cells, and the combination of ADR and wtp53 expression did not appear to have a synergistic effect. In addition, BRCA2 mRNA levels were not substantially affected by ADR treatment of MCF7 cells ectopically expressing dnp53 (Fig. 3 B). The combination of these data and the results from the reporter assays described above strongly suggest that ADR and wtp53 can regulate BRCA2 expressionin vivo through inhibition of BRCA2 promoter activity. Although ADR appears to down-regulate BRCA2promoter activity and BRCA2 expression levels, down-regulation of BRCA2 protein levels must also be evident to speculate that ADR-dependent repression of BRCA2 transcription can affect BRCA2 function. To evaluate the effect of ADR on in vivoBRCA2 protein levels, MCF7, U2OS, and MCF10A cell lines were treated with 5 μm ADR. As shown in Fig.4 A, BRCA2 levels were decreased significantly in ADR-treated cells. In addition, the amount of BRCA2 in MCF7 cells decreased in a dose-responsive manner after treatment with 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0 μm ADR (Fig.4 B). The expected dose-dependent increase in p53 levels was also observed. To evaluate whether ADR treatment had a time-dependent effect on BRCA2 protein expression, MCF7 cells were treated with 5 μm ADR for 1 h, and BRCA2 protein levels were measured over a 24-h period. A gradual decrease in BRCA2 levels over time was observed with the most significant changes occurring between 5 and 11 h post-treatment (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, the decrease in BRCA2 correlated inversely with changes in p53 levels. Similar results were obtained in response to continuous treatment with 0.7 μm ADR over a 24-h period, although the most significant changes in BRCA2 and p53 were delayed and occurred between 9 and 13 h after initiation of treatment (Fig.4 D). Next we evaluated whether the effect of ADR on BRCA2 protein levels was dependent on p53. Matched p53-null (HCT116/p53−/−) and p53 wild type (HCT116/p53+/+) HCT116 cells, matched MCF7/E6 and MCF7/CMV cells, SW480 p53 mutant cells, and Saos2 p53-null cells were treated with 5 μm ADR, and cell lysates were Western blotted for BRCA2 with the Ab2 antibody. As shown in Fig.4 E, an ADR-dependent reduction in BRCA2 protein levels was observed in cells expressing wtp53 but not in p53-null or p53 mutant cells. Further analysis showed that ectopic expression of wtp53 in Saos2 cells (Fig. 4 F) and MCF7 cells (data not shown) also caused a significant reduction in BRCA2 levels. When combining all of these data, it is evident that there is a strong correlation between the effects of ADR and p53 on BRCA2 protein levels and on BRCA2 promoter activity. Having determined that ADR and p53 repress BRCA2 promoter activity, we sought to understand the mechanism of repression. We began by identifying the ADR-responsive region within the BRCA2 promoter using a series of luciferase reporter constructs containing deleted forms of an 8-kb form of the BRCA2 promoter in reporter assays (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells were transfected with the various constructs, and luciferase activities were measured before and after treatment with 5 μm ADR. All promoter constructs that contained the minimal promoter, located between nucleotides −58 and −1, were repressed equivalently by ADR treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the ADR-responsivecis-element is located in the minimal BRCA2promoter. However, as deletion of the minimal promoter between −58 and −19 eliminated basal promoter activity (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we could not directly evaluate the role of this region in the ADR response. To overcome this problem a series of promoter reporter constructs containing substitution mutations in the putative ATF and MLTF binding sites, in the known USF-binding element, and in the two repeats of the GCGTCACG tandem repeat sequence within the −58 to −19 region of theBRCA2 promoter was used (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs containing the mutated −13 to −20 USF transcription factor binding site and the overlapping −17 to −24 repeat sequence were 3-fold less repressed in the presence of ADR than any other reporter construct (data not shown). Similar results were obtained after ectopic expression of wtp53. These data suggest that this USF binding site that has been implicated previously in regulation of basal activity of theBRCA2 promoter (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also regulates the response to ADR and wtp53. To determine whether the USF transcription factor is directly involved in p53- and ADR-dependent regulation of BRCA2promoter activity, the ability of USF to bind to the BRCA2promoter was evaluated. Two 26-bp (−10 to −35) oligonucleotide probes containing either a wild type or mutated USF binding site (18Wu K. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were used in gel shift assays with lysates from MCF7 cells that had been treated with Me2SO or 5 μm ADR. As shown in Fig. 5 A, a specific protein complex bound to the wild type oligonucleotide but not to the mutant oligonucleotide and the ability of this complex to bind DNA decreased over time when cells were treated with ADR (Fig. 5 A). To determine whether wtp53 was needed for ADR-dependent inhibition of complex formation, we repeated the gel shift assays using lysates from matched Saos2 and U2OS cells, matched HCT116/p53−/− and HCT116/p53+/+ cells, and matched MCF7/CMV and MCF7/E6 cells (Fig. 5, B–D). A similar protein-oligonucleotide complex was evident in all cells, but the relative intensity of the complex was significantly greater in p53 mutant or p53-null cells than in matched cells with endogenous wtp53. Moreover, exposure to ADR further reduced the intensity of the protein·DNA complex in wtp53-expressing cells but had no effect in p53-null or mutant cells (Fig. 5, B–D). In addition, complex formation was reduced substantially by ectopic expression of wtp53, similarly to the ADR treatment, but was enhanced by expression of dnp53. This suggests that dnp53 inactivates endogenous or induced wtp53 and prevents p53-dependent inhibition of complex formation (Fig. 5 E).

Kv1.4 channels exhibit rapid “ball-and-chain”-type inactivation gating. Different from all other Kvα subunits, Kv1.4 harbors two inactivation domains at its N terminus. Here we report the solution structure and function of this “tandem inactivation domain” using NMR spectroscopy and patch clamp recordings. Inactivation domain 1 (ID1, residues 1–38) consists of a flexible N terminus anchored at a 5-turn helix, whereas ID2 (residues 40–50) is a 2.5-turn helix made up of small hydrophobic amino acids. Functional analysis suggests that only ID1 may work as a pore-occluding ball domain, whereas ID2 most likely acts as a “docking domain” that attaches ID1 to the cytoplasmic face of the channel. Deletion of ID2 slows inactivation considerably and largely impairs cumulative inactivation. Together, the concerted action of ID1 and ID2 may promote rapid inactivation of Kv1.4 that is crucial for the channel function in short term plasticity.

Inactivation domain 1 (ID1, residues 1–38) consists of a flexible N terminus anchored at a 5-turn helix, whereas ID2 (residues 40–50) is a 2.5-turn helix made up of small hydrophobic amino acids. Functional analysis suggests that only ID1 may work as a pore-occluding ball domain, whereas ID2 most likely acts as a “docking domain” that attaches ID1 to the cytoplasmic face of the channel. Deletion of ID2 slows inactivation considerably and largely impairs cumulative inactivation. Together, the concerted action of ID1 and ID2 may promote rapid inactivation of Kv1.4 that is crucial for the channel function in short term plasticity. voltage-activated K+ channel action potential inactivation domain tetraethylammonium Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement green fluorescent protein cytomegalovirus wild type heteronuclear single quantum coherence NOE spectroscopy Fast inactivation of voltage-gated K+(Kv)1 channels is a major determinant for signal propagation and synaptic transmission in central nervous system neurons (1Debanne D.

Thus, A-type K+ channels were shown to regulate orthograde and retrograde propagation of dendritic action potentials (APs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons and to dynamically control presynaptic Ca2+ inflow into hippocampal mossy fiber boutons (2Geiger J.R. Jonas P. Neuron. 2000; 28: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 3Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the latter, repetitive stimulation (frequencies of ≥10 Hz) led to a broadening of the APs because of cumulative inactivation of A-type K+channels. The prolonged AP resulted in an increased Ca2+inflow, which in turn promoted an increased transmitter release and a consecutive potentiation of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (2Geiger J.R. Jonas P. Neuron. 2000; 28: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The molecular determinant of the rapidly inactivating K+current in mossy fiber boutons most probably is Kv1.4, a Kv α-subunit with prototypic ball-and-chain-type inactivation (2Geiger J.R. Jonas P. Neuron. 2000; 28: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 4Sheng M. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

This classical gating process is brought about by a “plug-in” mechanism in which a protein domain termed “inactivation ball” occludes the ion pathway through interaction with a receptor site in the pore of the channel (6Armstrong C. Bezanilla F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis showed: (i) that inactivation domains (ID) are formed by the first 20–40 amino acids at the N terminus of certain Kvα (7Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 8Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen.

Physiol (Lond.). 1995; 484: 1-13Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Kvβ subunits (11Wissmann R. Baukrowitz T. Kalbacher H. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Pongs O. Antz C. Fakler B. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar); (iii) that IDs enter the channel pore and compete with open pore blockers such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) (11Wissmann R. Baukrowitz T. Kalbacher H. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Pongs O. Antz C. Fakler B. J. Biol.

Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar); and finally (iv) that NMR-derived solution structures of the known IDs vary from a well ordered and compact folding as in Kv3.4 ID (18Antz C. Geyer M. Fakler B. Schott M.K. Guy H.R. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to the disordered and highly flexible ID from ShakerB (19Schott M.K. Antz C. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Different from other α/β subunits that harbor one ID in their N terminus, Kv1.4 was found to be equipped with two IDs with the ability to endow the channel with rapid inactivation (Fig. 1 A). ID1 is made up by residues 1–37 (9Ruppersberg J.P. Frank R. Pongs O. Stocker M. Nature. 1991; 353: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and ID2 resides between amino acids 40 and 68 (20). More explicitly, the existence of the second ID became evident after the first 39 residues were deleted, and the resulting mutant channels did not lack inactivation but rather displayed rapid inactivation very similar to that observed with ID1 present at the N terminus (20Kondoh S. Ishii K. Nakamura Y. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19333-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Hollerer-Beitz G. Schonherr R. Koenen M. Heinemann S.H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, it remained obscure what the functional role of the second ID might be in intact channels and, therefore, how inactivation gating is realized by this tandem inactivation domain. Here we analyze the solution structure and the function of this tandem inactivation domain of Kv1.4 channels (amino acids 1–75, Kv1.4N-(1–75)) using NMR spectroscopy together with patch clamp recordings in whole cell configuration and simulations of neuronal spiking behavior. A polypeptide covering the 75 N-terminal amino acids of Kv1.4 was expressed as a histidine-tagged GST fusion protein in the Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) and labeled uniformly with 15N using15N-ammonium chloride (98%) as a nitrogen source. The protein was purified to homogeneity via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and glutathione-agarose chromatography. The GST fusion domain was chopped off with thrombin leaving three residues (Gly-Ser-Thr) at the N terminus of Kv1.4N-(1–75). For NMR Kv1.4N-(1–75) protein was dissolved in a solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v), pH 4.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm protease inhibitors. The final protein concentration of Kv1.4N-(1–75) was 1 mm. For 1H chemical shift referencing, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was added as an internal standard. All of the NMR spectra of Kv1.4N-(1–75) were recorded at 283 K on Bruker Avance spectrometers. At 600 MHz proton frequency, the following spectra were recorded according to standard procedures: 1H-15N HSQC,1H-15N total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC (spin-lock mixing time of 70 ms),1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (mixing time 120 ms), HNHA, and a two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY (mixing time 150 ms) in D2O solution. Spectral windows of 9 and 24 ppm were employed in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. 3 J HNHα coupling constants were determined from the three-dimensional HNHA spectrum as described previously (22Vuister G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The 15N relaxation measurements (T1, T2, 1H-15N NOE) were carried out at 500-MHz proton frequency as described previously (23Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) with overall delays between scans of 2 s for the T1 and T2 measurements and 3 s for the heteronuclear NOE experiment, respectively. The delays used for the T1 experiments were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, and 2560 ms, whereas delays of 8, 16, 24, 40, 64, 96, 128, 160, 256, 320, 480, and 800 ms were used for the T2 experiments. The15N relaxation data were analyzed according to the reduced spectral density mapping approach (24Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange of the backbone amide groups of Kv1.4N-(1–75) was evaluated by 1H-15N HSQC spectra on a uniformly 15N-labeled sample after solvent exchange to 99.9% D2O using a NAP5 column (Amersham Biosciences). NMR data were processed with the XWIN NMR software (Bruker) and analyzed with the programs AURELIA (Bruker) and XEASY (ETH Zürich) (25Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). The solution structure of Kv1.4N-(1–75) was calculated with the DYANA program package (version 1.5) that uses a simulated annealing algorithm in the torsion angle space (26Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from a15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY spectrum in H2O solution and a 1H-1H two-dimensional NOESY spectrum in D2O solution. Volumes of unambiguously assigned NOESY cross-peaks were converted into proton-proton upper distance limits by the caliba routine within DYANA. The dihedral angle Φ of residues with a3 J HNHα coupling constant of ≤6 Hz was restrained to values between −90 and −30°. Structures from preliminary DYANA runs were used to recalibrate the distance restraints in an iterative manner. Stereospecific assignments were provided by the glomsa algorithm implemented in DYANA. The final family of structures was generated in a calculation with 300 random starting structures and 12,000 annealing steps. The 25 best structures had values for the target function <0.55 Å2, no NOE violations >0.3 Å, and no violations of dihedral angle constraints. These structures were selected for further analysis and evaluation of structural quality with the programs DYANA and MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). The latter was also used to prepare the figures showing three-dimensional structures. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a standard cassette technique (28Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the mutations were verified by sequencing. For functional expression, Kv1.4 WT and mutant subunits were subcloned into pBK-CMV (29Ludwig J. Oliver D. Frank G. Klocker N. Gummer A.W. Fakler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4178-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the cDNA (0.5 μg/μl) was injected into Chinese hamster ovary dhFr− cells with a Microinjector (Transjector 5246, Eppendorf, Germany) (30Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For identification of successfully injected cells, 10 ng/μl pBK-CMV-GFP was coinjected as a reporter. Cells were grown in minimum essential medium-α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml, Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells showing GFP fluorescence were chosen for electrophysiological experiments 20–40 h after injection. Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at room temperature (21–24 °C) using quartz pipettes with resistances of 1.5–2.5 megohms when filled with intracellular solution of the following composition (in mm): 135 KCl, 3.5 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 K2EGTA, 5 HEPES, 2.5 Na2ATP, and 0.1 dithiothreitol (pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH). Dithiothreitol was used to establish a stable redox milieu in the cytoplasm (9Ruppersberg J.P. Frank R. Pongs O. Stocker M. Nature. 1991; 353: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After establishing whole cell configuration and series resistance compensation, residual series resistance was <0.8 megohms. Extracellular solution was (in mm) 144 NaCl, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.9 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.7 Na2HPO4, and 5.6 glucose (pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). For competition experiments, TEA-Cl (1 mm) was added to the intracellular solution and exchange of the intracellular solution was achieved by successively repatching the same cell with pipettes containing different intracellular solutions as described previously (30Oliver D. He D.Z. Klocker N. Ludwig J. Schulte U. Waldegger S. Ruppersberg J.P. Dallos P. Fakler B. Science. 2001; 292: 2340-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The absence of channel run-down during successive experiments was verified by concluding the experiment with the control solution used initially. Activation and inactivation kinetics of Kv1.4 channels (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) were measured by stepping the membrane potential from −120 mV to the values indicated for variable periods (between 250 and 500 ms). Steady-state inactivation curves as in Fig. 6 B were obtained with a standard two-step protocol, which used a prepulse of 0.8 s to potentials between −120 and 20 mV (10-mV increments) and a test pulse to 60 mV that determined the fraction of channels inactivated during the prepulse. Between individual cycles, the voltage was held at −120 mV to allow for complete recovery from inactivation. The inactivation curve was fitted with a Boltzmann function (I = [1 + exp{(V −V 12)/k}]−1), whereV is the membrane (prepulse) potential,V 12 is the potential at half-maximal inactivation, and k is the slope factor. Activation curves (used for the simulations in Fig. 7) were obtained by stepping the membrane potential from −120 mV to potentials between −80 and 60 mV (10-mV increment) for 250 ms. The current amplitude was divided by the driving force to yield channel activation as a function of membrane potential.Figure 5Distinct inactivation properties of WT and Δ2–38 mutant channels. A, inactivation of both WT and the Δ2–38 deletion mutant is competed by 1 mm TEA applied to the cytoplasmic side of the channels.Left panel, current response to voltage steps from −80 to 20 mV recorded in the absence (gray) or presence (black) of TEA.

C, relative change in the inactivation time constant observed with a proline-scan of the ID2 helix. Inactivation time constants obtained with the mutants indicated (6–8 experiments each) were divided by the mean value of the τinact of WT channels. Relative changes are given as mean ± S.D. Note that deletion of amino acids 50–60 had no effect on τinact. D, recovery from inactivation at a membrane potential of −80 mV.

A, differential spiking behavior of a neuron equipped with either non-inactivating Kv channels (upper panel), rapidly inactivating Kv1.4 channels (middle panel) or Kv1.4 channels lacking the docking domain (Δ40–50). Simulations were performed with the Neuron simulation environment (Neuron 4.3.1) for a spherical neuron exhibiting voltage-dependent Na+ and K+conductances, as well as a leakage K+ conductance. Note cessation of spiking because of cumulative inactivation of Kv1.4 channels that is absent in non-inactivating Kv channels or the Δ40–50 mutant.

C, memory effect of rapidly inactivating Kv channels envisaged by double-pulse excitation is largely impaired by deletion of the docking domain. Note the difference in response to the second excitation observed between Kv1.4 WT and mutant channels. Single pulse excitation of a Kv1.4 containing neuron is shown for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time course of recovery from inactivation was obtained with a three-step voltage protocol. 1) Voltage was first stepped to 60 mV for 1 s to allow for complete inactivation. 2) Voltage was then stepped to −120 or −80 mV for a variable period. 3) The final step used to determine the fraction of channels that recovered during the hyperpolarizing pulse was to −20 mV. Currents were low pass filtered at 2 kHz (4-pole Bessel) and sampled at 10 kHz. Processing and fitting of the data were performed with IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). All of the data are given as the mean ± S.D. of n experiments. Simulations of neuronal input-output relations were performed with Neuron (version 4.3.1) (31Hines M. Carnevale N. Neural Comput. 1997; 9: 1179-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar,32Hines M. Carnevale N. Neural Comput. 2000; 12: 995-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This simulation environment calculates the voltage response of a cell (of given geometry) to current stimuli based on Hodgkin-Huxley-type voltage-gated conductances for Na+ and K+ (non-inactivating K+ currents) and standard values for leakage conductance and passive electrical properties including membrane capacitance and intracellular resistance. To implement the kinetics of Kv1.4 WT and (Δ40–50) mutant channels, the measured steady-state activation and inactivation curves and the recovery from inactivation as well as the time constants for activation and inactivation on a broad voltage range (−100 to 80 mV) were used to determine the Hodgkin-Huxley parameters of channel gating (33Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref Scopus (14371) Google Scholar). The following rates were used to model the inactivation gating of Kv1.4 WT (α h (V) = 0.000025608·exp(−V/45.4217), β h (V) = 0.0330402/exp(−(V + 45.6599)/2.30235 + 1)) and of Kv1.4-(Δ40–50) (α h (V) = 0.000169537·exp(−V/223.943), β h (V) = 0.0090891/exp(−(V + 43.7084)/2.63186 + 1). The voltage-gated Na+ conductance was 0.12 S/cm2, and the values for voltage-gated K+ and leakage K+ conductance were 0.036 and 0.0003 S/cm2, respectively. The membrane capacitance was 0.7 microfarad/cm2. A polypeptide containing the first 75 amino acids of Kv1.4 (Kv1.4N-(1–75)) was overexpressed in bacteria, purified, and used for structural analysis. A series of multidimensional (two- and three-dimensional) homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR experiments (see “Materials and Methods”) was performed in aqueous solution under physiological salt conditions. The 1H and 15N resonances of the polypeptide were completely assigned by standard procedures based on 15N-edited three-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the observed NOE connectivities displayed a distinct pattern along the Kv1.4N-(1–75) sequence with NOEs between non-adjacent amino acids (i,i+x) only occurring on the sequence stretch extending from Gly-20 to Ala-50. In this region, NOEs between the α-proton of one residue and the amide (dαN(i,i+3)) or β-proton (dαβ(i,i+3)) of the third amino acid following were observed together with weak sequential contacts (dαN(i,i+1)) and strong amide-amide NOEs (dNN(i,i+1)), a NOE pattern usually seen with α-helices. In line with this interpretation, all of the 3 J HNHα coupling constants determined for residues 20–50 were between 4 and 5.6 Hz (Fig. 1 B), values regarded diagnostic for helical conformation (34Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), whereas the scalar couplings for the residues N- and C-terminal to this “core region” of Kv1.4N-(1–75) were between 6 and 8 Hz, as typically seen for random coil peptides (35Smith L.J. Bolin K.A. Schwalbe H. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This view of structurally distinct parts in Kv1.4N-(1–75) was further supported by the chemical shift index of the α-protons as well as the backbone dynamics. Thus, most of the α-protons within the core region are shifted upfield by 0.1 ppm or more with respect to random coil chemical shifts (Fig. 2, upper panel). The backbone dynamics on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale as determined from 15N relaxation and the1H-15N heteronuclear NOE (36Ishima R. Nagayama K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) strongly suggested an ordered core region flanked by flexible N and C termini. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (middle and lower panels), the termini displayed very short transverse relaxation rates (R2) and negative values for the heteronuclear NOE, whereas residues 20–50 exhibited positive values of the1H-15N NOE and relatively high R2rates. Moreover, the spectral density functions J(0) andJ(ω H ) demonstrated reduced mobility of the protein backbone between residues 20 and 50 together with high mobility in the rest of the polypeptide (data not shown) (24Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It should be noted at this point that the NOE pattern, the Hα chemical shifts, the scalar couplings, and the relaxation data suggest that the helical conformation may not extend throughout amino acids 20–50. Rather, there may be two helices with a different stability: the more stable one formed by amino acids Tyr-21 to Ala-38 (average deviation of 3 J HNHα from random coil values of −1.7 ± 0.6 Hz); the second one involving the alanine-rich stretch between residues 40 and 50 (average deviation of3 J HNHα from random coil values of −0.8 ± 0.3 Hz). Together, NOE pattern, scalar couplings, chemical shift data, and relaxation measurements suggest that Kv1.4N-(1–75) consists of a highly ordered core region with mostly helical conformation flanked by flexible N- and C-terminal ends. The absence of any stable tertiary folding is indicated by the small chemical shift dispersion of the backbone amide protons (∼1 ppm), the fast H/D exchange of all amide protons in D2O solution, and the missing of long range NOEs in the NOESY spectra of Kv1.4N-(1–75). A total of 391 experimentally determined distance restraints together with the restraints for dihedral angles and stereospecific assignments of protons (Table I) were used to calculate the solution structure of Kv1.4N-(1–75). After structure calculations with the simulated annealing protocol of DYANA (26Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2019695476,"Insertion and folding of polytopic membrane proteins is an important unsolved biological problem. To study this issue, lactose permease, a membrane transport protein fromEscherichia coli, is transcribed, translated, and inserted into inside-out membrane vesicles in vitro. The protein is in a native conformation as judged by sensitivity to protease, binding of a monoclonal antibody directed against a conformational epitope, and importantly, by functional assays. By exploiting this system it is possible to express the N-terminal six helices of the permease (N6) and probe changes in conformation during insertion into the membrane. Specifically, when N6 remains attached to the ribosome it is readily extracted from the membrane with urea, whereas after release from the ribosome or translation of additional helices, those polypeptides are not urea extractable. Furthermore, the accessibility of an engineered Factor Xa site to Xa protease is reduced significantly when N6 is released from the ribosome or more helices are translated. Finally, spontaneous disulfide formation between Cys residues at positions 126 (Helix IV) and 144 (Helix V) is observed when N6 is released from the ribosome and inserted into the membrane. Moreover, in contrast to full-length permease, N6 is degraded by FtsH protease in vivo, and N6 with a single Cys residue at position 148 does not react with N-ethylmaleimide. Taken together, the findings indicate that N6 remains in a hydrophilic environment until it is released from the ribosome or additional helices are translated and continues to fold into a quasi-native conformation after insertion into the bilayer. Furthermore, there is synergism between N6 and the C-terminal half of permease during assembly, as opposed to assembly of the two halves as independent domains.

Thus, YidC appears to play a key role in inner membrane protein insertion (12Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). SecD, SecF, and YajC form another heterotrimeric complex that binds to the SecYEG complex (13Duong F. Wickner W.

Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that YidC interacts directly with SecDF rather than SecYEG, which forms an even larger complex with SecYEG. Furthermore, SecA, a cytosolic protein with ATPase activity, is also important for insertion of inner membrane proteins with large periplasmic loops (15Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol.

Although some details regarding the mechanism of integral membrane protein insertion have been elucidated, there are still many issues that require resolution, particularly those related to insertion of polytopic membrane proteins. Examples include folding of intermediates, interaction between helices during translation/insertion, the order and timing of helices exiting from the translocon into the lipid bilayer, and topological determinants.In an effort to study some of these issues we have chosen to use the lactose permease of E. coli (LacY) as a model system. LacY is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (17Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and catalyzes the coupled stoichiometric translocation of galactosides and H+(symport) (18Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics: Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. II. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996Google Scholar). The protein has been solubilized from the membrane and purified to homogeneity in a completely functional state (19Viitanen P. Garcia M.L. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, LacY is physiologically (24Sahin-Tóth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), in conjunction with a battery of site-directed biochemical and biophysical techniques has led to the formulation of a tertiary-structure model (29Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as well as a hypothesis for the mechanism of lactose/H+ symport (30Kaback H.R. Sahin-Tóth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Like most inner membrane proteins, LacY is inserted into the membrane co-translationally (31Stochaj U. Ehring R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Ahrem B. Hoffschulte H.K. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and insertion involves SRP and FtsY (33MacFarlane J. Müller M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,34Seluanov A. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2053-2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as well as SecY (35Ito K. Akiyama Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also important for the late maturation of LacY and required for proper assembly and function (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PE can even reverse misfolding of LacY topology after insertion into membranes devoid of PE (37Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which LacY is inserted into the membrane and folds into its final tertiary conformation is far from clear.Remarkably, co-expression of LacY in two contiguous, non-overlapping fragments with a covalent discontinuity in either cytoplasmic or periplasmic loops leads to complementation resulting in resistance of the fragments to proteolysis and functional LacY (38Bibi E. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Wrubel W. Stochaj U. Sonnewald U. Theres C. Ehring R. J.

Furthermore, a salt bridge between Asp-237 (Helix VII) and Lys-358 (Helix XI) plays an important role in membrane insertion (42Dunten R.L. Sahin-Tóth M. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3139-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Lengeler J.W. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9368-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating that Helix VII must interact with Helix XI before insertion of LacY into the bilayer. In addition, the relatively long middle cytoplasmic loop is important for functional expression, possibly acting as a time delay to allow the N-terminal six helices (N6) to clear the translocon before the last six helices are inserted (44Weinglass A.B. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8938-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To analyze these phenomena more completely, as well as the insertion mechanism of LacY, an in vitro transcription/translation/insertion system is described in which LacY appears to be inserted in a native, functional conformation. In this study, we focus on insertion of the N-terminal half of LacY (N6).DISCUSSIONAlthough previous studies (32Ahrem B. Hoffschulte H.K. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 64Bochkareva E. Seluanov A. Bibi E. Girshovich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22256-22261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicate that LacY transcribed and translated in vitro can be inserted into ISO membrane vesicles with the correct topology (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), questions remain as to whether or not the inserted protein is in a native conformation. Because LacY, like many other membrane proteins, is resistant to traditional means of structural analysis, alternative approaches have been developed to study topology and discern the overall three-dimensional fold (see Refs. 29Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and 30Kaback H.R. Sahin-Tóth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The studies presented here, which utilize some of these approaches, provide convincing evidence that LacY synthesized and inserted into the membrane in vitro is in a native conformation. (a) By using engineered Factor Xa protease sites in cytoplasmic or periplasmic loops, the topology of the polypeptide with respect to the membrane appears to be correct. (b) A mAb that binds to a discontinuous epitope comprised of residues in cytoplasmic loops VIII/IX and X/XI (61Sun J. Li J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) binds to LacY synthesized and inserted in vitro as well as it binds when LacY is synthesized and inserted in vivo. (c) Cys residues at positions 126 and 144 in the in vitro system undergo spontaneous cross-linking as observed in vivo (53Wolin C.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (d) LacY synthesized and inserted in vitroexhibits lactose/Dns6-Gal counter-flow and significant ligand protection against alkylation of Cys-148. Therefore, transcription, translation, and insertion of LacY into ISO vesiclesin vitro represents a system in which the mechanism of insertion of a polytopic membrane protein and its folding into a tertiary conformation can be studied reliably.Despite conjecture regarding co-translational insertion of polytopic membrane proteins, it is unclear how many transmembrane helices are accommodated by the translocon before insertion into the bilayer. Furthermore, little information is available regarding whether folding into a tertiary conformation begins in the translocon or only after migration into the bilayer with the assistance of chaperones such as PE (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 70Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36827-36830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The observation that the first six helices of LacY are extracted with urea when the ribosome remains attached, whereas the first eight helices are not, suggests that the translocon can accommodate at least six transmembrane helices, a conclusion similar to that drawn from findings obtained with P-glycoprotein (71Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, an in vitro study of the polytopic membrane protein MtlA suggests more than one pair of transmembrane domains are assembled before the exit from translocon (72Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N6 portion of LacY may not be fully accommodated by the translocon, and part of N6 may be in contact with lipid, which would explain why the polypeptide is not completely extracted with urea (Fig. 3).Photo cross-linking studies on certain membrane proteins indicate that the transmembrane domains may indeed interact with lipid during insertion (72Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 73Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). With LacY, the first or second transmembrane helix might interact with phospholipid, whereas helices III to VI are still in the translocon. However, if this is the case, it is unlikely that the first two helices migrate very far from the translocon. Indeed, it has been suggested that in some endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins, a transmembrane helix can re-enter the translocon after its initial release into the lipid phase if it has affinity for other helices still within the translocon (74Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, the data suggest that the N6 half of LacY must remain near the translocon after exit into the bilayer as the C6 half is translated. Once the C6 half exits the translocon, folding into a final tertiary structure likely occurs within the bilayer, resulting in a protease-resistant, functional molecule.The differential sensitivity of engineered Factor Xa protease sites in cytoplasmic loop IV/V to cleavage in N6 with attached ribosomes versus fully translated N6 suggests that the conformation of the two polypeptides differs. The observation that fully translated N6 is not extracted with urea whereas a significant amount of the translocation intermediate is urea-soluble (Fig. 4) implies that a folding event occurs after N6 exits the translocon. Cross-linking data with Cys residues at positions 126 (Helix IV) and 144 (Helix V) also support the interpretation that N6 folds after insertion into the bilayer (Fig. 5). However, it seems unlikely that N6 synthesized and insertedin vitro has the same tertiary structure as it does in native, full-length LacY since N6 is clearly sensitive to proteolysis by FtsH protease in the absence of C6 but stabilized in its presence (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, N6 with a single Cys residue at position 148 does not react with NEM (Fig. 7B).Unlike the two-dimensional projection map of OxlT (75Heymann J.A. Sarker R. Hirai T. Shi D. Milne J.L. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4408-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which indicates that each helix in the two halves of the protein occupy symmetry-related positions, neither the Na+/H+antiporter NhaA (76Williams R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 311-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 77Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the Na+/sugar symporter MelB (78Hacksell I. Rigaud J.L. Purhonen P. Pourcher T. Hebert H. Leblanc G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3569-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), nor LacY (29Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) exhibit such symmetry. Rather, in these transport proteins, helices from the N- and C-terminal halves of the polypeptides interdigitate. Thus, it is not surprising that N6 in LacY probably does not insert into the bilayer in a native conformation, although some of the structural features of the native, full-length protein are observed. This being the case, it seems clear that folding of LacY into a native, functional conformation must occur in the bilayer after both halves of the protein have exited the translocon, a conclusion consistent with the finding that PE acts as a molecular chaperone in the folding of LacY into its final native conformation (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).

Thus, YidC appears to play a key role in inner membrane protein insertion (12Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). SecD, SecF, and YajC form another heterotrimeric complex that binds to the SecYEG complex (13Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported (14Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that YidC interacts directly with SecDF rather than SecYEG, which forms an even larger complex with SecYEG. Furthermore, SecA, a cytosolic protein with ATPase activity, is also important for insertion of inner membrane proteins with large periplasmic loops (15Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Koch H.G. Hengelage T. Neumann-Haefelin C. MacFarlane J. Hoffschulte H.K. Schimz K.L. Mechler B. Müller M. Mol. Biol.

Although some details regarding the mechanism of integral membrane protein insertion have been elucidated, there are still many issues that require resolution, particularly those related to insertion of polytopic membrane proteins. Examples include folding of intermediates, interaction between helices during translation/insertion, the order and timing of helices exiting from the translocon into the lipid bilayer, and topological determinants. In an effort to study some of these issues we have chosen to use the lactose permease of E. coli (LacY) as a model system. LacY is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (17Saier Jr., M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and catalyzes the coupled stoichiometric translocation of galactosides and H+(symport) (18Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics: Transport Processes in Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Organisms. II. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996Google Scholar). The protein has been solubilized from the membrane and purified to homogeneity in a completely functional state (19Viitanen P. Garcia M.L. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, LacY is physiologically (24Sahin-Tóth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis of an extensive library of mutants, particularly Cys replacement mutants (28Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), in conjunction with a battery of site-directed biochemical and biophysical techniques has led to the formulation of a tertiary-structure model (29Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as well as a hypothesis for the mechanism of lactose/H+ symport (30Kaback H.R. Sahin-Tóth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Like most inner membrane proteins, LacY is inserted into the membrane co-translationally (31Stochaj U. Ehring R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Ahrem B. Hoffschulte H.K. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and insertion involves SRP and FtsY (33MacFarlane J. Müller M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,34Seluanov A. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2053-2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as well as SecY (35Ito K. Akiyama Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also important for the late maturation of LacY and required for proper assembly and function (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PE can even reverse misfolding of LacY topology after insertion into membranes devoid of PE (37Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which LacY is inserted into the membrane and folds into its final tertiary conformation is far from clear. Remarkably, co-expression of LacY in two contiguous, non-overlapping fragments with a covalent discontinuity in either cytoplasmic or periplasmic loops leads to complementation resulting in resistance of the fragments to proteolysis and functional LacY (38Bibi E. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Wrubel W. Stochaj U. Sonnewald U. Theres C. Ehring R. J.

Furthermore, a salt bridge between Asp-237 (Helix VII) and Lys-358 (Helix XI) plays an important role in membrane insertion (42Dunten R.L. Sahin-Tóth M. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3139-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Lengeler J.W. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9368-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating that Helix VII must interact with Helix XI before insertion of LacY into the bilayer. In addition, the relatively long middle cytoplasmic loop is important for functional expression, possibly acting as a time delay to allow the N-terminal six helices (N6) to clear the translocon before the last six helices are inserted (44Weinglass A.B. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8938-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To analyze these phenomena more completely, as well as the insertion mechanism of LacY, an in vitro transcription/translation/insertion system is described in which LacY appears to be inserted in a native, functional conformation. In this study, we focus on insertion of the N-terminal half of LacY (N6). DISCUSSIONAlthough previous studies (32Ahrem B. Hoffschulte H.K. Müller M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1637-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 64Bochkareva E. Seluanov A. Bibi E. Girshovich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22256-22261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) indicate that LacY transcribed and translated in vitro can be inserted into ISO membrane vesicles with the correct topology (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), questions remain as to whether or not the inserted protein is in a native conformation. Because LacY, like many other membrane proteins, is resistant to traditional means of structural analysis, alternative approaches have been developed to study topology and discern the overall three-dimensional fold (see Refs. 29Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and 30Kaback H.R. Sahin-Tóth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The studies presented here, which utilize some of these approaches, provide convincing evidence that LacY synthesized and inserted into the membrane in vitro is in a native conformation. (a) By using engineered Factor Xa protease sites in cytoplasmic or periplasmic loops, the topology of the polypeptide with respect to the membrane appears to be correct. (b) A mAb that binds to a discontinuous epitope comprised of residues in cytoplasmic loops VIII/IX and X/XI (61Sun J. Li J. Carrasco N. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) binds to LacY synthesized and inserted in vitro as well as it binds when LacY is synthesized and inserted in vivo. (c) Cys residues at positions 126 and 144 in the in vitro system undergo spontaneous cross-linking as observed in vivo (53Wolin C.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (d) LacY synthesized and inserted in vitroexhibits lactose/Dns6-Gal counter-flow and significant ligand protection against alkylation of Cys-148. Therefore, transcription, translation, and insertion of LacY into ISO vesiclesin vitro represents a system in which the mechanism of insertion of a polytopic membrane protein and its folding into a tertiary conformation can be studied reliably.Despite conjecture regarding co-translational insertion of polytopic membrane proteins, it is unclear how many transmembrane helices are accommodated by the translocon before insertion into the bilayer. Furthermore, little information is available regarding whether folding into a tertiary conformation begins in the translocon or only after migration into the bilayer with the assistance of chaperones such as PE (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 70Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36827-36830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The observation that the first six helices of LacY are extracted with urea when the ribosome remains attached, whereas the first eight helices are not, suggests that the translocon can accommodate at least six transmembrane helices, a conclusion similar to that drawn from findings obtained with P-glycoprotein (71Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, an in vitro study of the polytopic membrane protein MtlA suggests more than one pair of transmembrane domains are assembled before the exit from translocon (72Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N6 portion of LacY may not be fully accommodated by the translocon, and part of N6 may be in contact with lipid, which would explain why the polypeptide is not completely extracted with urea (Fig. 3).Photo cross-linking studies on certain membrane proteins indicate that the transmembrane domains may indeed interact with lipid during insertion (72Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 73Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). With LacY, the first or second transmembrane helix might interact with phospholipid, whereas helices III to VI are still in the translocon. However, if this is the case, it is unlikely that the first two helices migrate very far from the translocon. Indeed, it has been suggested that in some endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins, a transmembrane helix can re-enter the translocon after its initial release into the lipid phase if it has affinity for other helices still within the translocon (74Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, the data suggest that the N6 half of LacY must remain near the translocon after exit into the bilayer as the C6 half is translated. Once the C6 half exits the translocon, folding into a final tertiary structure likely occurs within the bilayer, resulting in a protease-resistant, functional molecule.The differential sensitivity of engineered Factor Xa protease sites in cytoplasmic loop IV/V to cleavage in N6 with attached ribosomes versus fully translated N6 suggests that the conformation of the two polypeptides differs. The observation that fully translated N6 is not extracted with urea whereas a significant amount of the translocation intermediate is urea-soluble (Fig. 4) implies that a folding event occurs after N6 exits the translocon. Cross-linking data with Cys residues at positions 126 (Helix IV) and 144 (Helix V) also support the interpretation that N6 folds after insertion into the bilayer (Fig. 5). However, it seems unlikely that N6 synthesized and insertedin vitro has the same tertiary structure as it does in native, full-length LacY since N6 is clearly sensitive to proteolysis by FtsH protease in the absence of C6 but stabilized in its presence (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, N6 with a single Cys residue at position 148 does not react with NEM (Fig. 7B).Unlike the two-dimensional projection map of OxlT (75Heymann J.A. Sarker R. Hirai T. Shi D. Milne J.L. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4408-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which indicates that each helix in the two halves of the protein occupy symmetry-related positions, neither the Na+/H+antiporter NhaA (76Williams R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 311-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 77Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the Na+/sugar symporter MelB (78Hacksell I. Rigaud J.L. Purhonen P. Pourcher T. Hebert H. Leblanc G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3569-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), nor LacY (29Sorgen P.L. Hu Y. Guan L. Kaback H.R. Girvin M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14037-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) exhibit such symmetry. Rather, in these transport proteins, helices from the N- and C-terminal halves of the polypeptides interdigitate. Thus, it is not surprising that N6 in LacY probably does not insert into the bilayer in a native conformation, although some of the structural features of the native, full-length protein are observed. This being the case, it seems clear that folding of LacY into a native, functional conformation must occur in the bilayer after both halves of the protein have exited the translocon, a conclusion consistent with the finding that PE acts as a molecular chaperone in the folding of LacY into its final native conformation (36Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5255-5264Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2071266681,"A novel variant of antithrombin, the major serpin inhibitor of coagulation proteases, has been identified in a patient with early onset thrombosis and abnormal plasma antithrombin activity. Sequencing of the antithrombin genes of the patient revealed that one of the two alleles was abnormal due to an in-frame deletion of the codon for the P1 arginine residue. The abnormal antithrombin was separated from the normal inhibitor by complexing the latter with thrombin followed by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. The purified variant, antithrombin London, was completely inactive as a thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor even after heparin activation. Surprisingly, the variant bound heparin with a KDreflecting an ∼10-fold greater affinity than the normal inhibitor. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis showed that this was almost entirely due to a more favorable conformational activation of the variant than the normal inhibitor, as reflected by a decreased rate constant for reversal of the activation. Consistent with its higher than normal heparin affinity, the inactive antithrombin variant was a potent competitive antagonist of the heparin-catalyzed reaction of normal antithrombin with thrombin but did not affect the uncatalyzed reaction. These results suggest that deletion of the antithrombin P1 residue partially activates the serpin by inducing strain in the reactive center loop, which destabilizes the native loop-buried state and favors the activated loop-exposed state with high heparin affinity. The unusually severe thrombosis associated with the heterozygous mutation may be explained by the ability of antithrombin London to bind endogenous heparan sulfate or heparin molecules with high affinity and to thereby block activation of the normal inhibitor. A novel variant of antithrombin, the major serpin inhibitor of coagulation proteases, has been identified in a patient with early onset thrombosis and abnormal plasma antithrombin activity. Sequencing of the antithrombin genes of the patient revealed that one of the two alleles was abnormal due to an in-frame deletion of the codon for the P1 arginine residue. The abnormal antithrombin was separated from the normal inhibitor by complexing the latter with thrombin followed by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. The purified variant, antithrombin London, was completely inactive as a thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor even after heparin activation. Surprisingly, the variant bound heparin with a KDreflecting an ∼10-fold greater affinity than the normal inhibitor.

The unusually severe thrombosis associated with the heterozygous mutation may be explained by the ability of antithrombin London to bind endogenous heparan sulfate or heparin molecules with high affinity and to thereby block activation of the normal inhibitor. Antithrombin, a member of the serpin family of protein proteinase inhibitors, is the principal regulator of blood coagulation proteinases in plasma (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D.

Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar). The essential role of this protein in hemostasis and in sustaining life is clear from the association of inherited or acquired deficiencies of the serpin in humans with an increased risk of thrombosis (2van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar) and from the finding that complete deficiency in mice results in embryonic lethality due to a consumptive coagulopathy (3Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Kadomatsu K. Nakayama Y. Takagi A. Suzuki M. Takeda N. Ito M. Yamamoto K. Matsushita T. Kusugami K. Muramatsu T. Saito H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Efficient regulation of clotting proteinases by antithrombin requires the polysaccharide cofactors heparin and heparan sulfate, which act to increase the moderate rates of inhibition of clotting proteinases by the serpin several thousand-fold (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins. Plenum Press, New York1997: 17-33Google Scholar). Only a fraction of heparin molecules are functional in this regard due to their possessing a specific pentasaccharide sequence capable of binding antithrombin with high affinity and inducing activating conformational changes in the serpin (4Thunberg L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cell surface heparan sulfate molecules are thought to be to be the natural activator of antithrombin, but only a limited fraction (∼1%) of such molecules contain the pentasaccharide sequence and are anticoagulantly active (8Marcum J.A. Atha D.H. Fritze L.M.S. Nawroth P.P. Stern D.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of antithrombin free and complexed with the heparin pentasaccharide reveal that pentasaccharide binding to an allosteric site on the inhibitor transmits conformational changes to a reactive proteinase binding loop on the inhibitor surface that enhances the loop accessibility to proteinases (9Skinner R. Abrahams J.-P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis studies suggest that not only the proteinase binding loop common to serpins but also a unique exosite region adjacent to the loop are made accessible for proteinase interaction as a result of heparin activation (11Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14961-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Natural variants of antithrombin have provided valuable insights into the anticoagulant function of the serpin. Such variants initially led to the identification of the pentasaccharide binding site as well as verification of the proteinase binding site of the inhibitor before the crystal structures became available (1Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins. Plenum Press, New York1997: 17-33Google Scholar, 2van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar). Antithrombin variants have additionally provided significant insights into the relative physiologic importance of antithrombin interactions with clotting proteinases and heparin (2van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar). Individuals expressing variant antithrombins with abnormal proteinase binding are thus typically heterozygous for the genetic defect and are usually at risk for thrombosis. However, those individuals expressing a variant antithrombin with a defect in heparin binding may be heterozygous or homozygous, and only homozygotes are typically more susceptible to thrombosis. In the present report we describe a novel dysfunctional variant of antithrombin associated with early onset thrombosis in the proband and a clear family history of thrombosis in affected individuals. Sequencing of the gene for the variant revealed an in-frame deletion of the P1 Arg of the serpin. Purification of the variant antithrombin confirmed the complete absence of inhibitory activity but also revealed an abnormally high affinity for heparin. The latter property was shown to result in the variant acting as an effective antagonist of the heparin-catalyzed inhibition of clotting proteinases by normal antithrombin, providing an explanation for the unusually severe thrombosis associated with this mutation. The abnormally high heparin affinity of the variant suggests that the deletion of the reactive loop residue causes activation of the variant without heparin and provides new insights into the structural basis of heparin activation. Patient antithrombin activity was measured as heparin cofactor activity using a commercially available kit (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL). Antithrombin antigen was measured using antibody-coated microlatex particles in a commercially available kit (Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ). The reference plasmas used were 100% reference plasma from Technoclone for antithrombin activity and the 7th British standard supplied by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control for antithrombin antigen. Routine testing did not identify any other thrombophilic trait in the proband (protein C and protein S were normal, and the proband tested negative for the genetic lesions, Factor V Leiden, and prothrombin 20210A). Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of antithrombin with heparin included in the gel was performed according to Sas et al.(12Sas G.D. Pepper D.S. Cash J.D. Thromb. Res. 1975; 6: 87-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as described (13Lane D.A. Olds R. Conard J. Boisclair M. Bock S.C. Hultin M. Abildgaard U. Ireland H. Thompson E. Sas G. Horellou M.H. Tamponi G. Thein S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2422-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard methods. The 7 exons (and their flanking regions) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using primers described in full elsewhere (14Chowdhury V. Olds R.J. Lane D.L. Pabinger I. Machin S.J. Ryan K. Bauer K.A. Bhavani M. Abildgaard U. Finazzi G. Conard J. Castaman G. Mannucci P. Thein S.L. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 84: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Amplified products were sequenced using an ABI 377 sequencer. Normal antithrombin was purified from outdated human plasma by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-200 columns as previously described (15Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The variant antithrombin was isolated from ∼200 ml of plasma of the proband by adsorption to 20 ml of heparin-Sepharose gel equilibrated in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4, washing the gel with equilibrating buffer containing 0.40 m NaCl to remove unbound protein, and then step-eluting the bound antithrombin with buffer containing 2.5m NaCl. SDS-PAGE of the purified protein revealed a major antithrombin band in addition to a minor protein contaminant. After dialysis into 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 8.3, the protein was repurified by binding to heparin-Sepharose and eluting with a NaCl gradient according to the procedure used to purify normal antithrombin from plasma. Protein fractions eluting at the end of the gradient were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The concentration of normal functional antithrombin in the purified inhibitor was assessed by titrating 100 nm thrombin with 0–2 molar eq of purified inhibitor in I 0.15 buffer. After overnight incubation at 25 °C, the residual thrombin activity was determined from the initial rate of hydrolysis of the substrate, S-2238, monitored from the change in absorbance at 405 nm. The amount of active antithrombin was determined from the abscissa intercept of a plot of the linear decrease in activity versus the molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme added. A 10% molar excess of thrombin over the normal antithrombin found in the preparation (5.8 μm) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, a time sufficient to fully complex the functional inhibitor based on the measured inhibition rate constant (>99.9%). Any remaining thrombin was inactivated by the addition of 30 μmd-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem), and the mixture was chromatographed in ∼5-mg batches on a 5-ml Hi-Trap Heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in dialysis buffer. After loading the sample at 0.5 ml/min, the column was washed with equilibrating buffer for 10 min, a gradient from 0.1 to 3 m NaCl in the same buffer was applied over the next 35 min, and elution was then continued with 3m NaCl limit buffer for 15 min, all at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two incompletely resolved peaks detected by protein fluorescence eluted between 18 and 28 min followed by a well resolved peak eluting between 35 and 50 min. Fractions containing the high heparin affinity variant antithrombin peak were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into equilibration buffer. Concentrations of normal and variant antithrombins were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 37,700m−1cm−1 (16Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin and a variant of this sequence having higher affinity for antithrombin (compound 83 in van Boeckel and Petitou (17van Boeckel C.A.A. Petitou M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1671-1690Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar)) were synthesized by Sanofi Recherche and generously provided by Dr. Maurice Petitou. A full-length heparin of ∼26 saccharides containing the pentasaccharide binding sequence for antithrombin was isolated from commercial heparin by size and antithrombin affinity fractionation as described (15Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Concentrations of all heparins were determined by stoichiometric fluorescence titrations of plasma antithrombin with the saccharides as described (7Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was prepared by purifying prothrombin from plasma followed by activation of the zymogen and purification of the enzyme as described (18Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 221-228Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Owen W.G. Jackson C.M. Thromb. Res. 1973; 3: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa (predominantly α-form) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Concentrations of active proteinases were determined by comparison of the activities in standard enzyme assays with those of active-site titrated preparations of the enzyme as in previous studies (20Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and nondenaturing electrophoresis of normal and variant antithrombins and of their interactions with thrombin, heparin, and neutrophil elastase (Athens Research and Technology) were done with the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Samples containing thrombin or neutrophil elastase were treated with a >100-fold molar excess ofd-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone or methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem), respectively, before denaturation and electrophoresis. For reactions of antithrombin with neutrophil elastase, 5 μmnormal or variant antithrombin was mixed with 0.1 μmelastase with or without 5 μm heparin pentasaccharide at 25 °C, and samples were taken after 5–80 min and quenched with chloromethyl ketone inhibitor before electrophoresis. All experiments were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffers containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 adjusted to pH 7.4. NaCl was either absent or added to 0.10 or 0.25 m to give ionic strengths of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.30. Normal or variant antithrombins were titrated with heparin, and binding of the saccharide was monitored from the increase in tryptophan fluorescence that accompanies the binding interaction with an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY) as in previous studies (15Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 22Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Titrations to assess heparin binding stoichiometry were done at antithrombin concentrations (200–800 nm) much higher than KD (>10-fold) and in I 0.05 (pentasaccharide) or 0.15 (full-length heparin) buffer, whereas titrations to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant were done at inhibitor concentrations closer to KD in I 0.3 buffer (50–200 nm). Fluorescence data were computer-fit by nonlinear regression analysis to the equilibrium binding equation for a 1:1 binding interaction (7Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries measured in titrations at lower ionic strength were assumed in titrations at higher ionic strength. Normal or variant antithrombins (10 μg) were applied to a 5-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated in I 0.15 buffer, washed, and eluted with the program used to purify the variant inhibitor given above. Normal or variant antithrombins were reacted with at least a 5-fold molar excess of heparin to achieve pseudo-first-order conditions, and the kinetics of heparin binding were continuously monitored from the increase in protein fluorescence in an SX-17MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Biophysics, Leatherhead, UK) as in previous studies (7Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The rise in fluorescence was well fit by a single exponential function in all cases, which yielded the observed pseudo-first-order binding rate constant (kobs). kobs from 10–20 reaction traces were averaged for each heparin concentration. Heparin concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 1 μm for determinations of overall association and dissociation rate constants at ionic strengths of 0.15 and 0.3. Polysaccharide concentrations were extended up to 32 μm for resolution of the two steps of the binding process for the full-length heparin in I 0.15 buffer. The proteinase inhibitor activity of the variant antithrombin was assessed by reacting 100 nm variant with 10 nm thrombin or factor Xa in the absence or presence of 300–500 nm heparin in I 0.15 buffer in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Control reactions were done in the absence of inhibitor to establish the activity of the uninhibited enzyme and in the presence of normal antithrombin to determine the normal rate of enzyme inhibition. After varying intervals of time up to 60 min, reactions were quenched by the addition of 0.9 ml of chromogenic substrate, either 100 μm S-2238 (Chromogenix) for thrombin reactions or 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica) for factor Xa reactions, containing 50–100 μg/ml Polybrene to neutralize heparin. Residual enzyme activity was then determined by monitoring the initial linear rate of absorbance increase at 405 nm for several minutes. The effect of the variant antithrombin on the kinetics of normal antithrombin inhibition of thrombin was determined under pseudo-first-order conditions by reacting 100 nm normal antithrombin with 10 nmthrombin with or without 1 nm full-length heparin in the presence of 0–500 nm variant antithrombin. Reactions in the absence of heparin additionally contained 50 μg/ml Polybrene. Reactions were quenched after varying times with 0.9 ml of 100 μm S-2238 containing 50 μg/ml Polybrene, and the residual thrombin activity was measured from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis. Progress curves of the loss in thrombin activity were fit by a single exponential function with a zero activity end point to obtain kobs. In some cases, inactivation was allowed to proceed for a fixed time of 3 or 5 min, andkobs was calculated from the expression for a first-order reaction, (ln(vo/vt))/t, wherevt and vo represent the enzyme activities after reaction for time t and for unreacted enzyme, respectively. The dependence of kobs on the variant antithrombin concentration was fit by the following equation for competitive binding of heparin to normal and variant antithrombins, kobs=kuncat×[AT]0+kH×[H]0×[AT]0/([AT]0+KAT,H×(1+[AT*]0/KAT*,H))(Eq. 1) where kuncat and kHare the second order rate constants for reactions of free and heparin-complexed normal antithrombin with thrombin, [AT]oand [AT*]o are the total concentrations of normal and variant antithrombins, respectively, [H]o is the total heparin concentration, and KAT,H andKAT*,H are the dissociation constants for heparin binding to normal and variant antithrombins. The expression multiplying kH represents the concentration of normal antithrombin-heparin complex in the presence of the competitor variant antithrombin. The expression derives from the cubic equation defining the concentration of antithrombin-heparin complex in the presence of a competitor antithrombin under the conditions, [AT]o, [AT*]o ≫ [H]o, in which the concentrations of the free antithrombins can be equated with their total concentrations (23Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Values for kobsmeasured in the absence of the variant antithrombin, denotedkobs,o, and also in the absence of heparin, denoted k′obs,o, enabled simplification of this equation to the form(kobs−kobs,o′)/(kobs,o−kobs,o′)=(1+[AT]0/KAT,H)/(1+[AT]0/KAT,H+[AT*]0/KAT*,H)(Eq. 2) Data were fit by this equation by fixingKAT,H at the measured value of 19 nm with KAT*,H a fitted parameter. The 16-year-old proband presented in the clinic with deep vein thrombosis. Coagulation test screening identified an abnormality in the antithrombin of the patient, as indicated from the 100% antigen levels but ∼50% activity (Fig. 1 and Table I ), suggesting the presence of an inactive antithrombin variant. No other functional abnormality could be detected and the genetic risk factors, factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A, were not present. Further analysis of the patient antithrombin by crossed immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of heparin indicated a normal profile, consistent with the variant antithrombin binding heparin with an affinity at least as high as that of the normal protein. Sequencing of the coding region of the two antithrombin alleles confirmed that one of the alleles contained an in-frame deletion of 3 base pairs corresponding to the codon for the P1 Arg-393 residue (results not shown but available on request to the authors). Such a mutation has not been previously described. Investigation of the family medical history revealed several cases of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, mesenteric thrombosis, and still births. Thrombosis was correlated with antithrombin deficiency in several cases that were tested (Fig. 1).Table IFamily history of propositusFamily memberClinical commentsAntithrombin functional activity1-aNormal range 0.81–1.35 iu/ml.Antithrombin antigenic activity1-bNormal range 0.79–1.11.I2Died one week after hip operationNA1-cNA, not available for testing.NAII2Spontaneous pulmonary emboli at age 60 years0.64 IU/ml0.91 IU/mlIII1-3Still births (26, 40, and 40 weeks' gestation) preceded by intrauterine growth restrictionNANAIII4Mesenteric thrombosis; not testedIV1Antithrombin deficiency.

Open table in a new tab Antithrombin was purified from the plasma of the proband by heparin-agarose chromatography as in previous studies (15Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 24Olson S.T. Stephens A.W. Hirs C.H.W. Bock P.E. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9717-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Comparison of the specific activity of the isolated proband antithrombin with that purified from normal pooled plasma showed that about twice as much of the former protein than of the latter was required to neutralize a fixed amount of thrombin (Fig. 2). This observation was consistent with the presence of an inactive antithrombin variant in the purified antithrombin. To separate the anticipated variant and normal antithrombins present in the patient antithrombin, thrombin was added in slight molar excess over the amount of normal antithrombin measured in the preparation. After allowing sufficient time to fully complex the normal inhibitor, the protein mixture was subjected to heparin-agarose affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). A peak with high heparin affinity anticipated to be the unreacted variant antithrombin was well separated from two low heparin affinity peaks whose elution positions corresponded to those expected for normal antithrombin-thrombin complex and residual free thrombin. SDS-PAGE showed that the isolated antithrombin variant was pure and comigrated with normal antithrombin but was unable to form an SDS-stable complex with thrombin (Fig. 3A) or with factor Xa (not shown) either in the absence or presence of heparin. The variant, termed antithrombin London or ΔP1 antithrombin to indicate that the P1 Arg residue is deleted, also showed no detectable ability to inhibit thrombin or factor Xa enzymatic activity with or without added heparin (<0.001% normal antithrombin activity, data not shown). Nondenaturing PAGE showed an increased mobility of ΔP1 antithrombin as compared with normal inhibitor (Fig.3B), consistent with deletion of the positively charged P1 Arg residue in the variant. Both normal and variant bands also showed a similar large mobility shift upon the addition of a molar excess of a super high affinity pentasaccharide (17van Boeckel C.A.A. Petitou M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1671-1690Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the variant retained high heparin affinity. Neutrophil elastase cleaved the variant inhibitor at a rate comparable with that of the normal inhibitor in the absence or presence of heparin pentasaccharide (not shown), indicating a similar accessibility of the loop to the enzyme in both inhibitors whether they were in the native or activated conformation.Figure 3SDS and nondenaturing PAGE of purified normal and variant antithrombins.

Interestingly, the variant protein eluted at a much higher salt concentration of 1.9 m than that required to elute the normal inhibitor (1.3 m), indicating that the variant bound heparin with a significantly higher affinity than normal. Direct equilibrium binding studies were conducted by titrating variant and normal antithrombins with both pentasaccharide and full-length high affinity heparins and monitoring polysaccharide binding from the 40% increase in tryptophan fluorescence that signals this binding (15Olson S.T.

https://openalex.org/W2001965627,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-regulated and sequence-specific transcription factor that activates or represses expression of target genes. Here, we show that the N terminus of AR contains an inhibitory domain located in an 81-amino acid segment lying upstream of the DNA-binding domain (DBD). The inhibitory domain interacted directly with DBD and repressed DBD binding to the androgen response element. Mutations of the conserved amino acid residues (K520E and R538E) within the inhibitory domain decreased its inhibiting ability in vitro and increased AR trans-activation in vivo. These data demonstrate the existence of a novel inhibitory domain in the N-terminal part of AR, which might play important roles in the regulation of AR trans-activation."

In pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, VEGF expression is regulated by A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) activation. The present work examines the underlying signaling pathway. The adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A cascade has no role in the down-regulation of VEGF mRNA induced by the A2AAR agonist, 2-[4-[(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl]ethylamino]-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680). Conversely, 6-h exposure of cells to either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors mimicked the CGS21680-induced down-regulation. PMA activated PKCα, PKCε, and PKCζ, and CGS21680 activated PKCε and PKCζ as assessed by cellular translocation. By 6 h, PMA but not CGS21680 decreased PKCα and PKCε expression. Neither compound affected PKCζ levels. Following prolonged PMA treatment to down-regulate susceptible PKC isoforms, CGS21680 but not PMA inhibited the cobalt chloride induction of VEGF mRNA. The proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, abolished PMA- but not CGS21680-induced down-regulation of VEGF mRNA. Phorbol 12,13-diacetate reduced VEGF mRNA levels while down-regulating PKCε but not PKCα expression. In cells expressing a dominant negative PKCζ construct, CGS21680 was unable to reduce VEGF mRNA. Together, the findings suggest that phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of VEGF mRNA occurs as a result of a reduction of PKCε activity, whereas that mediated by the A2AAR occurs following deactivation of PKCζ.

Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar), and was characterized subsequently as an endothelial cell mitogen (2Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). VEGF is involved primarily in angiogenesis, the pruning and reorganization of pre-existing vasculature to create new vasculature, and it has a critical role in embryonic development (3Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In the adult, VEGF is required for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive cycle (4Shweiki D. Itin A. Neufeld G. Gitay-Goren H. Keshet E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and may be cardioprotective during ischemia (5Deindl E. Schaper W. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 186: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, elevated levels of VEGF have been associated with pathologies, such as diabetic retinopathy, endometriosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumorigenesis (3Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 6Wilkinson-Berka J.L. Kelly D.J. Gilbert R.E. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Folkman J.

Many tumors demonstrate elevated levels of VEGF, which can be correlated to disease progression (9Volm M. Koomagi R. Mattern J. Stammler G.

This correlation reflects the requirement of an expanding vasculature for tumor growth, and disruption of VEGF signaling retards cancer progression (13Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W.

Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells are a frequently employed model for hypoxia-initiated responses and have been used to study VEGF gene regulation, as hypoxia is a potent stimulant of VEGF expression (16Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Additionally, PC12 cells express A2A and A2B adenosine receptors (AR) (31Arslan G. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and have been employed to study AR signal transduction and physiologic activity. This laboratory has shown previously that activation of the A2AAR in PC12 cells results in a substantial reduction of VEGF, which is observed at both the mRNA and protein levels (32Olah M.E. Roudabush F.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this down-regulation of VEGF mRNA occurs because of an inhibition of VEGF gene transcription (32Olah M.E. Roudabush F.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar). The nonselective AR agonist, 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine, was also reported to down-regulate VEGF expression in PC12 cells (33Kobayashi S. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20358-20365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Other cell types have been shown to respond to AR agonists with either increases or decreases in VEGF expression (34Feoktistov I. Goldstein A.E. Ryzhov S. Zeng D. Belardinelli L. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Biaggioni I. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 35Grant M.B. Tarnuzzer R.W. Caballero S. Ozeck M.J. Davis M.I. Spoerri P.E. Feoktistov I.

Shock. 2001; 15: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This differential regulation may exist because of the subtype specificity of various AR ligands, and because of cell-specific variations in the signal transduction cascade to which a distinct AR subtype may be linked. The A2AAR is typically coupled via the Gsprotein to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (31Arslan G. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Linden J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). However, certain effects mediated by the A2AAR have been linked to protein kinase C (PKC) activation (39Gubitz A.K. Widdowson L. Kurokawa M. Kirkpatrick K.A. Richardson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Neurosci.

Huang C.L. Messing R.O. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on their requirements for activation, three PKC classes are defined: conventional (α, βI, βII, γ), which are activated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG); novel (δ, ε, η, θ), which are Ca2+-independent; and atypical (ζ, λ, τ), which are activated independently of Ca2+or DAG. PC12 cells have been reported to express PKC isoforms α, βI, βII, δ, ε, η, θ, and ζ (43Ohmichi M. Zhu G. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44Borgatti P. Mazzoni M. Carini C. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Bertolaso L. Previati M. Zauli G. Capitani S. Exp.

Commun. 2000; 275: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two specific PKC isoforms, PKCζ and PKCε, have been demonstrated to regulate VEGF expression. For example, increases in PKCζ activity up-regulate VEGF expression in glioblastoma U373 cells (46Shih S.C. Mullen A. Abrams K. Mukhopadhyay D. Claffey K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15407-15414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and in HT1080 fibrosarcoma and 786-0 renal carcinoma cells (25Pal S. Datta K. Khosravi-Far R. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2395-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Activation of PKCζ has also been implicated in stretch-induced up-regulation of VEGF in retinal capillary pericytes (47Suzuma I. Suzuma K. Ueki K. Hata Y. Feener E.P. King G.L. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that ischemic preconditioning induces translocation of PKCε to the nucleus in cardiomyocytes, which causes up-regulation of VEGF expression (48Kawata H. Yoshida K. Kawamoto A. Kurioka H. Takase E. Sasaki Y. Hatanaka K. Kobayashi M. Ueyama T. Hashimoto T. Dohi K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to elucidate the signal transduction cascade responsible for the down-regulation of VEGF mRNA that is induced by 2-[4-[(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl]-ethylamino]-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680), a selective agonist for the A2AAR. Our results indicate that stimulation of PKC activity by either CGS21680 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) produces an initial up-regulation of VEGF mRNA that is rapidly followed by a marked reduction in VEGF expression. The latter response appears to result from a decrease in PKC activity with specifically PKCε and PKCζ mediating the PMA- and CGS21680-induced response, respectively. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were grown in complete RPMI medium (RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% equine serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone), and were maintained in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C as previously described (32Olah M.E. Roudabush F.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured into collagen-coated six-well dishes, 100-mm dishes, or T-75 flasks for experiments 24 h prior to treatment. Culture medium was replaced with fresh complete RPMI medium or with RPMI 1640 medium, when noted, 30–60 min prior to treatment. The times of treatment with various agonists and inhibitors are provided under “Results.” Control cells were treated with appropriate volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide when appropriate. Intracellular cAMP levels in PC12 cells were determined with a cAMP 125I-Radioimmunoassay Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells in six-well dishes were treated for the indicated amount of time and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1.36 m NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 80.5 mmNa2HPO4, 14.7 mmKH2PO4), scraped, and suspended in 1 ml of EtOH. A 250-μl aliquot of the lysate was then dried at 60 °C for 3 h in a SpeedVac (Savant), and lysates were resuspended in 250 μl of sterile H2O. These solutions were diluted 1:50 in assay buffer, and 100-μl aliquots of the diluted solutions were used for the assay in duplicate. Samples were incubated overnight with125I-labeled cAMP and antiserum complex prior to cAMP precipitation and centrifugation the following day. Gamma counts of the precipitated cAMP pellets were determined, and intracellular cAMP concentrations determined from a set of freshly prepared standards as instructed by the manufacturer. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine VEGF mRNA content as previously described (32Olah M.E. Roudabush F.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Total RNA was isolated from PC12 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA samples were run on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to Zeta-Probe nylon membranes (Bio-Rad) and UV cross-linked with a Strata-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) prior to prehybridization at 42 °C for 2–5 h. Hybridization was conducted overnight with a 600-bp fragment of murine VEGF165 cDNA random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP. The membrane was sequentially washed and subjected to autoradiography. To normalize total RNA levels, membranes were additionally hybridized with a 1,100-bp fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) random prime labeled with [32P]dCTP. Autoradiographic signals were quantitated by an AlphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Total protein from PC12 cells was isolated and analyzed to determine PKC protein levels. Cells were treated for the indicated amounts of time and then scraped in 250 μl of lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol), boiled for 5 min, and microcentrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Total protein concentration of the resulting supernatant was determined with Bio-Rad Protein Assay, and equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h with Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% thiomerosal, in PBS), prior to being incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution in Blotto. The following antibodies were employed: cPKCα (C-20), nPKCε (C-15), and aPKCζ (C-20)-G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were washed three times for 5 min with Blotto and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three times for 5 min in Blotto and two times for 5 min with PBS prior to being developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and being exposed to x-ray film. Signals were analyzed with an AlphaImager 2000. PC12 cells were treated with the appropriate agonists for 5 min. After treatment, subcellular fractions were isolated as previously described (49Huang H.M. Weng C.H. Ou S.C. Hwang T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 668-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells from 100-mm dishes were scraped in 100 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), and protease inhibitors including 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were then Dounce homogenized with 10 strokes, and lysates were microcentrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions) was removed and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min, and the resulting pellet (plasma membrane) was resuspended in 50 μl of suspension buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME, and protease inhibitors as described above) by sonication. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet from the initial 500 × g spin (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in 100 μl of nuclei buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-ME, and protease inhibitors described above) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then layered over 100 μl of nuclei buffer + 0.5m sucrose and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 500 ×g. The pellet (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in 25 μl of suspension buffer by sonication. All fractions were then resuspended in lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min, and microcentrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g prior to protein concentration determination by Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels as described above. Nuclear sample purity was demonstrated with the histone H1 (AE-4) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). PC12 cells were infected with previously characterized replication-deficient adenoviral vectors containing either wild-type or kinase-deficient mutant (dominant negative) forms of PKCζ, or a vector containing β-galactosidase as a control (50Ohba M.

Each recombinant adenovirus was prepared as previously described (52Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Molkentin J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The vectors were expanded in HEK293 cells, and the amount of plaque-forming units for each was determined to infect at an equal multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). The wild-type PKCζ adenoviral vector was infected at an m.o.i. of 600, whereas the dominant negative PKCζ adenoviral vector was infected at an m.o.i. of 800. PC12 cells were infected for 8 h in 4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum with gentle shaking in a 5% CO2-humidified 37 °C cell incubator. Complete RPMI medium was then added to the cells overnight, and cells were either treated for 24 h with 1 μm PMA prior to a 6-h treatment with the appropriate agonist in fresh complete medium, or cells were directly given fresh complete RPMI medium and treated for 6 h with the appropriate agonist. Cells were then scraped in 1 ml of PBS, and a 150-μl aliquot was microcentrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer. PKC protein levels were assessed by Western blot as described above. The remaining cell suspension was spun at 200 × g, and the resulting pellet was used for RNA isolation. VEGF mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot analysis as described above. All experiments were performed a minimum of three times, and in duplicate when noted. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls post-test. Ap value < 0.05 was considered significant. The following compounds were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA): forskolin,N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89), protein kinase A inhibitor 14–22 amide (PKI), PMA, MG-132, bisindolylmaleimide IX (Ro-31-8220), and bisindolylmaleimide I (GFX). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and all cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The following compounds were purchased from Sigma: 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), CGS21680, and phorbol 12, 13-diacetate (PDA). As stimulation of the A2AAR is linked to AC activation (31Arslan G. Kull B. Fredholm B.B. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Olah M.E.

Toxicol. 2001; 41: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), the signaling pathway mediating the down-regulation of VEGF mRNA induced by CGS21680, a selective agonist for the A2AAR, was initially explored using activators and inhibitors of PKA (Fig.1A). As previously described (32Olah M.E. Roudabush F.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of PC12 cells for 6 h with 1 μmCGS21680 reduced the VEGF mRNA level to 27.0 ± 8.1% of that in control cells. Forskolin (5 μm), an activator of AC and 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm), a cell-permeable cAMP analogue, did not alter VEGF mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). The PKA inhibitors, H-89 (5 μm) and PKI (10 μm), had no effect on VEGF mRNA and were unable to reverse the CGS21680-induced down-regulation of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 1A). To further examine the role of cAMP in CGS21680-induced down-regulation of VEGF mRNA, whole cell accumulation of cAMP was assessed in response to forskolin (5 μm) or CGS21680 (1 μm) (Fig. 1B). Radioimmunoassay of cAMP content showed that forskolin elicited a greater increase in cAMP levels than CGS21680 at all time points examined during a 6-h time course. As forskolin increased cAMP levels significantly more than CGS21680, but had no effect on VEGF mRNA levels, the data strongly suggest that cAMP is not involved in the A2AAR-mediated down-regulation of VEGF. Overall, the sum of these data indicates that pathways involving cAMP and/or PKA are not involved in the observed down-regulation of VEGF following the stimulation of the A2AAR in PC12 cells. As activation of the A2AAR has been linked to PKC stimulation in certain systems (39Gubitz A.K. Widdowson L. Kurokawa M. Kirkpatrick K.A. Richardson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40Cunha R.A. Ribeiro J.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 289: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Cunha R.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the role of PKC in the regulation of VEGF mRNA was explored. For the initial analysis, cells were serum-starved for 14 h prior to a 6-h agonist treatment, as growth factors found in serum can stimulate PKC activity and/or up-regulate VEGF expression (21Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Olah M.E. Roudabush F.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 779-787PubMed Google Scholar). Under serum-free conditions, CGS21680 (1 μm), PMA (100 nm), and EGF (10 ng/ml), a growth factor known to activate PKC (21Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Altin J.G. Bradshaw R.A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), similarly regulated VEGF mRNA in a biphasic manner over a 6-h time period (Fig.2A). At 1 h of treatment, all three compounds induced an initial increase in VEGF mRNA levels, followed by a down-regulation of VEGF mRNA by 6 h. The similarity of the PMA-, EGF-, and CGS21680-induced responses indicated that PKC may be involved in the A2AAR-mediated regulation of VEGF. To explore this possibility, the up-regulation of VEGF mRNA induced at 1 h by CGS21680 and PMA was examined for sensitivity to chemical inhibitors of PKC. As shown in Fig.2B, administration of GFX (5 μm) and Ro-31-8220 (5 μm) blocked the increase in VEGF expression that was induced by CGS21680 and PMA. Under these conditions, the PKC inhibitors alone had no effect on VEGF mRNA. Based on the above findings, the ability of CGS21680 and PMA to activate various PKC isoforms was assessed by examining the translocation of PKC isoforms in the nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions as translocation to the membrane or the nucleus is an indicator of enzyme activation (54Toker A.

PKCα, PKCε, and PKCζ isoforms were studied, as each represents one of the three PKC classes: conventional, novel, and atypical, respectively. As shown in Fig.3, PMA promoted the nuclear translocation of PKCα, PKCε, and PKCζ by 710.8 ± 181.8%, 520.5 ± 107.2%, and 397.7 ± 98.9%, respectively. CGS21680 induced the nuclear translocation of PKCε and PKCζ by 358.7 ± 86.3% and 416.0 ± 146.1%, respectively. This correlates with previous data indicating activation of the PKC pathway following stimulation of the A2AAR (39Gubitz A.K. Widdowson L. Kurokawa M. Kirkpatrick K.A. Richardson P.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2044508856,"Positive cofactor 4 (PC4), originally identified as a transcriptional coactivator, possesses the ability to suppress promoter-driven as well as nonspecific transcription via its DNA binding activity. Previous studies showed that the repressive activity of PC4 on promoter-driven transcription is alleviated by transcription factor TFIIH, possibly through one of its enzymatic activities. Using recombinant TFIIH, we have analyzed the role of TFIIH for alleviating PC4-mediated transcriptional repression and determined that the excision repair cross complementing (ERCC3) helicase activity of TFIIH is the enzymatic activity that alleviates PC4-mediated repression via β-γ bond hydrolysis of ATP. In addition, the alleviation does not require either ERCC2 helicase or cyclin-dependent kinase 7 kinase activity. We also show that, as complexed within TFIIH, the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 kinase does not possess the activity to phosphorylate PC4. Thus, TFIIH appears to protect promoters from PC4-mediated repression by relieving the topological constraint imposed by PC4 through the ERCC3 helicase activity rather than by reducing the repressive activity of PC4 via its phosphorylation."

Furthermore, mutants of R. leguminosarum lacking lpcC are deficient in mannosyl transferase activity, are unable to form functional root nodules onPisum sativum, and synthesize a truncated LPS molecule lacking the usual core sugar residues beyond the Kdo disaccharide (4Kadrmas J.L.

J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a gene encoding an ortholog of LpcC is present in S. meliloti. Mutant 6963, which harbors a Tn5 insertion in this gene (designatedlpsB), is defective in symbiosis with Medicagospp. (8Lagares A. Caetano-Anolles G. Niehaus K. Lorenzen J. Ljunggren H.D. Puhler A. Favelukes G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5941-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Niehaus K. Lagares A. Pühler A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 906-914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Initially, mutant 6963 derived from strain 2011 was shown to be delayed in nodulation and poorly competitive for nodule occupancy on alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (8Lagares A. Caetano-Anolles G. Niehaus K. Lorenzen J. Ljunggren H.D. Puhler A. Favelukes G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5941-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In later studies, the same mutant was found to be unable to fix nitrogen (Fix−) onMedicago truncatula (9Niehaus K. Lagares A. Pühler A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 906-914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Clear signs of plant defense were also observed with an abnormal pattern of infection as judged by electron microscopy (9Niehaus K. Lagares A. Pühler A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 906-914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, independent lpsBmutants generated with the related strain S. meliloti 1021 were reported to be Fix− in alfalfa. However, since 2011 and 1021 are both streptomycin-resistant derivatives of the wild type strain SU47, it may be that the defective nitrogen fixation phenotype seen in alfalfa with the lpsB mutant of strain 1021 is the consequence of both the lpsB lesion and some other as yet unidentified mutation in 1021 that is absent in strain 2011. Whatever the explanation, it is apparent that mutants defective inlpsB provide an interesting model system with which to probe the participation of LPS in symbiosis.As shown in Fig. 1, S. meliloti LpsB is 351 amino acid residues long and displays 58% identity and 72% similarity to LpcC over the full length of the entire protein. Accordingly, LpsB, like R. leguminosarum LpcC, would be expected to function as a mannosyl transferase. ThelpsB gene is, in fact, able to complement the truncation of lipopolysaccharide assembly and the nodulation deficiency seen in strain RSKnH, an lpcC mutant of R. leguminosarum(7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, lpcC is not able to restore normal lipopolysaccharide assembly to the S. meliloti lpsB mutant 6963 (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To understand the biochemical basis for this genetic anomaly, we have now characterized the glycosyl transferase activity of the parental strain S. meliloti 2011 and its LPS core biosynthesis/nodulation-deficient mutant 6963. We have also cloned thelpsB gene behind the T7lac promoter and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The results show conclusively that LpsB, like LpcC, can function as an effective mannosyl transferase using GDP-mannose as the donor and Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor substrate. However, unlike LpcC, LpsB shows comparable activity with several other sugar nucleotides, including ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose. These additional activities of LpsB may account for the observation that lpcC cannot substitute forlpsB in cells of S. meliloti (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our findings further suggest that the most important functions of LpsB for S. meliloti biology are those related to the utilization of the sugar nucleotides other than GDP-mannose. How the LpsB protein acquires its relaxed sugar nucleotide selectivity when compared with LpcC can now be studied at the level of enzymology and structure.DISCUSSIONR. leguminosarum LpcC (4Kadrmas J.L. Allaway D. Studholme R.E. Sullivan J.T. Ronson C.W. Poole P.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26432-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and S. melilotiLpsB (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) are protein orthologs that display 58% identity and 72% similarity over their entire lengths (Fig. 1). In other metabolic pathways, such as lipid A biosynthesis (23Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 24Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar), extensive similarity at this level is predictive of functional identity. Accordingly, LpsB of S. meliloti is classified as a mannosyl transferase in genomic databases (6Galibert F. Finan T.M. Long S.R. Puhler A. Abola P. Ampe F. Barloy-Hubler F. Barnett M.J. Becker A. Boistard P. Bothe G. Boutry M. Bowser L. Buhrmester J. Cadieu E. Capela D. Chain P. Cowie A. Davis R.W. Dreano S. Federspiel N.A. Fisher R.F. Gloux S. Godrie T. Goffeau A. Golding B. Gouzy J.

Science. 2001; 293: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), and it can indeed catalyze the mannosylation of Kdo2-lipid IVA in vitro (Fig.7 B). However, LpsB can also utilize several other sugar nucleotide substrates, namely ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose (Fig.7 B), which LpcC does not recognize effectively (Fig. 6) (1Kanipes M.I. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16356-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We also know that whereas the lpsB gene can complement thelpcC mutation of R. leguminosarum,lpcC cannot complement lpsB-deficient strains ofS. meliloti (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings, taken together, demonstrate that LpsB donor substrates other than GDP-mannose (Fig. 7 B) (i.e. most likely UDP-glucose or ADP-glucose) are critical for proper LPS core assembly in S. meliloti.The results shown in Fig. 2 B suggest that LpsB-catalyzed mannose incorporation (lanes 12 and13) may not generate a core biosynthetic intermediate suitable for further glycosylation, as is observed when ADP-glucose or UDP-glucose is added as the sugar donor for LpsB (lower migrating bands in Fig. 2 B, lanes 11 and17). Additional evidence for the idea that mannosylation may prevent further core assembly in S. meliloticomes from the observation that lpcC expressed in thelpsB mutant 6963 does not significantly alter the migration of the truncated LPS species that is present in this strain (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas lpcC and lpsB both restore full-length O-antigen to lpcC mutants of R. leguminosarum(7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). LpcC presumably incorporates mannose into the nascent LPS of theS. meliloti mutant 6963, but the resulting product is not a substrate for further glycosylation.The distinctly different sugar donor selectivity of LpcCversus LpsB demonstrates the need to conduct biochemical and enzymatic studies in conjunction with sequence comparisons when proposing in vivo functions for putative glycosyl transferases. Although LpsB does in fact catalyze the incorporation of mannose into Kdo2-lipid IVA in vitro, the role of LpsB within cells of S. meliloti is most likely the transfer of glucose units to the core of nascent LPS. The results of the present study reveal the difficulties associated with the correct functional assignment and data base annotation of glycosyl transferases. Thousands of diverse glycosyl transferase orthologs for which biochemical selectivity and function cannot be assigned are present in both procaryotic and eucaryotic genomes. LpcC and LpsB are members of a very large family of glycosyl transferases, most of which are probably membrane proteins (4Kadrmas J.L. Allaway D. Studholme R.E. Sullivan J.T. Ronson C.W. Poole P.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26432-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In E. coli, RfaG (the first glucosyl transferase of the core domain) is very distantly related to the LpsB/LpcC family (24Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar). Although an x-ray structure has not been reported for any member of this enzyme family, it is likely that LpcC and LpsB will show similar protein folds. The unusual sugar nucleotide promiscuity of LpsB versus LpcC could be explained by subtle differences in the shapes of their donor substrate binding sites. Structural information might be helpful in redesigning the selectivity of glycosyl transferases such as LpsB with potential applications in the field of large scale carbohydrate synthesis. In that context, it remains to be determined whether or not LpsB actually glycosylates Kdo2-lipid IVA in the same position as does LpcC and generates the same anomeric configurations when using different sugar nucleotides as donor substrates.A discrepancy between the results of Fig. 2 B and our earlier studies (18Kadrmas J.L. Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32119-32125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is the detection of significant mannosyl transferase activity in membranes of S. meliloti 1021. We previously reported that such preparations are inactive (18Kadrmas J.L. Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32119-32125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It may be that the previously reported cultures were not harvested at the same time in late log phase. Furthermore, the cells were not grown in the presence of antibiotics in the previous studies (18Kadrmas J.L. Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32119-32125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Brozek K.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32112-32118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Perhaps the mannosyl transferase is expressed in a regulated manner in response to growth phase or the composition of the medium. Whatever the explanation, the broad substrate selectivity of LpsB might allow for regulation ofS. meliloti core sugar composition in response to changes in the relative intracellular concentrations of GDP-mannoseversus UDP-glucose and/or ADP-glucose. The covalent structure of the S. meliloti core has not been reported. It appears to be complex2 compared with the well characterized core of R. leguminosarum (2Bhat U.R. Krishnaiah B.S. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Carlson R.W. Reuhs B. Chen T.B. Bhat U.R. Noel K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11783-11788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Peculiar characteristics of the S. meliloti core were also suggested by earlier immunological studies. For instance, in contrast to most other Gram-negative bacteria, the immunodominant LPS epitopes of S. meliloti LPS are not located in the O-antigen domain but are in the core region (8Lagares A. Caetano-Anolles G. Niehaus K. Lorenzen J. Ljunggren H.D. Puhler A. Favelukes G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5941-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these core-associated epitopes are missing in the symbiotically defective lpsB mutant 6963 (8Lagares A. Caetano-Anolles G. Niehaus K. Lorenzen J. Ljunggren H.D. Puhler A. Favelukes G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5941-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional structural and physiological studies clearly will be necessary to explore the role of the S. meliloti core during symbiosis with plants.Like the lpsB mutants of S. meliloti, thelpcC mutants of R. leguminosarum show aberrant nodulation (4Kadrmas J.L. Allaway D. Studholme R.E. Sullivan J.T. Ronson C.W. Poole P.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26432-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The LPS in the lpcC mutant RSKnH is entirely devoid of any residual species containing O-antigen (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and both thelpcC and the lpsB genes can restore O-antigen to RSKnH (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly, the lpsB mutant 6963 contains an altered, rapidly migrating LPS species, not present in the wild type, which we believe consists of Kdo2-lipid A (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). This substance is soluble in chloroform/methanol mixtures, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, 6963 differs from RSKnH in that it retains some LPS molecules that are still derivatized with an O-antigen-like polymer or some other kind of polysaccharide (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This more hydrophilic material would not be extracted with chloroform/methanol under our conditions. These complexities could explain why the total LPS, which was extracted with phenol from thelpsB mutant described by Campbell et al. (5Campbell G.R. Reuhs B.L. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3938-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), contains additional sugars besides glucosamine and Kdo. Xylose is reported by Campbell et al. (5Campbell G.R. Reuhs B.L. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3938-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as a major component of the LPS in their lpsB mutant but is not present in our preparations (Fig. 8). As with the structure of the core domain ofS. meliloti,2 the final resolution of these issues will require the development of better methods for LPS purification as well as direct structural analysis of intact material by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.Many interesting questions remain regarding the relaxed substrate selectivity of LpsB versus LpcC. Is this phenomenon associated with other LpcC orthologs seen in organisms likeAgrobacterium tumefaciens, Brucella meliltensis, or Franciscella tularensis? 3The F. tularensis genome is available on the World Wide Web at artedi.ebc.uu.se/Projects/Franciscella/. Is the mannosyl transferase activity of S. meliloti LpsB necessary under certain physiological circumstances when a truncated LPS core would be desirable? Could a mutant of LpsB be isolated that is unable to utilize GDP-mannose but that still functions normally with UDP- and ADP-glucose? Are the secondary glycosylation reactions that follow glucose incorporation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11 and 17) catalyzed by LpsC or LpsD (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)? The further biochemical and genetic analysis of this important class of glycosyl transferases should help to answer these questions and to advance our understanding of core assembly and function in theRhizobiaceae and other Gram-negative bacteria. Molecular insights into the biochemistry of diverse LPS cores could prove useful in the development of new vaccines and in the improvement of agriculturally important crops. As shown in the preceding paper (1Kanipes M.I. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16356-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), LpcC of Rhizobium leguminosarum is a highly selective mannosyl transferase that utilizes the sugar nucleotide GDP-mannose for the enzymatic glycosylation of the acceptor Kdo2-lipid IVA. These findings are consistent with earlier structural studies by Carlson and co-workers (2Bhat U.R. Krishnaiah B.S. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Carlson R.W. Reuhs B. Chen T.B. Bhat U.R. Noel K.D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, mutants of R. leguminosarum lacking lpcC are deficient in mannosyl transferase activity, are unable to form functional root nodules onPisum sativum, and synthesize a truncated LPS molecule lacking the usual core sugar residues beyond the Kdo disaccharide (4Kadrmas J.L. Allaway D. Studholme R.E. Sullivan J.T. Ronson C.W. Poole P.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26432-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Detailed structural studies of the LPS core of Sinorhizobium meliloti have not yet been reported. 2R. Carlson, personal communication. 2R. Carlson, personal communication. The S. meliloti core is complex, and it may contain glucose and galactose residues (5Campbell G.R. Reuhs B.L. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a gene encoding an ortholog of LpcC is present in S. meliloti. Mutant 6963, which harbors a Tn5 insertion in this gene (designatedlpsB), is defective in symbiosis with Medicagospp. (8Lagares A. Caetano-Anolles G. Niehaus K. Lorenzen J. Ljunggren H.D. Puhler A. Favelukes G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5941-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Niehaus K. Lagares A. Pühler A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 906-914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Initially, mutant 6963 derived from strain 2011 was shown to be delayed in nodulation and poorly competitive for nodule occupancy on alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (8Lagares A. Caetano-Anolles G. Niehaus K. Lorenzen J. Ljunggren H.D. Puhler A. Favelukes G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5941-5952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In later studies, the same mutant was found to be unable to fix nitrogen (Fix−) onMedicago truncatula (9Niehaus K. Lagares A. Pühler A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 906-914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Clear signs of plant defense were also observed with an abnormal pattern of infection as judged by electron microscopy (9Niehaus K. Lagares A. Pühler A. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 906-914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, independent lpsBmutants generated with the related strain S. meliloti 1021 were reported to be Fix− in alfalfa. However, since 2011 and 1021 are both streptomycin-resistant derivatives of the wild type strain SU47, it may be that the defective nitrogen fixation phenotype seen in alfalfa with the lpsB mutant of strain 1021 is the consequence of both the lpsB lesion and some other as yet unidentified mutation in 1021 that is absent in strain 2011. Whatever the explanation, it is apparent that mutants defective inlpsB provide an interesting model system with which to probe the participation of LPS in symbiosis. As shown in Fig. 1, S. meliloti LpsB is 351 amino acid residues long and displays 58% identity and 72% similarity to LpcC over the full length of the entire protein. Accordingly, LpsB, like R. leguminosarum LpcC, would be expected to function as a mannosyl transferase. ThelpsB gene is, in fact, able to complement the truncation of lipopolysaccharide assembly and the nodulation deficiency seen in strain RSKnH, an lpcC mutant of R. leguminosarum(7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, lpcC is not able to restore normal lipopolysaccharide assembly to the S. meliloti lpsB mutant 6963 (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To understand the biochemical basis for this genetic anomaly, we have now characterized the glycosyl transferase activity of the parental strain S. meliloti 2011 and its LPS core biosynthesis/nodulation-deficient mutant 6963. We have also cloned thelpsB gene behind the T7lac promoter and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The results show conclusively that LpsB, like LpcC, can function as an effective mannosyl transferase using GDP-mannose as the donor and Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor substrate. However, unlike LpcC, LpsB shows comparable activity with several other sugar nucleotides, including ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose. These additional activities of LpsB may account for the observation that lpcC cannot substitute forlpsB in cells of S. meliloti (7Lagares A. Hozbor D.F. Niehaus K. Otero A.J. Lorenzen J. Arnold W. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our findings further suggest that the most important functions of LpsB for S. meliloti biology are those related to the utilization of the sugar nucleotides other than GDP-mannose. How the LpsB protein acquires its relaxed sugar nucleotide selectivity when compared with LpcC can now be studied at the level of enzymology and structure.

Little is known about the biochemical properties of the glycosyltransferases that assemble the LPS core. We now report the purification and characterization of the Rhizobium leguminosarum mannosyl transferase LpcC, which adds a mannose unit to the inner 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) moiety of the LPS precursor, Kdo2-lipid IVA. LpcC containing an N-terminal His6 tag was assayed using GDP-mannose as the donor and Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor and was purified to near homogeneity.

Mild acid hydrolysis of the glycolipid generated in vitro by pure LpcC showed that the mannosylation occurs on the inner Kdo residue of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. A lipid acceptor substrate containing two Kdo moieties is required by LpcC, since no activity is seen with lipid IVA or Kdo-lipid IVA.

The significance of these correlations remains to be determined, but all three organisms can live inside of eucaryotic cells. R. leguminosarum lpcC mutants, which lack most core and all O-antigen sugars, are able to infect their hosts and form small nodules, but the nodules do not fix nitrogen (14Kadrmas J.L. Allaway D.

Pure LpcC is highly selective for GDP-mannose, consistent with the reported structure of the R. leguminosarum LPS core (11Bhat U.R. Krishnaiah B.S. Carlson R.W.

When lpcC is expressed at 22 °C in a deletion mutant of E. coli lacking bothwaaC and waaF (34Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a single hexose moiety (presumably mannose) is added to a portion of the Kdo2-lipid A made by this strain, further validating the utility of lpcC as a tool for LPS structure modification in living cells of diverse bacteria. The [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ADP-mannose, GDP-mannose, Kdo, and HEPES were obtained from Sigma. Bicinchoninic assay reagents and Triton X-100 were purchased from Pierce. Yeast extract and peptone-tryptone were from Difco. Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates were obtained from Merck. DNA primers and T4 DNA ligase were from Invitrogen, and PCR reagents were from Stratagene. Reagent grade pyridine, chloroform, and methanol were purchased from Mallinckrodt.

E. coli strain BLR(DE3)/pLysS was purchased from Novagen. All bacteria were grown in LB broth (10 g of NaCl, 10 g of peptone-tryptone, and 5 g of yeast extract per liter) (35Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). When necessary, the cultures were supplemented with tetracycline (12 μg/ml) or kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen Mini Prep Kit (Qiagen). Restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs), shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and T4 ligase were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Competent cells were prepared for transformation using the calcium chloride method (36Bergmans H.E. van Die I.M. Hoekstra W.P. J.

The desired fragment was ligated into the pET28b+ vector (Novagen) behind the T7lac promoter that had been digested with the same enzymes, placing a His6 tag at the N terminus. This construct (pMKHN) contains a thrombin cleavage site immediately downstream of the His6tag. The plasmid pMKCA was used for complementation of thewaaC-deficient S. typhimurium mutant SL1377 (18Sirisena D.M. Brozek K.A. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson K.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18874-18884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or of the E. coli waaC-waaF deletion mutant WBB06 (34Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pMKHN was digested with XhoI and BamHI to retrieve the lpcC gene, and the desired fragment was then cloned behind the lac promoter into the vector pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene), digested with the same enzymes, to generate pMKCA. The mannosyl transferase LpcC was assayed using the LPS precursor Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, which was isolated and stored as a frozen aqueous dispersion as described previously (38Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11139-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Prior to each use, the radiolabeled substrate was subjected to ultrasonic irradiation in a water bath for 1 min. The mannosyl transferase was assayed as follows. The reaction mixture (10-μl final volume) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm GDP mannose, and 10 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA(3000–6000 cpm/nmol). The reaction was started by the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme (2.5–5 μg/ml of pure enzyme or about 50 μg/ml of membranes of cells overexpressing lpcC behind the T7lac promoter) and incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by spotting 4-μl samples directly onto a silica gel thin layer plate. After drying the spots at room temperature, the plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v/v/v). Following removal of the solvent with a hot air stream, the plate was analyzed using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager (STORM 840), equipped with ImageQuant software. BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pMKHN was grown from a single colony in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the optical density of 600 reached ∼0.5. The culture was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated with shaking for an additional 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, were resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and were broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. Debris and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer, and the centrifugation was repeated a second time at 100,000 ×g to remove any remaining cytosol. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The membrane pellet was resuspended at 10–15 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C until further use. The washed membranes were solubilized by adding an appropriate volume of a 10% Triton X-100 stock solution to give a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with intermittent inversion on a rotating apparatus (19Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The solubilization mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove any remaining particulate proteins and inclusion bodies. One ml of His-Bind resin (Novagen) was prepared for nickel affinity chromatography in a small disposable column by first washing the resin with 3 column volumes of water, 5 column volumes of 50 mmNiSO4, and 3 column volumes of the binding buffer (Novagen), which contains 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mNaCl, and 20 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.9, with the further addition of 0.1% Triton X-100. A sample of the solubilized membrane proteins (11.2 mg), prepared as described above, was diluted 10-fold in binding buffer and was applied to the column at 4 °C at its natural flow rate. One-ml fractions were collected throughout. The column was washed and then eluted sequentially with 10 ml (5 mm), 6 ml (20 mm), and 6 ml (60 mm) of imidazole in 20 mm Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein content of each fraction was determined. The peak of enzyme activity, which eluted in the 60 mm imidazole wash, was determined by assaying each fraction in the linear range under standard conditions. The proteins were visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 12% SDS using the Bio-Rad Mini Protean II electrophoresis system. The thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen) was used to remove the N-terminal His6 tag and the adjacent thrombin cleavage site from the purified LpcC preparation. Approximately 5 μg of the cleaved purified protein was loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel along with two control lanes containing prestained standards to facilitate transfer to the blot and purified LpcC that had not been cleaved with thrombin. Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 50 min using the Laemmli buffer system. The gel was then soaked in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, for about 5 min. A polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was prepared while the electrophoresis was in progress by brief soaking in methanol, rinsing with water, and then soaking in 10 mmCAPS, pH 11. Protein bands were transferred to the membrane with a Bio-Rad SD electroblotter, according to the manufacturer's directions, at 4 °C. The transferred protein was visualized by Ponceau S staining, and the band of interest was excised. N-terminal sequencing was carried out by Dr. John Leszyk of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology (Shrewsbury, MA). The sequence was determined as GSHMPDIRDV. The first two amino acid residues represent the residual thrombin cleavage site, and the single His residue is derived from the construction of the vector. The remaining sequence corresponds to the predicted N terminus of LpcC. Two 10-μl reaction mixtures in plastic microcentrifuge tubes were prepared containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and either Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (8,000 cpm/reaction) or mannosyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA(8,000 cpm/reaction). The mannosyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVAwas first isolated from a larger scale mannosyl transferase assay system that had been allowed to go to completion. The purification of the mannosyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was achieved by thin layer chromatography, as for the preparation of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (38Basu S.S. York J.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11139-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Next, 4 μl of 10% SDS and 26 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, were added to each microcentrifuge tube, and the tubes were incubated in a boiling water bath. At various times, 4-μl samples were withdrawn and spotted onto a silica TLC plate. The plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v/v/v) and analyzed as described previously to determine the site of mannose attachment (19Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To isolate LPS, 100-ml cultures of the E. coli heptose deficient mutant WBB06 containing either pBluescript KS+ or pMKCA (expressing lpcC in pBluescript KS+) were grown to an optical density of 600 = 1.7 at 22 °C. A relatively low temperature was used for this work in order to induce the biosynthesis of colanic acid (39Gottesman S. Stout V. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and therefore presumably also GDP-mannose, inE. coli. Ce"

https://openalex.org/W2093565204,"The Na+-dependent or E1 stages of the Na,K-ATPase reaction require a few micromolar ATP, but submillimolar concentrations are needed to accelerate the K+-dependent or E2 half of the cycle. Here we use Co(NH3)4ATP as a tool to study ATP sites in Na,K-ATPase. The analogue inactivates the K+ phosphatase activity (an E2 partial reaction) and the Na,K-ATPase activity in parallel, whereas ATP-[3H]ADP exchange (an E1 reaction) is affected less or not at all. Although the inactivation occurs as a consequence of low affinity Co(NH3)4ATP binding (KD ≈ 0.4–0.6 mm), we can also measure high affinity equilibrium binding of Co(NH3)4[3H]ATP (KD = 0.1 μm) to the native enzyme. Crucially, we find that covalent enzyme modification with fluorescein isothiocyanate (which blocks E1 reactions) causes little or no effect on the affinity of the binding step preceding Co(NH3)4ATP inactivation and only a 20% decrease in maximal inactivation rate. This suggests that fluorescein isothiocyanate and Co(NH3)4ATP bind within different enzyme pockets. The Co(NH3)4ATP enzyme was solubilized with C12E8 to a homogeneous population of αβ protomers, as verified by analytical ultracentrifugation; the solubilization did not increase the Na,K-ATPase activity of the Co(NH3)4ATP enzyme with respect to parallel controls. This was contrary to the expectation for a hypothetical (αβ)2 membrane dimer with a single ATP site per protomer, with or without fast dimer/protomer equilibrium in detergent solution. Besides, the solubilized αβ protomer could be directly inactivated by Co(NH3)4ATP, to less than 10% of the control Na,K-ATPase activity. This suggests that the inactivation must follow Co(NH3)4ATP binding at a low affinity site in every protomeric unit, thus still allowing ATP and ADP access to phosphorylation and high affinity ATP sites."
