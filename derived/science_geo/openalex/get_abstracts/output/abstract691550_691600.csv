https://openalex.org/W4225246927,"Abstract Over the past few decades, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight 1 . Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data ( http://www.brainchart.io/ ). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories 2 of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones 3 , showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes."

The Higgs boson was the last missing component of the model. After observation of the Higgs boson, a measurement of the W boson mass provides a stringent test of the model. We measure the W boson mass, MW, using data corresponding to 8.8 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected in proton-antiproton collisions at a 1.96 tera-electron volt center-of-mass energy with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. A sample of approximately 4 million W boson candidates is used to obtain [Formula: see text], the precision of which exceeds that of all previous measurements combined (stat, statistical uncertainty; syst, systematic uncertainty; MeV, mega-electron volts; c, speed of light in a vacuum). This measurement is in significant tension with the standard model expectation."
https://openalex.org/W4223893712,"The human immune system displays substantial variation between individuals, leading to differences in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1,267,758 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTLs, with most showing cell type-specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from naïve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to interindividual variation in immune function. Finally, using a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level. This work brings together genetic epidemiology with scRNA-seq to uncover drivers of interindividual variation in the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W4223992851,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Knowledge of circulating immune cell types and states associated with SLE remains incomplete. We profiled more than 1.2 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (162 cases, 99 controls) with multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing (mux-seq). Cases exhibited elevated expression of type 1 interferon–stimulated genes (ISGs) in monocytes, reduction of naïve CD4 + T cells that correlated with monocyte ISG expression, and expansion of repertoire-restricted cytotoxic GZMH + CD8 + T cells. Cell type–specific expression features predicted case-control status and stratified patients into two molecular subtypes. We integrated dense genotyping data to map cell type–specific cis–expression quantitative trait loci and to link SLE-associated variants to cell type–specific expression. These results demonstrate mux-seq as a systematic approach to characterize cellular composition, identify transcriptional signatures, and annotate genetic variants associated with SLE."
https://openalex.org/W4224078476,"Whereas DNA viruses are known to be abundant, diverse, and commonly key ecosystem players, RNA viruses are insufficiently studied outside disease settings. In this study, we analyzed ≈28 terabases of Global Ocean RNA sequences to expand Earth's RNA virus catalogs and their taxonomy, investigate their evolutionary origins, and assess their marine biogeography from pole to pole. Using new approaches to optimize discovery and classification, we identified RNA viruses that necessitate substantive revisions of taxonomy (doubling phyla and adding >50% new classes) and evolutionary understanding. ""Species""-rank abundance determination revealed that viruses of the new phyla ""Taraviricota,"" a missing link in early RNA virus evolution, and ""Arctiviricota"" are widespread and dominant in the oceans. These efforts provide foundational knowledge critical to integrating RNA viruses into ecological and epidemiological models."
https://openalex.org/W4223950730,"During bone formation, collagen fibrils mineralize with carbonated hydroxyapatite, leading to a hybrid material with excellent properties. Other minerals are also known to nucleate within collagen in vitro. For a series of strontium- and calcium-based minerals, we observed that their precipitation leads to a contraction of collagen fibrils, reaching stresses as large as several megapascals. The magnitude of the stress depends on the type and amount of mineral. Using in-operando synchrotron x-ray scattering, we analyzed the kinetics of mineral deposition. Whereas no contraction occurs when the mineral deposits outside fibrils only, intrafibrillar mineralization generates fibril contraction. This chemomechanical effect occurs with collagen fully immersed in water and generates a mineral-collagen composite with tensile fibers, reminiscent of the principle of reinforced concrete."
https://openalex.org/W4224065213,"Spike architecture influences grain yield in wheat. We report the map-based cloning of a gene determining the number of spikelet nodes per spike in common wheat. The cloned gene is named TaCOL-B5 and encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that is orthologous to COL5 in plant species. Constitutive overexpression of the dominant TaCol-B5 allele but without the region encoding B-boxes in a common wheat cultivar increases the number of spikelet nodes per spike and produces more tillers and spikes, thereby enhancing grain yield in transgenic plants under field conditions. Allelic variation in TaCOL-B5 results in amino acid substitutions leading to differential protein phosphorylation by the protein kinase TaK4. The TaCol-B5 allele is present in emmer wheat but is rare in a global collection of modern wheat cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W4225786093,"Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) has recently emerged as a platform to engineer strongly correlated flat bands. We reveal the normal-state structural and electronic properties of TTG using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy at twist angles for which superconductivity has been observed. Real trilayer samples undergo a strong reconstruction of the moiré lattice, which locks layers into near-magic-angle, mirror symmetric domains comparable in size with the superconducting coherence length. This relaxation introduces an array of localized twist-angle faults, termed twistons and moiré solitons, whose electronic structure deviates strongly from the background regions, leading to a doping-dependent, spatially granular electronic landscape. The Fermi-level density of states is maximally uniform at dopings for which superconductivity has been observed in transport measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4223964264,"Adoptive cell therapy using engineered T cell receptors (TCRs) is a promising approach for targeting cancer antigens, but tumor-reactive TCRs are often weakly responsive to their target ligands, peptide–major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). Affinity-matured TCRs can enhance the efficacy of TCR–T cell therapy but can also cross-react with off-target antigens, resulting in organ immunopathology. We developed an alternative strategy to isolate TCR mutants that exhibited high activation signals coupled with low-affinity pMHC binding through the acquisition of catch bonds. Engineered analogs of a tumor antigen MAGE-A3–specific TCR maintained physiological affinities while exhibiting enhanced target killing potency and undetectable cross-reactivity, compared with a high-affinity clinically tested TCR that exhibited lethal cross-reactivity with a cardiac antigen. Catch bond engineering is a biophysically based strategy to tune high-sensitivity TCRs for T cell therapy with reduced potential for adverse cross-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W4224006698,"We established a genome-wide compendium of somatic mutation events in 3949 whole cancer genomes representing 19 tumor types. Protein-coding events captured well-established drivers. Noncoding events near tissue-specific genes, such as ALB in the liver or KLK3 in the prostate, characterized localized passenger mutation patterns and may reflect tumor-cell-of-origin imprinting. Noncoding events in regulatory promoter and enhancer regions frequently involved cancer-relevant genes such as BCL6 , FGFR2 , RAD51B , SMC6 , TERT , and XBP1 and represent possible drivers. Unlike most noncoding regulatory events, XBP1 mutations primarily accumulated outside the gene’s promoter, and we validated their effect on gene expression using CRISPR-interference screening and luciferase reporter assays. Broadly, our study provides a blueprint for capturing mutation events across the entire genome to guide advances in biological discovery, therapies, and diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W4225657780,"The topological structure associated with the branchpoint singularity around an exceptional point (EP) provides new tools for controlling the propagation of electromagnetic waves and their interaction with matter. To date, observation of EPs in light-matter interactions has remained elusive and has hampered further progress in applications of EP physics. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of EPs in the electrically controlled interaction of light with a collection of organic molecules in the terahertz regime at room temperature. We show, using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, that the intensity and phase of terahertz pulses can be controlled by a gate voltage which drives the device across the EP. This fully electrically-tuneable system allows reconstructing the Riemann surface associated with the complex energy landscape and provides a topological control of light by tuning the loss-imbalance and frequency detuning of interacting modes. We anticipate that our work could pave the way for new means of dynamic control on the intensity and phase of terahertz field, developing topological optoelectronics, and studying the manifestations of EP physics in the quantum correlations of the light emitted by a collection of emitters coupled to resonators."
https://openalex.org/W4223964064,"The in vitro generation of germ cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can have a substantial effect on future reproductive medicine and animal breeding. A decade ago, in vitro gametogenesis was established in the mouse. However, induction of primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) to produce gametes has not been achieved in any other species. Here, we demonstrate the induction of functional PGCLCs from rat PSCs. We show that epiblast-like cells in floating aggregates form rat PGCLCs. The gonadal somatic cells support maturation and epigenetic reprogramming of the PGCLCs. When rat PGCLCs are transplanted into the seminiferous tubules of germline-less rats, functional spermatids-that is, those capable of siring viable offspring-are generated. Insights from our rat model will elucidate conserved and divergent mechanisms essential for the broad applicability of in vitro gametogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4225986550,"Advances in nanoscale self-assembly have enabled the formation of complex nanoscale architectures. However, the development of self-assembly strategies toward bottom-up nanofabrication is impeded by challenges in revealing these structures volumetrically at the single-component level and with elemental sensitivity. Leveraging advances in nano-focused hard x-rays, DNA-programmable nanoparticle assembly, and nanoscale inorganic templating, we demonstrate nondestructive three-dimensional imaging of complexly organized nanoparticles and multimaterial frameworks. In a three-dimensional lattice with a size of 2 micrometers, we determined the positions of about 10,000 individual nanoparticles with 7-nanometer resolution, and identified arrangements of assembly motifs and a resulting multimaterial framework with elemental sensitivity. The real-space reconstruction permits direct three-dimensional imaging of lattices, which reveals their imperfections and interfaces and also clarifies the relationship between lattices and assembly motifs."
https://openalex.org/W4224949887,"After large galaxies merge, their central supermassive black holes are expected to form binary systems. Their orbital motion should generate a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies. Searches for this background use pulsar timing arrays, which perform long-term monitoring of millisecond pulsars at radio wavelengths. We used 12.5 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data to form a gamma-ray pulsar timing array. Results from 35 bright gamma-ray pulsars place a 95% credible limit on the GWB characteristic strain of 1.0 × 10-14 at a frequency of 1 year-1. The sensitivity is expected to scale with tobs, the observing time span, as [Formula: see text]. This direct measurement provides an independent probe of the GWB while offering a check on radio noise models."
https://openalex.org/W4226063069,"Paranoia and belief in conspiracy theories both involve suspiciousness about the intentions of others but have rarely been studied together. In three studies, one with a mainly student sample (N = 496) and two with more representative UK population samples (N = 1,519, N = 638) we compared single and two-factor models of paranoia and conspiracy theories as well as associations between both belief systems and other psychological constructs. A model with two correlated factors was the best fit in all studies. Both belief systems were associated with poor locus of control (belief in powerful others and chance) and loneliness. Paranoid beliefs were specifically associated with negative self-esteem and, in two studies, insecure attachment; conspiracy theories were associated with positive self-esteem in the two larger studies and narcissistic personality traits in the final study. Conspiracist thinking but not paranoia was associated with poor performance on the Cognitive Reflection Task (poor analytical thinking). The findings suggest that paranoia and belief in conspiracy theories are distinct but correlated belief systems with both common and specific psychological components."
https://openalex.org/W4226098345,"As a global threat, the COVID-19 pandemic has been an important factor in increasing death rate worldwide. As the virus spreads across international borders, it causes severe illness, death, and disruptions in our daily lives. Death and dying rituals and customs aid bereaved people in overcoming their grief. In this sense, the purpose of this study was to access thoughts and feelings of Portuguese adults and the impact of the loss in daily life during COVID-19. A structured online questionnaire was applied (snowball sampling) and qualitative data on death and mourning namely the impact of the loss in daily life, was collected. One hundred and sixty-six individuals have lost someone since the beginning of the pandemic and were included. Analysis was inspired by Braun and Clark’s content analysis. Most participants were female (66.9%), the median age was of 37.3 years, and 70.5% had a high education degree. Moreover, 30.7% of the participants present anxiety symptoms and 10.2% depression symptoms. The answers of studied participants gave insights on the extent of the loss in day-to-day life and four thematic themes were found: (1) The perceived inadequacy of the funeral rituality, (2) Sadness, fear and loneliness, (3) Changes in sleeping and concentration and increased levels of anxiety and (4) Concerns regarding the pandemic situation. We found a high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study sample. Also, the changes in post mortem procedures, have shown to be of great importance in the mourning procedure of the participants."
https://openalex.org/W4225981502,"Chinese households have overinvested in risk-free financial assets, resulting in a single structure of financial assets. However, this proportion declined as digital finance developed. By combing the data from the China Household Finance Survey Data and the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China, we find that digital finance significantly promotes household participation in risky financial markets. Further mechanistic analysis unveils that digital finance mainly affects households’ participation in risky financial markets by reducing the lack of investment channels, promoting households’ access to financial information and increasing the possibility of household risk appetite. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis suggests that digital finance effectively reduces the deterrent effect of wealth and cognitive thresholds on all households, reflecting the inclusive nature of financial development. Our findings provide an empirical basis for the mainstream positioning of digital finance in the development of inclusive finance, and display its positive impact on social welfare."

https://openalex.org/W4226377825,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are both risk factors for bleeding, stroke and mortality. The aim of our study was to investigate the interaction between CKD and atrial fibrillation and outcomes.We included 12,394 subjects referred to the University Medical Center Utrecht (the Netherlands) from September 1996 to February 2018 for an out-patient visit (Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort Second Manifestation of Arterial disease cohort). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for bleeding, ischemic stroke or mortality were calculated with Cox proportional hazard analyses. Presence of interaction between AF and CKD was examined by calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), the attributable proportion (AP) due to interaction and the synergy index (S).Of the 12,394 patients, 699 patients had AF, 2,752 patients had CKD and 325 patients had both AF and CKD. Patients with both CKD and AF had a 3.0-fold (95% CI 2.0-4.4) increased risk for bleeding, a 4.2-fold (95% CI 3.0-6.0) increased ischemic stroke risk and a 2.2-fold (95% CI 1.9-2.6) increased mortality risk after adjustment as compared with subjects without atrial fibrillation and CKD. We did not find interaction between AF and CKD for bleeding and mortality. However, we found interaction between AF and CKD for ischemic stroke risk (RERI 1.88 (95% CI 0.31-3.46), AP 0.45 (95% CI 0.17-0.72) and S 2.40 (95% CI 1.08-5.32)).AF and CKD are both associated with bleeding, ischemic stroke and mortality. There is a positive interaction between AF and CKD for ischemic stroke risk, but not for bleeding or mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4225822655,"Despite quantum electrodynamics (QED) being one of the most stringently tested theories underpinning modern physics, recent precision atomic spectroscopy measurements have uncovered several small discrepancies between experiment and theory. One particularly powerful experimental observable that tests QED independently of traditional energy level measurements is the ""tune-out"" frequency, where the dynamic polarizability vanishes and the atom does not interact with applied laser light. In this work, we measure the tune-out frequency for the 23S1 state of helium between transitions to the 23P and 33P manifolds and compare it with new theoretical QED calculations. The experimentally determined value of 725,736,700(260) megahertz differs from theory [725,736,252(9) megahertz] by 1.7 times the measurement uncertainty and resolves both the QED contributions and retardation corrections."
https://openalex.org/W4226035627,"Coronary vasospasm is a known side effect of 5-FU (fluorouracil) therapy. Beyond switching to non-5FU-based chemotherapy, there are no established treatments for 5-FU associated coronary vasospam. Our objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of re-challenge with 5-FU after pre-treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and long-acting nitrates among patients 5-FU associated coronary vasospasm.We conducted a retrospective study of patients with 5-FU coronary vasospasm at a single academic center. By protocol, those referred to cardio-oncology received pre-treatment with either combination [nitrates and CCBs] or single-agent therapy [nitrates or CCBs]) prior to re-challenge with 5-FU. Our primary outcome was overall survival. Other important outcomes included progression-free survival and safety.Among 6,606 patients who received 5-FU from January 2001 to Dec 2020, 115 (1.74%) developed coronary vasospasm. Of these 115 patients, 81 patients continued 5-FU therapy, while 34 stopped. Of the 81 who continued, 78 were referred to cardio-oncology and prescribed CCBs and/or nitrates prior to subsequent 5-FU, while the remaining 3 continued 5-FU without cardiac pre-treatment. Of the 78, 56.4% (44/78) received both nitrates and CCBs, 19.2% (15/78) received CCBs alone, and 24.4% (19/78) received nitrates alone. When compared to patients who stopped 5-FU, those who continued 5-FU after pre-treatment (single or combination therapy) had a decreased risk of death (HR 0.42, P = 0.005 [95% CI 0.23-0.77]) and a trend towards decreased cancer progression (HR 0.60, P = 0.08 [95% CI 0.34-1.06]). No patient in the pre-treatment group had a myocardial infarct after re-challenge; however, chest pain (without myocardial infarction) recurred in 19.2% (15/78) among those who received cardiac pre-treatment vs. 66.7% (2/3) among those who did not (P = 0.048). There was no difference in efficacy or the recurrence of vasospasm among patients who received pre-treatment with a single agent (nitrates or CCBs) or combination therapy (14.7% (5/34) vs. 25.0% (11/44), P = 0.26).Re-challenge after pre-treatment with CCBs and nitrates guided by a cardio-oncology service was safe and allowed continued 5-FU therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4225554041,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) is becoming increasingly more accessible to biomedical researchers with significant potential to transform biomedicine through optimization of highly-accurate predictive models and enabling better understanding of disease biology. Automated machine learning (AutoML) in particular is positioned to democratize artificial intelligence (AI) by reducing the amount of human input and ML expertise needed. However, successful translation of AI/ML in biomedicine requires moving beyond optimizing only for prediction accuracy and towards establishing reproducible clinical and biological inferences. This is especially challenging for clinical studies on rare disorders where the smaller patient cohorts and corresponding sample size is an obstacle for reproducible modeling results. Here, we present a model-agnostic framework to reinforce AutoML using strategies and tools of explainable and reproducible AI, including novel metrics to assess model reproducibility. The framework enables clinicians to interpret AutoML-generated models for clinical and biological verifiability and consequently integrate domain expertise during model development. We applied the framework towards spinal cord injury prognostication to optimize the intraoperative hemodynamic range during injury-related surgery and additionally identified a strong detrimental relationship between intraoperative hypertension and patient outcome. Furthermore, our analysis captured how evolving clinical practices such as faster time-to-surgery and blood pressure management affect clinical model development. Altogether, we illustrate how expert-augmented AutoML improves inferential reproducibility for biomedical discovery and can ultimately build trust in AI processes towards effective clinical integration."
https://openalex.org/W4226133975,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is transmitted mainly by droplet or aerosol infection; however, it may also be transmitted by contact infection. SARS-CoV-2 that adheres to environmental surfaces remains infectious for several days. We herein attempted to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus adhering to an environmental surface by dry fogging hypochlorous acid solution and hydrogen peroxide solution. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus were air-dried on plastic plates and placed into a test chamber for inactivation by the dry fogging of these disinfectants. The results obtained showed that the dry fogging of hypochlorous acid solution and hydrogen peroxide solution inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in CT value (the product of the disinfectant concentration and contact time)-dependent manners. SARS-CoV-2 was more resistant to the virucidal effects of aerosolized hypochlorous acid solution and hydrogen peroxide solution than influenza A virus; therefore, higher concentrations of disinfectants or longer contact times were required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 than influenza A virus. The present results provide important information for the development of a strategy that inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus on environmental surfaces by spatial fogging."

https://openalex.org/W4225524759,"Brassica juncea L. is a significant member of the Brassicaceae family, also known as Indian mustard. Water is a limiting factor in the successful production of this crop. Here, we tested the effect of water shortage in B. juncea plants supplemented with or without the application of silicon and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in total 8 different treatments compared under open filed conditions using a randomised complete block design (RCBD). The treatments under control conditions were control (C, T1); C+Silicon (Si, T2); C+My (Mycorrhiza; T3); and C+Si+My (T4). In contrast, treatments under stress conditions were S (Stress; T5); S+Si (T6); S+My (T7) and S+Si+My (T8), respectively. In total, we evaluated 16 traits, including plant response to stress by evaluating peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity. The fresh weight (g) increased only 7.47 percent with mycorrhiza (C+My) and 22.39 percent with silicon (C+Si) but increased 291.08 percent with both mycorrhiza and silicon (C+Si+My). Using mycorrhiza (S+My) or silicon (S+Si) alone produced a significant increase of 53.16 percent and 55.84 percent in fresh weight, respectively, while using both mycorrhiza and silicon (S+Si+My) together produced a dramatic increase of 380.71 percent under stress conditions. Superoxidase dismutase concentration (Ug-1 FW) was found to be increased by 29.48 percent, 6.71 percent, and 22.63 percent after applying C+My, C+Si and C+Si+My, but treatment under stress revealed some contrasting trends, with an increase of 11.21 percent and 19.77 percent for S+My, S+Si+My, but a decrease of 13.15 percent for S+Si. Finally, in the presence of stress, carotenoid content (mg/g FW) increased by 58.06 percent, 54.83 percent, 183.87 percent with C+My, and 23.81 percent with S+My and S+Si+My, but decreased by 22.22 percent with S+Si. Silicon application proved to be more effective than AMF treatment with Rhizophagus irregularis, and the best results were obtained with the combination of Si and AMF. This work will help to suggest the measures to overcome the water stress in B. juncea."

Aim of the present study was to enhance solubility and permeation of curcumin for the treatment of corneal bacterial infections. For increasing solubility, curcumin and polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) complex (1:3) was prepared by fusion melting method. Phase solubility studies were used for the calculation of Gibbs free energy of curcumin. Central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was applied for optimization of Curcumin (CUR), PEGylated Curcumin (PEG-CUR), penetration enhancer cremophore (CR). Optimized ointments were further evaluated by mucous permeation, membrane permeability and cell toxicity studies by Transwell cell, ussing chamber and Caco-2 cells respectively. Antibacterial test was also performed by agar well diffusion method. Solubility of PEG-CUR was increased up to 93±3.2% as compared to pure curcumin and content uniformity was in the range of 95–110%. Curcumin permeation from PEG-CUR ointment was increased up to 12 folds. No toxicity of Caco-2 cells for PEG-CUR even after 24h was observed. Activity index of pure CUR, PEG-CUR ointment with or without CR against S . aureus and P . aeruginosa was 97±2.3, 96±1.6, 95±2.5% respectively. Ointment with solubility enhanced PEG-CUR and cremophore can be used as a promising tool for the treatment of corneal bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W4225590991,"Current USEPA ecological risk assessments for pesticide registration include a determination of potential risks to bees. Toxicity data are submitted to support these assessments and the USEPA maintains a large database containing acute and chronic toxicity data on adult and larval honey bees (Apis mellifera), which USEPA considers a surrogate for Apis and non-Apis bees. We compared these toxicity data to explore possible trends. This analysis indicated a significant correlation between acute contact and oral median lethal dose (LD50) values for adult honey bees (ρ = 0.74, p <0.0001). Using default EPA modeling assumptions, where exposure for an individual bee is roughly 12x lower through contact than through ingestion, the analysis indicates that the oral LD50 is similarly if not more protective of the contact LD50 for the majority of pesticides and modes of action evaluated. The analysis also provided evidence that compounds with a lower acute toxicity for adults through contact and oral exposure pathways may still be acutely toxic for larvae. The acute toxicity of herbicides and fungicides was higher for larvae relative to oral and contact toxicity for adult honey bees for the same compounds and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from chronic toxicity studies were lower for larvae relative to adults, indicating increased sensitivity of larvae. When comparing 8-day LD50 values between single dose larval acute studies to those derived from repeat dose 22-day larval chronic toxicity studies, the LD50 values derived from chronic studies were significantly lower than those from acute toxicity tests (Z = -37, p = 0.03)."
https://openalex.org/W4226062045,"The World Health Organization has advocated mandatory face mask usage to combat the spread of COVID-19, with multilayer masks recommended for enhanced protection. However, this recommendation has not been widely adopted, with noncompliant persons citing discomfort during prolonged usage of face masks. And yet, a scientific understanding on how face mask fabrics/garment systems affect thermophysiological comfort remains lacking. We aimed to investigate how fabric/garment properties alter the thermal and evaporative resistances responsible for thermophysiological strain. We constructed 12 different layered facemasks (D1-D5, T1-T6, Q1) with various filters using commercially available fabrics. Three approaches were employed: (1) the evaporative and thermal resistances were measured in all the test face masks using the medium size to determine the effect of fabric properties; (2) the effect of face mask size by testing close-fitted (small), fitted (medium) and loose fitted (large) face mask T-6; (3) the effect of face mask fit by donning a large size face mask T-6, both loose and tightened using thermal manikin, Newton. ANOVA test revealed that the additional N95 middle layer filter has no significant effect on the thermal resistances of all the face masks, and evaporative resistances except for face masks T-2 and T-3 (P-values<0.05) whereas size significantly affected thermal and evaporative resistances (P-values<0.05). The correlation coefficient between the air gap size and the thermal and evaporative resistance of face masks T-6 were R2 = 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. The tight fit large face mask had superior performance in the dissipation of heat and moisture from the skin (P-values <0.05). Three-layer masks incorporating filters and water-resistant and antimicrobial/antiviral finishes did not increase discomfort. Interestingly, using face masks with fitters improved user comfort, decreasing thermal and evaporative resistances in direct opposition to the preconceived notion that safer masks decrease comfort."

We analyse how Ph.D. students perceive the institutional entrepreneurial environment, the drivers and the factors hindering entrepreneurship and gender-equality among faculties at the parent institution. We find evidence of a gender bias in Ph.D. entrepreneurship and that the perception about the factors either hampering or supporting entrepreneurship is deeply different between sexes. The academic environment can have a fundamental impact on students’ decisions to start new ventures and on the probability that they will abandon their entrepreneurial intentions. Female student entrepreneurs particularly benefit from the opportunity to engage with a gender-balanced work environment."

Conducting standardized authenticity tests is critical to the effective use of observed data products in models, data assimilation, and various terminal scenarios. Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data were used as a reference for comparative analysis, and triple collocation analysis was used to validate data from four mainstream passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture products: Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP), Global Change Observation Mission–Water using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument, and Fengyun-3C (FY-3C). The effects of topography, land cover, and meteorological factors on the accuracy of soil moisture observation data were determined. The results show that SMAP had the best overall performance and AMSR2 the worst. Passive microwave detection technology can accurately capture soil moisture data in areas at high altitude with uniform terrain, particularly if the underlying surface is soil, and in areas with low average temperatures and little precipitation, such as the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. FY-3C performed in the middle of the group and was relatively optimal in northeast China but showed poor data integrity. Variation in accuracy between products, together with other factors identified in the study, provides a baseline reference for the improvement of the retrieval algorithm, and the research results provide a quantitative basis for developing better use of passive microwave soil moisture products."
https://openalex.org/W4226325231,"Overview Processed foods make up about 70 percent of the North American diet. Sulfites and other food preservatives are added to these foods largely to limit bacterial contamination. The mouth microbiota and its associated enzymes are the first to encounter food and therefore likely to be the most affected. Methods Eight saliva samples from ten individuals were exposed to two sulfite preservatives, sodium sulfite and sodium bisulfite. One sample set was evaluated for bacteria composition utilizing 16s rRNA sequencing, and the number of viable cells in all sample sets was determined utilizing ATP assays at 10 and 40-minute exposure times. All untreated samples were analyzed for baseline lysozyme activity, and possible correlations between the number of viable cells and lysozyme activity. Results Sequencing indicated significant increases in alpha diversity with sodium bisulfite exposure and changes in relative abundance of 3 amplicon sequence variants (ASV). Sodium sulfite treated samples showed a significant decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, a marginally significant change in alpha diversity, and a significant change in the relative abundance for Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and for 6 ASVs. Beta diversity didn’t show separation between groups, however, all but one sample set was observed to be moving in the same direction under sodium sulfite treatment. ATP assays indicated a significant and consistent average decrease in activity ranging from 24–46% at both exposure times with both sulfites. Average initial rates of lysozyme activity between all individuals ranged from +/- 76% compared to individual variations of +/- 10–34%. No consistent, significant correlation was found between ATP and lysozyme activity in any sample sets. Conclusions Sulfite preservatives, at concentrations regarded as safe by the FDA, alter the relative abundance and richness of the microbiota found in saliva, and decrease the number of viable cells, within 10 minutes of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W4225632133,"While the epidemiologic literature suggests certain maternal occupational exposures may be associated with reduced measures of size at birth, the occupational literature employing fetal biometry data to assess fetal growth is sparse. The present study examines associations between maternal occupational exposures and ultrasound-measured fetal growth. We included 1,739 singleton pregnancies from the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) project (2003-2008). At 32 weeks of pregnancy, interviewers ascertained mothers’ employment status and assessed job-related physical loads, work schedules, and job strain during pregnancy. Job titles were linked to a job-exposure matrix to estimate exposure to 10 endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) groups. We calculated z-scores from longitudinal growth curves representing trajectories from 0-12, 12-20 and 20-34 gestational weeks for abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and estimated fetal weight (EFW). Linear mixed models clustered by IMNA region (i.e., Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, Valencia) were used to examine associations between occupational exposures and fetal growth. Effect estimates are presented as percentage change in fetal growth. There was limited evidence of associations between work-related non-chemical stressors and fetal growth. We observed associations of similar magnitude between multiple EDC groups and decreased EFW trajectories during 20-34 gestational weeks (phthalates: -1.4% [-3.5, 0.6%]; alkylphenolic compounds (APCs): -1.1% [-2.3, 0.1%]; miscellaneous chemicals: -1.5% [-3.7, 0.8%]), while miscellaneous chemicals were associated with increased BPD from 12-20 weeks (2.1% [0.8, 3.5%]). Notably, 67% of women exposed to phthalates were hairdressers; 68% of women exposed to APCs worked as domestic cleaners. In conclusion, we found limited evidence that maternal occupational exposures impact fetal growth. Further research should consider the combined impact of multiple workplace exposures."
https://openalex.org/W4225671735,"Objective This study aimed to determine whether the visual response to flickering checkerboard patterns measured using electroencephalography (EEG) relate to excitatory or inhibitory metabolite levels measured using ultra-high (7Tesla/7T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Background Electrophysiological studies have shown altered visual cortical response amplitudes and contrast gain responses to high contrast flickering patterns in people with migraine. These contrast response anomalies have been argued to represent an imbalance between cortical inhibition and excitation, however the specific mechanism has not been elucidated. Methods MRS-measured metabolite levels were obtained from the occipital cortex of 18 participants with migraine and 18 non-headache controls. EEG contrast gain response functions were collected on separate days from a subset of 10 participants with migraine and 12 non-headache controls. Case-control outcome measures were statistically compared between groups both before and after checkboard exposure. Results No significant difference in GABA and glutamate levels were found between groups nor checkerboard timepoint. Glucose levels were significantly reduced after checkerboard exposure in both participant groups. There was no metabolic signature in visual cortex in response to high-contrast flickering checkboards that distinguished those with migraine and without. There was also no correlation between MRS and EEG measurements in response to the flickering checkerboard. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the mechanisms driving contrast-flickering stimulus aversion are not simplistically reflected by gross changes in metabolic activity in the primary visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W4226026354,"Personal wellness data collected using wearable devices is a valuable resource, potentially containing knowledge that goes beyond what the device and its the associated software application can tell the user. However, extracting such knowledge from the data requires expertise that an average user cannot be expected to have. To overcome this problem, the data owner could collaborate with a data analysis expert; for such a collaboration to succeed, the collaborators need to be able to find one another, communicate with one another and share datasets and analysis results with one another. In this paper we presents a process model for such collaborations, a domain ontology and software system developed to support the process, and the results of a user trial demonstrating collaborative analysis of sleep data. Unlike existing collaborative data analytics tools, the process and software have been specifically designed with the non-expert data owner in mind, enabling them to control their data and protect their privacy by selecting the data to be shared on a case-by-case basis. Theoretical analysis and empirical results suggest that the process and its implementation are valid as a proof of concept."
https://openalex.org/W4226070799,"Facial expression recognition has been studied extensively, including in relation to social anxiety. Nonetheless, a limited number of studies examined recognition of disgust expressions. Results suggest that disgust is perceived as more threatening than anger, and thus may invite more extreme responses. However, few studies have examined responses to facial expressions. These studies have focused on approach-avoidance responses. Our primary aim was to examine to what extent anger and disgust expressions might invite interpersonal responses in terms of quarrelsomeness-agreeableness and dominance-submissiveness. As social anxiety has been previously associated with a heightened sensitivity to anger and disgust expressions, as well as with alterations in quarrelsomeness-agreeableness and dominance-submissiveness, our secondary aim was to examine whether social anxiety would moderate these responses.Participants were 55 women and 43 men who completed social anxiety measures, including the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale, and two tasks that involved ""targets"" expressing anger, disgust, or happiness at 0%, 50%, or 100%. Participants first indicated how quarrelsome or agreeable and how dominant or submissive they would be towards each target, and then how much they would avoid or approach each target.While 100% disgust and anger expressions invited similar levels of quarrelsomeness and avoidance, 50% disgust invited more quarrelsomeness and stronger avoidance than 50% anger. While these patterns were not meaningfully moderated by social anxiety, individuals with higher BFNE scores showed a relatively strong approach of happy faces.Actual interpersonal behaviour in response to facial expressions was not assessed.Findings support the relevance of disgust as an interpersonal signal and suggest that, especially at mild intensity, disgust may have a stronger impact than anger on people's quarrelsomeness and avoidance responses. Findings provided no support for the view that people with social anxiety would be particularly responsive to disgust (or anger) expressions."

In particular, we develop two methods for functional group-sparse regression under a generic Hilbert space of infinite dimension. We show the convergence of algorithms and the consistency of the estimation and the selection (oracle property) under infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the methods in both the selection and the estimation of functional coefficients. The applications to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveal the regions of the human brain related to ADHD and IQ."

Their SFCT and CVI were measured using the SS-OCT scan passing through the central fovea and image binarization. The difference in baseline SFCT and CVI from each group and their yearly changes up to second year of follow up were analyzed. The baseline characteristics of the groups were also compared.The baseline characteristics, including CVI and SFCT, of the MacTel group and the control group were not significantly different, except for BCVA. The mean CVI of MacTel group were 64.59 ± 2.92%, 63.76 ± 2.67%, and 62.97 ± 2.74% (p < 0.001) whereas that of control group were 63.33 ± 2.45%, 63.04 ± 2.46%, and 63.43 ± 2.25% (p = 0.636) at baseline, 1 and 2 years, respectively. The mean SFCT of MacTel group were 324.65 ± 89.65μm, 326.14 ± 93.11μm, and 322.65 ± 91.77μm (p = 0.436), whereas that of control group were 304.30 ± 51.86 μm, 300.86 ± 52.64μm, and 298.55 ± 53.71μm (p = 0.275) at baseline, 1 and 2 years, respectively.CVI decreases at a faster rate in MacTel type 2 in comparison with healthy subjects. This may suggest possible choroidal involvement in the progression of MacTel type 2."

https://openalex.org/W4225838170,"A central question in behavioral and social sciences is understanding to what extent cultural traits are inherited from previous generations, transmitted from adjacent populations or produced in response to changes in socioeconomic and ecological conditions. As quantitative diachronic databases recording the evolution of cultural artifacts over many generations are becoming more common, there is a need for appropriate data-driven methods to approach this question. Here we present a new Bayesian method to infer the dynamics of cultural traits in a diachronic dataset. Our method called Evoked-Transmitted Cultural model (ETC) relies on fitting a latent-state model where a cultural trait is a latent variable which guides the production of the cultural artifacts observed in the database. The dynamics of this cultural trait may depend on the value of the cultural traits present in previous generations and in adjacent populations (transmitted culture) and/or on ecological factors (evoked culture). We show how ETC models can be fitted to quantitative diachronic or synchronic datasets, using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, enabling estimating the relative contribution of vertical transmission, horizontal transmission and evoked component in shaping cultural traits. The method also allows to reconstruct the dynamics of cultural traits in different regions. We tested the performance of the method on synthetic data for two variants of the method (for binary or continuous traits). We found that both variants allow reliable estimates of parameters guiding cultural evolution, and that they outperform purely phylogenetic tools that ignore horizontal transmission and ecological factors. Overall, our method opens new possibilities to reconstruct how culture is shaped from quantitative data, with possible application in cultural history, cultural anthropology, archaeology, historical linguistics and behavioral ecology."

https://openalex.org/W4226251467,"Although peripheral deafferentation studies have demonstrated a critical role for trigeminal afference in modulating the orosensorimotor control of eating and drinking, the central trigeminal pathways mediating that control, as well as the timescale of control, remain to be elucidated. In rodents, three ascending somatosensory pathways process and relay orofacial mechanosensory input: the lemniscal, paralemniscal, and extralemniscal. Two of these pathways (the lemniscal and extralemniscal) exhibit highly structured topographic representations of the orofacial sensory surface, as exemplified by the one-to-one somatotopic mapping between vibrissae on the animals’ face and barrelettes in brainstem, barreloids in thalamus, and barrels in cortex. Here we use the Prrxl1 knockout mouse model (also known as the DRG11 knockout) to investigate ingestive behavior deficits that may be associated with disruption of the lemniscal pathway. The Prrxl1 deletion disrupts somatotopic patterning and axonal projections throughout the lemniscal pathway but spares patterning in the extralemniscal nucleus. Our data reveal an imprecise and inefficient ingestive phenotype. Drinking behavior exhibits deficits on the timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Eating behavior shows deficits over an even broader range of timescales. An analysis of food acquisition and consummatory rate showed deficits on the timescale of seconds, and analysis of body weight suggested deficits on the scale of long term appetitive control. We suggest that ordered assembly of trigeminal sensory information along the lemniscal pathway is critical for the rapid and precise modulation of motor circuits driving eating and drinking action sequences."

https://openalex.org/W4225557036,"In 2016/2017 we had a major epidemic of chikungunya (CHIK) in Brazil, with many deaths. We evaluated to factors associated with deaths from CHIK that occurred in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil.A matched case-control study was conducted (1:2), by sex, age (± 5 years) and neighborhood. Cases were CHIK deaths that occurred between January 1 and December 31, 2017, in Fortaleza, Brazil, and which were laboratory confirmed. Controls were laboratory confirmed CHIK patients occurring in the same neighborhood and in the same period, but which did not progress to death.82 cases of CHIK and 164 controls were included. Considering the clinical history, significant associations were found between other chronic heart diseases (OR 3.8; CI: 1.53-9.26) and chronic kidney disease (OR 12.77; CI: 2.75-59.4). In the multivariate analysis of the variables related to signs and symptoms, fever (OR: 19.23 CI: 1.73-213.78), abdominal pain (OR: 3; 74 CI: 1.06-13.16), apathy (OR: 11.62 CI: 2.95-45.82) and dyspnea (OR: 50.61; CI: 12.37-207.18) were identified with greater likelihood of death from CHIK. It also stood out that altered blood glucose was associated with cases with a worse prognosis (OR: 13.5; CI: 1.3-135.0). Among the laboratory findings, only lymphocytes and albumin were not associated with greater likelihood of death.The factors related with deaths were chronic kidney disease and previous heart disease, presence of fever, abdominal pain, apathy, dyspnea and arthritis and laboratory findings such as leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia."
https://openalex.org/W4225744390,"The house mouse or Mus musculus has become a premier mammalian model for genetic research due to its genetic and physiological similarities to humans. It brought mechanistic insights into numerous human diseases and has been routinely used to assess drug efficiency and toxicity, as well as to predict patient responses. To facilitate molecular mechanism studies in mouse, we present the Mouse Interactome Database (MID, Version 1), which includes 155,887 putative functional associations between mouse protein-coding genes inferred from functional association evidence integrated from 9 public databases. These putative functional associations are expected to cover 19.32% of all mouse protein interactions, and 26.02% of these function associations may represent protein interactions. On top of MID, we developed a gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) web tool to annotate potential functional impacts from observed differentially expressed genes. Two case studies show that the MID/GSLA system provided precise and informative annotations that other widely used gene set annotation tools, such as PANTHER and DAVID, did not. Both MID and GSLA are accessible through the website http://mouse.biomedtzc.cn."

The aim of this study was to explore university students' perceptions regarding the relevance and utility of a planned dietary life skills course.Qualitative design including focus group discussions.A Norwegian university with participating undergraduate students from seven different disciplines.Data collection included 13 semi-structured focus group discussions involving 57 university students (35 women and 22 men aged 18-38 years). The focus group discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. To ensure in-depth knowledge of the research participants' thoughts and reflections, thematic analysis strategy was undertaken by a team of researchers.When presented to the idea of a dietary life skills course as a university course, the students were mostly positive regarding its relevance and utility, however both motivators and barriers for attending were put forward. Some mentioned potential academic course benefits, such as enhanced CV, and a few mentioned potential societal benefits such as a healthy population and sustainable food consumption. Several motivators for attending the course were launched, such as increased knowledge and cooking skills, having dinner and expanded network. The students wanted to learn about food, nutrients and health, and how to cook simple, affordable, healthy and sustainable meals. Potential barriers for attending were mostly related to practicalities, such as potential lack of alignment with ordinary study programme or too demanding lectures.Most students acknowledged the value of a dietary life skills course and thought that such a course could benefit their personal life. This encourages the offering of such courses at university level, tailored to consider both motivators and barriers for attending."
