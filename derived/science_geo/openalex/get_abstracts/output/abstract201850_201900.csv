This latter finding, for at least two of the enzymes studied, is in agreement with work from other laboratories (2, 3). The oxidative reactions of the cycle, except for the reaction catalyzed by succinic dehydrogenase, are linked to oxygen through the pyridine nucleotides. Thus it became imperative to study the aerobic oxidation systems for reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide in order to obtain some understanding of the respiratory capabilities of embryonic tissues. Among work done by others on this subject, we may mention that Philips (4) measured the over-all oxygen consumption of the early chick embryo at various stages of development. He found, with unhomogenized tissue, and by means of Cartesian diver techniques, that the oxygen uptake with glucose as substrate, did not increase markedly between the first and third day, although he reported a 100 per cent increase in the Qo, during the first 4 hours of incubation. In later work Philips (5) showed that under his conditions there was no variation in the oxygen uptake of different regions of chick blastoderms between zero and 37 hours of incubation. A detailed discussion of the determination of Qo, values in the chick embryo has been given by Romanoff (6). Sippel (7) measured the increase of succinoxidase activity in the heart and heart forming tissue of the chick embryo with Cartesian diver and Warburg techniques. He reported an increase in the specific activity, relative to nitrogen, with age from the second day onward. Albaum et al. (8) also measured cytochrome oxidase manometrically in water homogenates of chick embryos and found an increase in activity per embryo which exceeded the corresponding increase in succinoxidase. More recently Davidson (9) assayed for cytochrome oxidase spectrophotometrically in buffered homogenates of embryonic organs. He found an increase in the specific activity of the heart and the liver from the fourth day on while the activity in the nervous system remained constant throughout the period of study. Scevola and De Barbieri (3) subjected homogenates of 5- and lo-day-old embryos to differential centrifugation. They report that the distribution of succinic oxidase and cytochrome oxidase in these fractions is not unlike that which might be expected with adult tissue. * Supported by Grant-in-aid H-2177 from the National Heart Institute, National Institutes of Health, United States Public Health Service, and a program grant of the"

Roels1 in other endocrine glands, I have found that, in the adrenal medulla of the white rat, there is a correlation between the mean deoxyribonucleic acid content of the nuclei and cell activity. A preliminary communication on this topic2 reports an increase of the nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid content after stimulation by means of daily injections of insulin, and also an important decrease in the resting gland after bilateral splanchnectomy."

https://openalex.org/W2063224204,"DURING a study of the catechol compounds in human urine it was observed that acid hydrolysis (20 min., 1 N sulphuric acid, 100° C.) caused a large increase in the content of some catechol compounds, presumably by splitting of a conjugate1. Chromatographic separation of the different catechols obtained by adsorption on alumina of hydrolysed urine indicated that the large increase was connected with a catechol compound having a rate of flow similar to that of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid in a solvent system of n-butanol–hydrochloric acid–acetic acid2."

https://openalex.org/W2021390781,"THE glutamic–aspartic transaminase of pig heart muscle has been more than 98 per cent resolved into apoenzyme and co-factor by carrying out a differential heat inactivation in phosphate buffer in the course of purification of the enzyme. The apoenzyme has been purified 64-fold, by relatively simple and reproducible techniques. The highest purification factor previously reported1 for the apoenzyme is 26. The specific activity of the purified apoenzyme compares favourably with that of an electrophoretically homogeneous preparation of the holoenzyme2. Cammarata and Cohen's suggestion3 that purification of the apoenzyme necessarily results in partial inactivation has been disproved, since it is possible to account for all the enzyme activity among the various protein fractions obtained at each step in the purification."

In some countries the law is based on the water content of the whole loaf; in others the maximum permissible moisture content of the crumb only is laid down."
