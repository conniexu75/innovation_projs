https://openalex.org/W1963890550,"Mutations in HERG are associated with human chromosome 7-linked congenital long QT (LQT-2) syndrome. We used electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunohistochemical methods to study the molecular mechanisms of HERG channel dysfunction caused by LQT-2 mutations. Wild type HERG and LQT-2 mutations were studied by stable and transient expression in HEK 293 cells. We found that some mutations (Y611H and V822M) caused defects in biosynthetic processing of HERG channels with the protein retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Other mutations (I593R and G628S) were processed similarly to wild type HERG protein, but these mutations did not produce functional channels. In contrast, the T474I mutation expressed HERG current but with altered gating properties. These findings suggest that the loss of HERG channel function in LQT-2 mutations is caused by multiple mechanisms including abnormal channel processing, the generation of nonfunctional channels, and altered channel gating.

The congenital long QT syndrome is a disorder associated with delayed cardiac repolarization and prolonged electrocardiographic QT intervals and the development of ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) and sudden death (1Moss A.J.

HERG channel current has been shown to have properties similar to the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), and it plays an important role in cardiac action potential repolarization in the mammalian heart (4Sanguinetti M.C.

More than 30 HERG mutations have been identified in LQT-2 patients (2Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T.

The electrophysiological properties of a few LQT-2 mutations have been studied in Xenopus oocytes, where they have been shown to result in reduced or absent HERG current (19Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis for some congenital human diseases is known to involve multiple mechanisms including defective protein processing and abnormal protein function, the molecular basis for long QT syndrome has not been studied. In the present work, we used electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunohistochemical methods to study intracellular protein processing and functional properties of wild type and five LQT-2 mutant HERG channels. Our findings show that some mutant HERG proteins are not processed to the mature form of the channel. Other mutant HERG proteins undergo normal processing but do not form functional channels, or they gate abnormally. These findings provide new information about the molecular mechanisms for the failure of mutant LQT-2 channels to generate normal HERG current. The HERG LQT-2 mutations shown in Table I were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Site II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). Each mutation was verified by DNA sequencing using automatic DNA sequencer. Wild type and mutant cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and HEK 293 cells were transfected transiently or stably with these constructs using a lipofectamine method as described previously (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). After transient transfection, HEK 293 cells were studied at 48 h. When transiently transfected cells were used for patch clamp experiments, green fluorescent protein cDNA (1 μg) was co-transfected with HERG cDNA (5 μg) to serve as an indicator. In our experiments, >90% of green fluorescent protein-positive cells express HERG channels. For LQT-2 mutants, we established four stable cell lines (T474I, I593R, Y611H, and G628S). LQT-2 mutant stably transfected cell lines were selected by their G418 resistance and identified by the presence of HERG protein on Western blot. A mock-transfected (pcDNA3 vector) cell line was selected by its G418 resistance.Table ILQT-2 mutationsMutationHERG protein domainT474IS2–S3 intracellular loop or S2I593RS5 pore regionY611HS5 pore regionG628SPore regionV822MCyclic nucleotide binding domain Open table in a new tab The HERG protein antibody was generated using a fusion protein as antigen. The cDNA fragment of HERG encoding 181 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus was subcloned into the pET-32a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to make a histidine-tagged thioredoxin-HERG fusion construct. This construct was expressed inEscherichia coli AD494(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen). The histidine-tagged thioredoxin-HERG fusion protein was purified using the His-Bind Buffer Kit (Novagen). The purified fusion protein was injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antibody using a standard method (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The specificity of the polyclonal anti-HERG antibody was tested by Western blot, immunohistochemical, and immunoprecipitation assays. Western blot showed that the HERG antibody recognized HERG protein bands only in HERG-transfected HEK 293 cells and not in mock-transfected or untransfected HEK 293 cells, and this reaction was inhibited when the HERG antibody was preincubated with the fusion protein. In addition, preimmune rabbit serum did not recognize HERG protein on Western blot. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated positive fluorescence staining only in HERG-transfected HEK 293 cells and not in mock-transfected and untransfected cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments also showed the absence of detectable HERG protein bands in mock-transfected cells. Membrane currents were recorded in whole cell configuration using suction pipettes as described previously (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys.

Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). Cells were superfused with HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution containing (in mm) 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The internal pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). All experiments were performed at 22–23 °C. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Membrane protein preparation and Western blot procedures were previously described (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the HERG antiserum (1:20,000 dilution) at room temperature overnight, and the antibody was detected with an ECL detection kit (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). For proteinase K treatment of cells, wild type HERG- and LQT-2 mutant-transfected cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 2 ml of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) with or without 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. The proteinase K activity was stopped by adding 1.3 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mmEDTA. The cells were then harvested and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The membrane proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis. For experiments using endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment, 30 μg of cell membrane protein was dissolved in 30 μl of 50 mmsodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 0.12% SDS by boiling for 2 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm followed by the addition of 15 milliunits of Endo H. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and boiling for 2 min. Wild type or mutant HERG-transfected cells were starved for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine and containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated in the same medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (400 μci/ml). After 1 h of labeling, the medium was removed, and cells were washed and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine. At different time intervals, the cells were washed and lysed in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) with a protease inhibitor mixture (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the cell lysate was precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (Pierce). HERG antiserum (1:100 dilution) was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antigen-antibody complexes were isolated with protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed with the immunoprecipitation buffer. The bound antigen was eluted from the protein A-agarose beads by sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized with autoradiography. Wild type or mutant HERG-transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with a buffer containing 5% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.05% azide in PBS and then incubated with the HERG antiserum (1:3000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. Following washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson, West Grove, PA) and washed with PBS. For double immunofluorescence staining experiments, cells were also incubated with a monoclonal antibody to BiP (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson, West Grove, PA). Immunofluorescence staining was viewed with a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). As shown in Table I, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of HERG to generate five reported LQT-2 mutations, T474I, I593R, Y611H, G628S, and V822M (2Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W.

To study the functional expression of the HERG wild type and mutant channels, we performed patch clamp studies on transiently and stably transfected cells. Patch clamp recordings using transient transfection are shown in Fig. 1. Wild type HERG current showed voltage-dependent activation with inward rectification at more positive voltages as previously shown (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 10Mohammad S. Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2534-H2538PubMed Google Scholar). For mutants I593R, Y611H, G628S, and V822M, no HERG current was recorded; rather, only a small amplitude current endogenous to HEK 293 cells was present (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar,10Mohammad S. Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2534-H2538PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in stably transfected cells with the mutants I593R, Y611H, and G628S (data not shown). In contrast, the T474I mutation expressed functional channels but with altered gating properties. The T474I mutation activated at more negative voltages compared with wild type HERG channels. Similar results were obtained with stably transfected cells (data not shown). Fig. 1 Bshows the activation curves for wild type and T474I mutant currents. When fit as a Boltzmann function, the half-maximal activation voltages for wild type and the T474I mutation were −15.9 ± 1.1 mV (n = 17 cells) and −43.2 ± 1.2 mV (n = 16 cells), respectively (p < 0.05). The slope factors were 7.6 ± 0.3 and 6.8 ± 0.6, respectively (p > 0.05). Fig. 1 C shows theI-V plots of wild type and T474I mutant current density measured at the end of the depolarizing step. It shows that the maximal outward current in the T474I mutation was reached at −20 mV and that for wild type it was reached at 0 mV. The maximal outward current densities for wild type and T474I were 34.7 ± 4.0 and 26.6 ± 5.6 pA/pF, respectively (p > 0.05). Fig.1 C also shows marked inward rectification for both wild type and T474I currents at more positive voltages, and in the voltage range 0–60 mV the current amplitudes for the T474I mutation were decreased compared with wild type current amplitude (p < 0.05 at each voltage). Fig. 1, B and C, also shows that the threshold voltage for eliciting current was shifted negatively for the T474I mutation. We have shown previously that wild type HERG channel protein expressed in HEK 293 cells consists of two forms on Western blot, a 135-kDa (lower) band and a 155-kDa (upper) band, and that both species involveN-linked glycosylation (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We proposed that the upper band was the complexly glycosylated, mature form of the HERG channel and that the lower band was a core-glycosylated, precursor form of the HERG channel. In order to study the mechanisms accounting for dysfunctional mutant channels, we analyzed HERG channel proteins by Western blot as shown in Fig. 2. The HERG antibody did not recognize protein in mock-transfected cells, whereas it recognized HERG proteins in wild type-transfected and all five mutant-transfected cells. Wild type HERG, as well as the T474I, I593R, and G628S mutations, expressed two protein bands, a lower band at 135 kDa and an upper broad band at 155 kDa. These findings suggest that the T474I, I593R, and G628S mutations undergo protein processing similar to that of wild type HERG channels. In contrast, the Y611H and V822M mutations expressed only the lower protein band at 135 kDa without the upper protein band. The absence of the complexly glycosylated form of the channel in the Y611H and V822M mutants strongly suggests that a defect in protein processing causes failure of channel maturation. To study cell surface expression of wild type and LQT-2 mutant channels, intact cells stably transfected with wild type, Y611H, and G628S were exposed to proteinase K to digest the extracellular domains of HERG protein on the cell surface. Proteinase K is a serine protease that cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxylic group of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids (24Ebeling W. Hennrich N. Klockow M. Metz H. Orth H.D. Lang H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the cells remained intact after proteinase K treatment. Membrane proteins were then isolated and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3, the upper band of wild type HERG was sensitive to the proteinase K treatment with the complete disappearance of the band. This was associated with the appearance of lower molecular mass bands of 60–75 kDa that should represent degraded C terminus-containing fragments from the upper band. Thus, HERG channels are sensitive to digestion by extracellular proteases. In contrast, the 135-kDa band was resistant to proteinase K treatment. These results support the hypothesis that the upper band represents the mature form of the HERG channel located in the surface membrane and that the lower band is the precursor form located inside the cell. Similar to wild type HERG, the upper band of the G628S mutant was also sensitive to proteinase K treatment, indicating that the G628S mutant protein traffics normally into the surface membrane. The lack of HERG current is probably due to the functional defects in the channel protein. For Y611H, the single lower band was resistant to proteinase K treatment. Similar findings with proteinase K were obtained with the V822M mutation. This suggests that these mutant channels are not transported to the cell surface membrane. In Fig. 4, we used Endo H to study further the intracellular biochemical processing of HERG channel protein. Endo H digests high mannose oligosaccharides that are added during core glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leaving a single GlcNAc residue attached to the protein. Once proteins reach the medial Golgi, they undergo complex oligosaccharide modification to become Endo H-resistant (25Dunphy W.G. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1985; 42: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As shown in the Western blot analyses in Fig. 4, the upper band of wild type HERG was resistant to Endo H digestion. In contrast, the lower band of wild type HERG was sensitive to Endo H treatment and was reduced in molecular mass from 135 to about 132 kDa. This band is similar in molecular mass to the smaller protein band observed followingN-glycosidase F treatment of wild type HERG and may represent the deglycosylated HERG protein (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). These findings provide further evidence that the 155-kDa band is the complexly glycosylated, mature form of HERG channel and that the 135-kDa band is a core-glycosylated precursor form of the HERG channel. Fig. 4 also shows data for the Y611H mutation. The 135-kDa band is sensitive to Endo H treatment and showed a decreased molecular mass of about 132 kDa. This suggests that Y611H mutant HERG protein undergoes core glycosylation in the ER but then fails to be transported to the medial Golgi to undergo complex glycosylation. To study the biosynthesis of wild type HERG and transport-deficient LQT-2 mutant proteins, we performed pulse-chase experiments using metabolic labeling. As shown in Fig. 5, the wild type HERG protein was initially synthesized as a precursor form of 135 kDa, which was gradually converted to a larger form of 155 kDa. These findings provide direct evidence for the precursor and product relationship of the 135- and 155-kDa bands of HERG channel protein found in Western blot experiments. The pulse-chase data also show that the rate of conversion of the precursor form to the mature form is relatively slow when compared with other membrane channel proteins expressed in mammalian cells (26Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 27Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the Y611H, the mutant protein was initially synthesized as a 135-kDa form; however, it was not converted to a larger molecular mass form for chase times up to 24 h. Rather, the mutant protein underwent progressive degradation with the appearance of smaller molecular mass bands and with the nearly complete disappearance of the 135-kDa band by 24 h. These findings show that the Y611H mutation fails to generate the mature form of the channel protein and that the immature form of the channel protein is rapidly degraded. We studied the subcellular localization of HERG protein in wild type and the five LQT-2 mutants by immunostaining permeabilized transfected HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the mock-transfected HEK 293 cells showed no detectable immunofluorescence staining. In cells transfected with wild type HERG, the immunofluorescence staining pattern is visible throughout the cells and their processes, showing the widespread distribution of HERG protein. Similar immunofluorescence patterns were obtained with the T474I, I593R, and G628S mutations. In contrast, cells transfected with the Y611H and V822M mutations display an immunofluorescence staining pattern that is more restricted to a perinuclear region. This restricted intracellular distribution pattern is consistent with the results of the Western blot experiments and shows that the mutant proteins are retained intracellularly. To study whether transport-deficient HERG mutant protein is trapped in the ER, we performed double immunofluorescence staining of HERG proteins and the ER-resident chaperone protein BiP (28Haas I.G. Walb M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 29Huovila A.P.J. Eder A.M. Fuller S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Riezman H. Science. 1997; 278: 1728-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows results of cells transfected by the Y611H mutation (A–D) and by wild type HERG (E–H). For the Y611H mutant, the green HERG andred BiP immunoreactivities are restricted to the same perinuclear distribution. This is confirmed in the superimposed image, which shows a uniform yellow color, indicating that the mutant HERG and BiP are colocalized. In contrast, for the wild type-transfected cell, HERG protein is widely distributed, whereas BiP shows a more restricted intracellular localization. These findings suggest that some LQT-2 mutations result in intracellular protein processing defects with retention of mutant HERG channel protein in the ER. Our results provide new data about the biosynthesis patterns of a human, voltage-gated ion channel protein studied in a heterologous mammalian expression system. Wild type HERG channel protein is initially synthesized in the ER as the core-glycosylated precursor form with a molecular mass of 135 kDa. It is then modified in the Golgi apparatus, where it becomes the mature form of the channel with a molecular mass of about 155 kDa. As we noted previously, much of the increased protein size results from the addition of complex oligosaccharides by N-linked glycosylation, although other post-translational modification may occur (6Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The 155-kDa protein is then transported into the plasma membrane. The fact that only 155-kDa protein is sensitive to externally applied proteinase K suggests that 155-kDa proteins form functional HERG channels in the cell surface membrane. Therefore, the 155-kDa band observed on Western blot serves as a useful marker to assess HERG protein maturation. An important finding of the present study is that some LQT-2 disease-causing mutations result in protein processing defects that lead to failure of the channel protein to undergo normal transport to the cell surface. Rather, mutant channels are retained in the ER, where they are rapidly degraded. The Y611H and V822M mutations are examples of this defect. These mutations are most easily identified on Western blot analysis, where they generate only the single lower molecular mass precursor band. Several lines of evidence show that these mutant channels are located intracellularly. They are not sensitive to externally applied proteinase K. The Y611H mutation is not converted to the mature form, as shown in the pulse-chase experiments. The immunolocalization experiments confirm a restricted intracellular distribution for both mutations and suggest that the mutant channels are retained in the ER. The mechanism of the retention of the mutant HERG channel protein in the ER is not identified in these experiments. It is well recognized that export of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi is regulated by a “quality control” mechanism (31Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 32Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This mechanism ensures that only properly folded and assembled proteins leave the ER. Misfolded, unassembled, and incompletely assembled subunit proteins are retained in the ER and undergo degradation without reaching the Golgi complex (33Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 34Zhang J-X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E.S. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, the LQT-2 mutations Y611H and V822M may cause structural abnormalities with protein misfolding or improper assembly, and they are retained and degraded in the ER. Whether these channel mutations are capable of forming functional channels is unknown. Defective protein processing has been recognized as an important mechanism in some congenital human diseases. For cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channels, the most common mutation is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (ΔF508), which causes 70% of cystic fibrosis cases. This mutation leads to retention of the channel protein within the cell and failure of channel trafficking to the plasma membrane (26Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Protein processing defects have also been shown to be important in the low density lipoprotein receptor in familial hypercholesterolemia (35Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1985; 232: 34-47Crossref Scopus (4362) Google Scholar), in the Na+/glucose symporter in glucose-galactose malabsorption (36Martin M.G. Turk E. Lostao M.P. Kerner C. Wright E.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 12: 216-220Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and in several other congenital human diseases (37Thomas P.J. Qu B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Our results with LQT-2 mutations are the first to show this mechanism for a human, voltage-gated K+ channel. In addition to transport-deficient mutants, other mechanisms for HERG channel dysfunction in LQT-2 are shown by our findings. The I593R and G628S mutations generate channel proteins that are processed similarly to wild type HERG protein, yet these proteins fail to form functional ion channels. The experiments showing sensitivity of the G628S mutant protein to digestion by proteinase K confirm its cell surface location. The immunolocalization experiments also show immunofluorescence staining patterns throughout the cell and its processes. These mutations are close to the pore region of HERG, which may result in defective channel gating or ion permeation; hence, we conclude that these channels cannot open or conduct ions normally. In a brief report, Nie et al. (38Nie L. Choi M. Palmer B. Wang D.W. Benson D.W. Bennett P.B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A213Google Scholar) have suggested that the I593R mutation also is able to insert into the plasma membrane, since epitope-tagged mutant protein can be detected on the cell surface. It is also interesting in our experiments that the I593R mutation causes a weakly stained upper band on Western blot. This could suggest that intracellular protein transport may not be completely normal and that some LQT-2 mutations could have both protein processing and functional defects. The T474I mutation represents another mechanism of channel dysfunction. This mutation generates HERG current with altered gating properties. The channels activate at more negative voltages (activation V½ shifted negatively by 27.3 mV). Although maximum current amplitude was similar to that of wild type current, the peak of theI-V plot was shifted negatively by about 20 mV as shown in Fig. 1 C. At more positive voltages, inward rectification was present for both the wild type and T474I mutation, and there was a reduction in outward current for the mutation compared with wild type current. This decrease in current at more positive voltages may account for its QT-prolonging phenotype. This mutation has been proposed to be in the S2-S3 intracellular loop (3Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) or in the S2 intramembrane domain (39Shi W. Wymore R.S. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Cohen I.S. Mckinnon D. Dixon J.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9423-9432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the putative channel protein structure. Interestingly, another LQT-2 mutation in the S2 region (N470D) also results in functional channels that gate at more negative voltages (19Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the S2 region or adjacent S2-S3 loop contribute to the voltage dependence of HERG channel activation. A role of the S2 region in channel gating also has been reported in other voltage-gated K+ channels (40Planells-Cases R. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Patten C.D. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Seoh S.A. Sigg D. Papazian D.M. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1159-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). LQT-2 is an autosomal dominant inherited disease with both normal and mutant genes present in patients. The present results were obtained by expressing LQT-2 mutations and wild-type HERG protein as homomultimeric channels. Since HERG proteins are thought to form tetrameric channels, the co-expression of some LQT-2 mutations with wild type HERG is thought to result in dominant negative suppression of HERG current (19Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Spector P.S. Keating M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These investigators have shown in Xenopus oocytes that the G628S mutation caused marked dominant negative suppression of HERG current, suggesting co-assembly of the G628S mutant protein with wild type protein. In a preliminary report, Nie et al. (38Nie L. Choi M. Palmer B. Wang D.W. Benson D.W. Bennett P.B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A213Google Scholar) also have shown that the I593R mutant is able to co-assemble with the wild type protein. As shown in our experiments, these mutations are processed similarly to wild type HERG channels. Whether the transport-deficient mutants such as Y611H and V822M can co-assemble with wild type HERG protein to cause similar dominant negative suppression is not known and is presently under investigation. In summary, our data identify three types of defects for HERG mutants in LQT-2: 1) some mutations result in intracellular transport defects with channel proteins retained in the ER; 2) some mutations result in channel proteins that are processed similarly to wild type channels but do not have electrophysiological function; and 3) some mutations result in channel proteins that gate abnormally. These findings provide new information about the molecular mechanisms for HERG channel dysfunction in LQT-2 patients. The mutations with these different mechanisms may result in different severities of LQT clinical phenotypes. More detailed clinical studies are needed to permit correlation of the LQT-2 phenotypes with our molecular findings. We thank Drs. Gail A. Robertson, James D. Bangs, Shetuan Zhang, Jonathan C. Makielski, and Timothy J. Kamp for helpful advice and discussion."

In contrast to numerous well studied plasma membrane isoforms (NHE1–4), much less is known about intracellular Na+/H+ exchangers, and thus far no vertebrate isoform has been shown to have an exclusively endosomal distribution. In this context, we show that the yeast NHE homologue, Nhx1 (Nass, R., Cunningham, K. W., and Rao, R. (1997) J. Biol.

In living yeast, we show that these compartments closely abut the vacuolar membrane in a striking bipolar distribution, suggesting that vacuole biogenesis occurs at distinct sites. Nhx1 is the founding member of a newly emergent cluster of exchanger homologues, from yeasts, worms, and humans that may share a common intracellular localization. By compartmentalizing Na+, intracellular exchangers play an important role in halotolerance; furthermore, we hypothesize that salt and water movement into vesicles may regulate vesicle volume and pH and thus contribute to vacuole biogenesis.

Na+/H+ exchangers of eukaryotic cells comprise a family of membrane proteins catalyzing the electroneutral countertransport of Na+ and H+ (1Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 2Tse C.-M. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Nath S. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. Cell. Physiol.

At the plasma membrane of animal cells, the prevailing Na+gradient generated by the Na+/K+-ATPase is used to drive H+ equivalents from the cell. As such, these exchangers are involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell volume control, and transcellular Na+ movements in epithelial tissue. These functions are closely related to physiological and pathophysiological cellular events, including fertilization, cell cycle control, differentiation, essential hypertension, gastric and kidney disease, and epilepsies. Na+/H+ exchange activity has been detected in virtually every cell type that has been examined, and at least six distinct NHE isoforms have been identified thus far. Molecular cloning of the first Na+/H+exchanger (4Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) led to a predicted membrane topology based on the hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence: there are 12 membrane-spanning segments comprising a discrete N-terminal structural domain of approximately 500 residues, followed by a long cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of approximately 300 residues. This predicted structural subdivision mimics a partition of function: analysis of deletion mutants has shown that the membrane-embedded domain retains the ability to insert into the plasma membrane, is transport-competent, and is sensitive to inhibition by amiloride and its derivatives (5Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, it is the C-terminal domain that carries multiple protein kinase consensus sites, binds calmodulin, and mediates the response to a multitude of regulatory signals involved in control of cell proliferation, volume, and osmolarity changes. All Na+/H+ exchangers that have been characterized at a molecular level thus far localize predominantly, if not exclusively, to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, there has been biochemical documentation of Na+/H+ exchange activity in endosomal preparations from kidney, liver, zymogen granules of pancreatic acinar cells, and chromaffin granules of adrenal glands (6Gurich R.W. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F702-F709PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hilden S.A. Ghoshroy K.B. Madias N.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1311-F1319PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hensley C. Bradley M.

In each case, the exchange activity was reported to coexist with a distinct subset (∼20%) of vesicles containing the vacuolar H+-ATPase and to exhibit kinetic similarity with the plasma membrane exchangers with respect to reversibility, simple hyperbolic response to Na+, and allosteric activation by H+. However, amiloride did not inhibit the endocytic exchange activity, Li+ was a poor substrate but a good inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, and theKm for Na+ was somewhat lower than that seen for plasma membrane isoforms (4.7–10 mm versus 15–18 mm), suggesting that the endocytic exchanger is a distinct molecular isoform. In earlier work, we have shown that the NHX1 gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae mediates sequestration of Na+ within an intracellular compartment, suggestive of a novel intracellular localization (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here, we provide direct evidence that Nhx1 localizes exclusively to a unique late endosomal compartment, thus providing a starting point to explore the molecular, cellular, and physiological functioning of a completely novel member of this family of transporters. We have also observed the emergence of new exchanger homologues in other organisms, as a result of systematic sequencing efforts worldwide, that share greater homology with yeast Nhx1 than to the plasma membrane isoforms. We suggest that the sequence similarites among these newly discovered isoforms is indicative of a common intracellular, possibly endosomal localization. Strains K601 (wild type) and R100 (Δnhx1) used in this study are isogenic to W303 and have been described (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A 4.5-kilobase pair (kbp) 1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pairPCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPVCprevacuolar compartment. SalI insert containing the intact NHX1 gene was recovered from cosmid C9410 (American Type Culture Collection), and a 3-kbp SalI to SpeI fragment from the 5′ portion of the gene was cloned into pRS425 (13Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar), now called pRin72. The C terminus of Nhx1 was tagged with a triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope using two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products as primers for a third PCR. The following primers were used to amplify a 0.8-kbp product from cosmid C9410 that extended from +1.1 kbp downstream from the initiating ATG to the end of the NHX1 open reading frame, with the removal of the termination codon, and addition of a NotI site and a short sequence homologous to the 5′ end of the HA epitope: 5′-CTGAAGTAGAACTAGTCTATAAGCCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AACATCGTATGGGTAAAAGATGCGGCCGCCGTGGTTTTGGGAAGAGAAATCTGCAGG-3′ (antisense). The second PCR created a 1-kbp product beginning with a short sequence homologous to the 3′ end of the HA epitope, followed by the termination codon TAG, and extending through 1 kbp of 3′ noncoding sequence of the NHX1 gene to a new SacI site at the 3′ end. The following primers were used in conjunction with C9410 as template: 5′-GACGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCTGAGTGCTAGCCGCGGGTAGACTTTAAAGTGTATGGTTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCACGAGCTCGTCTTCATCCATGACGGAAG-3′ (antisense). The final PCR reaction used the PCR products, above, as primers with the plasmid pSM491 (gift of Susan Michaelis, Johns Hopkins University) containing the triple HA epitope as the template. The resulting 1.9-kbp product was digested with SpeI and SacI and cloned into pRin72 to give the full-length Nhx1::HA with the 1.9-kbp upstream sequence from the initiating codon ATG and the 1-kbp downstream sequence from the termination codon (pRin73). The Nhx1::GFP construct was created by digesting pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH) with BamHI andNotI to release the 0.7-kilobase GFP and ligating to the same sites in pRin72. To complete the NHX1 open reading frame, a 1.3-kbp BamHI fragment from pRin73 was inserted in the correct orientation into this plasmid, creating the full-length fusion. kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein prevacuolar compartment. Assays of protein, α-mannosidase activity, Kex2 activity, and azide-sensitive ATPase activity have been described in earlier publications (14Sorin A.G. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol.

Differential centrifugation of yeast lysates and nonequilibrium fractionation of yeast lysates by sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed as described (14Sorin A.G. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used as follows: mouse anti-HA antibody, 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 1:5000, mouse anti-Vph1, monoclonal antibody 10D7-A7-B2 (Molecular Probes) at 1:5000, mouse anti-Dpm1, monoclonal antibody 5C5-A7 (Molecular Probes) at 1:2500, mouse anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) at 1:500, rabbit anti-Pma1 (gift of Carolyn Slayman, Yale University) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-Pep12 (gift of Robert Piper, University of Iowa) at 1:1250, rabbit anti-Kex2 (gift of Robert Fuller, University of Michigan),at 1:1000. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse (Boehringer Mannheim) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at 1:1000. Cells (0.7–1.2A600 units/ml) were labeled with 53 μm FM 4-64 (N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-diethylamino)phenyl)-hexatrienzyl)pyridinium dibromide), 13 nm DiOC6(3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide), and 40 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (all from Molecular Probes) using a variable labeling period (10–60 min) followed by chase in fresh medium (30–60 min). Confocal microscopy was performed by the Noran Oz Confocal Microscope System; single label controls for each fluorophore were captured under identical double label conditions to eliminate any fluorescence bleed-through. Targeted disruption of the S. cerevisiae NHX1 (YDR456w) gene leads to loss of sodium tolerance in acidic (Fig. 1 a) but not neutral or alkaline medium (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), consistent with the expected properties of a H+ driven Na+ transporter. The NHX1gene was recovered from a 40-kilobase pair genomic insert in cosmid C9410 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the open reading frame was tagged at the C terminus with either a triple HA epitope or the GFP. Expression of the tagged constructs was directed from the endogenous NHX1 promoter in a Δnhx1 strain of yeast. Both tagged constructs appeared to be fully functional, effectively complementing the Na+-sensitive phenotype of the Δnhx1 mutant in the single copy (CEN) as well as multicopy (2μ) plasmid versions (Fig. 1 a). Like other members of the NHE family, yeast Nhx1 is predicted to be an integral membrane protein, with an N-terminal domain of 12 transmembrane helices, followed by a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Differential centrifugation of yeast lysates results in a substantial enrichment of Nhx1::HA (molecular mass, 73.5 kDa) in low speed membrane pellets (Fig. 1 b); in the absence of further fractionation, the Nhx1 polypeptide characteristically migrates as multiple bands on SDS gels, indicative of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation. Further evidence of the involvement of Nhx1 in halotolerance comes from salt induction of expression (Fig. 1 b). Our measurements of steady state intracellular 22Na levels indicated that enhanced sequestration of Na+ via Nhx1 correlated with salt-tolerant growth (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). By analogy with observations of vacuolar compartmentation of salt in halotolerant plants (17Serrano R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Barkla B.J. Apse M.P. Manolson M.F. Blumwald E. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1994; 48: 141-153PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Na+ transport by Nhx1 was likely to be coupled to the vacuolar H+ pump in an acidic compartment. Here, we show that HA-tagged Nhx1 cofractionates with markers for the vacuole, prevacuolar compartment, and the late Golgi compartment on sucrose density gradients (Fig.2 a), whereas it clearly fractionated away from markers representing the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and mitochondria, pointing to a hitherto novel cellular location for a Na+/H+ exchanger. To distinguish between prevacuolar, vacuolar, and Golgi distributions, subcellular fractions from sequential centrifugation of yeast lysates were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 b). Fractionation of Nhx1 closely followed that of the vacuolar marker, Vph1 (a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase), and that of Pep12 (a prevacuolar syntaxin) but was clearly different from the late Golgi protease, Kex2. To further define the cellular location of this novel exchanger, we used laser scanning confocal microscopy to examine the distribution of GFP-tagged Nhx1 in conjunction with the vacuolar stain FM 4-64 in exponentially growing, unfixed cells (Fig. 3). Fluorescence from Nhx1::GFP appears as 1–2 intensely fluorescent spots per cell, immediately abutting the vacuolar membrane, usually with a striking bipolar distribution. The number and size of the spots typically increase in salt-containing media, consistent with the observed induction of Nhx1 expression levels. The distinct perivacuolar location of the signal is highly reminiscent of the prevacuolar compartment (19Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 20Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Kohrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), at which the biosynthetic, autophagic, and endosomal pathways converge for sorting of cargo before final delivery to the vacuole. Indeed, we show that the syntaxin Pep12, which defines the identity of the prevacuolar compartment (21Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), colocalizes with Nhx1::GFP in fixed and permeabilized cells. Importantly, we were able to show by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies that the distribution of Nhx1::GFP was identical to that of Nhx1::HA on sucrose density gradients (data not shown). Together with the functionality of the tagged constructs (Fig.1 a) and the modest levels of expression achieved from the endogenous NHX1 promoter, the observations argue against a potential mislocalization because of the large GFP tag. The frequent distribution of Nhx1::GFP to opposing ends or poles of the vacuole is particularly intriguing and was clearly observed in three-dimensional reconstructions of the vacuole from sequential confocal planes (not shown). Such a bipolar pattern recalls the similar “patched” distribution of vacuolar assembly proteins, Vam3 and Vam6, on the vacuolar membranes (34Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and suggests that fusion of vacuolar precursors occurs at discrete sites. We note that this orientation is apparently lost upon fixation of cells. The inner membrane of mitochondria in mammals has been shown to possess two distinct forms of cation/H+ exchange activity: one selective for Na+ and the other transporting all alkali cations (22Garlid K.D. Shariat-Madar Z. Nath S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6518-6523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Garlid K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Functional studies in isolated yeast mitochondria indicate an absence of selective Na+/H+exchange, although a nonselective (K+/H+) antiporter was found (24Welihinda A.A. Trumbly R.J. Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A very recent report (25Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that Nhx1 localizes to mitochondria based on an overlap of signals from the DNA-binding dye 4′,6′-diaminidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and Nhx1::GFP expressed at high levels from the exogenous MET25 promoter. Evidence was also presented for low levels (1 nmol/min/mg) of Na+/H+exchange activity in three of five crude mitochondrial preparations, although contamination by other membranes was not assessed. Here we show that fluorescence from Nhx1::GFP is distinct from that of two well characterized mitochondrial dyes, DiOC6 and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Fig. 4). Mitochondria appear as typically elongated snake-like forms that have no particular orientation relative to the vacuole; in contrast, Nhx1::GFP flurorescence occurs as 1–2 spots/cell that are always observed to directly abut the vacuolar membrane. Taken together with the results from subcellular fractionation (Fig. 2 a), we conclusively rule out a mitochondrial localization for this exchanger. With the ongoing success of systematic genome sequencing, genes encoding putative Na+/H+exchangers have recently been identified in yeasts, worms, bacteria, and humans. They provide a unique opportunity to trace the phylogenetic ancestry and evolution of exchanger isoforms as well as provide clues to the function of newly identified homologues. In our survey of all NHE-like sequences residing in data bases, we were able to identify previously known clusters of sequences corresponding to the plasma membrane isoforms of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE1–4), as well as a previously unreported cluster of more distantly related prokaryotic sequences. We show here that Nhx1 defines a completely novel cluster of exchanger sequences derived from such evolutionary divergent organisms as yeast, nematodes, and humans (Fig.5 a). In addition, pairwise comparisons between NHE polypeptides using global alignment methods (26Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar) reveal significantly higher scores for members within this newly identified cluster: average identity, 34%; global score, 1000 (Box I, Fig. 5 b). Comparable scores were observed among members outside this cluster: average identity, 36%; global score, 1722 (Box II, Fig. 5 b). In contrast, scores for sequence pairs between the two groups were uniformly low: average identity, 23%; global score, 373 (Box III, Fig. 5 b). It should be noted that to avoid bias, we chose representative sequences from widely divergent phyla in both groups and that the overall length of the polypeptides varied in both groups: 540–666 (Box I) and 660–820 (Box II). All Na+/H+ exchanger sequences share the highest homology within predicted transmembrane segments of the N-terminal transporter domain. The conserved regions are presumably important for common transport functions, whereas the C-terminal domains are largely divergent, reflecting a diversity in modes of regulation of different isoforms. In Fig. 5 c, we show that there are consistent differences between members of the different clusters in sequence homology patterns within transmembrane segments known to be important for amiloride binding and ion transport. On the basis of these differences we suggest that members of the Nhx1-like cluster diverged early from plasma membrane isoforms. Finally, the length of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain is significantly shorter in members of the Nhx1-like cluster relative to the plasma membrane isoforms, resulting in shorter polypeptide lengths overall: 541–666 residues versus 717–832 residues. Thus, although separated from one another by a billion years or so of evolution, members of the newly identified Nhx1-like cluster are all recognizably related to each other. Taken together, these observations suggest a common intracellular, possibly endosomal location for these novel homologues. There is emerging evidence that plasma membrane-derived endosomes and Golgi-derived transport vesicles converge at a prevacuolar compartment (PVC) equivalent to late endosomes, where cargo is sorted prior to final delivery to the vacuole/lysosome. Proteinsen route to the vacuole may be visualized in the PVC transiently, as was observed for the α-factor receptor, Ste3, upon coordinated internalization from the plasma membrane (27Hicke L. Zanolari B. Pypaert M. Rohrer J. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), or by perturbation of vesicle traffic into or out of this compartment, as in the “Class E” family of vacuolar trafficking mutants (28Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The PVC itself is a discrete, rather than transient, structure that can be isolated on density gradients from normal yeast (29Darsow T. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and can be shown to have a perivacuolar distribution by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (20Rieder S.E. Banta L.M. Kohrer K. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 985-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Hicke L. Zanolari B. Pypaert M. Rohrer J. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the only resident protein of the PVC described in the literature is the syntaxin homologue, Pep12, which mediates docking of this compartment with the vacuole (21Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this context, the selective localization of Nhx1 to the prevacuolar compartment has considerable functional significance. An intriguing possibility is that regulation of vesicle volume and pH by endosomal Na+/H+ exchange may be important for vacuole biogenesis. Thus, the H+ gradient established by the vacuolar H+-ATPase would drive Na+ accumulation via Na+/H+ exchange, and Cl−influx via chloride channels (Fig. 5 d). As osmotically obliged water is dragged in, the vesicle swells and the hydrostatic pressure generated provides the energy for membrane destabilization and fusion. There is evidence that osmotic swelling precedes exocytosis and that, conversely, water loss from vesicles accompanies vesicle maturation and remodeling (30Satir B. Schooley C. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 153-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31Griffiths G. Back R. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 90: 40-54Google Scholar, 32Scharschmidt B.F. Lake J.R. Renner E.L.

FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We suggest that the yeast chloride channel ScCLC/GEF1 also has a prevacuolar localization based on the appearance of GFP-tagged ScCLC as 1–3 perivacuolar dots/cell (33Hechenberger M. Schwappach B. Fischer W.N. Frommer W.B. Jentsch T.J. Steinmeyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33632-33638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, colocalization of the Na+/H+exchanger, Cl− channel, and H+ pump, together with specialized coat proteins, syntaxins, and other docking factors may be involved in the assembly of the vacuole/lysosome from the prevacuolar compartment/endosomes. Our data do not exclude the possibility that Nhx1 also localizes to discrete patches on the vacuolar membrane. Recently, two components of a protein complex required for vacuole biogenesis, Vam3 (34Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Vam6 (35Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), were shown to have an unusual bipolar patched location on the vacuole, suggesting that specialized domains of the vacuole may be involved in vesicle fusion. By analogy, it is known that Golgi-derived secretory vesicles fuse at specialized regions of the plasma membrane, resulting in oriented bud growth (36TerBush D.R. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We note the enrichment of mammalian NheI at the leading edge and ruffles in fibroblast cells (37Grinstein S. Woodside M. Waddell T.K. Downey G.P. Orlowski J. Pouyssegur J. Wong D.C. P Foskett J.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5209-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and of the unrelated Na+/H+exchanger sod2 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe to the polarized cell tips (38Dibrov P. Smith J.J. Young P.G. Fliegel L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for Na+/H+ exchange at these specialized sites. Our data imply that regulation of vesicle pH and volume by endosomal Na+/H+ exchange may be important for vesicle maturation and fusion. Given the multifunctionality of Na+/H+exchangers, a variety of other cellular roles for endosomal exchangers may be envisaged: regulation of endosomal pH via Na+/H+ exchange can provide a functional link between the operational diversity among endocytic compartments and the known variability in their internal pH, intralumenal sequestration of Na+ may serve to detoxify the cytoplasm or to drive Ca2+ accumulation via Na+/Ca2+exchange, and in the case of the renal proximal tubule, exocytic insertion of endosomal Na+/H+ exchangers at the cell surface may effect rapid increases in H+ secretory capacity. We have already demonstrated that in yeast, Nhx1 makes an important contribution to halotolerance (12Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The molecular characterization and functional role of Nhx1-like homologues in other organisms remains to be determined.

Inaba and Okochi (1Inaba S. Okochi K. Igaku No Ayumi. 1978; 107: 690-691Google Scholar) reported that sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 1The abbreviations used are: SLEsystemic lupus erythematosusTBSTris-buffered salineLPSlipopolysaccharidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reaction. contained an antibody that reacted with normal sera. The antibody was shown to react against a novel thermolabile β2-macroglycoprotein, designated the “Hakata antigen” (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A similar thermolabile substance had been reported by Epstein and Tan (3Epstein W.V. Tan M. Arthritis Rheum. 1973; 16: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but it was not known whether the two proteins are the same. The molecular mass of the Hakata antigen in serum was 650 kDa as determined by gel filtration. The antigen was thermolabile because it lost antigenicity upon heating to 56 °C for 1 min. The Hakata antigen was separated as a single band of 35 kDa by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. However, under nonreducing conditions it separated as ladder bands from 35 kDa to nearly the top of the gel, suggesting that the Hakata antigen exists in serum as homopolymers consisting of the 35 kDa subunit (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All sera from 10,050 Japanese healthy blood donors, 99.99% of 751,352 Japanese patients' sera, and 99.98% of 41,430 Swedish patients' sera contained the Hakata antigen (4Inaba S. Okochi K. Yae Y. Fukuoka Acta Med. 1990; 81: 284-291PubMed Google Scholar), thus implying that the Hakata antigen is a normal serum protein. The reference range of the Hakata antigen was 7–23 μg/ml (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The antibody against the Hakata antigen was possessed by 4.3% of 349 SLE patients and 0.3% of 703 patients with other autoimmune diseases (4Inaba S. Okochi K. Yae Y. Fukuoka Acta Med. 1990; 81: 284-291PubMed Google Scholar). Among patients with other autoimmune diseases who possessed the antibody against the Hakata antigen, one patient was found among those with chronic glomerulonephritis and another in the group with primary biliary cirrhosis. systemic lupus erythematosus Tris-buffered saline lipopolysaccharide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we have cloned and characterized cDNA clones encoding the Hakata antigen revealing that the Hakata antigen is a novel serum protein that has Ca2+-independent lectin activity. The primary structure of the Hakata antigen is partially homologous to those of human ficolin-1 (5Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welch L. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and opsonin P35 (6Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizouchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), both of which contain collagen- and fibrinogen-like domains. The Hakata antigen was purified according to Yae et al. (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. In brief, Hakata antigen in serum was affinity-purified on a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column conjugated with a monoclonal antibody (4H5) produced against the Hakata antigen that had been purified from the propositus SLE patient serum (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fractions of the Hakata antigen were passed through a Hi trap Protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) and then applied to a Zn2+ column. Hakata antigen was eluted with 0–0.4 m glycine gradient in Buffer A. Hakata antigen-rich fractions were collected and dialyzed against Buffer A. The dialyzed Hakata fraction was applied to a lentil lectin-agarose column and eluted with Buffer A, containing 0.2 m methylmannoside. Purified Hakata antigen was dialyzed against Buffer A and its identity was confirmed by the reactivity with the autoantibody of the propositus SLE serum. Anti-Hakata human IgG was obtained from serum of the propositus patient with SLE by 35% ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography as described previously (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nonreduced, purified Hakata antigen (native form) and reduced, pyridylethylated Hakata antigen (denatured form) were used for preparation of antibodies. The antigen (200 μg) and complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories) were injected into BALB/c mice. After 5 weeks, the mice were boostered with 200 μg of the antigen, and 3 days later spleens were removed and used for fusion with P3U1 cells. Hybridoma cells producing antibodies were screened using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the Hakata antigen. Two of the positive monoclonal antibodies (2H2, 4H5) were collected from ascites fluid of mice bearing the hybridoma cells and purified with ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Protein G affinity column and a HPLC gel filtration column (Superdex 200, 10 × 300 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2H2 was an IgM isotype reacting with the denatured Hakata antigen, and 4H5 was an IgG1 isotype reacting preferentially with the native Hakata antigen. Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits by immunizing them with 1 mg of purified Hakata antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by four booster injections of the Hakata antigen at 2-week intervals. Antisera were collected 2 weeks after the last booster injection. Purified Hakata antigen was reduced and pyridylethylated according to the procedure described previously (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,7Kawano Y. Okubo K. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8232-8238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal end of the Hakata antigen was blocked, and thereafter, partial amino acid sequences of the Hakata antigen were determined after fragmentation of the antigen with CNBr or proteinases; pyridylethylated Hakata antigen was fragmented by CNBr, chymotrypsin, lysyl endopeptidase, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase as described previously (7Kawano Y. Okubo K. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8232-8238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragmented peptides were analyzed on a HPLC equipped with a reversed phase column (Cosmosil 5C18-AR-300, 4.6 × 250 mm; Chemco, Osaka, Japan), using a water/acetonitrile/propanol system containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (8Hamasaki N. Okubo K. Kuma H. Kang D. Yae Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purified peptides fragmented from pyridylethylated Hakata antigen were sequenced on a gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems division, model 492, Urayasu, Chiba, Japan), and the phenylthiohydantoins were identified by an Applied Biosystems 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer on-line system. To generate a cDNA probe by PCR (9Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar), several oligonucleotides were synthesized as primers for the cDNA cloning of the Hakata antigen, based on analysis of the amino acid sequences of the Hakata antigen. One pair, the sense primer (a 22-mer designed from the peptide sequence LGEVDHYQ in Fig. 1) and the antisense primer (a 21-mer designed from the peptide sequence GRYAVSE in Fig. 1), was successfully used. PCR was performed using a human lung λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and bands of the expected size were subcloned to TA cloning vector and sequenced. One of the PCR clones contained a unique sequence that encoded the partial amino acid sequence of the Hakata antigen. Using the PCR product as a probe (probe 1), a Hakata antigen cDNA clone lacking a portion of the 3′-end (clone 11–9) was isolated from the lung λgt11 cDNA library. By further screening using the cDNA clone as a probe (probe 2), two positive clones, B-1 and D-1, were obtained (Fig.2 A). These positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ (TOYOBO Co., Osaka, Japan) and sequenced by dideoxy method with a Thermo Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). By overlapping the sequences of these clones, a stretch of Hakata antigen cDNA was constructed. The 3′-end was determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) using a RACE PCR kit (CLONTECH).Figure 2cDNA cloning of the Hakata antigen.

PLC (human liver cell line) cells were used for transient expression according to Östman et al. (10Östman A. Rall L. Hammacher A. Wormstead M.A. Coit D. Valenzuela P. Betsholtz C. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16202-16208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded into a 15-mm culture plate at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well, and 1 μg of plasmid was transfected by the lipofection method of TfxTM-50 (Promega Corp.) on the following day. After overnight incubation, cells were washed three times with a phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, in 0.14 m NaCl) and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented without fetal calf serum for 3 more days with medium being changed everyday. The medium was then used for immunoprecipitation with the autoantibody of the propositus SLE serum. The medium was incubated with the autoantibody of the propositus SLE serum for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were bound to Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 150 mmNaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Trasylol. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) in the presence or absence of 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). After electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and probed with the rabbit polyclonal anti-Hakata antigen antibodies. After washing with TBS, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase–labeled anti-rabbit IgG and detected with an ECL chemiluminescent kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Fresh erythrocytes from human and sheep were washed and resuspended in TBS to yield a hematocrit of 10%. The erythrocyte suspensions were treated with trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed extensively with TBS. Hemagglutinating activity was determined in microtiter 96-well plates (U-shaped). Each well contained 25 μl of the cell suspension and 25 μl of serial dilutions of the Hakata antigen (highest concentration of Hakata antigen, 250 μg/ml) in TBS with or without 20 mmCaCl2 at a hematocrit of 1.0%. The inhibitory activity of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and mono/oligosaccharides was tested by adding the corresponding LPS and mono/oligosaccharide with serial dilutions from 0.5 m in a similar system of a 50 μl final volume, with 20 μg/ml Hakata antigen. LPS-sensitized erythrocytes were prepared by incubating the cells with 100 μg/ml LPS at 37 °C for 1 h. Hemagglutination was estimated visually after incubation at room temperature for 1 h. After 30 μg/ml purified Hakata antigen was applied to 1 ml of mono/oligosaccharide-conjugated Sepharose columns (EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) equilibrated with Buffer A, the columns were washed with 5 volumes of Buffer A. The bound Hakata antigen was eluted from the washed column by 0.1 mmono/oligosaccharide, 0.5 m mono/oligosaccharide, and 0.1m glycine (pH 3.5), and then each fraction was applied to Western blotting of the Hakata antigen. Hakata antigen was diluted to 20 μg/ml in TBS containing 50% glycerol. Rotary shadowed specimens were prepared by quickly spraying the diluted antigen onto freshly cleaved mica discs and shadowing with a carbon platinum at an angle of 3°. All of the specimens were examined with a Jeol 2000 EX electron microscope operated at 100 kV. The amino-terminal end of the Hakata antigen was blocked, and thereafter, partial amino acid sequences of pyridylethylated Hakata antigen were determined after fragmentation of the antigen with CNBr or proteinases. Fig. 1 shows the summary of amino acid sequences determined from the major fragmented peptides. The yield of individual peptides was 2–16% of the pyridylethylated Hakata antigen. Although it has been previously reported that the Hakata antigen contained five residues of hydroxyproline per molecule (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), peptide 1 in Fig. 1 contained six residues of hydroxyproline and also 11 GXY repeats in which X and Y residues were frequently proline and hydroxyproline residues, suggesting the collagen-like characteristics of the Hakata antigen. Based on the amino acid sequence of peptide 2 in Fig. 1, a pair of sense and antisense primers was designed, and PCR was performed to generate probe 1 (Fig. 2 A) using a human lung cDNA library, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Primary screening using probe 1 yielded a positive clone, 11–9, with the insert size of 1.3 kilobases that contained sequences of peptides 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as shown in Fig. 1. Because the clone 11–9 did not encode peptide 3 further attempts to obtain full-length clones were made using probe 2 (Fig. 2 A) generated by a pair of primers corresponding to sequences of peptides 2 and 6, as shown in Fig. 1. Two additional positive clones, B-1 and D-1, were obtained that encoded the sequences of peptides 2, 3, 4, and 6 (Fig. 2 A). The 3′-ends of these clones differed in that one lacked a poly(A) signal. The 3′-end was determined by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using liver and lung total RNA as templates. The 3′-untranslated sequence contained a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, followed by a poly(A) tail (Fig. 2 B). In the 5′ part of the open reading frame, the initiation codon was determined considering protein sequences (Fig. 1) as well as Kozak's theory (11Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hakata antigen cDNA sequence, made by combining the clones in Fig. 2 A, yielded a 1592-base pair sequence with an ATG codon starting at position 544. The open reading frame was the position from 544 to 1440 encoding 299 amino acids (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 Bshows the complete nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the Hakata antigen. Underlined amino acid sequences consisted of the sequences of peptides from purified Hakata antigen (listed in Fig. 1). The peptides could be aligned in order of peptide 1, 5, 4, 6, 2, and 3 (Fig. 2 A). The Hakata antigen is a plasma protein (1Inaba S. Okochi K. Igaku No Ayumi. 1978; 107: 690-691Google Scholar, 2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and should have a hydrophobic signal sequence, according to the rules of von Heijne (12von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic stretch from Met-1 to Gln-24 may be the signal sequence (Fig. 2). Cleavage at the Gln-24/Glu-25 bond with a typical motif for the recognition of signal peptidase (13von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) could yield a mature protein with 275 amino acids. However, the secreted Hakata antigen was blocked at the NH2-terminal end, and thus the NH2-terminal residue could not be confirmed by peptide sequencing. One potentialN-glycosylation site was found at Asn-189 (Fig. 2). A collagen-like domain, recognized beginning at Gly-48, contained 11 GXY repeats and six residues of hydroxyproline at positions 50, 53, 59, 65, 68, and 77 in the deduced sequence (Figs. 1 and 2). Following a short neck region (amino acids 81–118), a fibrinogen-like domain existed in the COOH terminus, which was homologous with human fibrinogen β and γ by 33 and 29%, respectively (Figs. 2 and3). No calcium binding motif or C-type lectin motif was found in the Hakata antigen sequence. The alignment of the amino acid sequences of the Hakata antigen, human ficolin-1, opsonin P35, fibrinogen β, and fibrinogen γ is shown in Fig. 3. Homologies between the Hakata antigen and either human ficolin-1 or opsonin P35 were both 48% overall, higher in the collagen-like domain (48%, 54%) and in the fibrinogen-like domain (52%, 53%), respectively (Fig. 3). To characterize the product of the Hakata antigen cDNA, the cDNA was subcloned into the pCIneo expression plasmid and expressed transiently in PLC cells. The Hakata antigen was secreted from the transfected cells to media. The Hakata antigen was immunoprecipitated from media with the autoantibody of the propositus SLE serum and analyzed by Western blot analysis (Fig.4). Under nonreducing conditions the transfected Hakata antigen formed ladder bands, whereas the ladder bands migrated to a single band of 35-kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 4) as observed on the Hakata antigen purified from human serum (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This indicated that the transfected Hakata antigen formed homopolymers of the 35 kDa subunits with disulfide bonds and that it was secreted into media as observed in serum. The Hakata antigen agglutinated nontreated and trypsin-pretreated sheep erythrocytes at antigen concentrations of 125 and 15 μg/ml, respectively. However, the antigen did not agglutinate human erythrocytes at the antigen concentration of 250 μg/ml, no matter what cells were pretreated with trypsin (Fig. 5 A). The agglutination activity was lost when the antigen was dissociated to monomer by reducing reagents (data not shown). The activity was resistant to heating at 56 °C for 10 min but not at 100 °C for 5 min. The agglutination activity was Ca2+-independent (data not shown). The LPS binding activity of the Hakata antigen was determined by measuring its potential to agglutinate human erythrocytes coated with LPS purified from Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella minnesota, and Escherichia coli (strain O111). Hakata antigen strongly agglutinated the sensitized human erythrocytes with LPS from S. typhimurium at a concentration of 8 μg/ml but weakly agglutinated the sensitized erythrocytes with LPS from S. minnesota and E. coli (O111) at the concentration of 125 μg/ml (Fig. 5 B). Free LPS from S. typhimurium and S. minnesota inhibited the agglutination of erythrocytes coated with LPS from S. typhimurium at 8 and 125 μg/ml, respectively (Fig.5 C). Free LPS from a Ra mutant of S. typhimuriumdid not inhibit the agglutination of erythrocytes coated with LPS fromS. typhimurium at as high a concentration as 500 μg/ml (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the Hakata antigen binds to the oligosaccharide chain. Mono/oligosaccharides of GalNAc, GlcNAc, and d-fucose inhibited the agglutination at 38, 9, and 2 mm, respectively (TableI). The Hakata antigen bound to GalNAc- and GlcNAc-agarose columns was eluted with 0.5 m GalNAc and 0.5 m GlcNAc, respectively, whereas neither mannose-agarose nor lactose-agarose sustained binding to the Hakata antigen (Fig.6).Table IThe inhibitory effects of mono/oligosaccharides on Hakata antigen-induced hemagglutination of LPS-sensitized erythrocytesMono/Oligosaccharidemmd-Galactose>300GalNac38d-Glucose>300GlcNac9d-Fucose2l-Fucose>300Mannose>300Lactose>300Maltose>300The minimum concentration of each mono/oligosaccharide for inhibiting hemagglutination of Hakata antigen-preincubated O-type human erythrocytes presensitized with LPS derived from S. typhimurium is shown.

We examined binding activity of the Hakata antigen to elastin, fibronectin, and zymosan, which had been reported to bind collectins and ficolins (14Harumiya S. Omori A. Sugiura T. Fukumoto Y.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 2287-2294PubMed Google Scholar). The Hakata antigen did not bind to any of these proteins (data not shown). Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed Hakata antigen is shown in Fig.7. The rough image of the Hakata antigen resembled the electron micrographs of ficolin, having globular domains on the ends of thin rods (17Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the electron micrographs, we could visualize two configurations of octadecamer, Form 1 and Form 2, as indicated in Fig. 8. Interpretive drawings of the images are given in Fig. 8.Figure 8Schematic model of monomer, trimer, and two forms of octadecamers of the Hakata antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Hakata antigen is a novel, thermolabile β2-macroglycoprotein that reacts with sera from patients suffering from SLE (1Inaba S. Okochi K. Igaku No Ayumi. 1978; 107: 690-691Google Scholar, 2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Hakata antigen is a normal serum protein with concentrations of 7–23 μg/ml. Transient Hakata antigen deficiency was found in 15 patients suffering from autoimmune diseases including SLE (4Inaba S. Okochi K. Yae Y. Fukuoka Acta Med. 1990; 81: 284-291PubMed Google Scholar). The serum concentration of the Hakata antigen correlated with those of albumin and cholinesterase among chronic liver diseases, and the serum concentration decreased with increasing severity of cirrhosis, suggesting that hepatocytes produce the Hakata antigen (18Fukutomi T. Ando B. Sakamoto S. Sakai H. Nawata H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 255: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Hakata antigen was cloned and characterized. The amino acid sequences determined from purified Hakata antigen were completely adjusted to the deduced amino acid sequence from cloned cDNA (Figs.1 and 2). The cDNA included 1592 nucleotides with a possible open reading frame of 897 nucleotides (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the Hakata antigen in human serum was determined to be 35 kDa on SDS-PAGE analysis under reduced conditions, but under nonreducing conditions it was determined to be 650 and 520 kDa by Sepharose 4B gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation, respectively (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that Hakata antigen in serum is a homopolymer of the 35 kDa-subunit. The transfected product of a cloned cDNA in PLC cells reacted with the human anti-Hakata antibody obtained from serum of the propositus patient with SLE (Fig. 3) and formed ladder bands from the gel top to the position of 35 kDa molecular mass under nonreducing conditions, whereas the ladder bands migrated to a single band of 35 kDa under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). This indicates that the cloned cDNA codes the Hakata antigen a novel thermolabile β2-macroglycoprotein. Collectins are a group of oligomeric Ca2+-dependent (C-type) animal lectins consisting of three domains: an NH2-terminal domain containing cysteine residues, a collagen-like domain containing Gly-X-Y triplet repeats, and a COOH-terminal domain containing a carbohydrate recognition domain (19Malhotra R. Haurum J. Thiel S. Sim R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Sastry K. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin.

Mannose-binding protein, conglutinin, and pulmonary surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D) are included in the collectin group. Collectins bound to carbohydrates with the COOH-terminal domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner (23Thiel S. Immunopharmacology. 1992; 24: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Turner M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human opsonin P35 is also an oligomeric serum lectin containing a collagenous domain similar to collectins. However, the COOH-terminal region of opsonin P35 contains a fibrinogen-like domain instead of a carbohydrate recognition domain, although opsonin P35 has Ca2+-dependent and GlcNAc-binding lectin activity (6Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizouchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The overall sequence of opsonin P35 is highly homologous to porcine ficolin and human ficolin-1, which binds to transforming growth factor-β1 and elastin (5Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hakata antigen was homologous to human ficolin-1 and opsonin P35 and also contained three structural domains consisting of an NH2-terminal domain, a collagen-like domain, and a fibrinogen-like domain (Fig. 2), although the homology was not so high as that between human ficolin-1 and opsonin P35 (Fig. 3). The Hakata antigen shows 48% homology to human ficolin-1 and opsonin P35, suggesting that the antigen should have lectin activity. Actually, the antigen had lectin activity binding to GalNAc, GlcNAc,d-fucose, and LPSs from S. typhimurium andS. minnesota. The oligosaccharide chain ofS. typhimurium, which is completely lacking in the Ra mutant, is composed of a trisaccharide repeating unit containing one residue each of d-mannose, d-galactose, andl-rhamnose, and a monosaccharide side chain, which is a residue of a 3,6-dideoxy-d-xylohexose (abequose). 3,6-Dideoxy-d-xylohexose, whose structure is similar tod-fucose, would be important for binding of the Hakata antigen to the oligosaccharide chain of S. typhimurium. Unlike opsonin P35 (6Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizouchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the lectin activity of the Hakata antigen was Ca2+-independent, similar to ficolin (17Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Lectin activity of the Hakata antigen was retained by 56 °C up to 10 min, although antigenicity of that is lost by heating for 56 °C for 1 min. The results indicate that Hakata antigen, human ficolin-1, and opsonin P35 shared common features of domain structure, polymerization tendency, images of electron micrographs, and lectin activities, and the primary structures indicate that the Hakata antigen forms a family with human ficolin-1 and opsonin P35. Based on electronmicroscopy findings and on the analogy of the ficolin molecule (17Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we propose that the Hakata antigen is an octadecamer consisting of an elementary trimer unit (Fig. 8). The elementary trimer unit has three fibrinogen-like globular domains connected to a collagen-like domain that terminate in a small, “triglobular” clustered NH2-terminal domain. Given that each monomer has an approximate molecular mass of 35 kDa, the trimer represents a molecular mass of 105 kDa. Because the Hakata antigen has a molecular mass of roughly 650 kDa in serum, we could visualize two sets composed of three units of each trimer coalescing to form an octadecameric structure (18 monomers) with two clusters of the amino-terminal ends remaining free (Form 1 in Fig. 8). Alternatively, we could also visualize the amino-terminal clusters of the octadecamer coalescing as depicted in Form 2 (Fig. 8). The dimensions of the octadecamer Form 1 are 40 nm in height with a width of 54 nm. Form 2, although having the same dimensions for height as in Form 1, has a reduced width of 33 nm because of the coalescing of the two amino-terminal clusters. Evidence that the interaction of the octadecamer with a molecular mass of 650 kDa was because of the sulfhydryl groups comes from the appearance of a single band corresponding to 35 kDa in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3) (2Yae Y. Inaba S. Sato H. Okochi K. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A histochemical study and the lower serum level in cirrhotic patients (18Fukutomi T. Ando B. Sakamoto S. Sakai H. Nawata H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 255: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) indicated that the major production site in vivo was the liver. Although the fraction of SLE patients was small (4.3%), the Hakata antigen disappeared from the patients' sera, and the antibody against the Hakata antigen was produced (4Inaba S. Okochi K. Yae Y. Fukuoka Acta Med. 1990; 81: 284-291PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dysfunctional mannose-binding protein allele was a risk factor for developing SLE (27Davies E.J. Teh L.S. Ordi-Ros J.

The physiological and pathological significance of ficolin/opsonin P35 and collectins remains to be determined. We thank Dovie R. Wylie for critical review of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2019490673,"The NHE3 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger localizes to both the plasmalemmal and endosomal compartments in polarized epithelial and transfected Chinese hamster ovary (AP-1) cells. It is unclear how the distribution of NHE3 between these compartments is regulated. In this study, we examined the potential involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-K) in regulating the activity and distribution of NHE3, as this lipid kinase has been implicated in modulating vesicular traffic in the endosomal recycling pathway. Wortmannin and LY294002, both potent inhibitors of PI3-K, markedly inhibited NHE3-mediated H+ extrusion across the plasma membrane in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The subcellular distribution of the antiporters was monitored by transfecting epitope-tagged NHE3 into AP-1 cells. In parallel with the inhibition of transport, PI3-K antagonists induced a pronounced loss of NHE3 from the cell surface and its accumulation in an intracellular compartment, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Further analysis using cells transfected with antiporters bearing an external epitope tag revealed that the redistribution reflected primarily a decrease in the rate of recycling of intracellular NHE3 to the cell surface. The wortmannin-induced inhibition and redistribution of NHE3 were prevented when cells were incubated at 4 °C, consistent with the known temperature dependence of the endocytic process. These observations demonstrate that NHE3 activity is controlled by dynamic endocytic and recycling events that are modulated by PI3-K.

Cellular processes such as pH homeostasis, volume regulation, and transepithelial ion and water transport are mediated, in part, by the active extrusion of cytosolic H+ in exchange for extracellular Na+ (1Boron W.F.

Shul G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NHE1 and NHE6 are present in nearly all cells, whereas the other isoforms have a more restricted tissue distribution and fulfill more specialized functions. Among the latter, the best characterized is NHE3, which is confined to certain epithelial cells of the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and gallbladder, where it participates actively in transepithelial Na+ and HCO3− absorption. The subcellular distribution of the isoforms also differs. NHE1, the “housekeeping” isoform, is present in the plasmalemma of most cells and accumulates in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. The other ubiquitous isoform, NHE6, is found in mitochondria (10Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The epithelial isoform NHE3 is detectable in the apical (“brush border”) membrane, and also in subapical vesicles, possibly endosomes (11Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this distribution is recapitulated when NHE3 is heterologously expressed in non-polarized cells, such as the antiport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line AP-1 (12Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, NHE3 is present and active on the plasma membrane, but is also abundant in a juxtanuclear vesicular compartment. Co-localization with transferrin receptors and with cellubrevin, and dispersal by colchicine indicated that this compartment overlaps with, or is identical to, the recycling endosomes (13D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.-P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that, as in the case of other transporters, Na+/H+ exchange may be regulated in epithelia by recruitment of NHE3 to and from the apical membrane. Indeed, earlier fractionation experiments revealed that the density of the subcellular compartment expressing NHE3 shifted following treatment of renal cells with parathyroid hormone, or after induction of hypertension (14Hensley C.B. Bradley M.E. Mircheff A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C637-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Mircheff A.K. Hensley C.B. Magyar C.E. Warnock D.G. Chambrey R. Yip K.P. Marsh D.J. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. McDonough A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1004-F1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the migration of NHE3 molecules from one intracellular compartment to another in response to physiological stimuli.Despite these suggestive observations, the mobilization of NHE3 has not been documented directly. Moreover, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the putative translocation process. Some insight may be derived from recent findings made in Caco-2 cells expressing NHE3. These colon carcinoma cells responded to epidermal growth factor with an increase in the rate of Na+/H+exchange, which was eliminated by wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-K). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 3′-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, yielding polyphosphoinositides that seem to play active roles in signal transduction, including the recruitment and activation of several kinases and adaptors to the plasma membrane (see Ref. 16Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar for review). Importantly, multiple lines of evidence have implicated PI3-K(s) in vesicular trafficking. The p110 catalytic subunit of the mammalian PI3-K is 55% homologous to theSaccharomyces cerevisiae protein VPS-34 (17Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G.

Disruption of the VPS-34 gene abolishes PI3-K activity in yeast and causes missorting of vacuolar hydrolases to the secretory pathway (18Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H.

In mammalian systems, PI3-K inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 interfere with membrane traffic in a variety of cell types. They obliterate histamine secretion in RBL-2H3 cells, exocytosis in neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic agents, and translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters in insulin-stimulated adipocytes (19Clarke J.F.

Finally, mutagenesis of the two PI3-K binding sites of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor disrupts the post-endocytic sorting of this receptor (26Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).In view of these precedents, we considered the possibility that traffic of NHE3 between the plasmalemmal and endosomal compartments could be similarly controlled by the activity of PI3-K. We therefore examined the effect of wortmannin and LY294002 on the activity and subcellular distribution of NHE3. In epithelial cells, NHE3 generally co-exists with other isoforms of the exchanger. To circumvent the complicating contribution of other exchangers to H+ flux determinations, NHE3 was heterologously expressed in AP-1 cells, which are antiport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells isolated by the H+-suicide method of Pouyssegur et al. (27Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These cells are also advantageous for microscopic localization studies, as they are flatter than epithelial cells and markers for their intracellular compartments are well defined. Finally, identification of NHE3 was facilitated by attaching an epitope tag derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). For some of the experiments, a triple HA tag was engineered in a putative extracellular loop of NHE3, enabling us to quantify the number of exchangers exposed to the extracellular surface and to compare their abundance with the functional activity recorded. Cellular processes such as pH homeostasis, volume regulation, and transepithelial ion and water transport are mediated, in part, by the active extrusion of cytosolic H+ in exchange for extracellular Na+ (1Boron W.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 8: 377-388Crossref Google Scholar, 2Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 3Knickelbein R.G.

This process is electroneutral and mediated by a family of integral membrane Na+/H+ antiporters or exchangers (NHE). 1The abbreviations used are: NHENa+/H+ exchangerBCECF2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinCHOChinese hamster ovaryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHAhemagglutininαMEMα-minimal essential mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salinepHiintracellular (cytosolic) pHPI3-Kphosphatidylinositol 3'-kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: NHENa+/H+ exchangerBCECF2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinCHOChinese hamster ovaryELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHAhemagglutininαMEMα-minimal essential mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salinepHiintracellular (cytosolic) pHPI3-Kphosphatidylinositol 3'-kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Shul G. Genomics. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NHE1 and NHE6 are present in nearly all cells, whereas the other isoforms have a more restricted tissue distribution and fulfill more specialized functions. Among the latter, the best characterized is NHE3, which is confined to certain epithelial cells of the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and gallbladder, where it participates actively in transepithelial Na+ and HCO3− absorption. The subcellular distribution of the isoforms also differs. NHE1, the “housekeeping” isoform, is present in the plasmalemma of most cells and accumulates in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. The other ubiquitous isoform, NHE6, is found in mitochondria (10Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The epithelial isoform NHE3 is detectable in the apical (“brush border”) membrane, and also in subapical vesicles, possibly endosomes (11Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this distribution is recapitulated when NHE3 is heterologously expressed in non-polarized cells, such as the antiport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line AP-1 (12Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, NHE3 is present and active on the plasma membrane, but is also abundant in a juxtanuclear vesicular compartment. Co-localization with transferrin receptors and with cellubrevin, and dispersal by colchicine indicated that this compartment overlaps with, or is identical to, the recycling endosomes (13D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.-P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that, as in the case of other transporters, Na+/H+ exchange may be regulated in epithelia by recruitment of NHE3 to and from the apical membrane. Indeed, earlier fractionation experiments revealed that the density of the subcellular compartment expressing NHE3 shifted following treatment of renal cells with parathyroid hormone, or after induction of hypertension (14Hensley C.B. Bradley M.E. Mircheff A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C637-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Mircheff A.K. Hensley C.B. Magyar C.E. Warnock D.G. Chambrey R. Yip K.P. Marsh D.J. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. McDonough A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1004-F1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the migration of NHE3 molecules from one intracellular compartment to another in response to physiological stimuli.

Despite these suggestive observations, the mobilization of NHE3 has not been documented directly. Moreover, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the putative translocation process. Some insight may be derived from recent findings made in Caco-2 cells expressing NHE3. These colon carcinoma cells responded to epidermal growth factor with an increase in the rate of Na+/H+exchange, which was eliminated by wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-K). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 3′-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, yielding polyphosphoinositides that seem to play active roles in signal transduction, including the recruitment and activation of several kinases and adaptors to the plasma membrane (see Ref. 16Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar for review). Importantly, multiple lines of evidence have implicated PI3-K(s) in vesicular trafficking. The p110 catalytic subunit of the mammalian PI3-K is 55% homologous to theSaccharomyces cerevisiae protein VPS-34 (17Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G.

Candida albicans is the leading cause of superficial and systemic fungal infections of humans. Virulence of C. albicans is a composite of several characteristics, including adaptation to body temperature, adhesion, and penetration of epithelial cells as well as its ability to undergo morphogenetic changes, especially between a yeast and a filamentous growth form (1Cutler J.E.

Conceivably, defects in protein glycosylation may have profound effects on the physical stability and function of the fungal cellular surface and may also affect the secretion efficiency and the activity of secreted soluble proteins. Present evidence suggests that O-glycosylation proceeds differently in fungal and in higher eukaryotic cells.

In C. albicans, the majority ofO-glycosyl chains consist of two or three mannoses, but they can extend up to about seven mannoses in α-glycosidic linkages (6Hayette M.P. Strecker G. Faille C. Dive D.

Recently, a genomic sequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been reported, which encodes a Pmt homologue (GenBankTM accession numberZ99126). In Drosophila melanogaster, a gene encoding a protein with high homology to the yeast Pmt1 proteins has been described (20Martı́n-Blanco E. Garcı́a-Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6048-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several “expressed sequence tags” deposited at GenBankTM are derived from genes encoding putative Pmt proteins of human, mouse, rat, Caenorhabditis elegans, and rice cells. In this report, we describe the C. albicans homologue of theS. cerevisiae PMT1 gene and characterize its function. PMT1 deletion in C. albicans leads to a lack ofin vitro Pmt activity and affects two secreted proteins, Als1p and chitinase. In addition, more drastic in vivophenotypes compared with S. cerevisiae are observed, including a complete block of morphogenesis in some inducing conditions, an increased sensitivity to some antifungal compounds, and a decreased adherence to host cells. Furthermore, PMT1function is shown to be essential for the virulence of C. albicans in a mouse model of infection. PMT alleles ofC. albicans and S. cerevisiae are designatedCaPMT and ScPMT respectively, whenever necessary for their distinction. Strains and plasmids are listed in TableI. C. albicans strain CAI4 (21Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for transformations and gene disruptions. Strains were grown in YPD or SD medium (22Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

YPGal medium is identical to YPD except that it contains 2% galactose and 0.2% glucose as carbon sources. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm of cultures (A600) using a Novaspec II photometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); cells were dispersed by sonification (1 min) in a bath sonifier (Bandelin Sonorex TK52) before measurements. Transformations were performed using the spheroplast or lithium acetate methods (22Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Hyphae were induced by diluting washed cells growing exponentially at 30 °C into 5% serum at 37 °C; alternatively, washed cells were first starved in salt base (SB) (0.45% NaCl; 0.335% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco)); 10 mm proline at pH 5.5 for 3 h, followed by dilution (A600 = 0.5) into SB (pH 6.5) containing 2.5 mm GlcNAc at 37 °C.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidGenotype or descriptionReference/SourceC. albicans strains SC5314Prototrophic21Fonzi W.A.

Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed by digesting DNA with HindIII and insertion of 5–6-kb fragments into YEplac195 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α transformants carrying the genomic library were analyzed by colony hybridization using a 2.5-kb EcoRV–XhoI fragment containing the S. cerevisiae PMT1 gene (17Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8164-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as a probe. Plasmid pCT1 was found to strongly hybridize to ScPMT1 and to contain a 5.5-kb C. albicans insert. Subfragments of the pCT1 insert were ligated into pUC19 and sequenced from both ends using forward and reverse primers or by using insert-specific oligonucleotides. The 5.5-kb HindIII CaPMT1 fragment was inserted into the HindIII site of pRC18 (24Stoldt V. Sonneborn A. Leuker C.E. Ernst J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1982-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) to generate replicatingC. albicans vectors (resulting in plasmids pCT29 and pCT30 with inverse insert orientation); alternatively, the CaPMT1fragment was inserted into the HindIII site of YEplac112 or YCplac22 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) to construct a high copy (pCT31) or a low copy vector (pCT32) for transformation of S. cerevisiae. To placeCaPMT1 under transcriptional control of a defined S. cerevisiae promoter, the CaPMT1 coding region was amplified by PCR, using the primers pcP1–9Bam (5′-TTAGGATCCCATTCAATATGGCAA-3′) and pcP1–10Hind (5′-TTAAAGCTTAAGTTTTCATCTACAAC-3′), by which aBamHI site (italic type) is placed 9 bp upstream of the ATG start codon (underlined), and a HindIII site (italic type) is placed 17 bp downstream of the stop codon. TheBamHI–HindIII CaPMT1 fragment was placed downstream of the GAL1 promoter (theEcoRI–BamHI fragment of pBM150 (25Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar)), and the promoter fusion was inserted, as anEcoRI–HindIII fragment, between theEcoRI and HindIII sites of YCplac22 or YEplac112 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) to generate plasmids pCH1 or pCH2. pCT28 contains the 7.1-kbBamHI–XhoI genomic ScPMT1 fragment (17Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8164-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as an SacI–SphI insert in YCplac22. In preparation for disruption ofPMT1, a pUC19 derivative (pCT5) containing 2 kb of thePMT1 promoter region and 2 kb of the coding region on aHindIII–HincII fragment was used as template for “divergent” PCR using the oligonucleotides A (5′-TTAGTCGACATTGAATGGGAAACT) and B (5′-TTAAGATCTTTAGAGCCGGATTGC). Oligonucleotide A corresponds to nucleotides −1–15 relative to the ATG in the PMT1 sequence and also adds a SalI site to the PCR product, while oligonucleotide B corresponds to nucleotides 975–990 and adds a BglII site. The 6.7-kb PCR fragment was cut with SalI and BglII and ligated to the 4-kb SalI–BglII “URA blaster” fragment of plasmid p5921 (26Gow N.A.R. Robbins P.W. Lester J. Brown A.J.P. Fonzi W.A. Chapman T. Kinsman O.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 6216-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). From the resulting plasmid, pCT23, a 6.7-kb Asp718–SpeI was isolated that was used to transform strain CAI4 to prototrophy. Correct insertion of the URA blaster into one of the two PMT1 alleles was verified by Southern blots on DNA of transformants, which was cut withHindIII and probed with a 0.7-kb XbaI fragment derived from the PMT1 promoter region or a 1.3-kbNheI–BamHI fragment from p5921 carrying hisG. A pmt1Δ::hisG-URA3-hisG/PMT1 strain was plated out on media containing 0.02% 5-fluoroorotic acid. Spontaneous 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant strains were analyzed for loss of theURA3 sequence by Southern blotting. One of several identified strains, CAP1–31, of the genotypepmt1Δ::hisG/PMT1 was used for a second round of gene disruption using the original URA blaster fragment. Several transformants had the genotypepmt1Δ::hisG/pmt1Δ::hisG-URA3-hisG, and strain CAP1–312 was chosen to identify strains by 5-fluoroorotic acid resistance (21Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain CAP1–3121 is a representative of mutant strains of the genotypepmt1Δ::hisG/pmt1Δ::hisG. TheCaPMT1 gene was reintroduced in CAP1–3121 by transformation with plasmid pCT29 or pCT30. To disrupt ScPMT1, we transformed S. cerevisiaestrain B76 (24Stoldt V. Sonneborn A. Leuker C.E. Ernst J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1982-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) with an XbaI–SacI fragment containing pmt1Δ::URA3, as described (13Finck M. Bergmann N. Jansson B. Ernst J.F. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8164-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Correct replacement of the genomic ScPMT1 gene was verified by Southern blottings (13Finck M. Bergmann N. Jansson B. Ernst J.F. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resulting strain, B76Δpmt1::URA3, was diploidized by transformation with YEplac112-HO, 2A. Sonneborn and J. Ernst, unpublished results. , which contains the HO gene (27Herskowitz I. Jensen R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). One diploid transformant was grown repeatedly under nonselective conditions in YPD, and a plasmid-free derivative, B76dΔpmt1, was identified. To induce pseudohyphal growth, B76dΔpmt1 was transformed with YCplac22RAS2Val19, 3F. Rademacher and J. F. Ernst, manuscript in preparation. and cells were grown on low nitrogen SLAHD plates as described (28Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). As a control, the diploid strain B76/4 was analyzed (24Stoldt V. Sonneborn A. Leuker C.E. Ernst J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1982-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 50 ml of YPD or SD to an A578 of 0.5–1.0. 40 OD units of cells were harvested and washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 mmMgCl2). The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of TM buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 0.25 mm N α-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 20 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm benzamidine) and transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. An equal volume of glass beads was added, and the cells were lysed by vortexing eight times in intervals of 1 min with a 1-min incubation on ice. The lysate was collected into a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (5 s/4 °C), and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and were then resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm bicine, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 33% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Microsomal membranes were stored in liquid nitrogen. The in vitro peptide assay for Pmt1p activity was performed according to Weston et al. (29Weston A. Nassau P.M. Henly C. Marriott M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The assay was optimized using Dol-P-[14C] mannose (approximately 30,000 cpm; specific activity of 305 Ci/mol) and the acceptor peptide Ac-YATAV-NH2 (final concentration of 4 mm). Up to 25 μl of C. albicans microsomal membranes (protein concentration of 3 mg/ml) were added. Assay mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Human colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) (30Bacher A. Gribl K. Mackamul S. Mitreiter R. Muckter H. Ben-Shaul Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Rousset M. Biochimie. 1986; 68: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 0.45% glucose, 292 μg/ml glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml penicillin G (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C (5% CO2). Monolayers established in culture dishes (well diameter of 60 mm) were used 2–4 days after confluency for adhesion studies. Adhesion was determined according to Rotrosen et al. (32Rotrosen D. Edwards Jr., J.E. Gibson T.R. Moore J.C. Cohen A.H. Green I. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 152: 1264-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and Fratti et al. (33Fratti R.A. Ghannoum M.A. Edwards Jr., J.E. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4714-4718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers were washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of approximately 200 C. albicans cells in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in an atmosphere of air containing 5% CO2. Following the incubation, monolayers were washed once with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonadhering cells; the monolayer in each well was then covered by 2 ml of YPD agar (1% agar). Yeast colonies appearing after 48 h of growth at 30 °C were counted. As a control, fungal cells were plated directly on YPD. Virulence studies were performed as described, using 8-week-old, male CFW-1 mice (Halan-Winkelmann, Paderborn, Germany) (34Leberer E. Harcus D. Broadbent I.D. Clark K.L. Dignard D. Ziegelbauer K. Schmidt A. Gow N.A.R. Brown A.J.P. Thomas D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13217-13222Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Because of the aggregation ofCapmt1 mutants, all strains were sonicated for 5–10 min in a bath sonifier (Bandelin Sonorex TK52) before injection; as determined by plating efficiency before and after sonication, viability was not affected by this treatment. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method using the Prism (TM) program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego) and compared using the log-rank test. Ap value <0.05 was considered significant. To quantify colony-forming C. albicans units in kidneys, mice were sacrificed 48 h after injection, and kidneys were homogenized in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, serially diluted, and plated. S. cerevisiae PMT genes were used as heterologous probes in Southern blots with C. albicans DNA; the 2.5-kb XhoI–EcoRV fragment of pDM3 carrying PMT1 (17Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R.

Yeast. 1995; 11: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the 1.2-kb BamHI–EcoRI fragment of pUC18/PMT5 carrying PMT5 (GenBankTMaccession number X92759). The coding regions of PMT6 andPMT7 were used as probes. The known sequences ofPMT6 (GenBankTM accession number Z49133) andPMT7 (GenBankTM accession number U28374) were used to amplify their coding regions by PCR and insert them into pUC18 (resulting plasmids pUC18-PMT6 and pUC18-PMT7, respectively). Filters were hybridized in 5× SSC at 50 °C and washed twice in 1× SSC at 50 °C. RNA blots were performed as described using the 2.2-kb XbaI fragment of pCT5 carrying PMT1 or the 1.5-kbSalI–ClaI ACT1 fragment (24Stoldt V. Sonneborn A. Leuker C.E. Ernst J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1982-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) as probes. For immunodetection of Als1p, cells were grown in SD medium to anA600 = 3–5 at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA and disrupted using glass beads (35Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min (4 °C), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was solubilized in a small volume of 8m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0); an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2×) was added, and samples were heated for 5 min at 65 °C Proteins in the solubilzed extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE (5% acrylamide) and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp.) filters. Als1p was visualized by standard procedures after reaction with anti-Als1 antiserum (1:10,000), followed by anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase and staining by the SuperSignal ULTRA substrate (Pierce). Monoclonal antibody 1B12 was kindly supplied by R. Sentandreu (36Elorza M.V. Marcilla A. Sanjuán R. Mormeneo S. Sentandreu R. Arch. Microbiol. 1994; 161: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar); polyclonal antibodies against the gp115 protein, the Pma1 protein, the Cdr1 protein and the Int1 protein were gifts by L. Popolo, A. Goffeau, D. Sanglard, and M. Hostetter, respectively (37Gale C.A. Bendel C.M. McClellan M. Hauser M. Becker J. Berman J. Hostetter M.K.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N-tetraacetylchitotetraoside as substrate. 20 μl of medium or cells contained in 20 μl of culture (A600 of ∼5) were added to 80 μl of 125 μm4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N-tetraacetylchitotetraoside and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.9 ml of 0.5 m glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 10.4), and fluorescence was determined in a Kontron SFM25 fluorometer. Each of the seven S. cerevisiae PMT genes was used to detect homologous genes in C. albicans genomic DNA by low stringency Southern hybridization. With genomic DNA cut by different restriction enzymes, only two patterns of hybridization were obtained. PMT1 andPMT5 probes yielded one pattern (Fig.1 A), while use of thePMT2, PMT3, and PMT6 genes resulted in an alternative pattern (Fig. 1 B), and PMT4 andPMT7 did not show any hybridization. Since only a single hybridizing band was obtained in each case, these results suggested that only two PMT genes, designated PMT1 andPMT2, exist in C. albicans, although the possibility of the presence of less homologous genes could not be excluded. Previously, we had pointed out the sequence-relatedness of the S. cerevisiae PMT1 and PMT5 genes as well as the PMT2, PMT3, and PMT6 genes (13Finck M. Bergmann N. Jansson B. Ernst J.F. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on the Southern results, we constructed a partial C. albicans genomic bank and cloned CaPMT1 by hybridization to the S. cerevisiae PMT1 gene. A positive clone contained a 5.5-kb fragment, which was sequenced (GenBankTM/EMBO accession number AF000232). The DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame with the potential to encode a protein of 877 amino acids (Fig. 2). Because of N- and C-terminal extensions, CaPmt1p is longer than any other Pmt proteins. The deduced Pmt1 protein has 49% identical residues compared with Pmt1p of S. cerevisiae (17Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8164-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Identities to the ScPmt2–7 proteins were lower, amounting to 28, 27, 25, 42, 23, and 19% identical residues, respectively. As determined by the TMpred program, 4Available on the World Wide Web (http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/ TMPRED_form.html). CaPmt1p is a likely integral membrane protein containing 10 possible transmembrane regions. Asparagine residues at positions 83, 195, 395, 400, and 721 are potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. To test if CaPmt1p functions in S. cerevisiae, we constructed a low copy centromeric and a high copy S. cerevisiae vector containing CaPMT1 (plasmids pCT32 and pCT31, respectively). In addition, the CaPMT1 coding region was placed under transcriptional control of the GAL1 promoter in low and high copy expression vectors (pCH1 and pCH2, respectively). All plasmids were transformed into the S. cerevisiae pmt1 mutant B76Δpmt1, and transformants were grown in YPGal (to induce theGAL1 promoter). Chitinase in the culture medium was adsorbed to chitin, separated by SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained (42Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19758-19767Abstract Full Text PDF"

The corresponding domain of the conserved GADD34 protein homologous to γ134.5 functionally substitutes for γ134.5. This report shows that γ134.5 and PP1 form a complex in the infected cells, that fractions containing this complex specifically dephosphorylate eIF-2α, and that both γ134.5 and GADD34 proteins contain the amino acid sequence motif common to subunits of PP1 that is required for binding to the PP1 catalytic subunit. An oligopeptide containing this motif competes with γ134.5 for binding to PP1. Substitution of Val193 and Phe195 in the PP1-binding motif abolished activity.

The second blocks the shut-off of protein synthesis resulting from phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2 by the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). This function maps in the 3′-terminal domain of the 263-codon gene (5Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3266-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 6Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that in HSV-1-infected cells PKR is activated but that in cells infected with wild-type virus or virus carrying in-frame deletions of the 5′-terminal coding domain of the gene eIF-2α was not phosphorylated (7Chou J. Chen J.J. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10516-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies (8He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) we have shown that the γ134.5 protein interacts with the protein phosphatase 1α (PP1). Indeed, infected cells contain a phosphatase activity that specifically dephosphorylates eIF-2α at a rate 3000-fold greater than that measured in uninfected cells. This phosphatase activity is inhibited by inhibitors of PP1. The hypothesis that emerged from these studies is that transcription of complementary sequences of the HSV-1 DNA results in the formation of double-stranded RNA, that PKR is activated in cells infected with both wild-type and mutant viruses, and that a domain of the γ134.5 protein binds PP1 and redirects its activity to dephosphorylate eIF-2α. This report centers on one aspect of this hypothesis: we show that in infected cells γ134.5 protein is a component of a multi-protein, cytoplasmic complex containing PP1 and that the interacting domain of the γ134.5 protein is near the carboxyl terminus of the protein and has an amino acid motif shared with accessory proteins or subunits interacting with the catalytic subunit of PP1. herpes simplex virus 1 double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase protein phosphatase 1α glutathioneS-transferase plaque-forming unit(s). Relevant to this report are the following: (i) The HSV-1 γ134.5 gene encodes a protein consisting of a 159-amino acid amino-terminal domain, the amino acids Ala-Thr-Pro repeated 5–10 times depending on virus strain, and a 74-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain (9Ackermann M.

The key observation was that protein synthesis was shut off after the onset of synthesis of viral DNA in cells infected with mutants either lacking the entire γ134.5 coding domain or that are unable to express the carboxyl-terminal domain (6Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). (ii) The γ134.5 gene is conserved in very few herpesviruses, suggesting that other herpesviruses have evolved different methods for blocking the consequences of double-stranded RNA accumulation in infected cells. Homologs of the γ134.5 carboxyl-terminal domain have been found, however, in the African swine fever virus (12Sussman M.D. Kutish L.G. Afonso C.L. Roberts P. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5586-5589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a DNA virus belonging to the unrelated, Iridovirus family, and in the corresponding domain of a highly conserved mammalian protein known as GADD34 (growth arrest and DNAdamage protein 34) (13McGeoch D.J.

The GADD proteins are induced in cells subjected to growth arrest as a consequence of serum deprivation or damage to their DNA or in the course of differentiation (14Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B.

Papathanasiou M., J. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It has been reported that overexpression of GADD34 results in apoptosis (17Hollander M.C. Zhan Q. Bae I. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13731-13737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is of interest, however, that the carboxyl-terminal domain of the mouse GADD34 protein substituted for the HSV-1 γ134.5 carboxyl-terminal domain in blocking the shut-off of protein synthesis (18He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the shared sequences are sufficient to block the shut-off of protein synthesis and that the corresponding GADD34 protein domain may perform upon induction a similar function. The homologous domains of known GADD34 proteins and of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 and African swine fever virus homologs are shown in Fig. 1. (iii) The catalytic subunit of PP1 is a highly conserved protein with a Mr of 38,000 (19Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). PP1 exists in holoenzyme complexes with noncatalytic or regulatory components that modulate catalytic activity or restrict the subcellular localization of the catalytic subunit. In essence, PP1 is regulated by different cellular proteins. Many of such regulatory proteins have been described (20Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Cohen P.

While this work was in progress, it has been reported that these subunits share an amino acid sequence required for binding to the catalytic subunit of PP1 (27Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouts F.

The HeLa and SK-N-SH cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (HeLa) or 10% (SK-N-SH cells) fetal bovine serum, respectively. The rabbit skin cell line originally obtained from J. McClaren was propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. HSV-1(F) is the prototype HSV-1 strain used in this laboratory (29Ejercito P.M. Kieff E.D. Roizman R. J. Gen. Virol. 1968; 2: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Recombinant virus R3616 lacks 1000 base pairs from the coding region of the HSV-1(F) γ134.5 gene (1Chou J. Kern E.R., R.J. Whitely R.J. Roizman B. Science. 1990; 250: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In recombinant R8301, the 3′ sequence encoding amino acids 206–263 was deleted from the carboxyl-terminal domain of the γ134.5 gene (18He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recombinant viruses R4002, R931, R908, and R909, the sequences of the γ134.5 encoding amino acids 1–30, 31–72, 72–106, and 107–146, respectively, were deleted (6Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As previously reported, all recombinant viruses listed above except R3616 and R8301 preclude the shut-off of protein synthesis. For infection, cells were exposed to the indicated virus for 2 h. at 37 °C. The inoculum was then replaced with medium 199V consisting of mixture 199 supplemented with 1% calf serum. In plasmid pRB4892 the coding domain of glutathione S-transferase (GST) is fused to the entire coding domain of PP1 except for the initiator methionine codon (8He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In plasmid pRB4893 the coding domain of GST is fused to codons 146–263 of the γ134.5 gene (8He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pRB4895, an oligonucleotide linker, AATTCCCAGCACGTGTACGTTTCTCGCCTCACGTCCGAGTACGTCACG, and its complement, TCGACGTGACGTACTCGGACGTGAGGCGAGAAACGTACACGTGCTGGG, were cloned into theEcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX4T-1. In this plasmid, codons 190–203 of the γ134.5 gene were fused in frame to the coding sequences of GST. To construct plasmid pRB4894, an oligonucleotide linker, AATTCCACCTGGTGTCCGGA, and its complement, TCGACTCCGGACACCAGGTGG, were inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX 4T-1, yielding plasmid pRB4896. A 244-base pair DraIII-BspEI fragment encoding amino acids 205–263 was then isolated from plasmid pRB3207 (18He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated into the DraIII and BspEI sites of pRB4896. To construct pRB4897, a BstEII-DraIII fragment encoding codons 28–205 of γ134.5 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pRB143 with primers CCACCCCGGCACGCTCTCTGT and CAGACCACCAGGTGGCGCACCCGGACGTGGGGCGATAAGCGCTCCCGCGCGGGGGTC. The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment with nucleotide changes (underlined) incorporated in the 3′ end primer was inserted into the BstEII and DraIII sites of pRB143, resulting in plasmid pRB4897, which was sequenced to verify that the plasmid contained the desired mutations. In this plasmid, the codons encoding Val193 and Phe195 of γ134.5 were replaced with those encoding Glu and Leu, respectively. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to cultures ofEscherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with plasmid pRB4892, pRB4893, pRB4894, or pRB4895, followed by affinity purification of the fusion proteins from bacterial lysates on agarose beads conjugated with glutathione. Purified PP1 was obtained by cleavage of GST-PP1 fusion protein with thrombin (Sigma). Recombinant virus R8321 was constructed by cotransfection of the intact viral DNA of R3659 (30Post L.E. Roizman B. Cell. 1981; 25: 227-233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with the plasmid pRB4897 on rabbit skin cells. In the parent virus R3659 (31Lagunoff M. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3605-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a 1-kilobase fragment from the coding sequences of γ134.5 was replaced with the chimeric α27-tk gene. The progeny of the recombinant was selected and plaque-purified on 143 TK mutant cells in medium consisting of mixture 199V supplement with 100 μg of bromodeoxyuridine/ml and 2% fetal calf serum. Preparation of viral stocks and titrations of infectivity were done with Vero cells. HeLa cells either mock-infected or infected with viruses were harvested at 18 h after infection, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm benzamidine, stored on wet ice for 30 min, and subjected to low speed centrifugation to remove nuclei. The supernatant fluids (S10 fractions) were saved for analysis. Samples were solubilized in disruption buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 2.75% sucrose, sonicated and boiled, subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, reacted with either anti-γ134.5 antibody (9Ackermann M. Chou J. Sarmiento M. Lerner R.A. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 843-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-PP1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Lake Placid, NY), rinsed, and reacted with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to alkaline phosphatase as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Replicate cultures of SK-N-SH cells were either mock-infected or exposed to 10 plaque-forming units (pfu) of HSV-1(F) or one of the γ134.5 mutants per cell at 37 °C. At 14 h after infection, cells were overlaid with 1 ml of medium lacking methionine but supplemented with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (specific activity, >1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and reincubated for 1 h. The cells were then harvested, solubilized, subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet and subjected to autoradiography as described previously (5Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3266-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (1.0 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA and pumped at 0.5 ml/min, using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system. Samples (final volume of 0.5 ml) were injected, 0.5-ml fractions were collected on ice, and the absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. Rabbit reticulocyte eIF-2, purified as described previously (32Gross M. Kaplansky D.A. J. Biol. chem. 1980; 255: 6270-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was phosphorylated with partially purified, hemin-controlled translational repressor as described elsewhere (33Gross M. Rabinovitz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 50: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Gross M. Kaplansky D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 740: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to yield phosphorylated eIF-2α and eIF-2β (1.0 and 0.7 mol/mol of eIF-2, respectively). This preparation also contains a phosphoprotein with aMr of 39,000. S10 fractions were prepared from lysates of HeLa cells infected with HSV-1(F) (7Chou J. Chen J.J. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10516-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and fractionated on a Superdex 200 column as described above. Aliquots (3.0 μl) of the fractions were incubated with 1.2 pmol of phosphorylated eIF-2 and a final concentration of 0.8 mm ATP in a final volume of 4.0 μl for 1.0 min at 34 °C. Reactions were terminated with SDS and subjected to electrophoresis on 7% denaturing, polyacrylamide gels, followed by silver staining, drying, and autoradiography as described (8He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The percentage of eIF-2(α32P) and eIF-2(β32P) that was dephosphorylated was determined by excising these bands and comparing their Cerenkov radiation to that of equivalent eIF-2(α,β32P) that was not further incubated and was subjected to electrophoresis in parallel. Earlier studies have shown that the carboxyl-terminal domain of the γ134.5 protein (Fig.1) is required to prevent the shut-off of protein synthesis, that it interacts with PP1, and that it is highly conserved among several viral and GADD34 proteins. The objective of this series of experiments was to determine the PP1-binding sites in the γ134.5 protein. In the first series of experiments, purified GST-PP1 protein bound to beads was incubated with cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells infected with 20 pfu of wild-type virus or mutants carrying γ134.5 genes from which various domains of the gene had been deleted (Fig. 2 A). The proteins bound to GST-PP1 were solubilized, electrophoretically separated in denaturing gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with antibody to the Ala-Thr-Pro repeat of the γ134.5 protein (9Ackermann M. Chou J. Sarmiento M. Lerner R.A. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 843-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results in Fig.3 A indicate that GST-PP1 was able to bind to the wild-type γ134.5 protein (lane 6), the γ134.5 mutants with the nested deletions from amino acids 1–146 at the amino-terminal domain (lanes 1–3 and 5), and the γ134.5 protein lacking the amino acids 205 to 263 (lane 4). These results indicate that a PP1-binding site is located between amino acids 146 and 205.Figure 3Association of PP1 with γ134.5 protein in vitro. A, replicate HeLa cell cultures were harvested in lysis buffer containing 10 mmHepes (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm benzamidine 18 h after mock infection or infection with 10 pfu of the indicated viruses. After 30 min on ice and low speed centrifugation to remove nuclei, the supernatant fluids were precleared with GST beads and then reacted with GST-PP1 beads at 4 °C for 14 h. The proteins bound to beads were rinsed extensively, solubilized by boiling in disruption buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 2.75% sucrose, electrophoretically separated on denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, and reacted with rabbit polyclonal anti-γ134.5 serum (9Ackermann M. Chou J. Sarmiento M. Lerner R.A. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 843-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The positions of the full-length and truncated γ134.5 are shown. B, an aliquot of GST-PP1 fusion protein bound to beads was reacted with 25 units of thrombin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. After 12 h, the mixture was centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge, and the supernatant fluid containing PP1 was then dialyzed against lysis buffer, reacted with GST or GST-γ134.5c chimeric proteins containing the amino acids (aa) 190–203, 205–263, or 146–263 bound to beads, and processed as described above. PP1 was detected with anti-PP1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the second set of experiments, purified PP1 was reacted with beads carrying GST or GST fused to the sequence of amino acids 146–263, 190–203, or 205–263 of the γ134.5 protein (Fig.2 B). The proteins bound to GST fusion proteins were solubilized, subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing gel, and reacted with anti-PP1 antibody. The results in Fig. 3 Bindicate that PP1 bound strongly to the γ134.5 peptide sequence encompassing amino acids 190–203. In addition, PP1 bound less efficiently to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the γ134.5 protein encompassing amino acids 205–263. PP1 did not bind to GST (Fig. 3 B). In the third series of experiments, a competition assay was done to test whether a synthetic test peptide containing amino acids 185–211 could block the interaction between intact γ134.5 protein and PP1. To control for the specificity, we synthesized a second peptide containing the same amino acids but in a scrambled order. GST-PP1 bound to beads was mixed with cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells infected with HSV-1(F) in the presence or absence of the synthetic peptides. The protein complex was separated in a denaturing protein gel and processed for immunoblotting with the anti-γ134.5 antibody. As shown in Fig.4, the test peptide competed with the γ134.5 protein for binding to PP1, whereas the control peptide was not. We conclude from these experiments that a PP1-binding site of γ134.5 is located between amino acids 190 and 203. PP1 also interacts with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the γ134.5 protein (amino acids 205–263) but with a lower affinity. In this series of experiments replicate cultures of SK-N-SH cells were exposed to 10 pfu/cell of wild-type and mutant viruses and incubated at 37 °C. At 14 h after infection, the cultures were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h. As shown in Fig.5, protein synthesis continued in cells infected with wild-type virus or with the mutants with deletions in the amino-terminal domain, whereas protein synthesis was shut off in cells infected with either R3616, from which 1 kilobase pair of coding sequences of the γ134.5 had been deleted, or R8301, from which 244 base pairs of the carboxyl-terminal domain had been deleted. It is noteworthy that the γ134.5 protein encoded by R8301 bound PP1 but was unable to prevent the shut-off of protein synthesis. We conclude from this experiment that both the PP1-binding site described above and the functions encoded by the carboxyl-terminal domain of the γ134.5 protein are required to prevent the shut-off of protein synthesis. The purpose of this series of experiments was to determine whether mutations in the PP1-binding site abolish the ability of the γ134.5 protein to prevent the shut-off of protein synthesis in HSV-1-infected cells. To address this question, we constructed the recombinant virus R8321 in which the conserved amino acids Val193 and Phe195 in the PP1-binding motif were mutated to Glu and Leu, respectively, and created the novel restriction site Eco47III. The inserted mutations were verified by sequencing of the plasmid and the presence of the restriction site in the viral DNA (data not shown). Replicate cultures of human neuroblastma SK-N-SH cells were either mock-infected or infected with HSV-1(F), R3616, or R8321 at 10 pfu/cell. At 14 h after infection, the cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine and then harvested, solubilized, subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The autoradiogram shown in Fig. 6 A indicates premature shut-off of protein synthesis in cells infected with R8321 or R3616 but not in mock-infected cells or those infected with HSV-1(F). To determine whether R8321 expressed the mutant γ134.5 in SK-N-SH cells, the nitrocelluse sheet described above was reacted with the anti-γ134.5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the lysates of cells infected with HSV-1(F) or R8321 expressed full-length γ134.5 protein. The decrease in the amount of the γ134.5 protein made in cells infected with the R8321 mutant was expected because γ134.5, as its name indicates, is made mostly after the onset of DNA synthesis, and its accumulation would be affected by the shut-off of protein synthesis. The antibody did not react with lysates of mock-infected cells or cells infected with the R3616. On the basis of these experiments, we conclude that Val193 and Phe195 in the PP1 biding motif of γ134.5 are essential for the function of γ134.5. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether PP1 forms a complex with γ134.5 protein in cells infected with wild-type virus. Replicate 150-cm2 flask cultures of HeLa cells were exposed to 20 pfu of HSV-1(F)/cell. At 15 h after infection, the cells were harvested and lysed, and the S10 fraction was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 column. The fractions were then assayed for their ability to dephosphorylate eIF-2(αP). Aliquots of these fraction were also solubilized, subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing gels, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and reacted with anti-PP1 and γ134.5 antibodies, respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results (Fig.7) indicate that the eIF-2(αP) phosphatase eluted as a single discrete component in fractions 22–24. This activity was relatively specific for eIF-2α, because it had little or no effect on eIF-2(βP) or on the 39-kDa phosphoprotein (Figs. 7 and 8 B). A separate activity that dephosphorylated eIF-2(βP) eluted in fractions 25–26. Comparison of the elution of eIF-2(α32P) phosphatase with that of known proteins (Fig. 7) yielded an estimated molecular weight of 340,000 for the eIF-2α-specific phosphatase activity.Figure 8A, immunoblot of proteins contained in chromatographic fractions obtained as described in the legend to Fig.7. 20 and 50 μl of unfractionated S10 fraction (lanes 1and 2) and 250-μl portions of fractions 15–26 (numbered at top and in lanes 3–14), to which were added 40 μg of sperm whale apomyoglobin as carrier, were precipitated by mixing with 2 volumes of acetone at −20 °C (44Gross M.

The solubilized precipitates and 20 μl of S10 fraction that was not precipitated (lane 15) were subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing gels, transferred electrically to nitrocellulose sheets, and reacted with antibody to PP1 or γ134.5 protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, autoradiographic image of purified, in"

We have isolated the protein product and corresponding cDNA of a gene designated Anticoagulant-factor Xa(AFXa), that encodes the factor Xa (FXa)-directed anticoagulant of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. The protein was purified partially by cation exchange chromatography and shown by enzyme activity profiles and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis to have an Mr = 54,000. The protein was purified further by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to internal protein sequencing, and the sequence of five peptides was determined. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on three of the peptide sequences, and these were used to screen an adult female salivary gland cDNA library from A. aegypti. A 1.8-kilobase pair cDNA was isolated and shown to encode a 415-amino acid conceptual translation product with a predicted molecular mass of 47.8 kDa that contains the five sequenced peptides. Hydrophobicity analysis predicts a 19-amino acid signal peptide typical for secreted proteins. Northern analysis demonstrated that AFXa is expressed only in female salivary glands. Baculovirus-expressed AFXa protein has the appropriate size and expected FXa-directed anticoagulant activity.

Mosquitoes contribute significantly to worldwide morbidity and mortality rates by transmitting pathogens responsible for malaria and other diseases. The transmission of pathogens occurs via salivation as the female mosquito takes a blood meal. Mosquito saliva contains biochemically active molecules that counteract vertebrate hemostasis and allow successful feeding (1James A.A. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1994; 92: 113-150Google Scholar). In addition, studies with sandfly saliva and the parasites that cause leishmaniasis have shown that the saliva of vector insects can play a role beyond acting as a transfer medium and can be involved in the enhancement of parasite infectivity (2Titus R.G. Ribeiro J.M.C. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 157-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By understanding the biochemical actions of saliva and its role in blood feeding, we hope to gain a better understanding of how hematophagy contributes to disease transmission and identify important targets for genetic manipulation toward the development of parasite-refractory mosquitoes (3Collins F.H. James A.A. Sci. Med. 1996; 3: 52-61Google Scholar). Mosquito saliva has been shown to contain platelet antiaggregating factors (4Ribeiro J.M.C. Sarkis J.J.F. Rossignol P.A. Spielman A. Comp. Biochem.

Recently, we used coagulation assays and factor-specific assays to demonstrate that a number of mosquito species contain anticoagulants (9Stark K.R. James A.A. J. Med. Entomol. 1996; 33: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a remarkable finding, we determined that although all of the mosquito species we examined inhibited coagulation at the common pathway, the specific coagulation factor that was inhibited differed between the hematophagous subfamilies of mosquitoes. The culicine mosquitoes contained anticoagulants that inhibited coagulation factor Xa (FXa) 1The abbreviations used are: FXafactor XaAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoridebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)CAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidEDTAethylenediamine tetraacetic acidPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSGEsalivary gland extractPAI-2plasminogen activator inhibitor-2.1The abbreviations used are: FXafactor XaAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoridebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)CAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidEDTAethylenediamine tetraacetic acidPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSGEsalivary gland extractPAI-2plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. , while anopheline mosquitoes had thrombin-directed anticoagulants. factor Xa 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis salivary gland extract plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. factor Xa 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis salivary gland extract plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. A biochemical analysis of the anticoagulant in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, a culicine, showed that it was a specific, reversible, noncompetitive, proteinaceous inhibitor of FXa (10Stark K.R. James A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The anticoagulant was shown to function at physiological levels and had calcium and pH optima that corresponded to those of FXa. Because anticoagulants do not form a specific class of molecules, theA. aegypti anticoagulant was isolated and analyzed to define further its mechanism of inhibition and to understand its molecular origins. Oligonucleotide primers based on partial peptide sequences of the purified anticoagulant led to the isolation of a 1.8-kb cDNA. The corresponding gene has been designated Anticoagulant-factor Xa (AFXa). The cDNA encodes a conceptual translational product of 415 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47.8 kDa and shares primary structural similarities with the serpin superfamily of serine protease inhibitors. However, theAFXa gene product has a unique inhibitory mechanism in comparison with typical serpins (10Stark K.R. James A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and therefore appears to be highly diverged biochemically from the serpin family of proteins. HEPES, rehydrogenated Triton X-100, CAPS, and AEBSF (Calbiochem); bovine FXa and thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories); and Chromozym X and TH, leupeptin, pepstatin, and apoprotonin (Boehringer Mannheim) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. A. aegypti (Rockefeller strain) were reared at 22 °C, 80% relative humidity, 18:6 light/dark cycle, and fed on anesthetized guinea pigs and/or sugar cubes. The mosquitoes used in the experiments were 3–5-day-old adults that had never fed on blood prior to salivary gland dissection. Salivary glands were dissected inAedes saline (20 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.8 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.0), transferred to a vial containing homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% rehydrogenated Triton X-100, pH 8.0), and stored at −70 °C until needed. The salivary glands were thawed and disrupted by sonication (Heat Systems Ultrasonics) in an ice-water bath at 40% output power for 5 min. The homogenate was centrifuged (20,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant, salivary gland extract (SGE), was recovered for purification of the anticoagulant or use in biochemical assays. All biochemical assays were performed in duplicate at 37 °C unless otherwise specified. Bovine FXa (0.22 ng) was incubated with and without SGE in coagulation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 250 mmNaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.3) with 5 mm CaCl2 for 15 min in a final volume of 0.2 ml. Chromozym X (500 μm) was added, and FXa activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the release of free p-nitroaniline with a continuous change in absorbency at 405 nm (molar extinction coefficient 9.75 mm−1 cm−1) using a Thermo-max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc.). The reaction velocities were measured with and without the addition of SGE, and the percentage of inhibition was expressed as follows: ((uninhibited velocity − inhibited velocity)/uninhibited velocity) × 100%. Units of anticoagulant activity are defined as percentage of inhibition of 0.22 ng of FXa/1.0 ml of AFXa. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed in 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gels according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204996) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver-stained (12Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred to PVDF (Bio-Rad) membranes using a tank electroblotter (Bio-Rad) in CAPS buffer containing 10% methanol (13Matsudaria P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparative SDS-PAGE, 0.1 mm thioglycolate was added to the upper buffer reservoir as a scavenger of unpolymerized acrylamide (14Speicher D.W. Hugli T.E. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 24-35Crossref Google Scholar). Salivary gland extract with added protease inhibitor mixture (10 μmE-64, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml apoprotonin, and 0.2 mm AEBSF) was used as the starting material for purification of the FXa-directed anticoagulant. Salivary gland extract was filtered (0.22 μm, ProX filter, Phenix), total protein content was quantified, the sample was diluted 10-fold in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and the diluted sample was loaded onto a 1.0-ml Mono S cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A until the base line returned to 0, and bound proteins were eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 10 ml of buffer A with 0.3 m NaCl, followed by a 20-ml linear gradient from 0.3 to 0.8 m NaCl in buffer A. Relative protein concentration was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. 0.5-ml fractions were collected with an LKB Frac-100 fraction collector and assayed for FXa-inhibitory activity. Fractions with anticoagulant activity were analyzed with SDS-PAGE to determine purity, and the peak active fractions were pooled and purified further by 12.5% preparative SDS-PAGE. Two gel-purified samples were submitted for internal protein sequencing. One sample was electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane and submitted to the Harvard Microchemistry Laboratories (under the direction of W. Lane) for cleavage with trypsin, peptide separation, mass spectroscopy, and peptide sequencing. The second sample was submitted as a gel slice to the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (under the direction of K. Williams) for Lys-C digestion, peptide separation, mass spectroscopy, and peptide sequencing. Amino-terminal protein sequencing was performed at the University of California, Irvine Sequencing Facility (under the direction of R. Niece). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the amino acid sequence of three peptides and synthesized using inosine where possible. Separate oligonucleotides were used for degeneracies in the first position, whereas nucleotide mixtures were used for third position degeneracies (Table I). Nested gene amplification was used to amplify a specific sequence corresponding toAFXa from a λgt11 female salivary gland cDNA library (15Grossman G.L. James A.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1993; 1: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An aliquot of phage DNA was purified by treatment with RNase and DNase (37 °C for 30 min) followed by proteinase K treatment (37 °C for 5 min). The sample was extracted with one volume of phenol for 20 min and one volume of chloroform for 1 min. The DNA was precipitated with one volume of ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate. The RNase treatment was repeated followed by standard phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and a 100-ng aliquot was used as the target DNA. The location of primer sets C and D (Table I) within the putativeAFXa sequence was surmised because they are based on the peptide that contains the carboxyl terminus. Primer sets AC, AD, BC, and BD were utilized for the first round of gene amplification. The nested step was amplified using 2 μl of DNA from the above reactions as follows. From the AD reaction, the primer sets AC, BD, and BC were used; from the AC reaction, BC primer sets were used; from the BC reaction, AC primer sets were used; and from the BD reaction, primer sets BC, AD, and AC were used. The nested gene amplification reaction conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; 20 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min with a 0.5 °C decrease each cycle, and 72 °C for 1 min; 20 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. A unique 225-bp product was isolated from the nested gene amplification reactions, cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced using the chain-terminating, dideoxy method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52115) Google Scholar). Conceptual translation of the primary sequence verified that this amplified product corresponded to AFXa. The 225-bp product was labeled with [32P]dATP and [32P]dCTP by random prime reactions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen the cDNA library. Positive clones were plaque-purified, and the clone containing the largest insert, 8–2B, was chosen for further characterization. For convenience, this clone will here be called the “AFXa cDNA.” Phage DNA was purified using Lambda DNA kits (Qiagen). The AFXa cDNA insert was released by digestion with EcoRI, cloned into pBlueScriptIISK(−) (Stratagene), and sequenced by dideoxy chain termination with λ forward and reverse primers and overlapping primers designed from the sequencing results. Protein data base searches were performed with the National Center for Biotechnology BLAST Network services (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (67332) Google Scholar). To obtain a full-length cDNA sequence, two nested oligonucleotide primers (AFXa 5′ R1, 5′-TTCTGCCTGATAGTCTATCGCC-3′; AFXa 5′ R2, 5′-TATCATCCTGTGTGAAACACACC-3′) were designed to the 5′-end of the AFXa cDNA. Heminested gene amplification was performed using 100 ng of purified cDNA from the phage library with λ forward or reverse primers and the nested 5′-endAFXa primers as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. Total RNA was prepared using Triazole (Invitrogen) from 3–5-day-old adult male and female mosquitoes, adult female salivary glands, and adult female carcasses without heads and salivary glands. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). The RNA was separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to a nylon filter (Zeta probe), and probed with 32P-labeledAFXa cDNA. A. aegypti genomic DNA was prepared (18Grossman G.L. Campos Y. Severson D.W. James A.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and used to amplify a 450-bp actin fragment using the primers 5′-GGTATCCACGAAACTGTCTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTGGACGCTGACAAGTATCAC-3′ (reverse), designed to the 3′-end of theA. aegypti muscle actin gene (19Ibrahim M.S. Eisinger S.W. Scott A.L. J. Med. Entomol. 1996; 33: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Gene amplification procedures were as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 8 min. This actin fragment was radiolabeled and used to reprobe the RNA blot. Before probing, the filter was stripped with 0.1 × saline-sodium citrate and 0.5% SDS in two washes incubated at 95 °C for 20 min. All hybridizations were performed using aqueous hybridization solutions at 65 °C (20Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman I.G. Smith I. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Full-lengthAFXa cDNA was generated by gene amplification of 100 ng of plasmid DNA from clone 8–2B using the primers 5′-CTCGGATCCATGTATCTGAAGATAGTAATATTAGTCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGCCGCTCGAGAGTGCTGTAGCAGTGTTGACC-3′ (reverse), designed to start at amino acid 1 and end with the polyadenylation site. The primers were also designed to contain a BamHI site at the 5′-end and anXhoI site at the 3′-end for directional cloning. The error-proof VentR DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used in gene amplification reactions as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min, 52 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; 5 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; 35 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 8 min. The amplified product was cloned into pGem-T (Promega) and subsequently subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector, pVL1393 (Invitrogen) using theBamHI/NotI cloning sites (NotI was obtained from the pGem-T vector). The recombinant virus was transfected into SF-9 cells and plaque-purified, and high titer virus for recombinant protein production was expanded in Hi-5 cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant protein (580 μg of total protein) was harvested from the supernatant of infected Hi-5 cells, and protease inhibitor mixture was added. The sample was centrifuged (40,000 × g, 30 min), diluted 3-fold with buffer A, and applied to a 1.0-ml Mono S column at 1.0 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A until the base line returned to 0, and bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear NaCl gradient. One-ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 10% glycerol, and fractions were assayed for FXa-inhibitory activity. Comparison and alignment of the carboxyl terminus of the AFXa translation product were performed with the similar regions of the following serpins identified from blast analysis: plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 from Homo sapiens (P05120 (21Ye R.D. Wun T.C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3718-3725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), maspin from Rattus norvegicus(U58857), 2Y. Y. Umekita, R. A. Richard, and S. Liao, unpublished GenBank accession number. neuroserpin fromGallus gallus (Z71930 (23Osterwalder T. Contartese J. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)), α-1 antitrypsin from H. sapiens (K02212 (24Long G.L. Chandra T. Woo S.L. Davie E.W. Kurachi K.

Biochem. 1991; 202: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). The sequences were aligned using the Pileup multiple sequence alignment program with a gap weight of 12 and a gap extension penalty of 4 (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin). Gap alignments were adjusted to visually emphasize insertions and deletions except within the reactive site loop, where maximum alignment of amino acid sequence flanking the reactive center P1 was emphasized. We had shown previously that adult female A. aegypti salivary glands contain a potent FXa-directed anticoagulant activity and provided a preliminary biochemical characterization (10Stark K.R. James A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In order to characterize further the anticoagulant, strategies were developed to isolate and purify the protein using adult female A. aegypti SGE as the starting material. Mono S cation ion exchange chromatography was used to fractionate SGE prepared from 2000 dissected female glands, and this produced a high yield of active protein in a mixture of proteins (Fig.1 A). SDS-PAGE analysis of the active fractions demonstrated that a protein with anMr = 54,000 coincided with the FXa-inhibitory activity peak (Fig. 1 B). The 54-kDa species was confirmed to correspond to the majority of the anticoagulant activity by densitometry analysis of the protein bands shown on the gel (data not shown). Fractions 34–37 from the Mono S column containing the protein with the peak anticoagulant activity were pooled, further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane, and the 54-kDa band was excised and submitted for protein sequencing analysis. Approximately 10 pmol of the putative anticoagulant were subjected to tryptic digestion prior to internal protein sequencing. This analysis yielded two sequenced peptide fragments, H46 and H23 (TableI). A gene amplification screen of an adult female A. aegypti salivary gland cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides designed based on the sequences of the H46 and H23 peptides failed to produce any true products, nor did an oligonucleotide-based library screen reveal any positive phage (data not shown). Salivary gland extract from 10,000 dissected female glands was subjected to Mono S chromatography in two separate batches of 12.5 mg of total protein each. 1.0-ml fractions were then collected and assayed for FXa-inhibitory activity. Peak activity was found in fractions 18–20 in both batches to give a 77.5% yield recovery of FXa-inhibitory activity. Fractions 18–20 from both batches were combined and concentrated on a Centricon-30 filter, and half of the sample was applied to 12.5% preparative SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane, and the other half was reserved for preparative SDS-PAGE without transfer to a membrane. The PVDF sample was utilized for amino-terminal protein sequencing, and the gel slice was submitted for Lys-C digestion and internal protein sequencing. Amino-terminal protein sequencing revealed a blocked N terminus. Analysis of Lys-C digestion products resulted in the determination of the primary sequence of three peptides: Y91, Y68, and Y58 (Table I). Peptide Y58 was identified as the carboxyl terminus of the protein, because it lacked a lysine residue at its carboxyl end, a characteristic of Lys-C digestion reactions. This conclusion was confirmed by mass spectroscopy of the peptide (data not shown). The amino acid X in peptide Y58 was undeterminable by spectroscopy or mass spectroscopy, and we concluded that it most likely represents an unusual modification of cysteine. This conclusion was confirmed when the primary nucleotide sequence of this region was determined. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the standard triplicate code using the amino acid sequences of the peptides Y91, Y68, and Y58 (TableI). These oligonucleotides were used for a gene amplification screen of an adult female A. aegypti salivary gland cDNA library. Using primers designed to peptide Y58 as the carboxyl terminus of AFXa, a strategy of nested gene amplification was developed to generate a DNA fragment to be used as a probe for the cDNA library screen (Fig.2 A). Amplification of the cDNA library with primer sets A and D followed by reamplification with primer sets B and C resulted in a unique 225-bp DNA fragment. When this fragment was sequenced and the conceptual translation product was examined, the amino acids from peptides Y68 and Y58 were revealed, including amino acids that were not utilized in the design of the oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 B). These results confirm that this fragment corresponded to a cDNA with sequence homology to theAFXa gene. The 225-bp DNA fragment was labeled and used as a probe to screen the salivary gland cDNA library. Approximately 750,000 plaques were screened in duplicate, and 100 positive colonies were identified. Twenty plaques were subjected to secondary screening, and 13 of these were purified by tertiary screening. The phage were analyzed for DNA insert size by gene amplification using oligonucleotide primers based on the sequence of the λ-phage arms. Phage DNA was prepared from four clones containing the largest insert sizes, and clone 8–2B (AFXa cDNA) was selected and subcloned for further analysis. The cDNA insert was sequenced completely in both directions and contained a 1873-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 17–1885 (Fig.3). 3This sequence has GenBankTMaccession number AF050133. The 5′-end of this phage clone lacked an ATG initiation codon and therefore represented an incomplete cDNA. Nested primers were designed to the 5′-end of the clone, and gene amplification using DNA prepared from the cDNA library was utilized to recover a fragment containing more of the 5′-end. This procedure yielded nucleotides 1–16 in the composite sequence and included the ATG start codon. The 1245-bp open reading frame, nucleotides 6–1250, encodes a conceptual translation product of 415 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47,800 Da. The sequences of all five peptides determined by protein sequencing were identified in the conceptual translation product, as were four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. A hydrophobicity plot identified the first 19 amino acids as a potential secretion signal peptide (data not shown). The cDNA also contains an unusually long 3′-untranslated region, nucleotides 1251–1870, with inverted repeats at nucleotides 1473–1501 and 1815–1843, flanked by 8-bp duplications at nucleotides 1465–1472 and 1844–1851. The AFXacDNA was used as a probe to determine if its corresponding gene showed a tissue-specific expression pattern matching that previously determined for the anticoagulant activity (10Stark K.R. James A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two hybridizing species of RNA of approximately 1.9 and 1.6 kb were detected in preparations from total females and female salivary glands (Fig.4). The 1.6-kb signal is sufficiently broad such that it could represent two mRNAs with similar molecular weights or a highly expressed single mRNA. This pattern of hybridization indicates that AFXa gene expression is specific to the salivary glands as had been shown previously by analysis of anticoagulant activity in dissected tissues. A muscle actin probe was used as a control to confirm the presence of RNA in negative lanes; the absence of a signal in the salivary gland RNA preparations is expected based on its previously described expression profile (19Ibrahim M.S. Eisinger S.W. Scott A.L. J. Med. Entomol. 1996; 33: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the lack of muscles in the glands. To confirm that the isolated cDNA corresponded to that of the FXa-directed anticoagulant, the full-length AFXacDNA was expressed in baculovirus, and infected cell supernatants were analyzed for the production of FXa-inhibitory activity. Analysis of duplicate samples for the presence of FXa-inhibitory activity demonstrated that infected cells produced a peak of activity at 72 h postinfection, followed by a decrease in activity that results most likely from degradation of the recombinant protein (TableII). The extract (30 ml) was applied to a 1.0-ml Mono S cation exchange column using similar conditions developed for the native protein except that bound proteins were eluted with a salt gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl (Fig.5 A). An analysis of the peak activity showed two major proteins at Mr = 54,000 and Mr = 40,000 (Fig. 5 B). The smaller species is most likely a degradation product, because it was not observed in the initial analytical gel. Therefore, the recombinantAFXa product shows FXa-directed anticoagulant activity, elutes off the Mono S column with approximately the same salt concentration as the native protein, and has the"

Nck interacts via its SH3 domains with effector molecules containing proline-rich sequences bringing them to the proximity of ligandactivated RTKs. The three SH3 domains (SH3.1, SH3.2, and SH3.3) of Nck interact selectively with target proteins. The SH3.1 domain mediates Nck association with the Nck-associated protein 1 (Nap1) (9Kitamura T.

The SH3 domains of Dock, the Drosophila homologue of Nck, have been shown to interact with the Drosophilaprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase dPTP61F (23Clemens J.C. Ursuliak Z. Clemens K.K. Price J.V.

Cytoskeletal rearrangement is triggered by a variety of external stimuli such as growth factors, stress, and adhesion through integrins (24Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and is mediated by small GTPases. In mammalian cells, Rho family GTPases control the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to growth factors. For example, epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor activate Rac which induces ruffling of the cell membrane with lamellipodia formation (24Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Polymerization of actin filaments in the cytosol is orchestrated by secondary messengers of signal transduction pathways and by proteins that interact with actin. Profilin is a 15-kDa G-actin-binding protein that regulates actin filament assembly. Profilin promotes actin polymerization by favoring the exchange of ADP to ATP on actin (25Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Furman M.I. Wachsstock D. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and by lowering the critical concentration of ATP-actin (26Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Profilin can also contribute to the pool of unassembled actin when barbed ends are capped (27Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N. Carlier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified a novel WASP-interacting protein (WIP) (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). WIP is a widely expressed 503-amino acid long protein with homology in its amino-terminal sequence to the yeast protein verprolin which is involved in cytoskeleton organization (29Donnelly S.F. Pocklington M.J. Pallotta D. Orr E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). WIP overexpression increases the basal level of polymerized actin in human lymphoid cells and induces the formation of actin-rich cerebriform projections on the cell surface (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). WIP is proline-rich and contains potential SH3 domain-binding sequences. In an effort to investigate the role of WIP in signal transduction, we analyzed WIP binding to Nck. Our results show that Nck binds to WIP and suggest that WIP-Nck interaction may bridge cell-surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. Full-length Nck cDNA was cloned in-frame into the bait vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The sequence of the clone was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, and the clone was designated Nck-GBT9. WIP4 is a truncation of WIP cDNA that encodes the carboxyl-terminal portion of WIP (amino acids 321–503) (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). WIP4 cDNA cloned in the yeast two-hybrid vector pGAD was used to construct the WIP4 deletion mutants. Deletions were obtained by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes followed by Klenow treatment and religation. pGAD-WIP-(321–415) was obtained by digestion with StuI andPstI, and pGAD-WIP-(321–376) was obtained by digestion withSfiI and PstI, and pGAD-WIP-(377–503) was obtained by SfiI digestion, Klenow treatment,EcoRI digestion, and a second Klenow treatment. WIP inserts for pGAD-WIP-(416–503) and pGAD-WIP-(416–488) constructs were obtained by polymerase chain reaction. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast transformation and colony analysis were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System Protocol, CLONTECH). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of Nck and of each of its three SH3 domains were generated as described previously (11Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). All expression constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Expression of fusion proteins in transformed Escherichia coli was induced for 2 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-thioβ-d-galactopyranoside. Fusion proteins were purified as described previously (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). WIP4 cDNA was cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector that expresses cloned cDNA as an amino-terminal FLAG fusion protein and was transfected into the human B lymphoma cell line BJAB as described (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The culture medium for BJAB-transfected cells was supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Lysates of BJAB cells transfected with pcDNA3 or with pcDNA-WIP4 were obtained as described previously (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and precleared for 1 h with 25 μl of GST-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Supernatants were tumbled for 16 h with 2 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on GSH beads. The beads were washed, suspended in Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to PAGE on 4–15% gradient gels and Western blotting. The blots were developed with rabbit anti-WIP followed by protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or with anti-FLAG M2 mAb followed by goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL). BJAB cells or BJAB cells transfected with pcDNA-WIP were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (45 × 106 cells in 0.35 ml) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 30% glycerol, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa3P2O7, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Boehringer Mannheim) and 1% Brij 96) for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of normal mouse serum bound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 8 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or of isotype-matched control MOPC21 mAb preadsorbed onto 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed 4× with modified lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 0.2% Brij-96, eluted in Laemmli loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient gels and Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG mAb or anti-Nck mAb (Transduction Laboratories). The blots were developed by ECL as described above. WIP contains several proline-rich sequences including three repeats of the sequence GRSGPXPPXP. This sequence is repeated twice in WASP and is involved in the binding of WASP to the SH3.3 domain of Nck (30Finan P.M. Soames C.J. Wilson L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26291-26295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that WIP may be a candidate for binding to Nck. Since all the three GRSGPXPPXP sequences were present within WIP4, a truncation of WIP that contains amino acids 321–503, we tested the interaction of WIP4 with Nck by the yeast two-hybrid system. TableI shows that Nck interacts specifically with WIP4. Nck did not interact with human TRAF1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1) used as a control, and WIP4 did not interact with laminin (Table I). As expected, WIP4 interacted with WASP (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Table IInteraction of Nck and WIP by the yeast two-hybrid systempGBT9pGAD424NoneWIP4TRAF1NoneND−−Nck−++−WASP−+++−Laminin−−NDTwo-hybrid assay results for HF7c clones containing the Gal 4 binding (pGBT9) or activation (pGAD424) domain vectors with the indicated fusion protein insert are shown.

A ++ denotes growth both on the selective medium and β-galactosidase activity with color development in 2 h, and +++ indicates growth on the selective medium and color change in 30 min. ND, not done. To demonstrate the Nck-WIP association in vivo, we examined whether Nck and WIP co-immunoprecipitate from cells. To this purpose, we examined the presence of Nck in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates of lysates from human B cells BJAB transfected with FLAG-tagged WIP4 cloned in pcDNA3. Fig.1 shows the presence of Nck in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from FLAG-WIP4 transfected cells (lane 1). Nck was not detected in MOPC21 mAb immunoprecipitates of WIP4-transfected cells (lane 2) nor in M2 immunoprecipitates of untransfected BJAB cells (lane 3). To ascertain the presence of FLAG-tagged WIP in the immunoprecipitates, the membrane was stripped and reblotted with anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Fig. 1, lower panel). FLAG-tagged WIP4 is detected in M2 immunoprecipitates from BJAB cells transfected with FLAG-WIP4 (lane 1) and, as expected, in total lysates from FLAG-WIP4-transfected cells (lane 4). FLAG-WIP4 was neither detected in MOPC21 immunoprecipitates from WIP4-transfected cells (lane 2) nor in M2 immunoprecipitates from untransfected cells (lane 3). Treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 15, 30, or 60 min did not alter the capacity of Nck and WIP to co-immunoprecipitate (data not shown) suggesting that Nck phosphorylation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (31Park D. Rhee S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5816-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) does not regulate WIP-Nck interaction. To confirm Nck interaction with full-length WIP, we used GST-Nck fusion protein to affinity precipitate endogenous WIP from BJAB cells. The precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with anti-WIP rabbit antibody. Fig. 2 A shows that WIP is present in GST-Nck precipitates but not in control GST precipitates. Since proteins that bind to Nck have a preference for one of its three SH3 domains, we sought to determine which of the three SH3 domains of Nck preferentially interacts with WIP. GST fusion proteins of Nck and of each of its individual SH3 domains were used to affinity precipitate WIP from BJAB cells transfected with FLAG-tagged WIP4 or with empty pcDNA3 vector, and the precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Fig. 2 B shows that WIP binds to the SH3.2 domain of Nck but not to the SH3.1 and SH3.3 domains of Nck. No bands were detected in precipitates of lysates from BJAB cells transfected with empty vector (data not shown). With longer exposures, we were able to detect WIP binding to SH3.1 and SH3.3 domains of Nck but not to GST (data not shown). As a control for fusion protein loading, we stained the gels with Coomassie Blue (Fig.2 C). The small differences in the amounts of fusion protein used (<2-fold) are unlikely to account for the difference in the ability of the Nck SH3 domains to bind WIP. Two copies of the sequence GRSGPXPPXP which has been implicated in the binding of WASP to SH3.3 of Nck are present in the shortest truncation of WIP that binds Nck (WIP-(321–415)). Yet WIP bound poorly to SH3.3 of Nck. This suggests that residues other than those in the above sequence determine binding to individual SH3 domains of Nck. The SH3.3 domain of Nck mediates its binding to the serine/threonine kinase CKI-γ2 (17Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It would be important to determine if WIP, which binds to the SH3.2 of Nck, is a potential target for phosphorylation by CKI-γ2. We have previously shown that WASP binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of WIP, amino acids 377–503 (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To determine whether the WASP- and Nck-binding sites on WIP overlap, we examined the interaction of WIP deletion mutants with WASP and Nck using the yeast two-hybrid system. Fig.3 shows that WIP-(416–488) binds to WASP but not to Nck. In contrast, the WIP deletion mutant WIP-(321–415) binds to Nck but not to WASP. Taken together, these results show that the WASP and Nck binding domains of WIP differ. Since WIP and WASP bind preferentially to distinct SH3 domains of Nck, Nck may simultaneously engage WIP and WASP, thereby increasing the local concentration of both proteins and enhancing their interaction. Since different domains of Nck bind to WIP and WASP, different sites on WASP bind to WIP and Nck, and different sites on WIP bind to Nck and WASP; trimolecular complexes of Nck, WIP, and WASP may exist in which each of the proteins could contact the two others. Because each of WIP, WASP, and Nck has non-overlapping binding sites for the other two proteins, formal demonstration of a trimolecular complex of the three full-length proteins is not possible. WIP interacts with profilin (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The two profilin binding consensus sequences in WIP (APPPPP) are located at positions 8–13 and 427–432 and are outside the Nck-binding site (amino acids 321–415). This raised the possibility that WIP may couple Nck to profilin. We therefore examined whether profilin co-precipitates with Nck. Fig.4 shows that endogenous profilin from lysates of BJAB cells is bound to GST-Nck but not to GST. Nck lacks proline-rich sequences, including profilin binding consensus sequences (A, G, L, or S followed by PPPPP) (32Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and fails to interact with profilin in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). These results suggest that the binding of profilin to Nck is indirect and may be mediated by WIP, although we cannot rule out a role for other intermediaries. The Drosophila homologue of Nck, Dock, has been shown to be involved in the photoreceptor cell (R cell) axon guidance, suggesting that it plays a role in cytoskeletal reorganization (33Garrity P.A. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition to binding profilin, WIP contains the actin-binding KLKK sequence, and its overexpression increases the cell content of F-actin. Furthermore, via its interaction with WASP (28Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and N-WASP, 2N. M. Quiles, I. M. Antón, N. Ramesh, and R. S. Geha, unpublished results. WIP may modulate cytoskeletal reorganization. Therefore, WIP may link Nck to the actin cytoskeleton. Since Nck is recruited to RTKs following their tyrosine phosphorylation subsequent to ligand binding, the Nck-WIP interaction we describe may provide an important link between extracellular signaling via RTKs and reorganization of the cytoskeleton.

Here, we report that TDG can interact with RAR and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in a ligand-independent manner, both in yeast and in vitro. Mapping of the binding sites revealed interaction with a region of the ligand binding domain harboring α-helix 1 in both RAR and RXR. In transient transfection experiments, TDG potentiated transactivation by RXR from a direct repeat element spaced by one nucleotide (DR1) and by RXR/RAR heterodimers from a direct repeat element spaced by five nucleotides (DR5).

Retinoic acids exert their pleiotropic effects on vertebrate development and homeostasis by binding to nuclear receptors that function as ligand-dependent transcription factors regulating the expression of target genes. These receptors belong to a gene superfamily including the receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and a growing number of the so-called orphan receptors for which no ligands have yet been found (1Gronemeyer H.

As all nuclear receptors, they share a conserved modular structure with five (RXRs) or six regions (RARs) denoted as A to E or A to F, respectively. Out of these, the central C region harboring the core of the DNA-binding domain shows the highest homology among all receptors. The C-terminal E region contains the ligand binding domain (LBD), which functions as a ligand-dependent transactivation domain (AF-2), and contains surfaces for the homo- and heterodimerization with other receptors and interaction with various cofactors. The ligand-dependent activation domain AF-2 in the E region can synergize with the ligand-independent activation domain AF-1 located in the N-terminal A/B region. RARs and RXRs bind as dimers to their response elements (RAREs) consisting of two hexameric motifs (PuG(G/A)(T/A)CA) usually arranged as direct repeats. Although RXRs can bind on their own as homodimers to direct repeat elements spaced by one nucleotide (DR1), response elements for RXR/RAR heterodimers are direct repeats with a spacing of one (DR1), two (DR2), or five nucleotides (DR5) (4Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). After binding to their response elements they modulate transcription in a promoter-specific manner by acting on the transcription machinery or through remodeling of the chromatin template. The link to the basic transcription factors and proteins involved in chromatin remodeling is most likely mediated by direct protein-protein interactions with cofactors (3Perlmann T. Evans R.M.

Using a one-hybrid screening in yeast for putative cofactors of RAR, we report here the isolation of a new splice variant of the T:G mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), which is required for the repair of methylated DNA sites. In vertebrates, DNA is most commonly modified by addition of a methyl group to the carbon 5 position in the pyrimidine ring of cytosines. Changes in 5-methylcytosine methylation patterns have been implicated in various processes such as control of gene expression (26Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), chromatin structure (27Keshet I. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Cedar H.

Methylation of cytosines is essential in vertebrates (31Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3158) Google Scholar). However, it also causes genome instability; although not more than 1% of bases are methylated cytosine in mammalian genomes, they probably cause one third of all transition mutations responsible for genetic diseases and cancer in humans (32Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 33Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2463-2467PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jones P.A. Gonzalgo M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2103-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This is due to the much higher spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine when compared with cytosine; deamination of 5-methylcytosine leads to T:G mismatches, whereas deamination of cytosine generates U:G mismatches in the DNA. The repair of U:G and T:G DNA mismatches is initiated by mismatch-specific DNA glycosylases (35Cleaver J.E. Layher S.K. Cell. 1995; 80: 825-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which excise in a first and rate-limiting step the mismatched base leaving an abasic site (AP) that is cleaved by an AP-endonuclease and deoxyphosphodiesterase to create a single nucleotide gap; this gap is then filled in by DNA polymerase-β and finally sealed by DNA ligase (36Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjørås M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). TDG was first characterized as a 55 kDa protein purified from HeLa cells (37Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that TDG was not only able to excise thymine from T:G, but also uracil from U:G DNA mismatches (38Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The cloning of the human TDG cDNA showed that this glycosylase belongs to a new class of excision repair enzymes with no significant sequence similarity to the established DNA glycosylase gene family including the U:G mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) (39Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, the gene for human TDG contains conserved regions with greater than 30% sequence identity with an E. coli gene (MUG) which was found later to encode an U:G mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase that, in contrast to the human TDG, cannot cut at T:G mismatches under physiological conditions (40Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The recently published crystal structure of the E. coli MUG, nevertheless, revealed structural and functional homologies with UNG despite of their low sequence similarity (41Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TDG was initially isolated and characterized in a yeast two-hybrid screening as a protein that can interact with the transcription factor c-Jun (42Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This interaction, together with those with RAR and RXR described here points to a possible function of TDG in transcription beyond its role in maintenance of methylated CpG sites in DNA, and provides a further link coupling transcription and DNA repair. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain BP-G5 (MATα ura3-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1::DR5 RARE-URA3) was derived from the strain PL1 (MATα ura3-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1::ERE-URA3) (43Pierrat B.

Library plasmids from positive clones were isolated and sequenced leading to the isolation of a TDG cDNA encoding the TDGb isoform. A cDNA fragment (286–2567 bp) was used as a probe to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library (10 days post coitum) for additional TDG cDNAs. A full-length mTDGa cDNA was cloned by PCR using a 5′-primer encoding the missing 8 amino acids (ATG GAC GCG GAG GCC GCG AGA AGC) and the mTDGb cDNA as a template.

Western blots were performed according to standard protocols using 50 μg of protein from whole cell extracts separated on 10% SDS gels. For dephosphorylation experiments, 25 μg of a whole cell extract from MCF7 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 units of calf thymus intestinal phosphatase (CIP) in a buffer provided by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). To avoid nonspecific degradation, leupeptin, pepstatin, aposterin, antipain, and chymostatin were added to the reactions at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, and vanadate was used at a concentration of 50 μm. For the mapping of the interaction domains in yeast, the LexA system was applied using the vectors pBTM116 (49Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) for the cloning of the LexA fusions and pASV3 (50Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R.

The expression of all LexA and VP16 fusion proteins was checked by Western blotting using anti-LexA or anti-VP16-specific antibodies (data not shown). Transient transfections in COS cells as well as CAT and β-galactosidase assays were done as described in Ref. 51Bocquel M.T. Kumar V. Stricker C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2581-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar. All transfections employed duplicate samples, and were repeated at least twice. Representative experiments are shown in the figures. In vitro binding studies using GST-tagged hRARα and mRXRα were carried out as described (11Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L.

Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed usingE. coli-expressed RARΔAB, RXRΔAB, Vaccinia virus expressed mTDGa(32–421), and 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (DR1: 5′-GGG TCA a AGG TCA-3′, DR5: 5′-AGG TCA agcttc AGG TCA-3′). The binding reaction was done in the presence of 1 μg of bovine serum albumin and protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were then submitted to non-denaturing gel electrophoresis as described (53Wahlström G.M. Sjöberg M. Andersson M. Nordström K. Vennström B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Previous studies in yeast have shown that RAR cannot efficiently induce transcription from a DR5 element without heterodimerization with RXR (54Hall B.L. McBride Z.S. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 55Heery D.M. Zacharewski T. Pierrat B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a search for additional partners allowing RAR to transactivate from such an element, the yeast strain BP-G5 harboring one DR5 element within the URA3 promoter was designed for a functional one-hybrid screening with full-length RARα as a bait and a mouse embryo (9.5 to 12.5 days post coitum) cDNA library fused to the acidic activation domain of the viral VP16 protein. Positive clones from this screening were expected not only to interact with RAR, but also to stabilize its binding to the DR5 element, thus allowing efficient RAR-mediated activation of the selection marker. Out of 30 positive clones obtained from the screening, 25 were identified as RXRs. From the five remaining clones, three encoded for another nuclear receptor, COUP-TFI (57Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocrin. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and two for TDG, which was initially cloned as a c-Jun-interacting protein (42Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The 2859-bp TDG cDNA clone obtained from the yeast screening (denoted b isoform, Fig. 1, Aand B) differs between positions 1 and 58 from the previously published sequences of TDG, here called TDG isoform a (39Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Due to these differences, the mouse TDGb cDNA lacks the codon for the starting methionine of the TDGa isoform and encodes for a truncated form of the enzyme missing the first 25 amino acids (Fig.1 B). Inasmuch as, in the TDGb cDNA, no stop codon was found in front of the first methionine (Fig. 1 A), a mouse embryo (10 days post coitum) cDNA library was screened for longer mTDG cDNAs. However, this screening did not result in the cloning of further 5′-extended TDGb cDNA. The expression of the mouse TDGa and TDGb mRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis performed with isoform-specific primers (see “Experimental Procedures”) on poly(A) mRNA from P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (data not shown). However, further Northern blot analysis using poly(A) mRNAs from various mouse adult tissues and a cDNA probe encoding a region common to the two isoforms (bp 286–2567 of TDGb cDNA) revealed only one mRNA species of ∼3 kilobases (Fig. 2 A) that was present in all tissues tested. A monoclonal anti-TDG antibody was used to analyze TDG protein levels in various monkey, mouse, and human cell lines (Fig. 2 B). TDG was detected in all tested cell lines with the lowest amount in F9 teratocarcinoma cells. In all extracts, two protein species of ≈63 kDa were revealed which comigrated with E. coli-expressed mTDGa(32–421), thus suggesting that the two species could represent TDGa and TDGb isoforms (see below). The mouse TDG was slightly larger than monkey and human TDG. In addition to the ∼63-kDa species, the antibody revealed in some extracts two slower migrating forms of the protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼90 kDa. The relative level of these species varied in different extract preparations from the same cell line, suggesting that they may represented modified forms of the enzyme. As TDG contains a number of putative kinase sites, MCF7 cell extracts were treated with CIP in the presence and absence of vanadate as a phosphatase inhibitor. In the absence of the phosphatase inhibitor, CIP converted the majority of the upper species into forms migrating with an apparent molecular mass of ∼63 kDa (Fig.2 C). To further characterize the two TDG species of ∼63 kDa, the mouse TDGa cDNA was cloned by PCR and expressed in transfected COS cells along with mTDGb cDNA. Extracts from transfected COS cells were analyzed by Western blotting together with an extract from P19 cells. Overexpressed mTDGa comigrated in this experiment with the upper species from P19 cells whereas mTDGb migrated at the level of the lower species (Fig. 2 D). Similar comigrations were also observed for the larger protein species recognized by the TDG antibody. Since P19 cells were shown to contain transcripts for the TDGa and TDGb isoforms (see above), it is likely that the two TDG protein species found in extracts of various cells correspond to TDG isoforms a and b. In all cell lines and tissues analyzed by Western blotting, these two TDG isoforms were found in similar amounts (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Full-length mTDGa was fused to the VP16 acidic activation domain (denoted AAD) and assayed for interaction with full-length RARα and RXRα fused to LexA in the yeast strain L40 which contains a lacZ reporter gene driven by eight LexA binding sites (49Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while a very weak (∼5-fold), but reproducible, increase in β-galactosidase activity was obtained by co-expressing AAD-TDGa with unfused LexA, 335- and 75-fold enhancements were observed by co-expressing AAD-TDGa with LexA-RXRα and LexA-RARα, respectively, in the absence of ligand (Fig.3 A). Addition of 9c-RA to yeast expressing LexA-RXRα and AAD-TDGa or t-RA to yeast expressing LexA-RARα and AAD-TDGa diminished by a factor of ∼2 and 3, respectively, the -fold enhancement mediated by AAD-TDGa over the AAD control (Fig. 3 A), indicating that TDGa may interact preferentially with the unliganded forms of RXRα and RARα in yeast. As a representative of the other conserved gene family of DNA glycosylases (see Introduction), the human uracil-specific U:G mismatch-specific DNA glycosylase (hUNG1) (58Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Wittwer C.U. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 59Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) was tested for its ability to interact with RXRα and RARα in yeast. Similarly to AAD-TDGa, co-expression of AAD-UNG1 with unfused LexA resulted in a weak activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3 A). However, no further stimulation was observed by co-expressing AAD-UNG1 with LexA-RXRα or LexA-RARα in either the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 3 A), indicating that, in contrast to TDGa, UNG1 does not interact with RXRα and RARα. TDG was then tested for a direct binding to RAR and RXR in vitro. GST pull-down assays using Vaccinia virus-expressed TDGa(32–421) (Fig. 3 B) or in vitro translated full-length TDGa (data not shown) and E. coli-expressed GST-RARα or RXRα fusion proteins revealed a ligand-independent interaction between TDG and the receptors. To map the interaction domains of the nuclear receptors and TDG, a deletion analysis of each protein was performed using the yeast two-hybrid system. Deletion derivatives of RXRα were expressed as fusion proteins with LexA and tested for interaction with AAD-TDGa(32–421) (Fig. 4 A). Similarly to AAD-TDGa, AAD-TDGa(32–421) interacted with RXRα in both the presence and absence of 9c-RA (Fig. 3 A and4 A). A region between residues 227 and 263 harboring the α-helix 1 (H1) of the LBD of RXRα was found to be sufficient for mediating an interaction with TDG (Fig. 4 A, seeLexA-RXRα[227–263] and AAD-TDG[32–421]). Interaction with the whole LBD of RXRα (amino acids 206–467) exhibited a 3-fold increase in the presence of 9c-RA (Fig.4 A). In view of this ligand-de"

Microglia, intrinsic cerebral immune effector cells, are likely to be key in the pathophysiology of this inflammatory state. We showed that macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a microglial activator found at increased levels in the central nervous system in AD, dramatically augments β-amyloid peptide (βAP)-induced microglial production of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide. In contrast, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, another hematopoietic cytokine found in the AD brain, did not augment βAP-induced microglial secretory activity. These results indicate that increased macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels in AD could magnify βAP-induced microglial inflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide production, which in turn could intensify the cerebral inflammatory state by activating astrocytes and additional microglia, as well as directly injuring neurons.

Neuronal injury is hypothesized to result from the direct effects of inflammatory effectors such as cytokines and activated complement, or indirect effects such as increased production of neurotoxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in response to cytokines or other inflammatory stimuli (1Mrak R.E.

This hypothesis is supported by epidemiological studies, which indicate that anti-inflammatory medications may protect against AD (3Breitner J.C. Gau B.A. Welsh K.A. Plassman B.L. McDonald W.M.

Microglia are likely to have a pivotal role in inflammatory neuronal injury in AD. As intrinsic immune effector cells of the brain, microglia are potent mediators of cerebral inflammation in a variety of disease states (8Dickson D.W. Mattiace L.A. Kure K. Hutchins K. Lyman W.D.

However, previously reported βAP-induced increases in microglial production of these factors have been of limited magnitude, on the order of only 2–5-fold greater than control levels. It is difficult to reconcile this weakin vitro microglial response to βAP with the hypothesis that βAP activation of microglia is important in AD pathophysiology. One reason for the limited response of cultured microglia to βAP may be that important costimulatory agents present in AD brain have not been taken into consideration in prior reports. The extracellular environment surrounding neuritic plaques in AD brain is rich in a variety of pro-inflammatory agents including cytokines (2Rogers J. Webster S. Lue L.-F. Brachova L. Civin W.H. Emmerling M. Shivers B. Walker D. McGeer P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 5: 681-686Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar), which are likely to augment the effects of βAP on microglia. It has been shown that interferon-γ, phorbol ester, and lipopolysaccharide all augment the effects of βAP on microglia and monocytic cells (13Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrel G.I. Otvos L. Baron P.

Results showing large synergistic increases in βAP-induced microglial activity in cultures cotreated with these agents may have no direct relevance to AD. We examined the effect of M-CSF (also called colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1)) on βAP-induced cytokine and NO production by cultured microglia. M-CSF is an important regulator of mononuclear phagocyte development and function throughout the body (17Stanley E.R. Berg K.L. Einstein D.B. Lee P.S.W. Pixley F.J. Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Mol. Reprod.

In AD brain, there is increased immunoreactivity for the M-CSF receptor (c-fms) on microglia (29Akiyama H. Nishimura T. Kondo H. Ikeda K. Hayashi Y. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), neurons in AD show labeling with M-CSF antibodies, and M-CSF levels in AD cerebrospinal fluid are 5-fold greater than in controls (7Yan S.D. Zhu H. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W. Rajavashisth T. Chen X. Godman G.C. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Thus, M-CSF represents a potent microglial activator relevant to AD pathophysiology. We hypothesized that in AD, M-CSF activates microglia to augment βAP-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and NO, which in turn promote additional inflammation and may directly injure nerve cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of combined M-CSF and βAP treatment on production of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and NO by the BV-2 immortalized murine microglial cell line. Synthetic βAP 1–40 and βAP 40–1 were purchased from Bachem California (Torrance, CA). Peptides were aggregated by resuspending at 2 mg/ml in endotoxin-free water (Sigma), holding at 4 °C for 60 h, incubating at 37 °C for 8 h with gentle mixing every 2 h, and then storing at 4 °C until use. Recombinant mouse M-CSF, recombinant mouse granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3) were purchased from R & D (Minneapolis, MN). Cytokines were resuspended in sterile tissue culture-grade phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) with 0.1% tissue culture-grade bovine serum albumin (Sigma), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until ready for use. The BV-2 immortalized microglial cell line was cultured as described previously (30Bitting L. Naidu A. Cordell B. Murphy Jr., G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BV-2 cells were detached from the substrate by gentle pipetting and reseeded at 1 × 105 cells in 500 μl of medium per well in a 48-well tissue culture dish. After an additional 24 h in culture, cells were used for experimentation by washing two times in serum-free medium and then applying fresh serum-free medium containing βAP and/or M-CSF. All treatments were performed for 24 h, after which conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 600 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and stored at −80 °C until ready for analysis. Each experiment included triplicate cultures for each treatment condition, and each experiment was replicated on separate occasions a minimum of two additional times. After harvesting conditioned medium for cytokine or NO assays, BV-2 cells were detached by trypsinization and resuspended in fresh medium. Aliquots of cells from each well were counted three times in a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion, and counts were averaged. For each treatment condition, triplicate wells were counted, and values were averaged. All cytokine and NO results were adjusted for the number of viable BV-2 cells present for each treatment condition. Mouse IL-1α and IL-6 in conditioned media were determined using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Endogen, Woburn MA). Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and values from duplicates were averaged. Means for each treatment condition were calculated, along with standard errors. To increase signal intensity, poly-horseradish peroxidase (RDI, Flanders, NJ) was substituted for streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase in the IL-1α ELISA. Absorbency at 450 nm was determined using a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA) microplate reader. Data were analyzed using the SOFTmax 2.32 program (Molecular Devices). Nitrite, an end product of NO oxidation, was used as an indicator of NO production by microglial cells (31Wishnok J.S. Glogowski J.A. Tannenbaum S.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 130-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrite in conditioned media was determined using the Griess assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Absorbency was determined at 550 nm using a Dynatech Laboratories MR700 microplate reader (Dynex, West Sussex, UK). RT-PCR was used to determine the effects of M-CSF and βAP on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in BV-2 cells. Total RNA was extracted from BV-2 cells using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of total RNA and Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) primed with random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed on cDNA using primers for mouse iNOS (32Personett D.A. Chouinard M. Sugaya K. McKinney M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 65: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and 28 cycles of PCR amplification consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. To control for differences in total RNA concentration among samples, mRNA levels for mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase were determined with RT-PCR as described previously (33Murphy G.M. Jia X.-C. Yu A.C.H. Lee Y.L. Tinklenberg J.R. Eng L.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PCR products were visualized on 2.5% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining. To demonstrate specificity of the M-CSF effect, BV-2 cells were reacted for 1 h with a monoclonal blocking antibody against the mouse M-CSF receptor, c-fms, at a concentration of 20 μg/ml (gift from Drs. R. Shadduck and G. Gilmore). This reagent has been shown previously to specifically block the effects of mouse M-CSF on macrophages (34Shadduck R.K. Waheed A. Mangan K.F. Rosenfeld C.S. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 515-520PubMed Google Scholar, 35Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Bourdon M.A. Gilmore G.L. Shadduck R.K. Muller-Sieburg C.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 2568-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sister cultures were reacted with a subclass-matched mouse IgG1 κ control antibody (Sigma) also at 20 μg/ml. After 1 h, medium was removed, and the cells were treated with 22 μm βAP 1–40 or 50 ng/ml M-CSF, or 22 μm βAP 1–40 plus 50 ng/ml M-CSF, with or without the c-fms antibody or the control antibody. After 24 h, conditioned media were harvested and cleared by centrifugation, and IL-1α was quantified using ELISA as described above. To demonstrate the expression of GM-CSF receptor α and β subunits by BV-2 cells, RT-PCR was performed on BV-2 cell total mRNA. For the α subunit, primers were designed using the Genbank cDNA sequence MUSCLNYSIM (36Park L.S. Martin U. Sorensen R. Luhr S. Morrissey P.J. Cosman D. Larsen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4295-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for the mouse GM-CSF low affinity receptor subunit. The forward primer was a 21-mer, which spanned nucleotides 508–528, whereas the reverse primer was a 21-mer spanning nucleotides 931–951. Thirty-five cycles of PCR amplification were performed consisting of 95 °C for 1 min, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, 20 s. This resulted in a PCR product of 444 bp. For the β subunit (AI2CB cDNA), the primers and PCR protocol of Fung et al. (37Fung M.-C. Mak N.-K. Leung K.-W. Hapel A.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 149: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were used, resulting in a PCR product of 325 bp. PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels using ethidium bromide staining. As a positive control for GM-CSF receptor expression, total RNA harvested from mouse bone marrow cells, which had been stimulated with 50 ng/ml GM-CSF for 24 h, was subjected to the same RT-PCR phenotyping protocol as the BV-2 cell RNA. The BV-2 immortalized microglial cell line has been extensively characterized and has many of the features of primary microglia (38Blasi E. Barluzzi I. Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Bistoni F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 27: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar,39Bocchini V. Mazzolla R. Barluzzi R. Blasi E. Sick P. Kettenmann H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), but it is devoid of immunologically active cells such as astrocytes commonly found in primary microglial cultures. Further, BV-2 cells express receptors for advanced glycation end products, which bind βAP and induce signal transduction, and BV-2 cells treated with M-CSF show chemotaxis and other indications of activation (7Yan S.D. Zhu H. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W. Rajavashisth T. Chen X. Godman G.C. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, treatment of BV-2 microglial cells for 24 h with 11 μm βAP 1–40 resulted in an increase in IL-1α production of about three times control levels (Fig.1). However, when BV-2 cells were simultaneously treated with M-CSF (25 or 50 ng/ml) and 11 μm βAP 1–40, there was a large increase in IL-1α production (approximately 70 times control levels in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 1; these results were replicated in three other independent experiments). M-CSF alone had little effect on BV-2 IL-1α production. A similar augmenting effect of βAP 1–40 and M-CSF on IL-1α production was obtained with a βAP concentration of 22 μm (Fig. 4). βAP 40–1, a reverse sequence control peptide that was prepared in the same manner as βAP 1–40, had little effect either alone or in combination with M-CSF. The augmenting effect of M-CSF on βAP-induced IL-1α production by BV-2 cells was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the mouse M-CSF receptor,c-fms (Table I), but not by a subclass-matched control antibody.Figure 4GM-CSF does not augment βAP-induced IL-1 expression by BV-2 microglia. BV-2 cells were treated for 24 h with serum-free medium alone, 22 μm βAP 1–40 plus 50 ng/ml M-CSF, or 22 μm βAP plus 10, 100, or 1000 units/ml GM-CSF. Results are expressed as the mean ratio of IL-1α in conditioned media from treated cells to that in medium from sister control cultures (with standard error of the mean). All values were adjusted for number of viable cells present in each culture well.

Simultaneous treatment of BV-2 cells with M-CSF and βAP 1–40 also induced a very large increase in IL-6 production (TableII).

However, the combination of M-CSF and βAP 1–40 (22 μm) resulted in an increase in IL-6 production by BV-2 cells that was over 200-fold greater than control values.Table IIM-CSF augments βAP-induced IL-6 production by BV-2 cellsTreatmentMean IL-6: ratio treatment to controlStandard errorMedium1.00.3βAP 1–40, 22 μm6.11.3M-CSF, 50 ng/ml2.61.1βAP 1–40, 22 μm232.746.5+(702.1 pg/ml)M-CSF, 50 ng/mlBV-2 microglia were treated in triplicate for 24 h with medium alone or medium containing 22 μM βAP 1–40, 50 ng/ml M-CSF, or 22 μM βAP plus 50 ng/ml M-CSF.

M-CSF also augmented βAP effects on NO (nitrite) production. Treatment of BV-2 cells with βAP 1–40 (11 μm) or M-CSF (50 ng/ml) alone had little effect on nitrite in conditioned medium (Fig. 2). In contrast, simultaneous treatment of BV-2 cells with βAP 1–40 and M-CSF resulted in nitrite levels in conditioned medium that were about 30-fold greater than control values. The control peptide βAP 40–1, either alone or in combination with M-CSF, had little effect on nitrite in conditioned medium. The augmenting effect of combined βAP and M-CSF treatment on microglial NO production was also detected at the mRNA level. Treatment with 22 μm βAP 1–40 in combination with 50 ng/ml M-CSF for 18 h resulted in a larger increase in iNOS mRNA than either agent alone (Fig.3). The control peptide βAP 40–1 did not augment M-CSF effects on iNOS expression.Figure 3Inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA is increased by combined treatment of BV-2 cells with βAP and M-CSF. RT-PCR products are visualized in 2.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. The 200-bp position is indicated. Cells were treated for 18 h and then harvested for total mRNA.

Whereas all conditions show approximately equal levels of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase mRNA, the βAP 1–40 plus M-CSF treatment shows a large increase in iNOS mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further test for the specificity of M-CSF in augmenting βAP effects on microglia, BV-2 cells were treated with the hematopoietic cytokine GM-CSF alone or in combination with βAP 1–40 (22 μm). Unlike M-CSF, GM-CSF did not augment βAP-induced IL-1α expression (Fig. 4). Likewise, cotreatment of BV-2 cells with βAP and the microglial activator IL-3 did not result in an increase in IL-1α production (data not shown). Although GM-CSF did not augment βAP-induced cytokine secretion by BV-2 cells, this was not because of a lack of GM-CSF receptors. RT-PCR phenotyping of BV-2 cells showed the expression of mRNAs for both the α and β subunits of the GM-CSF receptor (Fig.5). Neither M-CSF nor GM-CSF alone or in combination with βAP resulted in proliferation of BV-2 cells at the doses, cell density, and treatment duration used in the present study. At the end of a representative 24-h experiment, the mean number of control cells was 1.7 × 105/ml (S.E. = 0.2), whereas for 50 ng/ml M-CSF, the mean number was 1.5 × 105/ml (S.E. = 0.2), and for 1000 units/ml GM-CSF, the mean number was 1.3 × 105/ml (S.E. = 0.2). For M-CSF plus 11 μm βAP 1–40, the mean number of cells was 1.2 × 105/ml (S.E. = 0.2), whereas for GM-CSF plus βAP 1–40, the mean number was 1.4 × 105/ml (S.E. = 0.2). The results presented here suggest that M-CSF augments βAP-induced microglial inflammatory cytokine and NO production in AD. Simultaneous treatment of BV-2 microglia with M-CSF and βAP resulted in large synergistic increases in IL-1α, IL-6, and NO in conditioned media, which were greater than increases due to either agent alone. Interleukin-1 is expressed early in AD (41Griffin W.S.T. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7611-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 42Griffin W.S.T. Sheng J.G. Roberts G.W. Mrak R.E. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms could further augment microglia-mediated inflammation and neuronal injury in AD. Interleukin-6, another microglial cytokine (44Sebire G. Emilie D. Wallon C. Hery C. Devergne O. Delfraissy J.F. Galanaud P. Tardieu M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1517-1523PubMed Google Scholar), is also increased in AD brain (45Bauer J. Strauss S. Schreiter-Gasser U. Ganer U. Schlegel P. Witt I. Yolk B. Berger M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and in the serum of AD patients (46Singh V.K. Guthikonda P. J. Psychiatr. Res. 1997; 31: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Increased IL-6 expression may induce inflammatory changes, which injure neurons (47Heyser C.J. Masliah E. Samimi A. Campbell I.L. Gold L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1500-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). There is evidence that NO, an important inflammatory effector produced by rodent and human microglia (48Ding M. St. Pierre B.A. Parkinson J.F. Medberry P. Wong J.L. Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Merrill J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11327-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), is present at increased levels in AD brain, resulting in nitration of proteins and other abnormal cellular changes (49Smith M.A. Richey Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Beckman J.S. Perry G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2653-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results and the results of prior studies indicate that in AD there is a self-amplifying pathophysiologic cascade involving microglia, astrocytes, and neurons and the key AD cytokines M-CSF, IL-1, and IL-6 (Fig. 6). M-CSF levels are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and M-CSF antibodies label neurons in AD brain (7Yan S.D. Zhu H. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W. Rajavashisth T. Chen X. Godman G.C. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Further, expression of the M-CSF receptorc-fms is increased on microglia in AD brain (29Akiyama H. Nishimura T. Kondo H. Ikeda K. Hayashi Y. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1994; 639: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which may sensitize these cells to M-CSF effects. Astrocytes, an important source of M-CSF in the brain, can be induced to secrete M-CSF by IL-1 (20Thery C. Stanley E.R. Mallat M.J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that in AD, βAP induces microglia to secrete small amounts of IL-1, as our results and the results of others indicate (10Araujo D.M. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1992; 569: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,16Lorton D. Kocsis J.M. King L. Madden K. Brunden K.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 67: 21-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Walker D.G. Kim S.U. McGeer P.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 478-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). IL-1 then induces astrocytes to express M-CSF, which augments βAP-induced expression of IL-1 by microglia, resulting in further M-CSF expression by astrocytes. In addition, microglial IL-1 self-activates microglia via autocrine and paracrine effects. Neurons themselves may also secrete M-CSF in response to βAP (7Yan S.D. Zhu H. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W. Rajavashisth T. Chen X. Godman G.C. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), which may further activate microglia. IL-6 promotes astrogliosis (51Selmaj K.W. Farooq M. Norton W.T. Raine C.S. Brosnan C.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar) and activates microglia (47Heyser C.J. Masliah E. Samimi A. Campbell I.L. Gold L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1500-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Increased IL-6 found in AD brain could come from microglia, astrocytes, or both. Our results suggest that M-CSF and βAP would induce microglial IL-1 and IL-6 production in AD. IL-1 causes astrocytes to express IL-6 (52Benveniste E.N. Sparacio S.M. Norris J.G. Grenett H.E. Fuller G.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1990; 30: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), so microglial IL-1 induced by M-CSF and βAP would promote astroglial IL-6 expression. Through pro-inflammatory effects, IL-6 is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration in AD (47Heyser C.J. Masliah E. Samimi A. Campbell I.L. Gold L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1500-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 53Gadient R.A. Otten U.H. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Although βAP alone may increase microglial NO production (13Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrel G.I. Otvos L. Baron P. Villalba M. Ferrari D. Rossi F. Nature. 1995; 374: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 54Ii M. Sunamoto M. Ohnishi K. Ichimori Y. Brain Res. 1996; 720: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), in the presence of M-CSF βAP-induced microglial NO production is dramatically augmented. Contrary to prior findings, recent evidence indicates that human microglia can produce NO (48Ding M. St. Pierre B.A. Parkinson J.F. Medberry P. Wong J.L. Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Merrill J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11327-11335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), so results obtained with murine cells are likely to closely model the human system. Microglial NO, either directly or through its highly toxic derivative peroxynitrite, would injure neurons in AD (14Goodwin J.L. Uemura E. Cunnick J.E. Brain Res. 1995; 692: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 49Smith M.A. Richey Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Beckman J.S. Perry G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2653-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55McMillian M. Kong L.Y. Sawin S.M. Wilson B. Das K. Hudson P. Hong J.S. Bing G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NO may also induce additional IL-1 expression (56Marcinkiewicz J. Grabowska A. Chain B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 57Merrill J.E. Benveniste E.N. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), which in turn would promote astroglial M-CSF expression, ultimately resulting in further βAP-induced NO production. Astrocytes, too, produce NO, and IL-1 can induce astrocyte iNOS (58Lee S.C. Dickson D.W. Liu W. Brosnan C.F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 46: 19-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 59Vigne P. Damais C. Frelin C. Brain Res. 1993; 606: 332-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, in AD, microglial IL-1 induced by βAP and M-CSF would augment NO neurotoxicity by activating astrocyte iNOS. Finally, microglia are likely to generate neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in response to βAP (12Klegeris A. Walker D.G. McGeer P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast to M-CSF, the hematopoietic cytokines GM-CSF, present in the brain in AD (60Lee S.C. Liu W. Brosnan C.F. Dickson D.W. Glia. 1994; 12: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and IL-3 did not augment βAP-induced microglial cytokine and NO expression in our studies. Both GM-CSF and IL-3 can induce microglial activation (61Giulian D. Ingeman J.E. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the synergistic effect of M-CSF and βAP cannot be due to nonspecific microglial activation. Whereas GM-CSF and IL-3 share a common receptor subunit (βc) and elements of signal transduction (62Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the M-CSF receptor, c-fms, is distinct (63Hamilton J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 313-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Indeed, our results indicate that blockade of c-fms attenuates M-CSF augmentation of βAP effects on microglia. Differences in receptor function and signal transduction between M-CSF and other hematopoietic cytokines may account for the unique effects of M-CSF on βAP-treated microglia. The absence of an augmenting effect of GM-CSF cannot be the result of a receptor deficiency, as BV-2 cells were shown to express mRNA for both subunits of the GM-CSF receptor. M-CSF augmentation of βAP effects is not secondary to proliferation, as neither M-CSF nor GM-CSF induced BV-2 proliferation at the doses, cell density, and treatment duration we employed. In conclusion, our results indicate that M-CSF may have an important role in the pathophysiology of AD by augmenting the microglial response to βAP. Further, these results support the hypothesis that inflammatory effectors are an integral part of neuropathologic change in AD rather than being nonspecific signs of brain injury. Future studies should further clarify the relative roles of astrocytes and neurons in generating M-CSF in AD, fully phenotype microglia activated by combined M-CSF and βAP treatment, and determine the effects of microglia activated by βAP and M-CSF on neurons.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the amount of testin secreted by Sertoli cells in vitro was comparable with several other Sertoli cell secretory products. However, virtually no testin was found in the luminal fluid and cytosols of the testis and epididymis when the intercellular junctions were not previously disrupted, suggesting that secreted testin may be reabsorbed by testicular cells in vivo. Studies using Sertoli cells with and without a cell surface cross-linker and radioiodination in conjunction with immunoprecipitation illustrated the presence of two polypeptides of 28 and 45 kDa, which constitute a binding protein complex that anchors testin onto the cell surface. The 28- and 45-kDa peptide appear to be residing on and inside the cell surface, respectively. Immunogold EM studies illustrated testin was abundantly localized on the Sertoli cell side of the ectoplasmic specialization (a modified adherens junction) surrounding developing spermatids. In contrast, very few testin gold particles were found at the site of inter-Sertoli tight junctions. When the inter-Sertoli tight junctions were formed or disrupted, no significant change in testin expression was noted. This is in sharp contrast to the disruption of Sertoli-germ cell junctions, which is accompanied by a surge in testin expression. These results demonstrate the usefulness of testin in examining Sertoli-germ cell interactions. Testin is a testosterone-responsive Sertoli cell secretory product.

Testin, a testosterone-responsive glycoprotein secreted by rat Sertoli cells in vitro, consists of two highly homologous variants with an apparent Mr of 35,000 and 37,000 (1Cheng C.Y. Bardin C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12768-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheng C.Y. Grima J. Stahler M.S. Lockshin R.A. Bardin C.W. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescent microscopy and immunohistochemistry reveal that testin resides near the basal lamina of the seminiferous epithelium in most stages of the cycle, consistent with its localization at the Sertoli-germ cell junction (5Zong S.D. Bardin C.W. Phillips D. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Grima J. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Catterall J.F. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol.

However, a transient but drastic increase in testin accumulation was noted between Sertoli cells and the head of elongated spermatids at early stage VIII preceding spermiation (7Zong S.D. Zhu L.J. Grima J. Aravindan R. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), consistent with its localization at the ectoplasmic specialization, which is a modified adherens junction (see Table I). These observations suggest that testin may be a sensitive marker in examining the cellular events of Sertoli-germ cell interactions.Table IA functional classification of cell junctions in the testisI: Occluding junctions A.

It was found that testin is predominantly expressed in the gonad (6Grima J. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Catterall J.F. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We postulated that this expression correlated with the rapid turnover of intercellular junctions in the testis and ovary during germinal cell development. This hypothesis was supported by the observations that testin mRNA can also be detected in non-gonadal tissues such as pre- and neo-natal rat kidney at the time of extensive tissue restructuring due to organ growth (8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, the steady-state testin mRNA level in the ovary is high at proestrus, estrus, and metestrus, correlating with the maturation of intrafollicular ova and the eventual rupturing of the follicle at ovulation that coincides with the rapid turnover of inter-granulosa cell junctions (8Grima J.

Reprod. 1997; 56: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, testin expression was drastically reduced to an almost undetectable level at diestrus, during which functional regression of the corpora lutea occurs (8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,9Zhu L.J. Moo-Young A. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Other recent in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that testin is a sensitive marker to monitor the disruption of intercellular junctions in the testis, since the expression of testin is positively correlated to this event (8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For instance, a surge in testin expression and an intense accumulation of its protein in the cytosol of the testis are found when germ cells, mainly round and elongated spermatids, were depleted from the seminiferous epithelium by either lonidamine (8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), busulfan (2Cheng C.Y. Grima J. Stahler M.S. Lockshin R.A. Bardin C.W. J.

A brief hypotonic treatment lysing germ cells in Sertoli-germ cell cocultures, thereby disrupting the inter-Sertoli-germ cell junctions, also induced a drastic increase in testin expression by Sertoli cells (8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These studies, however, cannot distinguish whether the observed drastic increase in testin expression correlates with the disruption of inter-Sertoli tight junctions or adherens and gap junctions, which are found between Sertoli cells as well as between Sertoli and germ cells (Table I; for reviews, see Refs. 11Byers S.

Rete testis fluid was collected from rats (450 gm b.w.) by micropuncture 4 h after ligation of efferent ducts while rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg b.w., intraperitoneal) as described (15Howards S.S.

The use of animals for studies described in this report was approved by the Rockefeller University Institution Animal Care and Use Committee with Protocol Numbers 94–132, 95–129, 95–29-R1, and 97–117. Primary Sertoli cells were prepared from 20-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (6Grima J. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Catterall J.F. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All the experiments using Sertoli cell-enriched cultures reported in this paper were derived from 20-day-old rats unless otherwise specified. Cells were plated at a density of 4.5 × 106 cells/9 ml/100-mm dish (about 5 × 104 cells/cm2) in serum-free Ham's F12 nutrient mixture/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (F12/DMEM, 1:1, v/v) supplemented with insulin (10 μg/ml), human transferrin (5 μg/ml), bacitracin (5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml) and incubated at 35 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 (v/v). About 48 h after plating, cultures were hypotonically treated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2.5 min to lyse residual germ cells (17Galdieri M. Ziparo E. Palombi F. Russo M.A. Stefanini M. J. Androl. 1981; 5: 249-259Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar) to obtain Sertoli cell cultures with greater than 95% purity. Cells were washed twice with F12/DMEM, and the cells were allowed to recover for an additional 24 h before their use. Under these conditions, specialized tight junctions were not formed when assessed by various criteria as described previously (4Grima J. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of anti-testin IgG or [Ca2+] depletion on the inter-Sertoli tight junction, primary Sertoli cells isolated as described above from 20-day-old rats were cultured at high cell density to allow the establishment of specialized junctions. Briefly, about 2 × 106 cells/cm2 were plated on MatrigelTM (1:8)-coated HA filters in the apical chamber of a bicameral unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (4Grima J. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To assess the formation of tight junctions, TER across the Sertoli cell columnar monolayer was quantified using a Millicell electrical resistance system. Briefly, current was passed through the epithelial monolayer between two silver-silver chloride electrodes. Resistance was calculated from the change in voltage across the monolayer induced by a short (∼2 s) 20-μA pulse of current. The resistance was multiplied by the surface area of the filter to yield the areal resistance in ohms/cm2. The net value of electrical resistance was then computed by subtracting the background, which was measured on Matrigel-coated cell-free chambers, from values of Sertoli cell-plated chambers. Disruption of the tight junctions were achieved by incubating the Sertoli cell monolayer in [Ca2+]-free F12/DMEM for 15 min as described (14Gumbiner B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), which is manifested by a drastic decline in TER. Thereafter, cells were returned to [Ca2+]-containing F12/DMEM with or without anti-testin IgG or normal rabbit serum IgG (200 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature with gentle rocking and then returned to 35 °C for the re-establishment of the tight junction as described previously (14Gumbiner B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Disruption and reformation of the tight junction was assessed by TER measurement. IgG was purified from decomplemented sera (56 °C for 30 min) by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE chromatography as described previously (18Cheng C.Y. Mathur P.P. Grima J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Each time point contained triplicate cultures, and each experiment was repeated at least three times using different batches of cells. Primary cultures of Sertoli cells from 35- and 90-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared essentially as described previously (19Wright W.W. Zabluoff S.D. Erickson-Lawrence M. Karzai A.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 564: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in F12/DMEM supplemented with various factors as described for immature Sertoli cells (see above) and plated at approximately 4.5 × 106 cells/9 ml/100-mm dish and cultured for 2 days at 35 °C with 95% air, 5% CO2. Thereafter, cells were hypotonically treated to remove the residual germ cells (17Galdieri M. Ziparo E. Palombi F. Russo M.A. Stefanini M. J. Androl. 1981; 5: 249-259Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The resulting cell purity was about 85% when judged microscopically, and these cells were used for RNA extraction after 4 days in culture to compare the basal steady-state testin mRNA level between Sertoli cells isolated from rats of different ages. Total germ cells were isolated from 90-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat (about 300 gm b.w.) testes by a mechanical procedure without any enzymatic treatment as detailed elsewhere (20Aravindan G.R. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These cell preparations consisted largely of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids with a relative percentage of 16:19:65 when verified by microscopic examination and DNA flow cytometry as described (20Aravindan G.R. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,21Pineau C. Syed V. Bardin C.W. Jegou B. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1993; 14: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). Virtually all elongated spermatids were removed in the glass wool filtration step (20Aravindan G.R. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Germ cells were cultured at a density of 22.5 × 106 cells/9 ml of F12/DMEM supplemented with sodium dl-lactate (6 mm) and sodium pyruvate (2 mm) in 100-mm dishes for 20 h at 35 °C to obtain germ cell-conditioned medium (GCCM) as described (20Aravindan G.R. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Pineau C. Syed V. Bardin C.W. Jegou B. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1993; 14: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar) or used immediately after their isolation for binding and coculture experiments. These cells were largely free of somatic cell contamination when assessed by various criteria as detailed elsewhere (20Aravindan G.R. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of germ cells on Sertoli cell testin expression, primary Sertoli cells isolated from 20-day-old rats were plated at 5 × 104cells/cm2 and cultured for 2 days; thereafter, cells were hypotonically treated to remove contaminating germ cells (17Galdieri M. Ziparo E. Palombi F. Russo M.A. Stefanini M. J. Androl. 1981; 5: 249-259Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar) (day 0). Cells were then cultured for an additional 24 h (day 1), washed once, and cultured for 3 additional days (day 4) to ensure that the testin steady-state mRNA level had returned to base line since the culture procedure per se can induce damage on the intercellular junctions, which is a potent stimulator of testin expression (8Grima J. Zhu L. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6499-6509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thereafter, different amounts of germ cells using a Sertoli:germ cell ratio of 1:2.5, 1:5, and 1:10 were added to Sertoli cells and cultured for an additional 20 h (day 5). It must be noted that under these conditions, specialized junctions between Sertoli and germ cells had not yet formed, since their formation would require at least 24–48 h in culture (22Enders G.C. Millette C.F. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cameron D.F. Muffly K.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 623-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before their termination, cultures were subjected to a hypotonic treatment to lyse germ cells 20 min before the addition of RNA STAT-60TM for RNA extraction to eliminate RNA contributed by germ cells in the sample to be analyzed. As such, the RNA that were examined in this experiment were largely derived from Sertoli cells. To assess the effect of the disruption of Sertoli-germ cell junctions, some cocultures that had incubated for 30 h (day 5) were subjected to a hypotonic treatment on day 5 that was 24 h before their termination on day 6. Control dishes were Sertoli-germ cell cocultures incubated until day 6 without hypotonic treatment on day 5 but subjected to a hypotonic treatment 20 min before termination to eliminate RNA contributed by germ cells in the sample to be analyzed. To assess the effect of germ cells or GCCM on the synthesis and secretion of testin by immature Sertoli cells in vitro, Sertoli cells were prepared at a density of 4.5 × 106cells/9 ml/100-mm dish as described above. Twenty four h after the hypotonic treatment, germ cells (10 × 106 cells/dish) or GCCM (10 μg of protein/dish) were added and cocultured with Sertoli cells for 18 h in F12/DMEM containing 1/100th of the normal methionine concentration. The cells were then pulse-labeled for 15 min with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine per dish and subsequently washed three times to remove any remaining [35S]methionine. At specified time points, media and cells were harvested and stored at −20 °C until used. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (4Grima J. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In one set of control experiments (Con 1), Sertoli cells were cultured alone without germ cells or GCCM and immunoprecipitated with the testin antibody at specified time points. In other controls (Con 2), Sertoli cells were cultured alone but immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum to assess the specificity of the testin antibody. Samples were resolved onto 10% T polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures or tissues using RNA STAT-60TM as described previously (6Grima J.

Reprod. 1994; 50: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously using a α-32P-labeled testin cDNA probe by nick translation (6Grima J. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Catterall J.F. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for hybridization. To ensure that equal amounts of RNA were loaded into each lane, some blots were rehybridized with a α-32P-labeled β-actin cDNA probe (6Grima J. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Catterall J.F. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and data were normalized after densitometric scanning analysis. Recent studies have shown that glycerol can induce permanent damage of the blood-testis barrier and inhibit spermatogenesis by disrupting the inter-Sertoli cell tight junction near the basal lamina within 2 weeks after glycerol administration (25Eng F. Wiebe J.P. Alima L.H. J. Andol. 1994; 15: 311-317PubMed Google Scholar). As such, we seek to examine if there is any change in testin expression when the tight junctions between Sertoli cells are disrupted 2 weeks after glycerol treatment and to examine the changes of testin expression when germ cells are later depleted. A 20% glycerol solution was prepared in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and used to induce intercellular junction damage in the testis after intratesticular injection as described (25Eng F. Wiebe J.P. Alima L.H. J. Andol. 1994; 15: 311-317PubMed Google Scholar). Adult Sprague-Dawley rats approximately 90 days of age (about 250–300 gm b.w.) were used. Animals were anesthetized with MetofaneR before treatment. Control and test animals received 200 μl of PBS or 20% glycerol solution by intratesticular injection through the polar axis of each testis, respectively. Four to six rats were used per treatment group and rats were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation at specified time points. Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (6Grima J. Zhu L.J. Zong S.D. Catterall J.F. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Biol.

Bardin C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21386-21393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified testin isolated from SCCM as described previously (2Cheng C.Y. Grima J. Stahler M.S.

For binding experiments, Sertoli cells were plated in 12-well dishes at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/well/ml F12/DMEM. These cells were used on day 3. Cells were washed three times with F12/DMEM containing 1% BSA. Approximately 1 × 106cpm of 125I-testin were added per well in duplicate with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled testin and incubated at 35 or 4 °C for several different time points. Cells were then washed three times in F12/DMEM containing 1% BSA (w/v) to remove unbound125I-testin. Cells were solubilized in 1 m NaOH for radioactivity determination. Specific binding was determined from the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding (in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled testin). Radioactivity in solubilized cell extracts was determined in a Packard Cobra II γ-counter. Primary monolayer cultures of Sertoli cells were prepared from 20-day-old rats as described above and plated at a density of 4.5 × 106 cells/9 ml/100-mm dish. Four days after hypotonic treatment, Sertoli cells were washed twice with media and incubated with 5 × 106 cpm 125I-testin/5 ml of F12/DMEM for 4 h at 35 °C. Cells were washed three times with fresh media and scraped off in PBS containing 2 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide to inhibit protease activity. Cell membranes were disrupted by repeated freeze-thawing. Membranes were pelleted for 15 min at 12,000 × g and washed three times to remove residual cytosolic proteins. The membranes were then solubilized with 100 μl of corresponding buffer and heated at 100 °C for 10 min, and testin was visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. The membrane solubilization buffers consisted of 20 mm Tris containing 1.6% 2-mercaptoethanol with or without 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, or 1% Nonidet P-40. All buffers were adjusted to pH 6.8 at 22 °C. Extracellular matrix (ECM) was the remaining amorphous substances in the dishes used for membrane preparation as described previously (52Bradley R.S. Brown A.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was extracted with the same buffers as described above by heating at 100 °C for 10 min. Sertoli cells were cultured at high cell density (0.75 × 106 cells/cm2) on Matrigel (1:5 diluted with F12/DMEM)-coated dishes as described (4Grima J. Pineau C. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2007008313,"The metabolism of Krebs cycle intermediates is of fundamental importance for eukaryotic cells. In the kidney, these intermediates are transported actively into epithelial cells. Because citrate is a potent inhibitor for calcium stone formation, excessive uptake results in nephrolithiasis due to hypocitraturia. We report the cloning and characterization of a rat kidney dicarboxylate transporter (SDCT1). In situ hybridization revealed that SDCT1 mRNA is localized in S3 segments of kidney proximal tubules and in enterocytes lining the intestinal villi. Signals were also detected in lung bronchioli, the epididymis, and liver. When expressed inXenopus oocytes, SDCT1 mediated electrogenic, sodium-dependent transport of most Krebs cycle intermediates (Km = 20–60 μm), including citrate, succinate, α-ketoglutarate, and oxaloacetate. Of note, the acidic amino acids l- and d-glutamate and aspartate were also transported, although with lower affinity (Km = 2–18 mm). Transport of citrate was pH-sensitive. At pH 7.5, the Km for citrate was high (0.64 mm), whereas at pH 5.5, theKm was low (57 μm). This is consistent with the concept that the −2 form of citrate is the transported species. In addition, maximal currents at pH 5.5 were 70% higher than those at pH 7.5, and our data show that the −3 form acts as a competitive inhibitor. Simultaneous measurements of substrate-evoked currents and tracer uptakes under voltage-clamp condition, as well as a thermodynamic approach, gave a Na+to citrate or a Na+ to succinate stoichiometry of 3 to 1. SDCT1-mediated currents were inhibited by phloretin. This plant glycoside also inhibited the SDCT1-specific sodium leak in the absence of substrate, indicating that at least one Na+ binds to the transporter before the substrate.

Radiotracer studies revealed that the cotransport process exhibits a stoichiometry of 2–3 sodium ions/dicarboxylate molecule (2Wright S.H. Kippen I. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1773-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hirayama B. Wright E.M. Pfluegers. Arch. 1986; 407: 174-179Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Fukuhara Y. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F374-F381PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, experiments with a voltage-sensitive dye showed that the cotransport was electrogenic (14Jorgensen K.E. Kragh-Hansen U. Roigaard-Petersen H. Sheikh M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F686-F695PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schell R.E. Wright E.M. J. Physiol. 1985; 360: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which favors a 3:1 stoichiometry.In BLMV, succinate transport was pH-sensitive and with high affinity (Km = ∼10 μm; Refs. 12Wright S.H.

Pfluegers Arch. 1984; 401: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and citrate uptake was hardly pH-sensitive (12Wright S.H. Wunz T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F432-F439PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that both divalent and trivalent citrate can be transported. The functional differences between BBMV and BLMV transport suggest that there exist different transporter isoforms on the apical and basolateral sides. Also, a possible presence of a trivalent citrate transport system in the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule cell line from opossum kidney was proposed (9Law D. Hering-Smith K.S. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C220-C225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Citrate transport in the proximal tubule is of considerable interest because it has several implications for the kidney function. Citrate is metabolized by the kidney via the intramitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, and this process provides up to 10–15% of renal oxidative metabolism (18Nieth H. Schollmeyer P. Nature. 1966; 209: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Baruch S.B. Burich R.L. Eun C.K. King V.F. Med. Clin. N. Am. 1975; 59: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Urinary citrate is a potent inhibitor of calcium stone formation by chelating calcium and inhibiting precipitation of calcium and crystallization of calcium-oxalate crystals (20Pak C.Y.C. Miner. Electrolyte. Metab. 1987; 13: 257-266PubMed Google Scholar). Hypocitraturia is found in about half of patients with renal stone diseases (21Nicar M.J. Skurla C. Sakhaee K. Pak C.Y. Urology. 1983; 21: 8-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Low urinary citrate levels are found in many conditions associated with decreases either in intraluminal or intracellular pH in the proximal tubules (i.e. systemic acidosis) or with potassium depletion. These conditions are known to increase citrate reabsorption (6Simpson D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F223-F234PubMed Google Scholar, 22Adler S. Zett B. Anderson B. J. Lab. Clin.

Interestingly, hypocitraturia may be found without apparent cause (idiopathic), but the underlying mechanism is still undetermined (24Asplin J.R. Favus M.J. Coe F.L. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 5th Ed.

The expression of these cloned cotransporters in Xenopus oocytes allowed kinetic analyses under steady-state and presteady-state conditions and, in contrast to vesicle studies, with excellent control of membrane potential, external milieu, and in some cases internal milieu.

https://openalex.org/W2077119518,"Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a potent stimulator of adipocyte triacylglycerol storage. In vivostudies have shown that ASP production by adipocytes increases locally after a fat meal. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated increased production of ASP in the presence of chylomicrons (CHYLO). The present aim was to define the CHYLO component responsible. None of the apoproteins tested (AI, AII, AIV, CI, CII, CIII, and E) were capable of stimulating C3 (the precursor protein) or ASP production. Rather, the active component is a nonlipid, loosely associated, trypsin-sensitive molecule. High pressure liquid chromatography fractionation of the CHYLO infranate proteins identified the critical protein as transthyretin (TTR), which binds retinol-binding protein and complexes thyroxine and retinol. Addition of TTR alone, with lipid emulsion, or with respun CHYLO to human differentiated adipocytes had little effect on C3 and ASP production. By contrast, when transthyretin was added to CHYLO, C3 and ASP production were substantially enhanced up to 75- and 7.5-fold respectively, compared with the effect of native CHYLO alone. Finally, a polyclonal antibody against TTR could inhibit stimulation of C3 and ASP production by CHYLO (by 98 and 100%, respectively) and by CHYLO infranate proteins (by 99 and 94%, respectively). We hypothesize that TTR mediates the transfer of the active components from CHYLO to adipocytes, which then stimulates increased C3 and ASP production. Thus the CHYLO provides the physiologic trigger of the ASP pathway."

We report that purified recombinant SERP-1 forms SDS-stable complexes with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasmin, thrombin, and factor Xa. N-terminal sequencing confirmed Arg319-Asn320 as the site of reaction. Mutation of these residues to Ala-Ala abolished inhibitory activity but had no effect on the specific cleavage at Thr315-Leu316 seen with elastase and with cathepsin G. Kinetic analysis of the reactions with uPA, tPA, plasmin, thrombin, Xa, and C1s showed second-order rate constants to vary over 3 logs, from kinh = 3 × 105m−1 s−1 with thrombin to ∼600m−1 s−1 with C1s, while steady-state inhibition constants ranged from KI = 10 pm with thrombin to ∼100 nm with C1s. Stoichiometries of inhibition varied between SI = 1.4 ± 0.1 for uPA to SI = 13 ± 3 for thrombin. Analysis of the variations in inhibition kinetics shows that when serpins act at low concentrations, comparable with the target protease or with KI (as appears likely for SERP-1in vivo), inhibitory specificity becomes less dominated bykinh and is increasingly dependent on partitioning within the branched reaction mechanism and on the lifetime of the inhibited complex.

Serpins comprise a conserved superfamily of single-chain proteins that is widely distributed in nature. Almost all serpin family members have activity as inhibitors of serine proteinases, and serpins have been shown to serve in the regulation of a variety of proteinase-mediated processes including extracellular matrix remodeling, modulation of inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, complement activation, and blood coagulation (1Rubin H. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 632-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At least 90 naturally occurring serpin mutations have been associated with human disease (2Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Given the critical role that proteinases and serpins play in the maintenance of homeostasis, it is not surprising that certain parasitic organisms use serpins to disrupt host processes that would otherwise be antagonistic to the parasite's survival. Several filarial parasites have been reported to express serpins (3Yenbutr P. Scott A.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ghendler Y. Arnon R. Fishelson Z. Exp.

Viroceptors, Virokines and Related Immune Modulators Encoded by DNA Viruses. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995: 67-88Google Scholar). Myxoma virus, a leporipoxvirus, expresses SERP-1, the only known virus-encoded serpin that is secreted from infected cells (7Nash P. Lucas A. McFadden G. Church F. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins. Plenum Press, New York1997: 195-205Google Scholar, 8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Infection with myxoma virus produces a rapidly lethal disease state in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) known as myxomatosis (9Fenner F. Ratcliffe F.N. Myxomatosis. Cambridge University Press, London1965Google Scholar, 10Fenner F. Meyers K. Kurstok E. Maramorosch K. Viruses and the Environment. Academic Press, Inc., New York1978: 539-570Google Scholar), a characteristic feature of which is the specific down-regulation of host inflammatory and immune responses (11McFadden G. Graham K. Ellison K. Barry M. Macen J. Schreiber M. Mossman K. Nash P. Lalani A. Everett H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Myxoma virus causes severe immune dysregulation, which disrupts the ability of the infected host to combat the infection; morbidity is generally the result of supervening Gram-negative infections, since the immunocompromised host is unable to counteract even routine bacterial assault. No single viral protein appears sufficient to cause this degree of immunodysfunction; rather, it is through the combined action of an array of secreted and intracellular factors that the virus accomplishes this task (12). Interest in SERP-1 arose from its identification as the first virus-encoded serpin to be among these virulence factors. The secretion of SERP-1 from infected cells serves to dampen the in vivoinflammatory response to myxoma virus infection, and gene knockout analysis revealed greater inflammation, more rapid resolution of the infection, and a consequent attenuation of virulence upon infection of immunocompetent host animals (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Upton C. Macen J.L. Wishart D.S. McFadden G. Virology. 1990; 179: 618-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that SERP-1 contributes to viral pathogenesis by interacting with and inhibiting host proteins involved in the regulation of inflammation. Purified SERP-1 expressed from recombinant vaccinia virus has been tested in inflammatory models for restenosis following balloon angioplasty (14Lucas A. Liu L. Macen J.L. Nash P.D. Dai E. Stewart M.

Rheum. 1996; 23: 878-882PubMed Google Scholar) and in both cases proved to be effective at reducing localized inflammation at very low levels of SERP-1 protein. SERP-1 is the product of a gene located within the terminal inverted repeat region of the myxoma genome (16Block W. Upton C. McFadden G. Virology. 1985; 140: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and thus is present in two copies (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The expressed gene product is a secreted,N-glycosylated protein with a predicted molecular mass of 39.9 kDa, although the mature glycoprotein migrates as a diffuse band of 50–55 kDa on SDS-PAGE. A preliminary survey of the inhibitory properties SERP-1 using unfractionated supernatants from myxoma virus-infected cells has been reported by Lomas et al. (17Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Upton C.

Boswell D.R. Barrett A. Salvesen G. Protease Inhibitors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 403-420Google Scholar, 21Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The branched kinetic mechanism in Scheme FS1 has been proposed to account for currently available data on the mechanism of serpin action (22Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Schapira M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1994; 20: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 22: 210-225Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A key feature of this mechanism is that it includes an intermediate, [EI], which can partition to react either through hydrolysis to release free enzyme, E, and cleaved serpin, I', or alternatively by undergoing a major conformational change leading to the formation of a highly stabilized covalent inhibited complex, EI* (23Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 22: 210-225Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24Engh R.A. Huber R. Bode W. Schulze A.J.

Biol. 1997; 4: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The structural rearrangement that produces EI* is accompanied by insertion of a portion of the cleaved RCL into β-sheet A of the serpin structure (26Huntington J.A. Fan B. Karlsson K.E. Deinum J. Lawrence D.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5432-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and results in a large increase in stability (27Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This substantial conformational rearrangement has been suggested to distort the geometry of key residues in the active site of the proteinase and to thereby decrease the ability of the enzyme to achieve its release from the serpin through enzyme-catalyzed deacylation (28Rubin H. Plotnick M. Wang Z.M. Liu X. Zhong Q. Schechter N.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7627-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dissociation of EI* to give active enzyme plus cleaved serpin is typically extremely slow (29O'Malley K. Nair S. Rubin H. Cooperman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). reactive center loop tissue-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator human neutrophil elastase stoichiometry of inhibition 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate 4-methylumbelliferone Tris-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis baby green monkey kidney epithelial cell line 3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography fast protein liquid chromatography. The range of proteinases inhibited under a given set of experimental conditions has been established for many serpins, and in numerous cases the kinetics of interaction with one or more proteinase targets have been investigated. However, relatively little attention has been paid to determining which steps in the mechanism contribute to inhibitory specificity. The relative lack of emphasis on this issue may be due to the fact that many of the earliest and most thoroughly investigated serpins are those found in the blood. These serpins typically circulate at concentrations that are orders of magnitude above their IC50 for interacting with target proteinases, such that specificity is governed almost entirely by relative on-rates. However, serpins such as SERP-1 or inhibitors of caspases and other intracellular targets, may act at much lower concentrations in vivo. Under these conditions, the possibility exists that other steps in the mechanism might influence whether or not a particular proteinase will be subject to effective inhibition by a given serpin. In this report, we describe the purification to homogeneity of wild type SERP-1 and of a R319A/N320A double mutant in which the predicted P1-P1′ residues in the RCL are changed to alanine, expressed using a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. Both purified wild type SERP-1 and R319A/N320A were tested against a panel of proteinases for their ability to form SDS-resistant complexes or to be cleaved at the RCL. We also describe a detailed kinetic study of the reactions of SERP-1 with a panel of six proteinases that were inhibited by the serpin, using the techniques of slow binding inhibition kinetics and inhibition titrations. We interpret the results of these studies in terms of the contributions that specific steps in the inhibition mechanism make toward controlling the inhibitory specificity of SERP-1. The human enzymes plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, cathepsin G, C1s, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA, two-chain form), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA, low molecular weight form) were obtained from Sigma, as were thermolysin, subtilisin, and bovine chymotrypsin. Human neutrophil elastase (hNE), cathepsin G, and C1s were supplied by Calbiochem. Complement factor D was a generous gift of Fred Taylor of Biogen, Inc. The complement proteins factor B and C3, used for the generation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, were obtained from Quidel (San Diego, CA). Polyacryalamide gels were from Novex (San Diego, CA). Proteinase substrates Chromozym-TRY, Chromozym-TPA, Chromozym-TH, Chromozym-U, and Chromozym-X were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, andd-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroaniline was obtained from Sigma. The complete SERP-1 gene, including the signal sequence, was inserted into the thymidine kinase locus of vaccinia virus strain WR under the control of a strong, synthetic late promoter by homologous recombination as described (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), in order to produce a recombinant virus termed VV-S1. At late times (>8 h) after infection of BGMK cells with VV-S1 virus, SERP-1 accumulated as a stable glycoprotein in the culture supernatant. Expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-SERP-1 serum. At 20 h postinfection, the supernatant was collected, and SERP-1 was purified as described below. Reactive center mutant SERP-1, designated R319A/N320A, was produced using the U.S.E. mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SERP-1 in the p22MAP B/H-8 vector (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5′-ATCGCCGTGAGGGCGGCCGCGGGGATGAGGGTGAT-3′, which corresponds to a sequence change in the codons responsible for the P1 and P1′ residues from Arg319-Asn320 to Ala319-Ala320. The resulting mutant was confirmed by sequencing, and a 1344-base pairBamHI/BglII fragment containing the complete open reading frame was then ligated into the BamHI site of pMJ601 (30Davidson A.J. Moss B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4285-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This pMJ-S1AA construct allowed insertion of the mutant SERP-1 gene into the thymidine kinase gene of vaccinia virus under the control of a strong, synthetic late promoter using previously described methods (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Expression of the R319A/N320A protein from the recombinant vaccinia virus, designated VV-S1AA, was confirmed by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-SERP-1 antiserum (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BGMK cells (2 × 108 cells) were adsorbed with VV-S1 or VV-S1AA at a multiplicity of infection of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell for 2 h at 37 °C in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 50 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline to remove medium and serum proteins. Serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (15 ml) was added to each bottle, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 20 h at 37 °C. The culture supernatant was collected, spun at 5000 ×g to pellet cells and cell debris, and stored at −20 °C. The medium containing secreted viral proteins was concentrated approximately 50-fold using an Amicon pressure cell equipped with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane and was then dialyzed against 25 mmTris, pH 8.0 at 4 °C using Spectrapore dialysis tubing with a 30-kDa molecular weight cut-off. The dialyzed samples were spun at 14,000 × g to remove precipitates, loaded onto a MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–300 mm NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing SERP-1 were identified by immunoblotting using anti-SERP-1 antiserum (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), pooled, and concentrated to 1 ml using Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon). This material was further purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (150 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Fractions were collected and analyzed for SERP-1 by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining and immunoblotting using anti-SERP-1 antiserum (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SERP-1 (180 nm) was incubated with a slight molar excess of each proteinase for the times indicated in a total reaction volume of 10 μl (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Control experiments established that both SERP-1 and the proteinases are stable under these conditions. Reactions were quenched by boiling for 5 min in SDS-loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and 2% SDS. Samples were separated on a 4–20% linear gradient or 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) using the Laemmli buffer system (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Hybond C-extra (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) nitrocellulose by electroblotting; blots were blocked in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 25 mmTric-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for >2 h; and SERP-1 was detected by incubating for 1 h with 0.05% (v/v) polyclonal rabbit anti-SERP-1 antiserum (8Macen J.L. Upton C. Nation N. McFadden G. Virology. 1993; 195: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in blocking buffer. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was applied for 1 h. Immunoreactive SERP-1 species were visualized using ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on Eastman Kodak Co. x-ray detection type film. Reactions that showed complete cleavage of SERP-1 by the proteinase, with no evidence of the formation of a stable SERP-1-enzyme complex, were repeated with shorter incubation times in order to see whether reactions proceeded via a transient inhibited complex. Reactions in which the serpin appeared unchanged at the end of the incubation period were repeated at higher enzyme concentrations and for longer incubation periods. The position at which SERP-1 becomes cleaved upon treatment with thrombin, cathepsin G, or human neutrophil elastase was determined by N-terminal sequencing of the 5-kDa C-terminal cleavage fragment of SERP-1, according to Hewicket al. (32Hewick R.M. Hunkapillar M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 pmol of SERP-1 was digested to completion by thrombin, cathepsin G, or hNE. The C-terminal fragment of SERP-1 was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems) by semidry eletroblotting (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining, and the 5-kDa band corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of SERP-1 was excised from the blot, washed in 50% HPLC grade methanol/water, and air-dried. The excised membrane was loaded onto an Applied Biosystems (ABI) model 470A gas phase sequencer, and the resulting phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were analyzed on-line using an ABI 120A analyzer equipped with a phenylthiohydantoin C18 2.1 × 220-mm column. Data were analyzed using ABI 610A software. Plasmin, thrombin, and uPA were standardized by active site titration according to method A of Jameson et al. (33Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S.A. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme was added at a final concentration of 10–60 nm to a stirred quartz cuvette containing 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB; 0.8–2.0 μm) in a total volume of 2.5 ml (100 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, 25 °C). The molar concentration of active enzyme was determined from the magnitude of the burst in 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) formation upon addition of the enzyme, converted to molar units by reference to a standard curve for 4-MU fluorescence measured under identical conditions. Control experiments showed that the size of the burst was directly proportional to the final concentration of each enzyme. Concentrations of active enzyme in each stock solution were determined from the mean of at least three measurements. Individual measurements differed from the mean by ≤3% for uPA and plasmin and by ≤8% for thrombin. Factor Xa reacted with MUGB too slowly to allow this method to be used, so a concentrated incubation method (method B of Jameson et al. (33Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S.A. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar)) was used for this enzyme. This involved incubating 15, 30, or 40 μl of a factor Xa stock solution (∼5 μm) with 10 μl of aqueous MUGB solution (0.2 mm) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl (final buffer: 80 mm Tris-Cl, 80 mm NaCl, 1.6 mmCaCl2, and 0.004% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, 25 °C). Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at 15-min intervals and diluted to a total volume of 2.5 ml in a quartz fluorescence cuvette (100 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, and 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, 25 °C). The concentration of active factor Xa was determined by fluorometric measurement of the concentration of 4-MU released by reaction with the enzyme, extrapolated to zero reaction time and corrected for the background hydrolysis of MUGB by subtraction of the 4-MU fluorescence seen in a background reaction containing 0.2 mm MUGB but no enzyme. We estimate a precision of ±6% for these measurements. Neither tPA nor C1s reacted suitably with MUGB to allow standardization of these two enzymes with this reagent. The concentration of purified SERP-1 was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 32,700m−1 cm−1. This value was measured using mammalian cell-derived recombinant SERP-1 with an identical amino acid sequence. 2M. McKay, unpublished data. The experimentally determined extinction coefficient was within 5% of that calculated from the amino acid sequence according to the method of Gill and von Hippel (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Estimates of Km for the reaction of each enzyme with the appropriate chromogenic substrate were determined directly under the conditions used for the slow binding inhibition experiments. Km values for the reactions of uPA with Chromozym-U, tPA with Chromozym-tPA, C1s with Chromozym-TRY, thrombin with Chromozym TH, and factor Xa with Chromozym X were found to be 140 μm, 160 μm, 1.5 mm, 22 μm, and 510 μm, respectively. Inhibition progress curves were obtained by incubating a limiting concentration of proteinase (5–125 pm) with various concentrations of SERP-1 from 0.125 to 100 nm in the presence of the appropriate chromogenic substrate. In all cases, serpin was present at ≥10-fold excess over proteinase in order to achieve pseudo-first-order conditions with respect to SERP-1, and concentrations of enzyme and substrate were chosen so that ≤10% of the substrate was hydrolyzed over the entire duration of the assay. Reactions were performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 800 μl (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) in plastic cuvettes sealed with Parafilm. The time-dependent inhibition of each enzyme by SERP-1 was monitored by following the rate of production ofp-nitroaniline at 405 nm at 1- or 5-min intervals for a period of 1000 min, using a CARY 3E spectrophotometer equipped with a six-cell cuvette holder. Each set of six reactions comprised five reactions containing various concentrations of SERP-1 and one control reaction containing enzyme and substrate with no SERP-1. In the [SERP-1] = 0 controls, progress curves were observed to be linear, indicating that the enzyme activity was stable over the course of the reaction. For each enzyme, two to five sets of measurements spanning at least six different concentrations of SERP-1 were used to calculate the kinetic constants. The reactions were allowed to proceed until the steady state velocity of p-nitroaniline formation was attained, and the progress curves for each reaction were then fitted to the integrated rate equation for slow binding inhibition (Equation 1) (35Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stone S.R. Hermans J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in which At is the absorbance at 405 nm at time t, due to the evolution of p-nitroaniline; kobs is the apparent first-order rate constant for the inhibition of enzyme by SERP-1; vi andvs are the initial and steady-state velocities for reaction of the chromogenic substrate; and d is the initial absorbance at 405 nm. At=vst+vi−vskobs1−e−kobst+dEquation 1 Values for vi, vs, andkobs were obtained for the progress curves measured at each SERP-1 concentration using nonlinear regression analysis (DeltaGraph 3.5). Rate constants for the release of active enzyme from the enzyme-SERP-1 inhibited complex, kd, were measured by preincubating proteinase and SERP-1 together at high concentration (10–100 nm) and diluting the resulting inhibited complex 50-fold into a slow binding inhibition assay containing the appropriate chromogenic substrate. Reactivation of the enzyme was monitored by following the absorbance at 405 nm until the new steady state was reached. Progress curves were fitted to Equation1, for which kobs = kd. The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) was measured for the reactions of SERP-1 with uPA, plasmin, thrombin, and Xa using a method similar to that of Patstonet al. (37Patston P.A. Gettins P. Beechem J. Schapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Accurately known, fixed concentrations of each proteinase were incubated with SERP-1 at various molar ratios in a total reaction volume of 25 or 30 μl (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, 37 °C). For each proteinase, a control reaction was included that contained no SERP-1. Enzymes were used at the following concentrations: uPA and plasmin, 40 nm; thrombin, 5 nm; Xa, 16.7 nm. Reactions were incubated for 1 h, except for the slower reaction with Xa, for which a 10-h incubation was required for complete reaction. In all cases, control experiments at longer reaction times were performed to show that reaction was complete and that incubation under these conditions did not cause any significant loss of activity in the enzyme only control. At the end of the incubation period, residual proteinase activity was determined in activity assays containing an appropriate chromogenic substrate. SI values for reaction with each enzyme were determined by plotting residual proteinase activity against the molar ratio of SERP-1 to proteinase and extrapolating the linear portion of the inhibition titration curve to zero residual activity to give the minimum number of equivalents of SERP-1 required to fully inhibit the enzyme. SI values were measured a minimum of three times in at least two independent experiments for each enzyme. SERP-1 and the RCL mutant R319A/N320A were cloned into a vaccinia virus expression system, expressed and purified from viral supernat"
https://openalex.org/W2041874608,"Upon transfer of lysed chloroplasts from darkness to light, the accumulation of membrane and stromal chloroplast proteins is strictly regulated at the level of translation elongation. In darkness, translation elongation is retarded even in the presence of exogenously added ATP and dithiothreitol. In the light, addition of the electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea inhibits translation elongation even in the presence of ATP. This inhibition can be overcome by addition of artificial electron donors in the presence of light, but not in darkness. Electron flow between photosystem II and I induced by far red light of 730 nm is sufficient for the activation of translation elongation. This activation can also be obtained by electron donors to photosystem I, which transport protons into the thylakoid lumen. Release of the proton gradient by uncouplers prevents the light-dependent activation of translation elongation. Also, the induction of translation activation is switched off rapidly upon transfer from light to darkness. Hence, we propose that the formation of a photosynthetic proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane activates translation elongation in chloroplasts.

Protein expression in plastids of algae and higher plants is regulated by light during the light-dependent development of chloroplasts as well as during the light-dark transitions of fully differentiated chloroplasts. A great proportion of the regulatory mechanisms were found to be mediated at a posttranscriptional level, as the mRNA levels of many of the concerned genes were little or not affected (1Kirk M.M. Kirk D.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 419-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Fromm H. Devic M. Fluhr R. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 291-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Malnoe P.

Chem. 1986; 261: 11138-11145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the posttranscriptional changes of protein expression were explained by a regulation of translation initiation; the 5′-untranslated region of the psbA gene encoding the reaction center protein D1 was shown to direct light-dependent accumulation of a reporter gene in transformed tobacco plants (5Staub J.M. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and proteins binding to the 5′-regions of several chloroplast genes were observed in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (6Hauser C.R. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1486-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Light-dependent binding of proteins to the 5′-untranslated region of the psbA gene was shown to be responsible for the light-dependent translation initiation inChlamydomonas (7Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and in spinach (8Klaff P. Gruissem W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other examples of light-regulated protein expression were explained by translation elongation control; the mRNA encoding the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase was not translated in the dark but remained bound to polysomes in Amaranthus (9Berry J.O. Carr J.P. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4190-4194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of D1 translation intermediates in the dark was observed in pea chloroplasts (10Inagaki N. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 11Taniguchi M. Kuroda H. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in spinach (12van Wijk K.J. Eichacker L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Different explanations were given of how light regulated translation. Several groups attributed reduced protein expression in the dark to the reduced level of ATP in the chloroplast in the absence of photosynthetic activity (13Michaels A. Herrin D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Kuroda H. Kobashi K. Kaseyama H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 754-761Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversely, reduced translation initiation of the psbA gene has been explained by the increased level of ADP in the dark (15Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding of an initiation complex to the psbA mRNA was proposed to be regulated by reduced thioredoxin, which is generated in photosynthetic electron transport (16Kim J.-M. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Redox factors were also suggested to control chloroplast protein expression in general (17Allen C.A. Håkansson G. Allen J.F. Redox Report. 1995; 1: 119-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and translation elongation of the D1 protein (14Kuroda H. Kobashi K. Kaseyama H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 754-761Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we present a new effect of light on the general efficiency of translation elongation in barley chloroplasts, which is superimposed on a regulation of translation by redox factors or ATP. Our results suggest that the light stimulation of translation elongation is dependent on the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which arises from photosynthetic electron transport. The effect is manifested rapidly in the light and is also rapidly suppressed after transfer to darkness. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. Steffi) seeds were planted in moist vermiculite and grown for 7 days at 23 °C in a light/dark cycle of 12 h each. In the light phase of the seventh day, the upper half of the primary leaves was cut, and plastids were isolated as described (18Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol.

Additional reagents were added as indicated in the figure legends. Chloroplasts were lysed osmotically in the translation reactions because of the absence of sorbitol. Dark reactions were performed in a dim green safe light (<10 nE/m2 s), and light reactions were performed in a white light of 50 μE/m2 s. Far red light was applied to the samples with a Volpi Intralux 150H cold light source provided with an interference filter of 730 nm, providing a light intensity of about 5 μE/m2 s to the reactions. Reactions were terminated by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen. Samples were separated into stroma and membrane fractions by centrifugation (3000 ×g, 3 min). The stromal fraction was centrifuged again (20,000 × g, 5 min), and the membranes were washed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm potassium acetate.

Hydrophobic reagents were dissolved in ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol in the translation reactions and in the control reactions performed in parallel was kept below 2%. carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazon 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol reduced duroquinone phenazine methosulfate plastoquinone reduced plastoquinone photosystem I/II. The regulation of translation elongation was examined by radiolabeling of lysed barley chloroplasts with [35S]methionine in the presence of the translation initiation inhibitor lincomycin. When membrane-bound polysomes were isolated from chloroplasts pulse labeled for 2.5 to 15 min, radiolabel incorporation into defined polysome-bound translation intermediates was high after 2.5 min in the light but low in darkness. Thereafter, radiolabel accumulation in translation intermediates decreased between 2.5 and 15 min in the light, whereas in darkness radiolabel increased for 7.5 min and only decreased thereafter. This indicated that translation elongation was increased in the light by increased ribosome run off (Fig.1). In lysed chloroplasts, radiolabeling of soluble and membrane proteins was strongly enhanced in the presence of light (Fig.2; light, lanes 3 and5; dark, lane 1). The main translation product found in the membrane fraction of 7-day-old barley chloroplasts is the 33-kDa precursor of the D1 protein (pD1) (Fig. 2 A). During a 10-min chase with nonradioactive methionine, many protein bands with a lower molecular weight disappeared, whereas pD1 and mature D1 accumulate (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–10). These lower molecular weight protein bands can be immunoprecipitated with a N-terminal D1 antibody, indicating that they correspond to translation intermediates of the D1 protein. However, the light stimulation of translation elongation was not specific for the D1 protein, as light also increased radiolabeling of higher molecular weight proteins in the membrane and in the stromal fraction (Fig. 2 B). Also in the stroma, many bands immunoprecipitated in the presence of an antibody against the large subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (LSU) and seem to be translation intermediates, as they disappear during a 10-min chase (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–10). Hereby, a large proportion of the translation products in the stroma is shown to correspond to LSU, whereas proteins not elongated during the chase may correspond to other stromal proteins. The light-dependent stimulation of translation elongation was strongly inhibited by addition of the electron transport inhibitor DCMU (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). DCMU showed no effect on translation in darkness, indicating that DCMU did not inhibit translation elongation in general (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2). The inhibitory effect of DCMU in the light was also observed in the presence of exogenously added ATP (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Hence, the reduced translation efficiency in the light was not caused by DCMU-dependent inhibition of ATP synthesis but by inhibition of the photosynthetic electron transport. The influence of light on translation elongation was observed in all experiments for membrane and stromal proteins. Nevertheless, in the following figures only radiolabeling of membrane proteins will be shown to focus the data presented. To test which part of the electron transport chain is responsible for light stimulation of translation elongation, we restored electron transport in the presence of DCMU by addition of selected electron donors. As DCMU inhibits reduction of plastoquinone (PQ) by photosystem II (PS II), we restored the pool of reduced plastoquinone, and hereby photosynthetic electron transport, by addition of reduced duroquinone (DQH2) or plastoquinone-1 (PQH2) (20Izawa S. Pan L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Allen J.F. Bennet J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Gal A. Hauska G. Herrmann R. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19742-19749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both substances were able to release the inhibition of translation by DCMU in the light but did not stimulate translation in the dark (Fig. 3,A and B). These data indicated that light is required in addition to an electron donor component to overcome the inhibition of electron transport at the site of PQ reduction. Thus, we concluded that the pool of reduced plastoquinone is not the signal for light-dependent activation of translation elongation. Although reduction of plastocyanin by reduced PQ can take place in the dark (23Wood P.M. Bendall D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the amount of oxidized plastocyanin most likely limited electron flow in the dark, whereas in the light constant electron flow was possible due to PS I action. Hence, after inhibition of electron transport by DCMU, translation elongation could be reinduced by restoring electron transport after PS II because of the action of DQH2 or PQH2 as electron donors. To further localize the activation of translation elongation to a specific site of the electron transport chain, we directly reduced PS I by addition of reduced DCPIP (24Izawa S. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 413-434Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Reduced DCPIP was able to overcome the translation inhibition by DCMU in the light to the same extent as DQH2 and PQH2 (Fig. 3 C). Also, PMS, which mediates cyclic electron flow around PS I (24Izawa S. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 413-434Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar), was able to overcome the inhibition of DCMU in the light (Fig. 3 D). These data indicated that PS I activity alone was sufficient for light stimulation of translation. However, PMS and DCPIP are both known to form a proton gradient during electron transport by PS I (24Izawa S. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 413-434Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Orlich G. Hauska G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the formation of a photosynthetic proton gradient by electron transport between PS II and PS I by illuminating translation reactions with monochromatic light of 730 nm, which excites PS I but not PS II (26Haehnel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 459: 418-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Clearly, a stimulation of translation elongation in far red light occurred only in the presence of an electron donor (DQH2) (Fig. 4, lane 4 compared withlanes 1–3). This demonstrated that electron transport between PS II and PS I was sufficient for induction of translation, whereas activation of PS I alone was not. To further see whether the redox state of ferredoxin, thioredoxin, or NADPH, which are reduced by PS I during photosynthesis, could trigger induction of translation, the isolated redox compounds were added to the reactions in their reduced state. However, none of these substances was able to stimulate translation elongation in the dark (data not shown). Our data presented above suggested that the light-dependent signal for activation of translation elongation was not triggered by electron transport or a single redox component of the chain but by the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. We therefore investigated the rate of translation elongation during the release of the photosynthetic proton gradient by addition of uncouplers of photophosphorylation in the light and in presence of exogenously added ATP. Addition of the uncouplers Nigericin and CCCP clearly reduced translation elongation to the level obtained in darkness (Fig. 5,open bars). The pore-forming protonophore gramicidin, however, which inhibits photophosphorylation in thylakoid membranes already at a concentration of 0.1 μm (27McCarty R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 719-728Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), did not block light-dependent stimulation of translation elongation even in a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 5). Obviously, gramicidin only decreases the photosynthetic proton gradient to a level not high enough for ATP synthesis but does not abolish it even in high concentration (27McCarty R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 719-728Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We therefore completely abolished the proton gradient by addition of gramicidin in combination with NH4Cl (27McCarty R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 719-728Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hereby, translation elongation in the light was reduced to the level obtained in darkness. Hence, light-dependent formation of a weak proton gradient is sufficient to activate translation elongation. In parallel, we tested the influence of uncouplers on electron transport by measuring NADP reduction in the light (Fig. 5, filled bars). Data clearly revealed that electron transport was not (nigericin, gramicidin, gramicidin plus NH4+) or only slightly affected (CCCP) by the uncouplers, indicating that electron transport components are not involved in regulation of translation elongation. The photosynthetic proton gradient is rapidly released upon transfer of cells from light to darkness (29Junge W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1977; 28: 503-536Crossref Google Scholar). However, a proton gradient-induced signal could sustain a high rate of translation elongation for some time in darkness, if it was sufficiently long-lived. We therefore preilluminated plastids for 1 min on ice to stabilize the putative light signal and compared the activation of translation with preillumination at 25 °C. After preillumination, [35S]methionine and lincomycin were added, and translation reactions were performed in darkness or light. Preillumination had no stimulating effect on translation in the dark, regardless of the temperature in which the preillumination was performed (Fig. 6). This indicated that the putative proton gradient-induced signal was not long-lived but was lost upon transfer of chloroplasts to darkness. We conclude that the light-induced formation of the photosynthetic proton gradient serves a dual function for induction of translation elongation. First, a short-lived signal may be induced to increase the rate of translation elongation; second, ATP formation is induced after full development of the proton gradient to sustain the translation elongation process in general. Most studies on posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in chloroplasts have concentrated on gene-specific regulation mechanisms (3Malnoe P. Mayfield S.P. Rochaix J.-D. J.

Here, we describe a light-dependent mechanism that is not gene specific but enhances radiolabel accumulation in at least two proteins localized in the chloroplast stroma and membrane fraction. Light seems to directly activate radiolabeling by a factor involved in the enzymatic process of chain elongation, e.g. a ribosomal component, one of the chloroplast elongation factors, or chloroplast tRNA-aminoacyl synthases. Alternatively, light-dependent structural changes at the level of the mRNA or during folding of the nascent protein chain could indirectly affect the rate of chain elongation. It has been observed earlier that inhibitors of photosynthetic electron flow reduce light-dependent protein expression in chloroplasts (13Michaels A. Herrin D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Kuroda H. Kobashi K. Kaseyama H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 754-761Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Light activation of translation was attributed merely to the light-dependent increase in the ATP level, and inhibition of translation by inhibitors of photosynthetic electron flow was explained by inhibition of the light-dependent ATP synthesis. Our experiments, however, show that the presence of ATP is only one of the regulating factors, as addition of exogenous ATP was not sufficient for full activation of translation in the dark or for restoration of translation in the presence of DCMU or uncouplers. Kuroda et al. (14Kuroda H. Kobashi K. Kaseyama H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 754-761Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported an accumulation of translation intermediates of the D1 protein in the dark, which could not be overcome by ATP alone, and proposed the involvement of a light-dependent redox component for activation of translation, as dithiothreitol partly released the translational block. However, our experiments were performed in the presence of dithiothreitol and still revealed a light-dependent regulation of translation elongation that is superimposed on possible redox control mechanisms operating on the level of translation elongation or initiation. Control mechanisms on initiation level, as proposed for the psbA gene by several groups (5Staub J.M. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Klaff P. Gruissem W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), may still exist beside the regulation of translation elongation described here and may be important for the developmental control of photosystem accumulation, i.e. the onset of translation after prolonged etiolation or energy depletion in darkness. The regulation of D1 accumulation by translation elongation instead of initiation could be necessary to inhibit singlet oxygen formation by immediate binding of “free” chlorophyll to nascent apoprotein sites, even in darkness (28Tanaka A. Tanaka Y. Tsuji H. Planta. 1994; 192: 92-97Google Scholar). In the light, translation elongation was only activated by redox substances that allow the formation of a proton gradient, either by release of protons in the thylakoid lumen (PMS, DCPIP) or by allowing proton transport via the cytochrome b6/f complex (DQH2, PQH2). In contrast, addition of the same substances in the dark, or addition of redox substances that do not promote proton transport, like thioredoxin and ferredoxin, could not activate translation elongation (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, we show that a lower proton threshold level is required for the induction of translation elongation than for synthesis of ATP. Hence, the photosynthetic proton gradient, which is formed and released within seconds, is used at a very sensitive setting to monitor photosynthetic electron transport and therefore light (29Junge W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1977; 28: 503-536Crossref Google Scholar). Such a regulatory mechanism seems useful, as the highly energy-consuming process of translation will be immediately retarded upon light-dark transfer of the plant, before the level of ATP is decreased within the organell. A further indication that the proton gradient in chloroplasts may be used as a light sensor is its requirement for the light-dependent translocation of several nuclear-encoded proteins across the thylakoid membrane (30Robinson C. Klösgen R.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although it is unknown how the proton gradient signals activation of translation elongation and membrane translocation, these data indicate that the formation of a proton gradient is a prerequisite for the assembly of several chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded proteins in the thylakoid membrane. Most interestingly, the main stromal component activated by the light-induced proton gradient, LSU, was found to be translated on membrane-bound polysomes (31Bhaya D. Jagendorf A. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 832-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hattori T. Margulies M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); this could also be the case for other stromal proteins. Therefore, we suggest the following model for the general activation of translation elongation by a proton gradient (Fig. 7 B). The rate of translation elongation is coupled to the pH gradient by a thylakoid membrane component involved in the binding of ribosomes or in the enzymatic control of translation elongation activity. An increase in the luminal pH levels during illumination alters the conformation of a membrane component leading to increased chain elongation. The very rapid switch-off observed in our experiments would favor such a direct mechanism. Also, no indications for the requirement of signal transduction steps like protein phosphorylation have been found in our system. 2S. K. Mühlbauer and L. A. Eichacker, unpublished observations."

The 8-dioxygenase abstracts the 8-pro-S hydrogen from linoleic acid. Molecular oxygen binds in an antarafacial way and 8R-HPODE is formed. The second enzyme activity converts 8R-HPODE into 7S,8S-dihydroxylinoleic acid. This occurs by elimination of the 7-pro-S hydrogen and intramolecular suprafacial insertion of oxygen (12Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hamberg M. Zhang L.-Y. Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). LDS was isolated from the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis as a hemeprotein with at least 2.8 heme groups per tetramer (14Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14112-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Fatty acid dioxygenases with the same catalytic activity as LDS have not been described, but PGH synthases can catalyze a similar initial oxygenation. PGH synthases oxygenate 20:3n-9 at the monoallylic C-13 in an “abortive” cyclooxygenase reaction (15Elliott W.J. Morrison A.R. Sprecher H. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6719-6724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Oliw E.H. Hörnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem.

The 8-dioxygenase of LDS catalyzes the same event at the monoallylic C-8 of linoleic acid (13Hamberg M. Zhang L.-Y. Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the second step the peroxidase of PGH synthases can reduce the hydroperoxide to 13-HETrE, while the hydroperoxide isomerase of LDS converts the hydroperoxide into 7,8-DiHODE.The reaction mechanism of LDS is unknown. We have, therefore, examined the catalytic events of LDS. We found that important features of the reaction mechanism could be delineated with linoleate and with 8-HPODE as substrates. Our major findings are that the activity of LDS is stimulated by 8-HPODE, reduced by glutathione peroxidase, and that LDS catalysis is associated with formation of ferryl oxygen intermediates and a protein (tyrosyl) radical as judged from stopped flow and EPR analysis.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the catalytic properties of LDS. A catalytic model of LDS must accommodate all experimental observations and be consistent with the catalytic mechanisms of related heme enzymes. We will first recapitulate important properties of LDS and compare LDS with PGH synthase-1 and peroxidases.LDS forms two main products from linoleic acid and molecular oxygen,viz., 8-HPODE and 7,8-DiHODE, whereas 8-HODE is formed in small amounts. Purification of LDS suggests that the two enzyme activities are present in a homotetramer with 130-kDa subunits. Different preparations of LDS varied in hydroperoxide isomerase activity, which could be due to partial inactivation of the hydroperoxide isomerase by column chromatography. This suggests that hydroperoxide isomerase is more sensitive to perturbations of protein structure than the 8-dioxygenase activity.PGH synthase-1 and LDS are both inhibited by GSH peroxidase in the presence of GSH and activated by fatty acid hydroperoxides (6Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), although LDS might be preferentially activated by 8-HPODE. Both enzymes are also subject to suicide inactivation. An interesting similarity is that both enzymes can cleave the C–H bond of a monoallylic carbon. PGH synthases can oxygenate C-13 of 20:3n-9, whereas LDS can oxygenate C-8 of linoleic acid and C-8 of oleic acid (12Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Elliott W.J. Morrison A.R. Sprecher H. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6719-6724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Oliw E.H. Hörnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Oliw E.H. Hörnsten L. Sprecher H. J. Chromatogr. B. 1997; 690: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There are also obvious differences between the enzymes. LDS has hydroperoxide isomerase, whereas PGH synthase-1 has peroxidase activity. The ferryl oxygen intermediates I and II of PGH synthase-1 are formed during the peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 and during regeneration of ferric PGH synthase-1 with reducing equivalents (8Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The hydroperoxide isomerase of LDS does not need reducing equivalents. With oleic acid as a substrate, molecular oxygen can be inserted at C-8, the oxygen-oxygen bound cleaved and one atom of oxygen inserted either at C-7 to yield 7,8-dihydroxyoleic acid (12Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at the 9–10 double bond to yield 8-hydroxy-9(10)-epoxystearate. 2E. H. Oliw and C. Su, unpublished observation. These observations suggest an interesting analogy between LDS and peroxidases. It is well known that compound I of peroxidases can catalyze epoxidation of double bonds, lipid peroxidation, oxidation of bisallylic carbons, and even hydroxylation of unsaturated carbon chains (10Marnett L.J. Kennedy T.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 49-80Crossref Google Scholar, 30Hollenberg P.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Spectroscopy showed that LDS contained mainly high spin ferriheme. Difference spectra showed that linoleic acid caused spectral changes, which were similar to those of type I substrates of cytochrome P450 (Fig. 5), but linoleic acid had little effect on the spin state (Fig.7). Importantly, linoleic acid and 8-HPODE increased the light absorption at 412 nm, which might be related to the formation of the protein radical discussed below. Stopped flow also showed that the Soret absorption at 406 nm decayed rapidly within 10–20 ms after mixing with 8-HPODE, and then increased at a much lower rate. As the light absorption at 406 nm decreased, the light absorption increased at 421 nm after a lag time of 5 ms. These kinetic traces suggest but do not prove that ferryl intermediates are formed. We know from stopped flow and other analyses of horse radish peroxidase and PGH synthases that similar kinetic traces can be recorded, which are due to a transient ferryl oxygen intermediate and a porphyrin π-cation radical (compound I or intermediate I), which is converted to a second intermediate, most likely a ferryl oxygen and a protein radical (compound II or intermediate II), after a short time lag (9Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Marnett L.J. Kennedy T.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Chem. 1985; 260: 14894-14896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a protein radical during LDS catalysis would support the formation of compound II.EPR demonstrated that a protein radical was indeed formed upon incubation of LDS with linoleic acid and with 8-HPODE. LDS and linoleic acid generated a doublet hyperfine pattern at 3 and 45 s. The relaxation properties of the protein radical indicated that the radical was located near the heme group. However, a radical at g = 2.00 could also be a substrate radical, but we think this is unlikely for several reasons. Although LDS and linoleic acid likely can form a carbon-centered free radical, it will rapidly react with molecular oxygen to a peroxyl free radical. The former is characterized by a singlet (g = 2.004), while the latter is characterized by a singlet (or a doublet with major hyperfine splitting 0.38 mT) at g = 2.014, which were both detected by continuous flow EPR (32Chamulitrat W. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20968-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These signals are clearly different from those we observed. In addition, it seems unlikely that LDS and 8-HPODE can form a peroxyl free radical. The fact that LDS incubated with 8-HPODE or with linoleic acid for 3 and 45 s on ice generated radicals with seemingly identical features suggests that these radicals could be due to one radicalized amino acid residue. The relaxation properties of the two radicals were also found to be similar. The main difference was that 8-HPODE induced a higher concentration of the radical than did linoleic acid in the same experiment. This difference is likely substrate-dependent, reflecting the reaction scheme described below.Protein radicals have been described in many biological systems. Tyrosyl radicals are found in aerobic ribonucleotide reductase,e.g. Tyr122 in E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 8, inset) (29Sjöberg B.-M.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12852-12853Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Glycyl radicals are found in the pyruvate formate-lyase enzyme system (35Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J.

Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and from the bacteriophage T4 (Fig. 8, inset) (37Young P. Andersson J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20770-20775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transient tryptophan radicals are found in cytochrome c peroxidase (38Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Smith M. Hoffman B.M. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and in ribonucleotide reductase of E. coli with mutated protein R2 (Y122F) upon formation of the dinuclear iron center (39Sahlin M. Lassmann G. Pötsch S. Slaby A. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11699-11702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine radicals have been proposed as reaction intermediates during ribonucleotide reductase catalysis (29Sjöberg B.-M. Structure. 1994; 2: 793-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Likely candidates for the protein radical of LDS could be tyrosine, tryptophan, glycine, and cysteine amino acid residues.The main splitting in the EPR spectrum of a protein radical is often due to coupling of the unpaired electron to one or both of the β-methylene hydrogens of the radicalized amino acid. In case of an amino acid with an aromatic ring, the spin density will be delocalized over the ring system. For tyrosine, a large portion is found at C-1, which will couple to the β-protons (one proton in E. coliribonucleotide reductase and two protons in photosystem II). The ring protons at C-3 and C-5 of tyrosine are almost equivalent and will give rise to hyperfine splitting of ∼0.6 mT (40DeGray J.A. Lassmann G. Curtis J.F. Kenndey T.A. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E.

Acta. 1995; 1232: 175-179Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For tryptophan radicals that are neutral and deprotonated a large spin density is found at C-3 of the ring and will couple to the β-methylene protons. A doublet splitting can be observed when only one of the β-protons couples to the spin density at C-3 and a quartet splitting when both β-hydrogens couple with equal strength (39Sahlin M. Lassmann G. Pötsch S. Slaby A. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11699-11702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The couplings observed for protein glycyl radicals are characterized by a major doublet with hyperfine splitting constant of 1.4–1.5 mT and a g value of 2.004. Cysteine radicals have not been observed unless covalently coupled to a reactant in a suicidal reaction (43Covès J. Le Hir de Fallois L. Le Pape L. Décout J.-L. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8595-8602Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or ligated to a metal (44Licht S. Gerfen G.J. Stubbe J. Science. 1996; 271: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).The observed features of the LDS doublet intermediate seem most similar to tyrosyl radicals (Fig. 8, inset). Both the g values, the magnitude of the hyperfine splitting, and also the poorly resolved 0.6-mT splitting, which could be ascribed to the C-3 and C-5 ring protons, are similar in tyrosyl radicals and in the radical of LDS. Furthermore, PGH synthase-1 forms a radical at Tyr385, which is assumed to be of catalytic importance. This assignment is based on the three-dimensional structures of PGH synthases (2Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar) and on the EPR spectra of the radical (8Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conclusive identification of the radicalized amino acid as a catalytically important tyrosine residue of LDS will require isotope labeling of recombinant LDS, mutation of tyrosine residues to other amino acids, and the three-dimensional structure of LDS.What is the origin of the LDS radical? It seems likely that it is related to oxidation of the ferriheme and to the catalytic activity of LDS for several reasons. The relaxation properties of the radical indicated that it was located in the vicinity of the metal center. Exogenous 8-HPODE stimulates LDS activity, is metabolized to 7,8-DiHODE by the hydroperoxide isomerase (18Su C. Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H. Lipids. 1995; 30: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and generates the protein radical. Furthermore, stopped flow experiments with LDS and 8-HPODE showed transient spectral changes in the Soret region with at least two different rate constants, suggesting that ferryl intermediates similar to compounds I and II of peroxidases might be generated. Finally, work in progress suggests that the primary structure of LDS can be related to peroxidases, albeit distantly. A 200-amino acid long sequence of LDS can be aligned with 25% identity with a peroxidase, including 31% identity over a 70-amino acid sequence. 3L. Hörnsten, C. Su, U. Hellman, A. E. Osbourn, and E. H. Oliw, unpublished observation. Our observations and the apparent analogy with PGH synthase-1 and peroxidases (2Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 49-80Crossref Google Scholar) suggest the following catalytic mechanism of LDS (Fig. 9). The initiating step of catalysis could be the reduction of 8-HPODE to 8-HODE, or the reduction of other hydroperoxides, with formation of ferryl oxygen with a porphyrin π-cation (compound I). The latter is rapidly reduced to compound II with one electron, and a protein (tyrosyl) radical is formed. The protein (tyrosyl) radical could initiate the LDS cycle: (i) the 8-pro-S hydrogen of linoleate is eliminated by the protein radical, (ii) molecular oxygen reacts with the alkyl radical, (iii) 8R-peroxylinoleate is formed and it could form 8-HPODE either by abstracting a hydrogen from the tyrosyl residue (and regenerating the tyrosyl radical) or by receiving an electron from other electron donors, (iv) the hydroperoxide oxygen-oxygen bound is cleaved, (v) ferryl oxygen and 8-HODE are formed, and (vi) the ferryl oxygen is inserted at C-7 of 8-HODE, 7,8-DiHODE is released from LDS, and ferriheme is formed. This hypothetical reaction mechanism of LDS can be described as a branched chain reaction (45Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8499-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 46Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Xiao G. Swinney D.C. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol.

The latter is reduced to compound II with formation of a protein radical at a slower rate (k2). Ferryl oxygen is then inserted at C-7 of 8-HODE and 7,8-DiHODE is formed (rate constantk3). The protein radical can initiate a new catalytic cycle by abstraction of the 8-pro-S hydrogen of linoleic acid. The linoleoyl radical (marked ⋅ 18:2) reacts with molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical (⋅ OO-18:2). The latter will form 8-HPODE and at the same time the protein radical might be regenerated. The EPR spectra of the protein radical suggest that it could be a tyrosyl radical (Tyr·) as indicated. The protein radical can likely also be reduced (rate constant k4) with electrons from other sources than LDS. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate (p-HMB) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) plus GSH both inhibit LDS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)G. graminis causes a root disease of wheat with the ominous name “take-all” (47Abelson P.H.

The reaction mechanism of LDS makes it of scientific interest in its own right.

To explore the importance of the hydrogen bonds between the participating residues, we converted the protein R2 residue Asp237, one of the conserved residues along the radical transfer route, to an asparagine and a glutamate residue in two separate mutant proteins. In this study, we show that the D237E mutant is catalytically active and has hydrogen bond connections similar to that of the wild type protein. This is the first reported mutant protein that affects the radical transfer pathway while catalytic activity is preserved. The D237N mutant is catalytically inactive, and its tyrosyl radical is unstable, although the mutant can form a diferric-oxo iron center and a R1-R2 complex. The data strongly support our hypothesis that an absolute requirement for radical transfer during catalysis in ribonucleotide reductase is an intact hydrogen-bonded pathway between the radical site in protein R2 and the substrate binding site in R1.

The model suggests that the active site in R1 and the stable tyrosyl radical in R2 are connected via an array of conserved residues, which constitutes the radical transfer pathway. These residues are Tyr122, Asp84, His118, Asp237, Trp48, and Tyr356 in the R2 protein and Tyr730, Tyr731, and Cys439 in the R1 protein (see Fig. 1). The importance of the radical transfer route has been demonstrated extensively by site-directed mutagenesis of the E. colienzyme and also in experiments using selected residues in the mouse enzyme. Each residue of the radical transfer pathway has been replaced by another nonphysiological residue, and none of the mutant proteins could perform ribonucleotide reduction (4Larsson A. Sjöberg B.-M.

In all reported cases, the side chain of the particular amino acid residue was changed to a side chain with other hydrogen bonding properties than those of the original residue in the wild type protein. The very long (35–40-Å) radical transfer pathway in RNR is hard to reconcile with current electron transfer theories (15Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7801) Google Scholar, 16Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 17Moser C.C. Keske J.M.

In the current study, our intention was to investigate further the function of the radical transfer pathway. By altering the properties of the side chain of one residue, we wanted to assess the importance of the hydrogen bonds. We converted Asp237 in the R2 protein into an asparagine and a glutamate residue in two separate experiments. Asp237 plays an essential role; it forms hydrogen bonds with His118, Trp48, and Gln43 and thereby functions as a connecting point for three helices. It also participates both in the catalytic radical transfer (12Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in the generation of the tyrosyl radical (20Katterle B. Sahlin M. Schmidt P.P. Pötsch S. Logan D.T. Gräslund A.

Our data emphasize the requirement for hydrogen bonds between the conserved residues in the radical transfer route and strongly suggest that the catalytic radical transfer process in RNR is a coupled electron/proton transfer. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis and sequencing were synthesized and purified by Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB. CzDP was obtained by cleavage of its CTP derivative by incubation with myosin and subsequent purification on Centricon-10. CzTP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut-1, ung-1, thi-1,relA/pCJ105 Cmr) and E. coliMV1190 (Δ(lac-proAB), thi, supE, Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10/F' traD36,proAB, lacI q ZΔM15), obtained from Bio-Rad, were used for mutagenesis and cloning. E. coliMC1009 (Δ(lacIPOZYA)X74, galE, galK, strA, Δ(ara-leu)7697, araD139, recA, srl::Tn10)/pGP1–2, obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, was used for expression. pTZ18R, obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, contains a T7 promoter upstream of a cloning cassette (22Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTB2 is a derivative of pTZ18R, containing the E. coli nrdBgene, coding for the R2 protein (14Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J.S. Sanders Loehr J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGP1–2, obtained from S. Tabor, codes for T7 polymerase under control of the λPL promoter and a heat-sensitive cI857 repressor under the control of the Lac promoter (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of pTB2 was performed using the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitromutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad, based on a method described by Kunkel (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Initial verifications of the mutations were done by polymerase chain reaction of the entire nrdB gene and cleavage with a restriction enzyme specific for the mutations, MnlI for the D237E mutation, and BsrDI for the D237N mutation. The entire gene was then sequenced. MC1009/pGP1–2 containing either pTB2 D237N or pTB2 D237E was grown for several hours at 30 °C in 10 ml of LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). Overnight, 1 liter of the same medium was inoculated with 0.05 A640 units. The next day, 4 liters of the same medium were inoculated with 200 ml of overnight culture, divided into four 5-liter flasks, and shaken vigorously (300 rpm) at 30 °C. At A640 = 0.5, the temperature was raised to 42 °C to induce the λPL promoter by heat inactivation of the cI857 repressor. Growth was continued for about 3 h (A640 = 1.3). At harvest, the culture was quickly chilled and centrifuged at 4000 × g. The pellets were frozen and stored at −80 °C for further purification. The D237N mutant protein was overexpressed in the presence of 130 μm bathophenanthrolinesulfonic acid to obtain an apo form of the protein. Frozen cells were disintegrated in a BIOX X-press and then resuspended in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, and 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purification was essentially as described by Sjöberg et al. (25Sjöberg B.-M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions from the DEAE column that contained R2 were pooled and ultradialyzed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and 20% glycerol. For further purification, the concentrated sample was applied on a fast protein liquid chromatography MonoQ 10/10 ion exchange column and eluted with a gradient of NaCl in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6. The purified protein was then concentrated as described above and then stored at −80 °C. The purity was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm minus that at 310 nm. Molar extinction coefficients of 180,000 m−1cm−1 for R1 and 120,000 m−1cm−1 for R2 were used. For crystallization, glycerol was removed from the MonoQ 10/10 purified protein using a Superdex 200 column and concentrated by Centricon centrifugation. The apo D237N mutant protein was reconstituted with 6 and 3 irons/R2 protein. The reconstitution was performed at 25 °C by mixing apoprotein in an oxygen-containing buffer with ferrous iron in an anaerobic solution. The uv-visible absorbance spectra were collected on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer. The radical contents of wild type and mutant proteins were determined from light absorption spectra using an extinction coefficient of 2,110 m−1cm−1 for the tyrosyl radical (26Bollinger J.M. Tong W.H. Ravi N. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8015-8023Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Iron contents were determined colorimetrically as described previously (27Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Backes G. Loehr T. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The radical stability in the D237N mutant was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the 410-nm absorbance at 25 °C every 10th minute for 3 h, with a scan rate of 240 nm/min. Recording of the first spectrum was started approximately 30 s after the addition of iron. The R1 interaction with R2 D237E was determined by measuring the specific activity with a constant R1 concentration of 0.035 μm and concentrations of R2 D237E varying from 0.04 to 0.70 μm. The R1 interaction with R2 D237N was determined in a series of inhibition experiments where the mutant R2 was used as an inhibitor of wild type ribonucleotide reductase activity. The activity was measured with a constant R1 concentration of 0.044 μm, and the R2 concentrations were varied between 0.05 and 0.8 μm. The concentrations of inhibitor (R2 D237N) were 0, 0.2, 0.6, and 1.5 μm. The interaction constants, Kapp, for the different concentrations of the mutant proteins were determined graphically from Lineweaver-Burke plots, and Ki for D237N was determined by plotting Kapp versusinhibitor concentration. Enzyme activity was measured as described below. Assays were performed and analyzed as described for the [3H]CDP assay (28Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 50 μl with 1.5 mm ATP as effector, 0.5 mm[3H]CDP (63,000 cpm/nmol) as substrate, and in the presence of 13 μm thioredoxin and 0.5 μmthioredoxin reductase. For determination of specific activities, the R1 concentration was 1 μm, and the R2 concentrations were varied to give at least a 6-fold excess of R1 over R2. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of R2 reducing 1 nmol of substrate/min at room temperature in the presence of excess R1. The specific activity of R2 D237N was determined approximately 2 min after reconstitution of the protein. The D237E mutant was crystallized in space group P212121with cell dimensions of 74.4, 85.6, and 115.7 Å. The crystallization of D237E was carried out in Petri dishes by the hanging drop method using the same conditions as for the wild type R2 protein (29Nordlund P. Uhlin U. Westergren C. Joelsen T. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reservoir contained 18 or 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, with 0.2 m sodium chloride and 1.0 mm ethylmercury thiosalicylate as additives. The drops contained 5 μl of protein solution at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and 5 μl of reservoir solution. Diffraction data were collected to 1.95 Å on a Mar Research image plate mounted on a Siemens rotating anode. Data were indexed and integrated with Denzo and scaled and reduced with Scalepack (30Otwinowsky Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The resulting data comprise 53,000 unique reflections with a redundancy of 3.0, anRmerge of 8.5% and a completeness of 96%. Further data reduction was performed using programs of the CCP4 package (31Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and the software package BIOMOL (Protein Crystallography Group, University of Groningen, The Netherlands). The coordinates of reduced wild type R2 ribonucleotide reductase (32Logan D.T. Su X.D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) were used as a starting model for refinement with TNT (33Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The refined model was evaluated and corrected with Quanta (Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA). The D237E mutant structure has an R-factor of 18.7% with good geometry and root mean square differences to the wild type structure of 0.013 Å in bond lengths and of 2.1° in angles. The formation rate of a nitrogen-centered radical at the active site was determined by monitoring the signal amplitude at two different magnetic field points in the EPR spectrum. The two fixed points were chosen to give as high a contribution as possible of the nitrogen-centered radical and at the same time minimal contribution of the tyrosyl radical. Measurements were done by stopped flow EPR at room temperature with final concentrations of 75 μm R1 protein, 50 μm R2 protein, and 1.7 mm CzDP in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris at pH 7.6, 500 μm dTTP, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The binding constant of CzDP to RNR was determined as a function of the formation of the nitrogen-centered radical at different concentrations (0.026–1.7 mm) of CzDP. EPR spectra at 9 GHz were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300 EPR spectrometer, equipped with a cold finger Dewar for studies at 77 K. Parameter settings were as follows: modulation amplitude, 0.16 milliteslas; microwave power, 0.1 milliwatts; time constant, 327 ms; and sweep time, 83 s. For kinetic studies at room temperature, a stopped flow accessory type SFA1 (34Lassmann G. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was linked with the ESP 300 Bruker spectrometer. Parameter settings were as follows: modulation amplitude, 0.5 milliteslas; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; time constant 40–80 ms; and sweep time, 20–40 s. The kinetic curves were evaluated by using a fitting program, GraFit 3.01, for exponential curves. The constructs R2 D237N and D237E contain only the desired GAC to AAT (D237N) and GAC to GAG (D237E) mutations as verified by dideoxy sequencing. The D237E mutant R2 behaved like wild type during overexpression and purification. The D237N mutant had an unstable radical (see below) and was therefore overexpressed in the presence of an iron chelator (bathophenanthrolinesulfonic acid) to obtain the apo form, which could then be reactivated immediately prior to the experiments. No radical was present in D237N purified from material produced under normal growth conditions. The structure of the D237E mutant showed that a glutamic acid at position 237 is able to form the same hydrogen bonds as an aspartic acid in the wild type protein (Fig.1). The lengths of the hydrogen bonds in the mutant protein differ slightly from those in the wild type protein. The closest distances between the iron ligand His118 and Asp237 or Glu237 were similar within experimental error, 2.7 Å in wild type R2 and 2.6 Å in the mutant R2. Also connected to Asp237 is Trp48, another residue in the proposed radical transfer pathway in wild type R2. Asp237 has only one possibility to form a hydrogen bond to Trp48, whereas Glu237 in theory can form two types of hydrogen bond connections to Trp48. The bond distances were 3.3 and 2.9 Å in the D237E mutant and 2.9 Å in the wild type protein (Fig. 2, Aand B). However, the shorter bond in the mutant has an angle that may be unfavorable for a hydrogen bond. Gln43, the third residue connected to Asp237, is positioned identically in the D237E mutant and in wild type R2, with a hydrogen bond distance of 3.3 Å in the mutant and 3.0 Å in the wild type. Light absorption spectra for wild type and mutant R2 proteins are shown in Fig. 1. Active wild type R2 shows a sharp peak at 410 nm, related to the tyrosyl radical, and absorbances at 325 and 370 nm related to the diiron-oxo center (Fig.3 A). Both mutant proteins could form a tyrosyl radical and also an oxo-bridged iron center (Fig.3, B and C), although the spectrum of the D237N mutant protein was not as well resolved as were the wild type and the D237E spectra. The iron and radical contents of wild type and mutant R2 proteins are presented in Table I. The data of wild type R2 and D237E are almost identical, whereas the iron content was higher, and the amount of radical formed was slightly lower in the D237N than in the wild type protein. However, these differences are small and not likely to be a major cause of loss of enzyme activity (see below).Table IIron content, radical properties, and kinetic constants for R1-R2 interaction of the mutant R2 proteinsR2 proteinIron contentRadical contentRadical stability decayR1-R2 interaction Kapp orKimol/molmol/molh−1μmWild type2.90.8Stable0.11 (Ref. 11Climent I.

Open table in a new tab The radical of the D237E mutant protein was as stable as the radical of the wild type protein. In contrast, the radical of the D237N mutant decayed with a rate constant of 0.37/h at 25 °C, which corresponds to a half-life of about 110 min (Table I). We determined the R1-R2 interaction constants for the mutant R2 proteins. Table I shows that both mutant proteins have interaction constants similar to that of the wild type. From these data, we concluded that the mutant R2 proteins are not affected in their ability to bind to wild type R1. The specific activities of both mutant proteins were measured and are presented in TableII. The D237E was shown to have a significant enzyme activity, about 7% of the wild type activity. This is the first observation of a mutant affecting the radical transfer route in RNR that can still catalyze ribonucleotide reductase reduction. The low activity measured in the D237N mutant protein (0.3% of the wild type activity) corresponds approximately to the estimated amount of chromosomally encoded wild type protein in preparations from MC1009/pTB2/pGP1–2 constructs. It is therefore plausible that the D237N mutant protein per se is incapable of ribonucleotide reduction and that the low activity observed is due to a very small fraction of wild type contamination.Table IISpecific activity and rate constants for formation of the nitrogen-centered radical (CzDP*) in wild type and mutant R2 proteinR2 ProteinActivityCzDP* formation (k)Tyr* decay (k)units/mgs−1s−1Wild type50000.68 ± 0.090.64 ± 0.03D237E3400.084 ± 0.0040.044 ± 0.007aAfter curve fitting to a double exponential decay, where the second decay (0.006 s−1) probably is due to an unspecific loss of tyrosyl radical.D237N13bThe same activity was observed in D237N apoprotein, and protein reconstituted with 6 irons and 3 irons.No formationNDcNot determined.The rate constants were measured by stopped flow EPR at room temperature.a After curve fitting to a double exponential decay, where the second decay (0.006 s−1) probably is due to an unspecific loss of tyrosyl radical.b The same activity was observed in D237N apoprotein, and protein reconstituted with 6 irons and 3 irons.c Not determined. Open table in a new tab The rate constants were measured by stopped flow EPR at room temperature. To differentiate between a low intrinsic enzyme activity in the mutant proteins and a low amount of contaminating wild type activity, we used the substrate analogue CzDP. CzDP is a suicidal substrate analogue that scavenges the tyrosyl radical of R2 in a single half-turnover reaction catalyzed by the holoenzyme (35Thelander L. Larsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1398-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Eckstein F. J. Biol.

Soc. 1995; 117: 8908-8916Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A protein with an intact radical transfer route will form a nitrogen-centered radical at the active site in R1 at the expense of the tyrosyl radical in R2, whereas a protein with a disrupted radical transfer route will not form the nitrogen-centered radical, and the tyrosyl radical will consequently not be lost. By CzDP inactivation experiments, we showed that the D237N mutant protein was unable to perform radical transfer. No nitrogen-centered radical was formed, and the tyrosyl radical decay had the same rate constant as in the isolated D237N protein. In the D237E mutant protein, the radical transfer was functional; we could observe a nitrogen-centered radical and a tyrosyl radical decay. To determine an accurate formation rate for the nitrogen-centered radical in the D237E mutant protein and wild type R2 protein, we used stopped flow EPR spectroscopy at room temperature (Table II). The formation rate of the nitrogen-centered radical in the D237E protein was 0.084 s−1, which is approximately 8 times slower than in the wild type. The corresponding tyrosyl radical decay was 0.044 s−1, indicating that this mutant enzyme can perform radical transfer. The overall rate of the half turnover reaction in the mutant D237E is approximately 10% of the corresponding wild type rate (Table II). The only difference between the wild type and the mutant systems is the mutation in the R2 protein, since the same R1 wild type protein was used in both reactions. The rate constant for formation of the nitrogen-centered radical in wild type protein was determined to be 0.7 s−1 (Table II), which is faster than previously reported values of 0.23 min−1 (36Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8060-8067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Salowe S. Bollinger J.M. Ator M. Stubbe J. Mccracken J. Peisach J. Samano M.C. Robins M.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12749-12760Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), probably due to the efficient mixing technique used here. The decay rate of this radical (data not shown) agrees with the earlier published value (36Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8060-8067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with kcat of the enzyme, which is about 7 s−1, the CzDP-dependent reaction is a 10 times slower process. To exclude the possibility that the slower reaction rate with the CzDP substrate analogue was due to a nonsaturating CzDP concentration or a defective binding of the analogue to the active site, we determined the binding constant of CzDP to the wild type holoenzyme complex. The Lineweaver-Burke plot of Fig. 4 shows that the binding constant for CzDP is 0.27 mm. Using the method of Ormö et al. (39Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we obtained a similar binding constant for the normal substrate CDP, a value that is in accordance with the previously reported CDP binding constant of 0.25 mm obtained by equilibrium dialysis (40von Döbeln U. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3616-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From this, we concluded that the slower rate of the suicidal reaction with CzDP in wild type protein as compared with the multiple turnover of the CDP substrate is not due to decreased or defective binding of the analogue. Instead, it is most likely due to differences in the chemical reaction mechanism. The existence of a dedicated radical transfer route in E. coli RNR has been established by a combination of three-dimensional structure determinations, phylogenetic sequence comparisons, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. As long ago as 1990 when the three-dimensional structure of the R2 protein was solved, Nordlund et al. (5Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) pointed out that an array of three strictly conserved residues connected the diiron site in R2 with the surface of the protein through hydrogen bonds. The subsequently solved three-dimensional structure of protein R1 showed that there was a short array of three hydrogen-bonded co"
https://openalex.org/W1990571275,"Expression of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit is regulated by a mineralocorticoid- and glucocorticoid-responsive elements. Here we identified an MR and GR responsive element, at positions −650 to −630, within the β1 gene promoter that is required for both MR and GR activation. Independent expression of MR and GR activated by aldosterone or triamcinolone acetonide (TA) leads to significant transactivation of the β1 promoter. Yet coexpression of both receptors activated by aldosterone plus TA or cortisol results in a much lower induction, indicating that coexpression of MR and GR is inhibitory. Gel shift mobility assay using an oligonucleotide including the 21-base pair MRE/GRE with whole cell extracts prepared from CV-1 cells overexpressing MR or GR showed specific MR and GR binding to this sequence. Additionally, antibodies to both MR and GR effectively supershifted the protein-DNA complexes, indicating that these receptors bound to the DNA sequence. Finally, the 21-base pair MRE/GRE was capable of activating transcription from a heterologous promoter in response to both aldosterone and TA. Together these data indicate that the 21-base pair sequence represents a true MRE/GRE and that optimal activation of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 promoter is controlled by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones. It appears that an interaction of MR with GR on the β1 promoter effectively down-regulates transcription. Expression of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit is regulated by a mineralocorticoid- and glucocorticoid-responsive elements. Here we identified an MR and GR responsive element, at positions −650 to −630, within the β1 gene promoter that is required for both MR and GR activation. Independent expression of MR and GR activated by aldosterone or triamcinolone acetonide (TA) leads to significant transactivation of the β1 promoter. Yet coexpression of both receptors activated by aldosterone plus TA or cortisol results in a much lower induction, indicating that coexpression of MR and GR is inhibitory. Gel shift mobility assay using an oligonucleotide including the 21-base pair MRE/GRE with whole cell extracts prepared from CV-1 cells overexpressing MR or GR showed specific MR and GR binding to this sequence. Additionally, antibodies to both MR and GR effectively supershifted the protein-DNA complexes, indicating that these receptors bound to the DNA sequence. Finally, the 21-base pair MRE/GRE was capable of activating transcription from a heterologous promoter in response to both aldosterone and TA. Together these data indicate that the 21-base pair sequence represents a true MRE/GRE and that optimal activation of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 promoter is controlled by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones. It appears that an interaction of MR with GR on the β1 promoter effectively down-regulates transcription. Na/K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein responsible for the transport of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane in an ATP-dependent manner (for review, see Refs. 1Verrey F. Beron J. Spindler B. Mineral. Electrolyte Metab. 1996; 22: 279-292PubMed Google Scholar and 2Ewart H.S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; : C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Na/K-ATPase is composed of two subunits, the α subunit (113 kDa) which mediates the catalytic activity, and the smaller glycosylated β subunit (35 kDa) whose exact function is unclear (3Horisberger J.D. Lemas V. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 565-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that it may be involved in the localization of the enzyme to the plasma membrane, protein folding, or stabilization of the K+-bound form of the enzyme (4Lingrel J.B Van Huysse J. O'Brien W. Jewell-Motz E. Schultheis P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 17: 198-200Google Scholar). Na/K-ATPase is encoded by a multigene family and isoforms were described for both the α (α1, α2, and α3) and the β (β1, β2, and β3) subunits (5Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 6Lane L.K. Shull M.M. Whitmer K.R.

Expression of these isoforms occurs in a tissue-specific manner (8Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the α1 and β1 isoforms are expressed in most tissues, α2 is predominant in skeletal muscle and can be detected in the brain and heart, whereas α3 is found in excitable tissues. The β2 and β3 isoforms are mostly found in neural tissues (4Lingrel J.B Van Huysse J. O'Brien W. Jewell-Motz E. Schultheis P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. 1994; 17: 198-200Google Scholar). Aldosterone and glucocorticoid hormones regulate the expression of the α and β subunits of the Na/K-ATPase genes (9Whorwood C.B. Ricketts M.L. Stewart P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Whorwood C.B. Stewart P.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This regulation by steroid hormones was shown to occur in a tissue-specific manner. Aldosterone but not dexamethasone activates Na/K-ATPase gene expression in cardiac cells while the reverse is observed in colonic cells, suggesting that both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR) 1The abbreviations used are: MRmineralocorticoid receptorGRglucocorticoid receptorGREglucocorticoid response elementMREmineralocorticoid response elementTAtriamcinolone acetonideCATchloramphenical acetyltransferase. are involved in the regulation of the enzyme and non-receptor factors might be involved in conferring mineralocorticoid versusglucocorticoid specificity (11Ikeda U. Hyman R. Smith T.W. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12058-12066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MR is highly homologous to the GR (12Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1105-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) which enhances expression of target genes by binding to specific promoter DNA sequences. These sequences consist in imperfect inverted hexanucleotide repeats separated by 3 nucleotides (GGTACA NNN TGTTCT), known as the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) (for review, see Refs. 14Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar and 15Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). MR was shown to bind, in vitro, to GRE sequences (14Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar, 16Alnemri E.S. Maksymowych A.B.

In the current study, we examined the promoter region of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene subunit, for the presence of putative glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid response elements (GRE or MRE). We also analyzed the regulation of Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter by MR or GR or coexpression of both receptors. This included both transcriptional and DNA binding studies. Our results show that, both MR and GR are able to activate the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter. Using 5′ deletion constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified a functional GRE/MRE at position −650 of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter for both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid. In addition we show that co-transfection of both receptors inhibits transcription from the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter. All hormones were purchased from Sigma. RU38486 was a gift from Roussel Uclaf (Romainville, France). Stock solutions were prepared in ethanol. Stock solutions were at 10−3m for aldosterone and TA and at 10−2m for cortisol, RU38846, and spironolactone. 1 μl of hormone solution was mixed with 10 ml of cell culture medium for each experiment. Construction of the luciferase plasmids containing the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter (pHβ1–1141Luc) or various lengths of the 5′-flanking region (pHβ1–726Luc, pHβ1–554Luc, pHβ1141*(643–327)Luc, pHβ1–456-luc, pHβ1–327-luc, and pHβ1–83Luc) was described previously (17Feng J. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A pHβ1CAT promoter vector was constructed. A double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide β1MRE and β1mutMRE containing either a wild type sequence of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter from −662 to −628 (GGGTTTGGCAATTGTCCTGCTCGAGGTGGTTCAGG) or a deletion at bases −650 to −645, were inserted into a BglII site, upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pCAT promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The structures of these plasmids called pHβ1MRE CAT and pHβ1mutMRE CAT were confirmed by sequencing. Expression plasmids for the human mineralocorticoid receptor (RshMR) and the human glucocorticoid receptor (RshGR) were a generous gift from R. M. Evans. The GRE TKCAT plasmid was provided by G. Schutz. β-Galactosidase expression plasmid (Rsv-β-gal) and 7Zf+were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin at 100 units/ml, and streptomycin at 100 μg/ml. Cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and 8 × 104 cells were plated overnight on 100-mm dishes in duplicates, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped, steroid-free fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of pHβ1–1141Luc containing the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter or various lengths of the 5′-flanking region fused to a promoterless luciferase gene in pOLuc reporter plasmid (Promega), and 1 μg of the expression plasmid for the human MR (RshMR) or 1 μg of the human GR (RshGR), or 1 μg of each receptor expression plasmid along with 5 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid (Rsv-β-gal) and 7Zf+ carrier DNA to a total of 20 μg. Cells were incubated with DNA precipitates for 18 h, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with fresh medium supplemented with 100 nm aldosterone and 1 μm RU 38486 in MR transfections; 100 nmtriamcinolone acetonide (TA) and 1 μm spironolactone in GR transfections and 1 μm cortisol when both MR and GR were co-transfected. Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity. For CAT analysis, CV-1 cells were transfected with 10 μg of β1 MRE CAT or β1 mut MRE CAT construct and 1 μg of RshMR or RshGR, or 1 μg of each receptor, along with 5 μg of Rsv-β-gal and 7Zf+ carrier DNA to a total of 20 μg. Following 24 h of hormone treatment as above, cell extracts were prepared and processed for CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis (Boehringer Mannheim). Luciferase and CAT values were all normalized to β-galactosidase activity as follows. For each experiment, cells were co-transfected with equal amounts (1 μg) of Rsv-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (Rsv-β-gal) and each transfection was carried out in duplicate. β-Galactosidase activity was evaluated for all samples by measuring the absorbance of the o-nitrophenol at 420 nm, produced by transformation of the substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, by the β-galactosidase enzyme contained in cell extracts. Differences in the β-galactosidase activity were expressed as a fraction (highest activity divided by the other values). Luciferase and CAT values were then normalized to β-galactosidase activity by multiplying the luciferase or CAT value by the corresponding β-galactosidase ratio for the same transfection. COS-1 cells were grown and transfected as described above, with 7 μg of receptor expression vector RshMR or RshGR, and 3 μg of 7Zf+ plasmid. When both MR and GR were co-transfected, carrier DNA was supplemented to a total of 20 μg. Hormone incubations were conducted for 2 h as above and cells were washed and pellets stored at −80 °C, for preparation of whole cell extracts forin vitro DNA binding analysis. For luciferase and CAT assays, cell extracts were prepared from CV-1 cells as recommended by the manufacturers (Promega and Boehringer Mannheim). Pellets from transfected COS-1 cells were thawed on ice and homogenized by 20 strokes in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 600 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml antipain, using a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged (75,000 × g at 4 °C) for 30 min to obtain whole cell extract. A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the wild type human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene (β wt MRE) from position −662 to −628 GGGTTTGGCAATTGTCCTGCTCGAGGTGGTTCAGG, or including different deletions (β1 mutMRE 1 to β1 mutMRE 5), were synthesized (Fig. 5 A). A GRE 31 oligomer consisting of two GREs (TGTACAGGATGTTCT)2, separated by 16 base pairs, was obtained by excising the GRE 31 TK-CAT plasmid usingBamHI and HindIII digestion. GRE 31 and β1 wt MRE were filled using the Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) and labeled by incorporating [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and were used as probes. Whole cell extract of cells overexpressing MR or GR or both MR and GR (3 to 6 μg) were incubated on ice for 10 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm poly(dI-dC), in a total volume of 18 μl. An anti-GR polyclonal antibody (αGR), directed against the DNA-binding domain, or an anti-MR polyclonal antibody (αMR) recognizing the N terminus and the DNA-binding domain, as well as a preimmune serum were included in reaction mixtures where indicated. A 50–200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucotide was used in competition reactions. 0.1 ng of 5′-32P-end labeled GRE 31 or β1 MRE was added to the reaction and incubation was continued for 10 min at room temperature. Reaction mixtures were applied to a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (250 mV) at 4 °C, with buffer recirculation in 1 × TAE (6.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried under vacuum and autoradiographed at −80 °C. To analyze regulation of the Na/K-ATPase β1 promoter by mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid, CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding the human β1 gene promoter, spanning nucleotides −1141 to +490, linked to the luciferase gene (pHβ1–1141Luc). An expression vector for the human MR (RshMR) or the human GR (RshGR) or both MR and GR were co-transfected in CV-1 cells. These cells are known to express very little if any endogenous MR and GR. In MR experiments, treatment of the transfected cells with 100 nm aldosterone for 48 h, resulted in a 17-fold increase in the activation of the luciferase gene by the β1 full-length promoter (FLP) (Fig. 1). In cells transfected with GR, 100 nm TA induced a 23-fold increase in luciferase activity, indicating that GR is a somewhat stronger transactivator of the β1 gene promoter than MR (Fig. 1). Interestingly, co-transfection of both receptors, followed by treatment with 1 μm cortisol, which activates both MR and GR, induced only a 2-fold increase in activation (Fig. 1). These data indicate that together MR and GR have an inhibitory effect on activation of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter. To identify cis-acting elements involved in MR/GR induced activation, we carried out a detailed examination of the 5′-flanking region of the β1 gene subunit for the presence of GRE-like sequences. Three potential response elements were identified at position −1048, −650, and −276 relative to the transcriptional start (Fig.2 A), containing consensus binding sequences for GR (GRE). The first two sequences contain two half-binding sites separated by 10 and 9 base pairs, respectively, whereas the last one consists of a single half-site (Fig.2 A). To determine the functionality of these potential response elements and their specificity for MR versus GR, luciferase plasmids containing various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene (Fig. 2 B) were generated and transfected into CV-1 cells, along with the MR and/or GR expression plasmids. In MR co-transfection experiments, plasmid with an end point at position −726 (726-Luc) induced an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity following treatment with 100 nm aldosterone (Fig.3 A). This activation consists of half of that induced by the full-length promoter construct (1141-Luc). Deletion of an additional 172-base pair in the 554-Luc plasmid resulted in a 4-fold reduction in transcriptional activation. Finally, deletion of the remaining sequence in the 83-Luc construct abolishes the hormonal response (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that the deleted intervals in the various constructs contained potential functional elements, including the GRE-like sequences, responsible for the activation of the β1 promoter by aldosterone. Similar results were obtained in GR co-transfection experiments (Fig.3 B). Plasmids with end point at position −726 and −554 (726-Luc, 554-Luc) induced 10- and 5-fold increase in luciferase activity, respectively, following treatment with 100 nm TA (Fig. 3 B). The construct with an end point at −83 (83-Luc), did not retain hormone inducibility (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that sequences deleted from these intervals, including the putative GREs, may constitute positive regulatory elements contributing to the activation of the β1 promoter by GR. In addition, a luciferase plasmid containing the full-length promoter including an internal deletion −1141*(643–327) abolishing the sequence from position −643 through −327, was analyzed in the presence of MR or GR. In MR experiments, this construct induced a 2-fold increase in luciferase expression (Fig. 3 A) and a 4-fold activation was obtained in GR experiments (Fig. 3 B). This result reflects a significant decrease in promoter activity when compared with that of the full-length promoter (Fig. 1), suggesting that the deleted interval (−643 to −327) includes important positive cis-acting elements. Interestingly, deletion constructs such as 554-Luc, 456-Luc, and 327-Luc containing most of this interval (643–327), but not the GRE-like sequence at position −650, induced, similar to the FLP*643–327-Luc construct, 2–5-fold increases in luciferase expression but were not capable of re-establishing promoter activity to a higher level such as that of 726-Luc. Together these results indicate that the GRE/MRE sequence at position −650 plays an important role in conferring hormone responsiveness and that other elements including the GREs at position −1048 and −276 are necessary for optimal activation of β1 promoter by aldosterone and glucocorticoid. Co-transfection of both MR and GR, followed by treatment with 1 μm cortisol, resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in luciferase activity with the variant deletion constructs (Fig.3 C). The inhibition of promoter activity was similar to that obtained with the full-length promoter (Fig. 3 C) suggesting that MR and GR are inhibitory to each other when they are coexpressed. To examine the ability of cortisol to activate the β1 promoter via MR and GR, CV-1 cells were co-transfected with the full-length promoter (−1141-Luc) or various deletion constructs in the presence of MR or GR and cells were treated with 100 nm cortisol. These treatments induced significant luciferase activation by the full-length promoter for both MR and GR (data not shown). This activation was lower than that induced by the more specific ligands aldosterone and TA when used in MR and GR experiments, respectively. To examine whether the inhibition of promoter activity observed in the presence of both receptors and cortisol is ligand specific, CV-1 cells were co-transfected as above in the presence of both MR and GR and cells were treated with 100 nm aldosterone plus 100 nm TA. In these conditions, the full-length promoter induced a 5-fold increase in luciferase gene expression, while 1–3-fold increases were observed with the different deletion constructs (Fig. 3 D). These data indicate that activation by the β1 promoter, in the presence of both MR and GR and their specific ligands, aldosterone and TA, is 2-fold higher than that induced in the same conditions by cortisol. However, these results confirm that coexpression of MR and GR inhibits gene expression. Based on our observation of a 4-fold reduction in hormone inducibility of the β1 promoter upon deletion of the putative binding site at position −650 in the presence of MR but not with GR, it appears to function as a mineralocorticoid response element. To examine DNA-binding properties of MR to the β1 promoter −650 MRE, human MR was transfected into COS-1 cells and whole cell extract was prepared following 2 h treatment with 100 nm aldosterone. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 3 μg of whole cell extract and a sequence of the Na/K-ATPase β1 promoter from −662 to −628 as a probe (GGGTTTGGCAATTGTCCTGCTCGAGGTGGTTCAGG). This probe contains consensus binding sequences for GR, organized in two half-binding sites (bold) separated by 9 base pairs, as well as a NF1-binding site (underlined). In the untransfected cells treated with aldosterone we can detect minimal binding corresponding to a low level of endogenous MR (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Upon transfection with the human MR followed by treatment with aldosterone, the results show that two classes of protein-DNA complexes are formed on the β1 palindrome in vitro (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and5). These complexes may correspond to different MR oligomeric forms bound to the DNA, which includes monomers and dimers, with different mobility properties. DNA binding was competed completely with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled β1 MRE oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A, lane 4). A consensus GRE oligonucleotide (GRE 31), containing double GRE sequences separated by 16 base pairs, was also used as a competitor. GRE 31 was partially effective at competing the β1 MRE binding when a 200-fold excess was used (Fig. 4 A, lane 7). Moreover, in a reverse experiment, β1 MRE competed partially the binding when the GRE 31 was used as a probe (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that MR binds with higher affinity to the β1 MRE. These data indicate that protein extracts of cells overexpressing MR bind specifically to the −650 MRE of the β1 promoter. To demonstrate that the protein-DNA complexes contained MR, we next used a polyclonal antibody (α-MR) raised against human MR. The protein-DNA complexes were shifted to a higher position when the α-MR was used but remained unchanged when a preimmune serum was included in the reaction (Fig. 4 C). This result indicates that both complexes contain MR. To examine the involvement of the GRE-like binding sites and the NF1 sequences contained in Na/K-ATPase β1 MRE (−662 to −628) in MR binding in vitro, 5′ and/or 3′ deletions were introduced in β1 palindrome (Fig. 5 A) and used as cold competitors in gel shift analysis. Human MR was transfected into COS-1 cells and whole cell extract was prepared following 2 h treatment with 100 nm aldosterone. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 3 μg of whole cell extracts and the β1 MRE as a probe. Unlike the wild type oligonucleotide (β1 wt MRE), none of the mutated sequences were able to compete effectively for DNA binding, when a 200-fold excess of cold mutated oligonucleotide (β1 mut MRE) was included in gel shift reactions (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that optimal binding of MR requires both half-sites and the NF1 site, in total spanning at least 28 base pairs. To examine protein binding to the β1 MRE (−662 to −628) in the presence of both receptors, human MR, GR, or both MR and GR were transfected into COS-1 cells. Cell extracts were prepared following 2 h induction with 100 nm TA or 1 μm cortisol, respectively. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using 3 μg of whole cell extracts and β1 MRE as a probe. In extracts of cells overexpressing GR, two classes of DNA-protein complexes were formed on the β1 MRE in vitro, similar to that seen for MR (Fig. 6). Protein binding to the β1 MRE was eliminated when a GR antibody was included in the gel shift reaction, and was unaffected in the presence of a nonspecific serum. In the presence of both receptors, extracts from cells transfected with both MR and GR (3 μg), or in vitro mixtures of equal amounts of protein extracts prepared from cells overexpressing one of the two receptors (3 μg total), show no difference in DNA binding pattern, when compared with the binding of receptors expressed separately. Addition of MR antibody (α-MR) or GR antibody (α-GR) to reaction mixtures resulted in band shifting and elimination of DNA binding, respectively, indicating the presence of both MR and GR in the protein-DNA complexes formed in vitro, when both receptors are present (Fig. 6). Despite the absence of modifications in the binding pattern, we observed in a reproducible manner, a reduction in the DNA binding of coexpressed receptors when compared with the binding of receptors expressed separately. Densitometric analysis of DNA binding, indicated as upper and lower bands, revealed 50–60% reduction in protein-DNA binding of coexpressed MR and GR for both bands, when compared with the binding of MR or GR expressed individually (Fig. 6, B andC, MR/GR bars). Interestingly, in vitro MR+GR mixtures show 35% reduction in binding corresponding to the lower band but no changes in the upper band, when compared with GR (Fig. 6 C, MR+GR bars). However, little or no reduction in the binding corresponding to both bands was observed for in vitromixtures of MR and GR when compared with the MR binding (Fig. 6 B, MR+GR bars). These results suggest that MR/GR heterodimers formedin vivo bind to the β1 MRE with lower affinity in comparison with MR/MR or GR/GR homodimers. In addition, differences in the reduction of the upper and lower bands observed between in vivo coexpressed MR/GR and in vitro mixtures of MR+GR may reflect variations in the formation and equilibrium of the MR/GR heterodimer under different conditions. To determine whether the sequence extending from −650 to −628 of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene relative to the transcriptional start constituted a functional mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid regulatory element, a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to this sequence was inserted into a BglII site, upstream of the SV40 promoter in the CAT promoter vector (pHβMRE CAT). A mutated oligonucleotide was cloned, also, into the site. CV-1 cells were transfected with either β1MRE CAT construct or β1mutMRE CAT along with MR, GR, or both MR and GR and treated with 100 nm aldosterone or TA or 1 μm cortisol, respectively. In MR experiments, CAT activity was stimulated 3-fold in CV-1 cells transfected with MR and pHβ1MRE CAT. No induction was obtained with MR and the mutated MRE containing a deletion in the left consensus half-site (Fig.7 A). Following treatment with 100 nm TA, GR stimulated a 2-fold induction of CAT activity (Fig. 7 B). However, coexpression of both MR and GR in the presence of 1 μm cortisol resulted in no induction of the CAT gene expression (Fig. 7 B). These results demonstrate that the sequence from −662 to −628 of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene contains a potential MRE/GRE that is sufficient for mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid responsiveness in a heterologous promoter when MR and GR are expressed independently and that coexpresion of both MR and GR leads to inhibition of transcription. The mineralocorticoid receptor mediates aldosterone-induced regulation of sodium transport. It is well established that the α and β isoforms of the Na/K-ATPase gene family are regulated by corticosteroid hormones in a tissue-specific manner, at both the mRNA and protein levels (9Whorwood C.B. Ricketts M.L. Stewart P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Whorwood C.B. Stewart P.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 15: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Ikeda U. Hyman R. Smith T.W. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12058-12066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, the molecular mechanism of this regulation and its tissue specificity are still to be elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the transactivation of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter by the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. To locate DNA sequences required for hormone transactivation, we carried out a detailed analysis of the promoter and used 5′ deletions of the flanking region of the β1 gene fused to the luciferase reporter gene. This approach allowed us to identify three potential sequences containing consensus binding sequences for GR (GRE) at positions −1048, −650, and −276, relative to the transcriptional start. Two of the sequences contained two half-binding sites, whereas the last one consisted of a single half-site at position −276. Using 5′ deletions of the promoter region, MR and GR activation was shown with deletion constructs containing the MRE/GREs at position −650 and −276, suggesting that they are responsive both to aldosterone and the glucocorticoid TA. This activation was 50% lower than that induced by the full-length promoter construct indicating that the potential MRE at position −1048 may be functional. Importantly, 80–90% of promoter activation via MR and GR were lost with a deletion construct containing the full-length promoter including an internal deletion abolishing the left half-site of the MRE/GRE at position −650. This suggests an important role for this sequence in hormone responsiveness. Although a 3-fold activation was observed with constructs containing the single half-binding site at position −276, luciferase gene activation decreased dramatically when compared with that of constructs including the full site sequences at positions −1048 and −650. This observation is consistent with the current hypothesis for requirement of two copies of half-sites, to which GR and MR bind as homodimers, to generate a functional GRE. Presence of multiple GREs in the promoter of genes regulated by GR has been described and the transcriptional increase observed in our system when three or two of these sequences are present is in agreement with the known role played by multiple GREs in the amplification of the steroid hormone signal by synergy (18Jantzen H.M. Stahle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Functionality of one of these potential MRE/GREs as minimal sequences conferring mineralocorticoid and/or glucocorticoid responsiveness was examined. We demonstrate that the sequence from −662 to −628, containing the potential MRE/GRE at position −650, is capable of transactivation when cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter by both MR and GR in CV-1 cells. This sequence consists in two half-binding sites separated by 9 base pairs and each half-site exhibits a 5/6 match with a consensus GRE sequence. However, when the left half-site is deleted no induction of transcription was observed in response to hormone. Activation of the β1 gene promoter was demonstrated for both MR and GR. Importantly, GR induced regulation of the full-length promoter was shown to be roughly equal to that of MR. Results have been reported with a TATA3-TATA reporter plasmid, containing 3 near consensus HREs showing a greater induction of transcription by GR than MR in CV-1 cells (19Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). This difference is not due to a difference in the level of expression of GR and MR but seems to be a result of the inability of MR to self-synergize at multiple HREs, while GR does (20Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of gene expression by corticosteroid receptors was thought to involve exclusively, binding of receptor homodimers to GRE sequences (21Tsai S.Y. Carlstedt-Duke J. Weigel N.L. Dahlman K. Gustafsson J.A. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 361-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In cells expressing both receptors, molecular studies have demonstrated that MR and GR are capable of forming heterodimers, with transactivation properties different from those of the respective homodimers (19Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Trapp T. Rupprecht R. Castren M. Reul J.M. Holsboer F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1457-1462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Examination of the regulation of the human Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter, by MR and GR when both receptors are expressed, show inhibition of the transcriptional activation, indicating that MR has an inhibitory effect on GR activation of the β1 gene promoter and vice versa. Inhibition of GR induced transcriptional activity by MR has been reported in a different regulatory context supporting the idea that MR-GR heterodimers are less efficient activators than GR-GR homodimers (19Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Bamberger C.M. Bamberger A.M. Wald M. Chrousos G.P. Schulte H.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a region within the N terminus of MR disrupts GR self-synergy in MR-GR heterodimers. In our system, inhibition of GR induced transcriptional activity of the β1 gene promoter by MR may represent a mechanism for differential regulation of the Na/K-ATPase by glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid in different tissue contexts. To determine whether activation of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter by mineralocorticoid involves a direct interaction between MR and the putative cis-elements identified in the flanking region, we examined the ability of the potential MRE/GRE sequence at position −650 to bind MR in mobility shift assays. We demonstrate that activated human MR binds specifically to the palindromic β1MRE (−662 to −628) and two protein-DNA complexes were formed. Affinity of β1 MRE for MR was similar to that of a double consensus GRE oligomer. The observation of a supershift in the bands when a polyclonal antibody against human MR (α-MR) is included, demonstrates that the latter complexes indeed contained MR. Formation of multiple protein-DNA complexes in vitro has been previously reported for MR and GR and reflect existence of monomeric and dimeric forms of MR bound to the DNA (20Liu W. Wang J. Yu G. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1399-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Using whole cell extracts prepared from COS-1 cells overexpressing GR or both MR and GR, induced with 100 nm TA or 1 μm cortisol, respectively, immuno-binding assays show, as expected, that GR binds to the Na/K-ATPase β1 MRE and further demonstrate the presence of both MR and GR in protein-DNA complexes formed in vitro. These data indicate that a direct interaction of the β1 gene promoter with MR and GR is involved in the regulation of the Na/K-ATPase gene by mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. The specificity of mineralocorticoid hormone action remains unclear (24Funder J.W. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 1990; 1: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that some physiological studies show differences in the effect mediated by MR and GR, few hypothesis for specific mineralocorticoid regulation have been established by molecular studies. Steroid hormones were shown to regulate the expression of Na/K-ATPase genes in a tissue-specific manner. Aldosterone but not the glucocorticoid dexamethasone induces Na/K-ATPase gene expression in cardiac cells, while the reverse is observed in colonic cells (11Ikeda U. Hyman R. Smith T.W. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12058-12066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3462-3470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that both hormone receptors are involved in the regulation of the enzyme and that non-receptor factors might be involved in conferring mineralocorticoid versus glucocorticoid specificity. Tissue-specific factors may include other transcription factors. It is known that steroid receptors can bind to composite GREs containing binding sites both for the receptor and for other transcription factors. Differential regulation by MR and GR was shown at pIFG, a composite AP1/GRE site (26Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 27Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a putative NF1-binding site at position −657, upstream of the β1 MRE, indicating that NF1 may play a role in the regulation of Na/K-ATPase gene by MR and GR. Tissue-specific factors may also include members of the recently described family of steroid receptor coactivators and corepressors such as SRC1-a and GRIP1, N-COR and SMRT, which might be involved in conferring mineralocorticoidversus glucocorticoid specificity and their roles remain to be evaluated in the regulation of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter (28Onate S.A.

In rat pancreatic beta cells, both insulin secretion and mitochondrial [Ca2+] increases were desensitized following two challenges with the mitochondrial substrate methyl succinate. In the beta cell line INS-1, similar results were observed when a 5-min interval separated two 5-min pulses. In contrast, ATP generation monitored in luciferase-expressing INS-1 cells was stimulated to the same extent during both exposures to methyl succinate. Succinate, like α-glycerophosphate, activates the electron transport chain at complex II. As a consequence, the mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarizes, promoting ATP synthesis and Ca2+ influx into the mitochondria through the uniporter. The mitochondrial desensitization was further studied in permeabilized INS-1 cells. Increasing extramitochondrial [Ca2+] from 100 to 500 nm enhanced succinate oxidation 4-fold. At 500 nm Ca2+, 1 mm succinate caused a blunted mitochondrial [Ca2+] increase upon the second, compared with the first, stimulation. These effects were mimicked by α-glycerophosphate, and there was cross-desensitization between the two compounds. Succinate hyperpolarized the mitochondrial membrane during both the first and second applications. This suggests that the uniporter itself, rather than the respiratory chain, is desensitized. These results emphasize the key role of the mitochondria not only in the stimulation of insulin secretion, but also in its desensitization.

These results emphasize the key role of the mitochondria not only in the stimulation of insulin secretion, but also in its desensitization. Desensitization is a common feature of cell biology in general and of insulin secretion in particular. However, the molecular mechanism of desensitization toward nutrient stimuli is poorly understood. Nesher and Cerasi (1Nesher R. Cerasi E. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) first observed that successive short stimuli with glucose or arginine in the isolated perfused rat pancreas resulted in the inhibition of the insulin secretory response to the second stimulus. Insensitivity of the pancreatic beta cell to glucose was reported in pancreata taken from hyperglycemic rats (2Sako Y. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and is found in several diabetic animal models (3Leahy J.L. Cooper H.E. Deal D.A. Weir G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). A reduced responsiveness of the pancreatic beta cell to glucose has also been described after prolonged exposure of beta cells to hexose in vitro (4Anello M. Rabuazzo A.M. Degano C. Caltabiano V. Patanè G. Vigneri R. Purrello F. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Ling Z. Pipeleers D.G. J. Clin.

This desensitization phenomenon is distinguished from glucose toxicity, the latter being irreversible, whereas the former implies a reversible state of cellular refractoriness due to repeated exposures to an agonist (7Robertson R.P. Olson L.K. Zhang H.-J. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Desensitization can occur at any of the multiple steps coupling glucose recognition to insulin secretion, including the exocytotic process itself, as shown in permeabilized cells exposed to repeated Ca2+ pulses (8Jonas J.C. Li G. Palmer M. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic beta cell, mitochondrial metabolism plays a pivotal role in the generation of signals coupling glucose recognition to insulin secretion (9Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev.

Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The main trigger of exocytosis is an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (for a review, see Ref. 12Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ controls several other cellular functions, among them mitochondrial metabolism (14Hansford R.G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Transfer of reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain increases the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which enhances the driving force for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mediated by a low affinity uniporter (21Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ΔΨm-dependent Ca2+ entry permits an amplification of [Ca2+]m, relative to [Ca2+]c, further favoring the stimulation of the aforementioned dehydrogenases (22Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M.

On the other hand, the hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane exerts a negative feedback by lowering the oxygen consumption and the rate of H+ cycling (24Tzagoloff A. Mitochondria. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1982: 62-180Google Scholar, 25Magnus G. Keizer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C717-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In glucose-stimulated beta cells, insulin secretion is initiated by the activation of mitochondrial metabolism, leading to an increase in [Ca2+]c(10Matschinsky F.M.

The partial reduction of glucose oxidation by blockade of the [Ca2+]c increase (17Pralong W.F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

Using cells stably expressing the calcium-sensitive photoprotein aequorin targeted to the mitochondria, we have previously shown that desensitization of insulin secretion is associated with a parallel loss of the [Ca2+]m response (23Kennedy E.D.

These findings and other recent studies point to a pivotal role for the mitochondria in metabolism-secretion coupling (11Prentki M. Eur. J.

Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The existence of this putative mitochondrial factor is further suggested by studies showing impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in insulinoma cells depleted of the mitochondrial genome (33Soejima A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 34Kennedy E.D. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To study the involvement of the mitochondria in the desensitization process, we have monitored insulin secretion and three parameters that reflect mitochondrial activation: 1) ΔΨm using the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123, 2) [Ca2+]memploying a cell line stably expressing mitochondrial aequorin, and 3) generation of ATP using a cell line stably expressing cytosolic luciferase. The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate was used as a mitochondrial substrate. Some of these experiments were performed in cells isolated from rat islets, whereas the remainder were in cells derived from the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 (35Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). To study the dissociation between the [Ca2+]m signal and ATP generation, experiments were performed in Staphylococcusα-toxin-permeabilized INS-1 cells, which permits the control of the mitochondrial environment with respect to cytosolic [Ca2+] and [ATP] (13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The results show that [Ca2+]m increases and insulin secretion are strongly desensitized by mitochondrial substrates, whereas generation of ATP and ΔΨm activation are not. The study provides evidence that the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter is desensitized, rather than the activation of the electron transport chain. INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium as described previously (23Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin.

Clonal INS-1 lines expressing cytosolic luciferase under the control of doxycycline-dependent transcriptional transactivator were established (INS-r3-LUC7) (36Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Following two successive stable transfections, resistant clones were cultured with 250 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Pancreatic islet cells were isolated by collagenase digestion from male Wistar rats weighing ∼200 g (17Pralong W.F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured free floating in RPMI 1640 medium for 2–4 days. Rat pancreatic islet cells were isolated as described above, trypsinized, and seeded on 13-mm diameter extracellular matrix-coated coverslips (Eldan, Jerusalem, Israel) at 4 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium. Two days later, the cells were transfected with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Gibco BRL, Basel, Switzerland) and 1 μg of vector encoding mitochondrially targeted aequorin as described previously (17Pralong W.F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three days later, the cells were used for the experiments. This transfection procedure resulted in 10–15% of cells being transfected as judged by immunofluorescence of the hemagglutinin tag incorporated at the N terminus of aequorin (22Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W.M. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 23Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J.

Cells were first washed with a Ca2+-free HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (as described below except for the omission of CaCl2 and the addition of 0.4 mmEGTA). They were then permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (1 μg/coverslip, i.e. per 4–5 × 105 cells) (8Jonas J.C. Li G. Palmer M. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Palmer M. Jursch R. Weller U. Valeva A. Hilgert K. Kehoe M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol.

For [Ca2+]m measurements, perifusion was started with the same low Ca2+ intracellular buffer for 2–5 min, which was then switched to the stimulatory intracellular buffer with a free Ca2+ concentration of ∼500 nm (140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm ATP, 10.2 mm EGTA, and 6.67 mmCaCl2). Luciferase- or aequorin-expressing cells were seeded on 13-mm diameter coverslips 3–5 days prior to analysis and maintained in the same medium as described above except for the addition of G418 and hygromycin. For intact cell experiments, cells were seeded on plastic polyornithine-treated coverslips at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml. For permeabilized cell experiments, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/ml on A431 extracellular matrix-coated coverslips as described above. Prior to luminescence measurements, cells were maintained in glucose- and glutamine-free RPMI 1640 medium plus 10 mm HEPES for 2–5 h at 37 °C. This period also served to load aequorin-expressing cells with 2.5 μm coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), the prosthetic group of aequorin (23Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Luminescence was measured by placing the coverslip in a 0.5-ml thermostatted chamber at 37 °C ∼5 mm from the photon detector. We used a photomultiplier apparatus (EMI 9789, Thorn-EMI, Middlesex, United Kingdom), and data were collected every second on a computer photon-counting board (EMI C660) prior to calibration as described previously for [Ca2+]m (23Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The cells were perifused constantly at a rate of 1 ml/min, and where indicated, 1-min fractions of the effluent were collected for insulin measurements. Suspensions of islet cells were perifused with the same buffers as INS-1 cells using a perifusion apparatus (23Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Intact cells were perifused with HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (135 mmNaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 2.8 mm glucose) plus 10 μm beetle luciferin (Promega) for luciferase-expressing cells. Luciferase luminescence was used for the monitoring of [ATP] in living cells as described previously (36Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were perifused with the intracellular buffer described above. For insulin secretion experiments, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was added to buffers as carrier, and insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as a standard (35Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). ΔΨm was measured as described (13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 39Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a culture period in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium, cells were loaded with 10 μg/ml rhodamine 123 for 10 min at 37 °C. For cell suspension measurements, after centrifugation, the cells were permeabilized as described above and transferred to a fluorometer cuvette, and the fluorescence excited at 490 nm was measured at 530 nm at 37 °C with gentle stirring in an LS-50B fluorometer (Perkin-Elmer, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). For measurements on attached cells, the cells grown on A431-coated glass coverslips were loaded with rhodamine 123 prior to permeabilization (see above). Cells were then placed in a thermostatted microincubator (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) on an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) with a 40× oil immersion objective. Fluorescence excitation was filtered at 485 nm, and emission was split at 505 nm and further filtered at 530 nm (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT). The signal was recorded at 100 Hz with a photomultiplier (Nikon P100S) and a computerized acquisition system (40Nüsse O. Serrander L. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cell layer was perifused at 1 ml/min with the 500 nm free Ca2+ intracellular buffer (see above) supplemented with 0.1 μg/ml rhodamine 123. INS-1 cells were seeded at 4 × 105cells/2 ml on 35-mm diameter dishes coated with A431 extracellular matrix as described above. Cells were maintained 3–4 days prior to the experiment in the standard RPMI 1640 medium to subconfluency. Attached cells were then incubated in glucose- and glutamine-free RPMI 1640 medium plus 10 mm HEPES for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to a thermostatted glass chamber, and permeabilized according to the procedure described above. Cells were then washed with the corresponding intracellular buffer adjusted to either 100 or 500 nm free Ca2+ and preincubated for 10 min in that buffer. Succinate oxidation was initiated by replacing the buffer with 1 ml of the respective fresh ones containing 1 mm[2,3-14C]succinate (NEN Life Science Products; 0.1 μCi/chamber). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C in sealed chambers, 0.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl was added onto the cell layers to stop the reaction, and 1 ml of benzethonium hydroxide (Sigma) was injected into the bottom of the chamber to bind the CO2 liberated by the cells (41Sekine N. Fasolato C. Pralong W.F. Theler J.M. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1424-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation at room temperature,14CO2 production was measured in benzethonium extracted with 5 ml of EtOH and counted in an LS6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Where applicable, values are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and significance of difference was calculated by Student's t-test for unpaired data. Traces without S.E. values are representative of at least three independent experiments. Rat pancreatic islets were maintained in culture for 2–4 days prior to the experiments. Stimulation of insulin secretion with 16.7 mm glucose for 10 min was repeated after a 10-min interval of perifusion at 2.8 mm glucose. This revealed that the secretory response was desensitized during the second stimulation, displaying ∼50% reduction (Fig. 1 A). The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate, rendered cell-permeant by the ester binding of a methyl group (42MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 997-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), also produced a desensitization of the insulin exocytotic response with a pattern similar to that produced by glucose (Fig. 1 B). Finally, KCl was used to raise [Ca2+]c by membrane depolarization (29Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 17Pralong W.F. Spät A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27310-27314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the second of two exposures to 20 mm KCl revealed a blunted insulin secretory response (Fig.1 C). Primary rat pancreatic cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding mitochondrially targeted aequorin. Monitoring of [Ca2+]m in these cells showed that 5 mm methyl succinate increased [Ca2+]m during the first stimulation, but not during a second one repeated 5 min later (Fig.2 A). This desensitization was also observed by raising [Ca2+]c through depolarization of the plasma membrane induced by 20 mm KCl (Fig. 2 B). Contrary to clones stably expressing aequorin, the low expression levels after transient transfection (13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) do not permit a reliable calibration since the total photon emission was 10–20-fold less in the later case. Therefore, [Ca2+]m is expressed as photons emitted per second. The insulin-secreting cell line INS-1 was stably transfected with mitochondrially targeted aequorin (INS-1/EK3) or with luciferase (INS-r3-LUC7), allowing the continuous measurement of [Ca2+]m or [ATP], respectively, in living perifused cells. The simultaneous monitoring of [Ca2+]m and insulin secretion demonstrated that both parameters exhibited an attenuated response when 5 mmmethyl succinate was added to the perifusion 5 min after the first stimulation (Fig. 3, B andC, respectively). The [Ca2+]mdesensitization was not due to aequorin consumption or deleterious effects on the cells, as the [Ca2+]m response to methyl succinate was completely restored after an interval of 30 min between the two pulses (Fig. 3 D). The addition of 5 mm methyl succinate to INS-1 cells produced an increase in cytosolic ATP, and the same rise could be elicited 5 min later to the same extent during a second exposure to methyl succinate without any significant desensitization (Fig. 3 A). Additional time points for the [Ca2+]m increases and recovery of the secretory responses have already been documented using glucose as a stimulus (23Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, glucose, which also increases cytosolic ATP levels (36Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), did not exhibit any desensitization using the protocol of Fig. 2 A. The ATP response to 12.8 mm glucose was +23.3 ± 2.0 and +24.3 ± 2.2% during the first and second applications, respectively (not significant, n = 4). The aequorin-expressing cells were then permeabilized withStaphylococcus α-toxin, which forms very small holes (2–3-nm diameter) in the plasma membrane (38Palmer M. Jursch R. Weller U. Valeva A. Hilgert K. Kehoe M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11959-11962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jonas J.C. Li G. Palmer M. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this preparation, the cytosolic composition and hence the mitochondrial environment can be controlled. The permeabilized cells were perifused with an intracellular type buffer containing a permissive free Ca2+concentration of 500 nm and 10 mm ATP. The first addition of 1 mm succinate induced a large transient peak in [Ca2+]m, but the second pulse 5 min later was ineffective (Fig. 4 A). The desensitization phenomenon was also observed with α-glycerophosphate, which transfers reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the same site (complex II) in the electron transport chain as succinate (Fig.4 B). Glycerophosphate has been shown to produce ATP in isolated islet mitochondria (43Idahl L.A. Lembert N. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More important, using 5-min intervals, succinate desensitized the effect of α-glycerophosphate on [Ca2+]m and vice versa (Fig. 4,C and D). This latter effect shows that the desensitization mechanism appears to be located downstream of the oxidation of FADH2. It should be noted that when Ca2+ was substituted with the Ca2+ surrogate Sr2+ in the intracellular type buffer, a very similar desensitization of the mitochondrial [Sr2+] increase was observed upon repeated succinate stimulation. 2P. Maechler, E. D. Kennedy, and C. B. Wollheim, unpublished observations. As for intact cells, the desensitization was not an irreversible process due to a toxic effect or to the loss of functional aequorin since resensitization was observed after 30 min using either succinate or α-glycerophosphate (Fig. 5,A and B, respectively).Figure 5Resensitization of [Ca2+]m in permeabilized INS-1 cells.

CHO LIF binding to these receptors is neither affected by anti-gp190 mAbs nor by anti-gp130 mAbs and is specifically inhibited by low concentrations of mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) (IC50 = 40 μm), suggesting that they could be related to Man-6-P receptors.

Adv. Immunol. 1993; 53: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2Jacques Y. Heymann D. Minvielle S. Godard A. Cavaillon J.-M. Les Cytokines.

Signal transduction by these cytokines is proposed to result from cytokine-mediated homodimerization of the gp130 signal transducer (4Kitamura T. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 8-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or heterodimerization of gp130 with another signal transducing subunit. IL-6 first binds with low affinity (nanomolar) to a specific IL-6Rα subunit and the complex then recruits and homodimerizes two gp130 subunits for signaling. A final hexameric complex of two molecules each of IL-6, IL-6Rα, and gp130 has been proposed (5Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23286-23289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, specific IL-11Rα subunits have also been identified (6Hilton D.J. Hilton A.A. Raicevic A. Rakar S.

Moreau J.F. Bataille R. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 2534-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the IL-11/IL-11Rα complex is also proposed to induce homodimerization of gp130 for signaling. Other members of this cytokine family can induce heterodimerization of gp130 with gp190, a signaling molecule initially identified as the low affinity (nanomolar) LIF receptor (or LIF-Rβ) (8Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delanay P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). CNTF recruits gp130 and gp190 together with a third cytokine specific receptor chain (CNTF-Rα). LIF and OSM have been proposed to require only gp130 and gp190 to form a common signaling complex designated type I OSM receptor. Another type of OSM receptor, not used by LIF, has been described (type II OSM receptor). It involves the recruitment of gp130 with a recently identified gp180 transducing molecule also called OSM-Rβ (9Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies have also suggested that another receptor subunit besides gp130 and gp190 might participate in the structure of the LIF receptor (10Heymann D. Godard A. Raher S. Bentouimou N. Blanchard F. Cherel M. Hallet M.M. Jacques Y. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, a cytokine specific receptor chain has been described by cross-linking in the case of CT-1 (11Robledo O. Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Guillet C. Auguste P. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Pennica D.

Most of the cytokines of this subfamily have been shown to exert biological activities on various cell types, both within and outside of the hematopoietic system (1Gearing D.P. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 53: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2Jacques Y. Heymann D. Minvielle S. Godard A. Cavaillon J.-M. Les Cytokines. Masson, Paris1996: 349-365Google Scholar). Due to the sharing of common transducing receptor subunits, these cytokines also show overlapping activities. In agreement with the multiple activities elicited by LIF, high affinity (picomolar) LIF receptors have been demonstrated on a number of cell lines (12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M. Virdee K. Soulillou J.P. Moreau J.F. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3214-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several cell lines have been described to express only low affinity (nanomolar) LIF receptors, and it was postulated that this was linked to the expression of gp190 (LIF-Rβ) in the absence of gp130 (12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M. Virdee K. Soulillou J.P. Moreau J.F. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3214-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of this hypothesis was, however, hampered by the lack of anti-LIF-Rβ antibodies. In this study, with the recent availability of such anti-LIF-Rβ mAbs (13Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we show that the low affinity LIF receptor expressed by a number of cell lines is unrelated to gp190. This receptor binds LIF through its carbohydrate moieties and displays biochemical, immunochemical, and functional features, indicating that it is identical to the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (Man-6-P/IGFII-R). The human myeloma U266 cell line and the human choriocarcinoma JAR cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). U266 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and JAR cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% FCS.

The first cDNA strand was synthesized using total RNA (2 μg) at 45 °C for 30 min in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer, Mannhein, Germany), 1 mm amounts of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 600 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 μg of oligo(dT) 15-mer. 1 μl of the reaction mixture was made up to 25 μl using Taq polymerase buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2) containing 10 pmol of each primer and 0.6 unit of Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Amplifications were performed using a thermal cycler for 35 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 59 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C using gp190 primers: 5′-CGGGATCCAGGACTGACTGCATTGCAC and antisense: 5′-AACAGCTGTTGAATTAATATCCTTC. PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel and analyzed by Southern blotting with the 3.3-kilobase pair EcoRI insert from PKCR6-gp190 plasmid (10Heymann D. Godard A. Raher S. Bentouimou N.

Control PCR was performed using β-actin primers: 5′-GGCTACAGCTTCACCACCAC and antisense: 5′-GCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAGG to check RNA integrity. The different mAbs were radiolabeled as described (14Blanchard F. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Raher S. Hallet M.M. Moreau J.F. Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) according to a procedure using IODOGEN as a catalyst. The specific radioactivities obtained were in the range of 450–900 μCi/nmol. CHO LIF and E. coli LIF were iodinated according to the chloramine T method as described (12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M. Virdee K. Soulillou J.P. Moreau J.F. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3214-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIF was labeled at a specific radioactivity of around 15,000 μCi/nmol for high affinity binding studies and at a specific radioactivity of around 1,800 μCi/nmol for binding studies under low affinity conditions. CHO or JAR cell monolayers were incubated with PBS containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA to bring the cells in suspension, washed with FCS containing culture medium, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA). U266 cells were washed prior to resuspension in PBS-BSA. Binding experiments were carried out in PBS-BSA as described previously (12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B.

Cells (1×106/well in 96-well round-bottomed plates) were incubated with increasing concentrations of labeled LIF or anti-gp190 mAb in a final volume of 50 μl. Nonspecific binding was evaluated by including a 100-fold excess of the respective unlabeled cytokine or antibodies. Incubation was carried out under agitation for 90 min (equilibrium conditions) at 4 °C. Cell bound (B) and unbound (F) fractions were separated by centrifugation through a layer of dibutyl-phthalate (90%) and parrafin oil (10%). Regression analysis of the binding data was accomplished using a one- or two-site equilibrium binding equation (Grafit, Erithacus Software, Staines, United Kingdom). For competition studies, cells were incubated as described above with a constant and non-saturating concentration of radioactive LIF (with respect to its equilibrium dissociation constant) and increasing concentration of unlabeled competitor ligand (antibodies, cytokines, or monosaccharides) in a final volume of 50 μl. Separation of cell bound and unbound fractions was carried out as described before. Inhibition curves obtained were analyzed with a four-parameter hyperbolic equation describing competitive inhibition between two ligands for a common binding site (Grafit). Cross-linking was carried out as described (12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M. Virdee K. Soulillou J.P. Moreau J.F. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3214-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 5 nm radiolabeled LIF. After washing, cross-linking was accomplished through the addition of 1 mm ethylene glycolbis(succinimidyl succinate) (Pierce). Cells were then lysed in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm iodoacetamide. The cell lysate was centrifuged and the resulting pellet solubilized in 125 mmTris buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1% SB14 (solubilization buffer). Solubilized samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE (3–9% acrylamide gradient) under reducing condition. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For immunoprecipitations, cross-linked and solubilized cell samples were heated at 90 °C before adding polyclonal antibodies and protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad). After incubating under agitation overnight at 4 °C, agarose beads were centrifuged, washed in solubilization buffer, and submitted to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. These experiments were performed with the BIACore 2000 optical biosensor (BIACore, Uppsala, Sweden). Man-6-P/IGFII-R extracytoplasmic domain purified from bovine serum was covalently coupled through primary amino groups to a carboxymethyl dextran flow cell (CM5, BIACore) as recommended by the manufacturer. The coupling reaction was carried out for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The level of immobilization obtained was 13,000 resonance units corresponding to a surface concentration of 13 ng/mm2. A control dextran flow cell was prepared by blocking carboxymethyl groups with ethanolamine. Binding of CHO LIF, E. coli LIF, or IGFII was assayed at different concentrations from 5 nm to 1 μm in Hepes-buffered saline (BIACore) and at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Association was monitored for 10 min before initiating the dissociation phase for another 10 min with Hepes-buffered saline buffer. Regeneration of the flow cells was achieved with 5 mm HCl for 30 s. The resonance signal measured on the control flow cell was subtracted from the signal measured on the experimental flow cell. The resulting sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAEvaluation (BIACore) software. In the course of studies investigating the expression of gp190, gp130 and LIF receptors by various cell lines, a surprising observation was that the plasmocytoma cell line U266 expressed LIF receptors but did not bind anti-gp190 mAbs. Indeed, as shown in Fig.1 A, U266 cells display a single class of low affinity binding sites for glycosylated, CHO-derived LIF (24,200 sites/cell, Kd = 6, 9 nm) but no detectable binding of the anti-human gp190 mAb 1B4. This is in sharp contrast with Fig. 1 B, which shows that CHO cells transfected with human gp190 bind CHO LIF and 1B4 mAb with similar maximal binding capacities (11,500 and 11,700 sites/cell, respectively). Five other anti-gp190 mAbs, which have previously been shown to react with separate epitopes in addition to the one recognized by 1B4 (13Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Blanchard F. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Raher S. Hallet M.M. Moreau J.F. Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), also bound to gp190-CHO cells without detectable binding to U266 cells (data not shown). In agreement with previous results (18Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), U266 cells expressed 790 binding sites for the anti-gp130 mAb BR3 (Kd = 0.68 nm, Fig.1 A). Lack of gp190 expression by U266 cells was further confirmed at the transcriptional level. RT-PCR (Fig. 2) showed the absence of detectable human gp190 transcripts in U266 cells, using a cDNA probe that was positive on CHO-190 cells and on the gp190-positive choriocarcinoma JAR cell line. In order to further document this finding, competition experiments were performed. Fig. 3 A shows that glycosylated LIF binding to U266 cells was not affected by the anti-gp130 mAb BR3, a mAb that has previously been shown to block high affinity binding of all the cytokines using the gp130 molecule (19Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Muller Newen G. Roche C. Gu Z.J. Clement C. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), nor by the combination of anti-gp190 mAbs 1B4 and 1C7, two antibodies that have been shown to synergize for inhibiting the binding of glycosylated LIF to high affinity LIF receptor (14Blanchard F. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Raher S. Hallet M.M. Moreau J.F. Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) as well as the binding of glycosylated LIF to soluble gp190 molecule (13Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Control experiments (Fig. 3 B) showed that the combination of 1B4 and 1C7 did inhibit CHO LIF binding to gp190-CHO-transfected cells. Together, these data indicated that U266 cells expressed a low affinity LIF receptor unrelated to the gp190/LIF-Rβ component or to the gp130 signal transducer. Another surprising observation was that U266 cells did not bind non-glycosylated, E. coli-derived LIF (Fig. 1 A). This again was in sharp contrast to gp190-transfected CHO cells, which bound the non-glycosylated cytokine with a stoichiometry (11,200 sites/cell) similar to that for the glycosylated species (11,700 sites/cell) (Fig. 1 B). Additional experiments showed that treatment of glycosylated LIF with Endoglycosidase F, an enzyme that removes the N-linked carbohydrates, completely abrogated LIF binding to U266 cells, while leaving its binding to gp190-CHO cells unaffected (data not shown). We then analyzed whether E. coli LIF could compete for CHO LIF binding. As indicated in Fig. 3 A, CHO LIF binding to U266 cells was not affected by excess amounts of E. coliLIF, whereas similar amounts of E. coli LIF completely abolished CHO LIF binding to gp190-CHO cells (Fig. 3 B). Fig.3 C shows dose-response curves for inhibition of CHO LIF binding to U266 cells. E. coli LIF has no effect on this binding over a wide concentration range. As expected, unlabeled CHO LIF competes with its labeled counterpart with an IC50 (12 nm) in agreement with the Kd of CHO LIF binding to U266 cells (Kd = 6.9 nm; see Fig. 1 A). A glycosylated form of LIF immunopurified from cell culture supernatants of the A375 human melanoma cell line also competed with CHO LIF binding with efficiency similar to that for unlabeled CHO LIF. In contrast, natural glycosylated human IL-6 (purified from MG63 osteosarcoma cells) or glycosylated recombinant human IL-9 derived from insect cells were without effect on CHO LIF binding. These data reinforce the notion that the LIF receptor of U266 cells is unrelated to gp190. They further demonstrate that it specifically binds glycosylated forms of LIF, and suggest N-linked carbohydrate involvement in this binding. The JAR cell line has been previously shown in our laboratory to express both low and high affinity receptors for glycosylated LIF (10Heymann D. Godard A. Raher S. Bentouimou N. Blanchard F. Cherel M. Hallet M.M. Jacques Y. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M.

Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, the binding of glycosylated CHO LIF to JAR cells is characterized by a curvilinear Scatchard plot, which is resolved into two linear components: 2,400 high affinity sites with a Kd of 140 pmand 40,000 low affinity sites with a Kd of 14,2 nm. In contrast, non-glycosylated E. coli-derived LIF was found to bind to JAR cells with a linear Scatchard plot indicating the presence of a single class of high affinity binding sites (Kd = 112 pm) with a maximal capacity (2,300 sites/cell) being comparable to that of high affinity CHO LIF binding sites. Similarly, the anti-gp190 mAbs 1B4 bound to JAR cells with a single class of binding sites (Kd = 0.22 nm) and a maximal binding capacity (2,330 sites/cell) comparable to the number of E. coli LIF binding sites or CHO LIF high affinity binding sites and far less than the number of low affinity CHO LIF binding sites. Similar results were found with other anti-gp190 antibodies directed at separate epitopes (data not shown). These results indicated that most of the low affinity LIF receptors on JAR cells were not able to bindE. coli LIF and were different from gp190. The number of gp130 molecules on JAR cells, as measured by the binding of BR3 mAb, was in excess of the number of anti-gp190 mAb binding sites (8,200 sites/cell, Kd = 0.77 nm). Competition experiments on LIF binding to JAR cells were performed either with labeled E. coli LIF at 0.25 nm (Fig.4 D) or with labeled CHO LIF used either at 50 pmto label mainly the high affinity component (Fig. 4 C), or at 5 nm to label mainly the low affinity component (Fig.4 B). Results show that CHO LIF competed with E. coli LIF binding and, conversely, E. coli LIF competed with CHO LIF binding to its high affinity component. In contrast,E. coli LIF only displayed a low inhibitory effect (about 25%) on the CHO LIF low affinity component. In addition, whereas the anti-gp190 mAbs almost completely inhibited E. coli LIF binding and CHO LIF high affinity component (Fig. 4, D andC), they had little inhibitory effect (30%) on the CHO LIF low affinity component (Fig. 4 B). Together, these data indicate that the low affinity component on JAR cells behaves like the LIF receptor on U266 cells: no relation to gp190 and specific recognition of the glycosylated form of LIF. The effects of the anti-gp130 mAb BR3 were also analyzed (Fig. 4); as already observed on U266 cells, it had no significant effect on CHO LIF low affinity component, an observation that reinforces the similarity between U266 and JAR cells low affinity LIF receptors. On the contrary, BR3 displayed similar partial inhibitory effects on CHO LIF high affinity binding (about 50%) and E. coli LIF binding (about 65%). In a first attempt to investigate the spectrum of expression of such LIF receptors, a number of cell lines were evaluated for their binding capacities of CHO LIF and E. coli LIF. TableI shows that a number of cell lines, including U266, expressed fairly large numbers of CHO LIF binding sites in the absence of detectable (<50 sites/cell) binding sites forE. coli LIF. Other cell lines, including JAR cells, expressed CHO LIF binding sites in large excess to the number ofE. coli binding sites. The Epstein-Barr virus-transformed DAB lymphoblastoid B cell line was receptor-negative for both types of LIF.Table IDistribution of LIF receptors on different human cell linesTissue typeCell lineE. coli-LIF bindingCHO-LIF bindingsites/cellsites/cellPlacental choriocarcinomaJAR250042,000HepatocarcinomaHepG210030,000NeuroblastomaSKNSH50011,000KeratinocyteSVK148007000MyelomaLP11005000OsteosarcomaMG63NDaND, not detectable.40,000MyelomaU266ND24,000Ery"

In this study, the involvement of specific lysine residues in mannose phosphorylation of cathepsin D was explored by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of two lysine residues in the mature portion of the protein, Lys-203 and Lys-293, cooperated to inhibit mannose phosphorylation by 70%. Other positively charged residues could not substitute for lysine at these positions, and comparison of thermal denaturation curves for the wild type and mutant proteins indicated that the inhibition could not be explained by alterations in protein folding. Structural comparisons of the two lysine residues with those required for phosphorylation of cathepsin L, using models generated from recently acquired crystal structures, revealed several relevant similarities. On both molecules, the lysine residues were positioned approximately 34 Å apart (34.06 Å for cathepsin D and 33.80 Å for cathepsin L). When the lysine pairs were superimposed, N-linked glycosylation sites on the two proteins were found to be oriented so that oligosaccharides extending out from the sites could share a common region of space. Further similarities in the local environments of the critical lysines were also observed. These results provide details for a common lysosomal targeting structure based on a specific arrangement of lysine residues with respect to each other and to glycosylation sites on the surface of lysosomal proteins.

These results provide details for a common lysosomal targeting structure based on a specific arrangement of lysine residues with respect to each other and to glycosylation sites on the surface of lysosomal proteins. The mammalian lysosomal protein targeting system has the capability of recognizing and modifying lysosomal hydrolases and growth factors from a wide range of protein families with high specificity. The molecular basis for this selectivity is due to the activity of UDP-GlcNAc, lysosomal enzymeN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, which phosphorylates N-linked oligosaccharides of lysosomal proteins by the addition of phospho-GlcNAc (1Kornfeld S.

This modification begins after lysosomal proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and is followed by removal of terminal GlcNAc moieties and binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors as the proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus. The receptors mediate delivery of the phosphorylated proteins to the endosomal compartment, and from there the proteins are transported to lysosomes (for a review, see Ref.1Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Studies focusing on the molecular basis for mannose phosphorylation have shown that the phosphotransferase recognizes a protein-based structure or “signal” on lysosomal proteins and that this recognition is required for efficient phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro (5Lang L. Reitman M. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of this phosphorylation signal requires that the protein be in its native conformation (4Reitman M.L. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Analysis of the cathepsin D signal, using chimeras of cathepsin D and the nonphosphorylated homologous aspartic protease pepsinogen, defined a “minimal” structure for phosphorylation involving Lys-203 and a segment of 27 amino acids in the C-terminal region of the protein (7Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both portions are contained within a 1630-Å 2The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisr.m.s.root mean square. surface patch on cathepsin D, but it was unclear whether the entire surface was involved in recognition or just certain residues (8Baranski T.J. Koelsch G. Hartsuck J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23365-23372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments indicated that Lys-203 and other residues that were critical in the minimal structure were not as important in the context of the native protein and that additional elements in the N-terminal region of the protein also appeared to be involved (9Baranski T.J.

Thus, the specific amino acids involved directly in phosphotransferase recognition of this protein remained undefined. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis root mean square. Using a chemical modification approach, we have demonstrated that cathepsin L, cathepsin D, and preparations containing several other mannose-phosphorylated proteins require lysine residues for efficient phosphorylation (6Cuozzo J.W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that the propeptide of the cathepsin L precursor (procathepsin L), the form that interacts with phosphotransferase in vivo, contains critical elements of the recognition structure (11Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q.-L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of all cathepsin L lysine residues indicated that two lysine residues, Lys-54 and Lys-99, both of which are contained in the propeptide, play the major role in phosphorylation. Mutation of either residue effectively inhibits phosphorylation without causing noticeable changes in the overall structure of the protein (11Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q.-L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The chemical modification study also indicated that lysine residues are required for efficient phosphorylation of cathepsin D (11Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q.-L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This result has been explored further in this study by performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis of cathepsin D lysine residues as was done previously for cathepsin L. The results indicate that two lysine residues are also the primary determinants for phosphorylation of cathepsin D. Comparison of these residues with those of cathepsin L, using recently acquired crystal structures and molecular models for the proteins, has revealed several features of these lysine residues that are common to both proteins. These features provide the basis for a general model of the phosphotransferase recognition signal for further investigation. Endoglycosidase H and thermolysin (protease X) were purchased from Genzyme and Sigma, respectively. Cathepsin D was purified from human liver by the procedure of Gulnik et al. (12Gulnik S. Baldwin E.T. Tarasova N. Erickson J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two bands, corresponding to the heavy and light chains of cathepsin D, with no other apparent impurities, were observed by SDS-PAGE1 of the purified protein followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Antiserum to human cathepsin D was raised in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA) and was shown to specifically immunoprecipitate cathepsin D from biosynthetically labeled mouse 66cl4 breast tumor cells and COS cells transfected with human cathepsin D cDNA. The cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A and pepstatin A-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Human cathepsin D cDNA was provided by Dr. Andrej Hasilik (13Horst M. Hasilik A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the cDNA for glycosylated human pepsinogen (mPep1,2) was provided by Dr. Stuart Kornfeld (7Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Both the human cathepsin D cDNA and the glycosylated human pepsinogen cDNA were subcloned into the pED4 vector (14Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) for expression in COS-1 cells. The pED4 vector was modified by the insertion of a synthetic linker made from the complementary oligonucleotides GTCTAGAGAATTCGTCGACT and AATTAGTCGACGAATTCTCTAGACTGCA between the PstI and EcoRI cloning sites of pED4. The linker contains XbaI, EcoRI, andSalI sites, in 5′–3′ order, and eliminates the 3′EcoRI site into which it was cloned. The modified vector will be referred to as pED4L. Human cathepsin D cDNA (13Horst M. Hasilik A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in the pHH vector was excised with EcoRI and ligated into theEcoRI site in pED4L. The orientation of the subcloned cDNA was checked by restriction enzyme digestion. TheXbaI and SalI sites that flank theEcoRI site in the linker were used to transfer the cathepsin D cDNA to the pAlter vector for mutagenesis (described below) and to transfer the mutated cDNAs back into the pED4L vector for expression. Glycosylated human pepsinogen cDNA (mPep1,2) in the sp64 vector (Promega) (7Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was excised and transferred to pED4L as follows. mPep1,2 was cut out using EcoRI, and a partial PstI digest was performed to obtain a 1450-base pair segment that included the entire coding sequence. The cDNA was then inserted into thePstI and EcoRI sites in pED4L for expression in COS cells. Primers were designed to substitute alanine for lysine residues in the protein. Many of the primers also included “silent” mutations that did not alter the amino acid sequence but created new restriction sites in the cDNA so that the mutant clones could be isolated rapidly. The AAA codons of Lys-P31, Lys-47, Lys-109, and Lys-281 were changed to GCA, and AAG codons of Lys-P10, Lys-P36, Lys-8, Lys-58, Lys-63, Lys-69, Lys-120, Lys-130, Lys-158, Lys-189, Lys-192, Lys-203, Lys-223, Lys-249, Lys-267, Lys-277, Lys-284, Lys-293, Lys-299 were changed to GCG. Substitution mutations of Lys-203 to arginine and Lys-293 to arginine were made by changing the AAG codons to AGG. Lys-203 to glutamate was made by changing AAG to GAG, Lys-293 to glutamine by changing AAG to CAG, and Lys-203 to histidine by changing AAG to CAT. Mutagenesis was performed by the dual primer method, simultaneously introducing a site-directed mutation and antibiotic resistance to increase the yield of colonies containing mutant cDNAs, using the commercially available in vitro mutagenesis kit, Altered Sites II (Promega). The cathepsin D cDNA was excised from the pED4L vector using XbaI andSalI and inserted into the XbaI andSalI sites in the pAlter-1 vector (Promega) for mutagenesis. Double mutants were made by using two mutagenic primers simultaneously. Triple mutants were made by using a single mutagenic primer on a template that already contained the other two mutations of interest. Mutated cathepsin D cDNAs were excised with XbaI andSalI and transferred to the pED4L vector for expression in COS cells. Mutagenized DNAs were checked by restriction digestion and sequencing to ensure that only the expected mutations were introduced. COS cells were transiently transfected with pED4-cathepsin D or pED4-pepsinogen recombinants using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (15Kaufman R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured for 60 h prior to labeling and were labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine in low methionine medium (15Kaufman R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, labeling was for 6 h. Immunoprecipitation and 12.5% SDS-PAGE of procathepsin D and procathepsin D mutants was carried out using previously published methods described for cathepsin L (16Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.-L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For quantitation of phosphorylation, transfected cells were double-labeled for 6 h with both 0.1 mCi/ml [3H]leucine and 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate, and mutant or wild type cathepsin D proteins were immunoprecipitated. Ovalbumin (10 μg) was added to each immunoprecipitate, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as above. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue. Ovalbumin (45,000 Da) migrated 0.5 cm below the human cathepsin D precursor in the gel system used and was used as a marker for the position of the cathepsin D bands. Cathepsin D-containing bands were excised from the wet gel, and the labeled cathepsin D proteins were extracted from the gel slices by overnight incubation on a rocking platform in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH at room temperature. After neutralization with HCl, the amount of32P and 3H in each band was determined by dual label scintillation counting in Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics). Pepstatin A-agarose affinity chromatography was performed as described by Conner (17Conner G.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aliquots (100 μl) of conditioned media from COS cells transfected with cathepsin D or cathepsin D mutant plasmids and labeled with [35S]methionine were diluted to 1.0 ml with binding buffer composed of 0.2 m sodium formate, pH 3.5, 0.4m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, with or without 1 μm pepstatin A. This solution was applied to a 2-cm column of pepstatin A-agarose in a glass Pasteur pipette that had been preequilibrated in binding buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer and then eluted with the same volume of elution buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.3, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100. Both the column washes and eluates were then immunoprecipitated using cathepsin D antisera. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Conformations of cathepsin D and cathepsin D mutants were probed by proteolysis with thermolysin (18Hecht M.H. Nelson H.C.M. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2676-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Hecht M.H. Sturtevant J.M. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5685-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant cathepsin D proteins were first expressed in COS cells and labeled with [35S]methionine for 6 h in serum-free media using the method described above. For thermolysin treatment, 10 μl of medium containing the protein to be analyzed was incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 μg of thermolysin at various temperatures for 30 min, in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm, and the amount of remaining labeled protein was quantitated after SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager analysis. Proteolysis using chymotrypsin gave results similar to those for thermolysin digestion. Human procathepsin D and mouse procathepsin L were modeled from known crystal structures using the program MODELLER (20Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10562) Google Scholar) as part of QUANTA, a molecular modeling software package marketed by Molecular Simulations. MODELLER uses the satisfaction of spatial restraints derived from known template structures to model the three-dimensional structure of proteins with high sequence homology to the template. MODELLER is generally capable of predicting protein structure to within a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of approximately 1 Å when the sequences of the target and template structure display greater than 40% identity (21Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Such structures are comparable with medium resolution structures obtained by x-ray crystallography. In order to test MODELLER's ability to predict protein structure for the two cathepsins, we used it to model two known cathepsin structures: (i) the mature portion of human cathepsin D from the 1.8-Å resolution structure of porcine pepsin (22Sielecki A.R. Fedorov A.A. Boodhoo A. Andreeva N.S. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whose sequence is 51% identical to human cathepsin D, and (ii) the mature portion of human procathepsin L from papain (1.65-Å resolution) and actinidin (1.7-Å resolution) that are 36.9 and 39.9% identical to human cathepsin L, respectively. A total of 10 models, each beginning with different initial conformations and fitted to the calculated structural constraints by a variable target function, were generated and evaluated by MODELLER by the calculation of an objective function for each model. The objective function is inversely related to the probability that a certain model is valid based on comparison with a number of features of the template including bond lengths, bond angles, main chain dihedral angles, van der Waals contacts, Cα–Cα distances, main chain N–O distances, side chain dihedral angles, and features of disulfide bridge bonds (20Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10562) Google Scholar). Comparison of the best modeled structure (i.e. the one with the lowest objective function) with the known crystal structure for cathepsin D (23Baldwin E.T. Bhat T.N. Gulnik S. Hosur M.V. Sowder R.C. Cachau R.E. Collins J. Silva A.M. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6796-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and cathepsin L (33Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) gave r.m.s. values of 0.845 and 1.163 Å, respectively. These values are similar to r.m.s. values obtained by Sali and Blundell (20Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10562) Google Scholar) for models of trypsin using known structures for elastase and tonin. From this investigation, we concluded that the MODELLER program was capable of generating reasonably accurate models for the mature portions cathepsins D and L and would probably produce similarly accurate models for the proenzyme forms of these proteins. For construction of the procathepsin D model, the 1.8-Å resolution crystal structure of porcine pepsinogen (24James M.N.G. Sielecki A.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Sielecki A.R. Fujinaga M. Read R.J. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 671-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The pepsinogen sequence is 48% identical to the procathepsin D sequence and is 64% similar, based on alignment using the method of Needleman and Wunsch (26Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7806) Google Scholar). The final model for procathepsin D based on pepsinogen was selected on the basis of having the least structural violations with respect to the original template as determined by MODELLER, using the objective function as described above for the mature cathepsin D structure. Comparison of the model to matching residues on the crystal structure of mature cathepsin D gave a r.m.s. value of 1.11 Å, similar to the 1.38-Å value reported for a previously published model of procathepsin D (28Koelsch G. Metcalf P. Vetvicka V. Fusek M. Takahashi K. Aspartic Proteinases: Structure, Function, Biology and Biomedical Implications. Plenum Press, New York1995: 273-278Google Scholar). Initially, several structures including pepsin, pepsinogen, progastricin, and mature cathepsin D were evaluated alone and in combination as templates for the procathepsin D model. Of these, pepsinogen alone was found to give the lowest r.m.s. value. Similarly, the mouse procathepsin L model was constructed from the 2.2-Å resolution crystal structure of human procathepsin L (33Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Ménard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The sequence of the mouse protein is 77.1% identical to the human protein. Comparison of the model with the matching residues on the crystal structure of human procathepsin L gave a r.m.s. deviation of 0.765 Å. For examining potential hydrogen bonds in the proteins, polar hydrogens were added with QUANTA and minimized while the rest of the structure was fixed. COS-1 cells were transfected with human cathepsin D cDNA, and after biosynthetic labeling with [35S]methionine for 6 h, the expressed protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and media using antiserum directed against human liver cathepsin D (Fig.1 A). A large portion of the labeled newly synthesized cathepsin D precursor was secreted, presumably due to saturation of intracellular mannose 6-phosphate receptors, a condition that often occurs when lysosomal proteins are overexpressed in these cells (36Stearns N.A. Dong J.M. Pan J.-X. Brenner D.A. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Most of the expressed protein is secreted, since labeling in the presence of 10 mm ammonium chloride, which diverts newly synthesized lysosomal proteins to the constitutive secretory pathway, did not cause a further increase in secretion (data not shown). Treatment of 32P-labeled cathepsin D with endoglycosidase H indicated that phosphorylation of the expressed protein was restricted to its oligosaccharides (Fig.1 B). Although not shown, the expressed human protein was phosphorylated as well as the low levels of endogenous cathepsin D detected in media, indicating that the COS cell phosphotransferase was capable of efficiently phosphorylating the overexpressed protein. Glycopepsinogen, a nonlysosomal aspartic protease engineered to contain an N-linked oligosaccharide (7Baranski T.J. Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1990; 63: 281-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), was inefficiently phosphorylated (<2%), indicating that nonspecific phosphorylation of aspartic proteases does not occur to any appreciable extent in this system (Fig. 1 B). Previous protein modification experiments indicated that lysine residues are required for phosphorylation of cathepsin D (11Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q.-L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine which of the 23 lysine residues were involved, each lysine residue was converted individually to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant cDNAs were transfected into COS cells and transiently expressed. Direct quantitation of the level of phosphorylation of each mutant was performed by double labeling the cells with [3H]leucine and [32P]PO4 (Fig.2). Two lysine to alanine mutations significantly decreased phosphorylation. Mutation of Lys-203 and Lys-293 reduced phosphorylation by 42 and 13%, respectively. As observed for the wild-type protein both mutants were efficiently expressed and secreted by the cells (data not shown). Since alanine mutations at Lys-203 and Lys-293 individually decreased phosphorylation, a Lys-203/Lys-293 double mutant (DA mutant) was constructed to test the effect of both mutations together. When the DA mutant was expressed, phosphorylation was reduced by 69% compared with wild-type cathepsin D (Fig. 3). Replacement of the lysine residues with arginine (DR mutant) did not substitute for lysines, and replacement with the homologous pepsinogen residues (Lys-203 to glutamate and Lys-293 to glutamine; DP mutant) decreased phosphorylation by 77%. The double mutant result highlights the importance of the two lysine residues by showing that they can account for a major portion of the interaction between cathepsin D and the phosphotransferase. Various substitutions were made at position 203 to test the nature of the involvement of lysine at this position. The cationic character of lysine appears to be important for recognition, since substitution with negatively charged glutamate at position 203 causes a 15% decrease in phosphorylation, while positively charged arginine results in a 19% increase relative to the alanine mutation. Histidine had a slight inhibitory effect (Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that a similar arginine substitution at position 293 did not increase phosphorylation relative to the Lys-293 to alanine mutation. While other explanations are possible, this observation is consistent with the notion that the two lysines interact with similar but different binding sites on the phosphotransferase. Overall, while the positive charge appears to be important, there is clearly a preference for lysine at both positions. The double lysine to alanine mutation was phosphorylated at a 31% level relative to the wild type protein. This residual phosphorylation cannot be readily explained as a nonspecific effect, since phosphorylation of a glycosylated derivative of pepsinogen, a related aspartyl protease, was barely detectable (<2% of wild type cathepsin D). The best explanation for the residual phosphorylation is that additional phosphorylation signals exist on cathepsin D. A similar conclusion was reached previously by Baranski et al. on the basis of their data (9Baranski T.J. Cantor A.B. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23342-23348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because chemical modification of lysine residues completely eliminates phosphorylation of cathepsin D (6Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that some lysine residues may function cryptically and become more prominent when the primary signal was ablated. To examine this possibility, triple lysine to alanine mutants were constructed from the double lysine mutant (DA) and examined for phosphorylation. Further decreases of 10–12% were observed for residues Lys-120, Lys-130, and Lys-223 relative to the double mutant (Fig. 5). Because mannose phosphorylation is sensitive to the three-dimensional structure of the protein, it is important to evaluate the effects of mutations on protein folding (6Cuozzo J.W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q.-L. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol.

Consistent with normal folding, all mutants that showed decreased phosphorylation in this study were efficiently secreted from COS cells. All double mutants t"

(1992) EMBO J. 11, 4197–4203). To analyze the potential retention signal of b5, mutant proteins were prepared to replace each domain with natural or artificial sequences, and subcellular localizations were examined using immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation. The transmembrane domain functioned to retain the cytochrome in the ER, and the mutation of all or part of the transmembrane domain with an artificial hydrophobic sequence had practically no effect on intracellular distribution of the cytochrome. However, when the transmembrane domain was extended systematically, a substantial portion of the protein with the domain of over 22 amino acid residues leaked from the organelle. Thus, the transmembrane length functions as the retention signal. When cytochromes with mutations at the carboxyl-terminal end were overexpressed in cells, a substantial portion of the protein was transported to the plasma membrane, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal luminal domain also has a role in retention of b5 in the ER. Carbohydrate moiety of the glycosylatably-mutated b5 was sensitive to endoglycosidase H but resistant to endoglycosidase D. Therefore, both transmembrane and carboxyl-terminal portions seems to function as the static retention signal. Cytochrome b5 (b5), a typical tail-anchored protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, is composed of three functionally different domains: amino-terminal heme-containing catalytic, central hydrophobic membrane-anchoring, and carboxyl-terminal ER-targeting domains (Mitoma, J., and Ito, A.

It is widely accepted that proteins destined for localization in these organelles or for secretion are co- or post-translationally inserted into the ER and transported from the ER by a default pathway, in which resident proteins are selectively retained by specific signals (1Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar).

The transmembrane domain has recently been demonstrated as another retrieval signal for Sec12p, since chimeric proteins containing this domain were localized in the ER and hadcis-Golgi α1–6 mannosylated carbohydrates (11Nishikawa S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to these motifs, some proteins in the ER seem to require two signals in different portions in the molecule. Sönnichsenet al. (13Sönnichsen B. Füllekerug J. Van Nguyen P. Diekmann W. Robinson D.G. Miekskes G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the calreticulin mutant, which lacked the Ca2+ binding domain but included the KDEL sequence, escaped from the ER to a much greater extent. The mutant protein that changed the carboxyl-terminal portion of Wbp1 from KK to QQ or SS was retained in the ER, without acquiring Golgi specific carbohydrate modifications (8Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). For Sec12p, an amino-terminal portion of the protein was reported to participate in static retention in the ER (12Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), thereby indicating that transmembrane and amino-terminal domains of Sec12p seem to function independently as retrieval and retention signals, respectively. Cytochrome b5 (b5), a typical tail-anchored protein of the ER membrane, is composed of three functionally different domains: amino-terminal heme-containing catalytic, central hydrophobic membrane-anchoring, and carboxyl-terminal ER-targeting domains (14Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although Pedrazzini et al. (15Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown that insertion of five amino acids into the transmembrane domain of b5 resulted in localization of the mutant protein on the cell surface, it has remained to be determined how long the transmembrane domain can retain b5 in the ER, whether another portion of the cytochrome has a retention signal, and how these portions function as signals. We now report that both transmembrane and luminal domains function as static retention signals of b5 to the ER and that fewer than 22 amino acid residues of the transmembrane domain have a major role in retaining b5 in the ER.

A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) or polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using Sequenase, then were inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors pSVL, pcDNA, or pSG5. cDNA fragments of OMb and b5 were inserted in tandem into M13mp18 to obtain M13mp18OMb-B5. Deletions of nucleotides coding the last 10 amino acids of OMb and the catalytic and transmembrane domains of b5, the transmembrane and last 10 amino acids of OMb and catalytic domain of b5, and the last 22 amino acids of OMb and the 1st methionine to 115th isoleucine of b5 were done to obtain OMbC10, OMbB5, and TMOMbB5, respectively, using appropriate oligonucleotides. Nucleotides coding the last 18 amino acids of b5 and the 1st methionine to 89th proline of OMbC10 were deleted from M13mp18B5-OMbC10, using an appropriate oligonucleotide. The nucleotides coding a part of the transmembrane domain of b5 were exchanged using oligonucleotides coding amino acid sequences shown in Fig. 1 C. Mutants containing an artificial hydrophobic transmembrane domain of various lengths were constructed from the M13mp18B5Syn20C10 (14Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because this protein has a 22-amino acid transmembrane domain (105LQLALLALAILALLALLSTLMY126), including residues derived from the b5 molecule, it was designated as B5Syn22C7 instead of B5Syn20C10. To construct B5Syn24C7, B5Syn26C7, and B5Syn28C7, amino acids AL, ALAL, and ALALAL were inserted between leucine 121 and serine 122 of B5Syn22C7, using oligonucleotides corresponding to these amino acids. To construct B5Syn20C7 and B5Syn18C7, LL-(120–121) and LALL-(118–121) were deleted from the B5Syn22C7, using oligonucleotides. To construct a N-linked glycosylation site at the carboxyl-terminal portion of b5 and B5syn26C7, T7 (MASMTGGQQMG) or c-myc (EQKLISEEDL) peptide and glycosylating sequence were introduced by polymerase chain reaction, using oligonucleotides corresponding to these amino acids and the M13 universal primer with pBluescriptSK(+)b5 and B5syn26C7 as a template. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DNA transfection was carried out as described (14Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using cationic liposomes (17Ito A. Miyazoe R. Mitoma J. Akao T. Osaki T. Kunitake T. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 36 h after transfecting the plasmid into the cells. Cells cultured in three 10-cm diameter dishes were harvested in ice-cold STE (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin, pH 8.0). The suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was homogenized gently in 1 ml of STE buffer using a Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove nuclear and unbroken cells, and the pellet was gently homogenized again in 0.5 ml of STE buffer, then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The first and second supernatants (1.5 ml) were then layered over sucrose layers consisting of 0.5 ml of 2 m sucrose solution, 9 ml of linear gradient from 1.5 m to 0.65 m sucrose solution, 1.0 ml of 0.5 m sucrose solution, and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 8 to 10 h in an RPS-40T rotor (Hitachi), or 1 ml of postnuclear supernatants was placed in discontinuous sucrose layers consisting of 0.5 ml of 2 m, 3 ml of 1.1 m, 5.5 ml of 0.6 m, and 1 ml of 0.5 m sucrose solution, instead of linear gradient, and centrifuged under the same conditions. Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and designated as fraction numbers 1 to 11. The amount of b5 and derivatives expressed in the transfected cells was estimated using immunoblot analysis. The subcellular fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer of the proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. Rabbit antibodies against b5 and OMb and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were used for the primary and secondary antibody, respectively. Amounts of proteins were measured using a densitometer. Immunofluorescence microscopy was done as described elsewhere (2Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 14Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the second antibody. After homogenization of COS cells expressing the glycosylatably-mutated b5s, membrane fractions were prepared by centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatants at 100,000 ×g for 20 min. In endoglycosidase H digestion, the membrane fraction (25 μg) suspended in citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.02% SDS, 0.02 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was treated overnight with 2.5 milliunits of the enzyme at 37 °C. For N-glycosidase F digestion, the membrane fraction (25 μg) suspended in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.15% SDS, 0.03 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.2% Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA was digested overnight with 2 milliunits of the enzyme at 37 °C. Endoglycosidase D was done at 37 °C overnight in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extent of digestion was estimated by immunoblot analysis, as described above. Documented methods were used to assay NADPH-cytochrome P450 α-mannosidase II, alkaline phosphodiesterase I, and glutathioneS-transferase activities (19Omura T. Takesue S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1970; 67: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 20Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a specific amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain of b5 serves as the retention signal, we constructed several mutant proteins, in which all or half of the transmembrane portion of the cytochrome was substituted by a corresponding sequence of OMb, which is a b5-like hemeprotein of the outer mitochondrial membrane and has a similar molecular architecture (21Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1980; 87: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Hydrophilic catalytic portion and both hydrophilic and transmembrane portions of b5 were replaced with the corresponding portions of OMb to obtain OMbB5 and OMbC10, respectively. While in the mutants, TMOMbB5 and TMB5OMBC10, the transmembrane domains consist of the amino-terminal half of the domain in OMb and the carboxyl-terminal half of that in b5 and vice versa, respectively. All mutant proteins were constructed to have an ER-targeting signal at the carboxyl-terminals. Subcellular localization of the original and mutant proteins in the COS cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.1 B). In cells expressing the original b5, the reticular staining pattern characteristic of the ER was observed, indicating that the recombinant rat b5 was targeted correctly in the cells. OMbB5 and TMOMbB5 had the same staining pattern as that of b5, whereas the plasma membrane, in addition to the ER, was stained in cells expressing OMbC10 and TMB5OMbC10. Thus, proteins that have the transmembrane domain of b5, B5 and OMbB5, showed a typical ER pattern, and a portion of the protein lacking this domain, OMbC10, could not be retained in the ER membrane. Our observations mean that the transmembrane domain of b5 has an important role in retaining the cytochrome in the ER. To determine whether the ER retention signal consists of a specific amino acid sequence, the transmembrane segment of b5 was subdivided into four portions and each portion was replaced with an artificial hydrophobic sequence of ALALA (AL1–3) or AAA (AL4) (Fig.1 C). Subcellular distributions of the mutant proteins in COS cells are shown in Fig. 1 D. Because all the mutant proteins are located only in the ER membrane, the retention signal obviously does not reside in a specific amino acid sequence. Although definition of the absolute length or number of amino acids of the transmembrane domain is difficult, one difference between b5 and OMbC10 or TMB5OMbC10 is length of the hydrophobic stretch; B5 and TMOMbB5 have 19 and 18 amino acids, respectively, whereas OMbC10 and TMB5OMbC10 have 21 and 22 residues, respectively. Although Pedrazzini et al. (15Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) found that the insertion of five amino acids into the transmembrane domain of b5 resulted in localization of the mutant protein on the cell surface, it remained unknown how long the domain can function as the retention signal. We then systematically constructed derivatives with an artificial hydrophobic sequence of various lengths of 18 to 28, instead of the transmembrane segment of b5 (Fig.2 A). A mutant with the transmembrane segment of 18 amino acids was constructed using an artificial sequence of 15 hydrophobic amino acid residues and three hydrophobic residues derived from the b5 molecule. We termed the mutant B5syn18C7, instead of B5syn15C10, to indicate length of the transmembrane domain. A typical ER pattern of fluorescence was observed with cells expressing B5syn18C7 and B5syn20C7 (Fig. 2 B,a and b). In cells expressing B5syn22C7 and B5syn24C7, both the tubular network around the nucleus and edge of the cell was usually stained (Fig. 2 B, c andd). In some cells, the cell surface was stained and there was little tubular net work (data not shown). When the transmembrane segment was extended further, B5syn26C7 and B5syn28C7, the cell surface was stained (Fig. 2 B, e and f). When the non-permeabilized cells expressing B5syn24C7 and B5syn26C7 were treated with anti-peptide antibody against the carboxyl-terminal 7 amino acids located inside the ER vesicles (18Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the plasma membrane was clearly stained. Thus, the mutant proteins were inserted into the membrane with a correct topology (Fig. 2 B, g andh). Location of b5 with the transmembrane segment of 24 amino acids in Golgi and plasma membrane was confirmed by subfractionation experiments, using sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the cell lysates, followed by immunochemical quantitation (Fig. 2 C). The figure shows distributions of b5 and the derivatives as well as those of marker enzyme activities, NADPH-cytochrome P450 α-mannosidase II, alkaline phosphodiesterase I, and glutathioneS-transferase for the ER membrane, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and cytosol, respectively. The patterns of distribution of B5 and B5syn20C7 were the same as that for NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, confirming that these proteins were exclusively localized in the ER membrane. As the transmembrane segment was longer, a larger amount of the protein was recovered in the Golgi and plasma membrane fractions, as expected from the immunocytochemical study, although some portion of the protein remained in the ER fraction, even in mutants of B5syn24C7 and B5syn26C7. The carboxyl-terminal hydrophilic domain functions as the ER-targeting signal of b5 and is exposed on the luminal side of the ER vesicle (14Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,18Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Vergeres G. Ramsden J. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3414-3422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When the c-myc peptide was attached to the carboxyl-terminal end of b5, the mutants were precisely targeted to the ER and inserted into the membrane in a topologically correct orientation (18Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, a substantial portion of the protein leaked from the ER, in case of overexpression using the pSG5 vector, instead of pSVL, although the wild type cytochrome was strictly localized to the ER (18Kuroda R. Kinoshita J. Honsho M. Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) under the same conditions (see Fig. 3 B). To confirm participation of the carboxyl-terminal portion on the retention of b5 in the ER, we constructed several mutant proteins, B5Rev and B5syn26Rev, in which the carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids were arranged in the reverse order (Fig. 3 A). Cells expressing B5C7Rev stained the plasma membrane, in addition to the ER (Fig. 3 B). Subcellular fractionation showed that a larger amount of B5syn26C7Rev was recovered in Golgi and plasma membrane fractions, compared with the finding for B5syn26C7 (Fig.3 C). Change in amino acid sequence of the luminal domain of B5syn26C7 did not affect resistance of proteins to alkaline treatment of the membranes (data not shown). These observations suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the cytochrome participates in retention in the ER, probably by a mechanism independent of that of the transmembrane domain. To investigate amino acid residue(s) in the carboxyl-terminal portion responsible for retention of b5 in the ER, some well conserved amino acids (23Zhang H. Somerville C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were mutated to other residues (Fig. 3 D). Replacement of tyrosine 130, a residue completely conserved among cytochromes for various animal species, with serine had essentially no effect on retention of the cytochrome (Fig. 3 E). Substantially the same results were obtained in the case of substitution of three carboxyl-terminal charged residues, arginine 128, glutamic acid 133, and aspartic acid 134 for neutral or counterionic residues (Fig. 3 E). The ER location of membrane proteins is achieved by retrieval or combination of static retention and retrieval mechanisms (2Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 3Pelham H.R.B. Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J.

To investigate whether b5 is statically retained or retrieved from the post-ER compartments, we added an Asn glycosylation site to the carboxyl-terminal end of the original b5 and mutants that are known to leave the ER and analyzed the glycosidase sensitivity. Because the N-glycosylation site should be at least 12–14 amino acids away from the membrane spanning segment (24Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), T7 or c-myc antigen peptides consisting of 11 or 10 amino acids, respectively, and 5 amino acid peptides with an Asn glycosylation motif were fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of B5 and B5syn26C7 (Fig.4 A) and expressed in COS cells, using a pcDNA vector. The typical ER pattern of the immunofluorescence staining was observed in cells expressing B5T7Glyc (Fig. 4 B). The same staining patterns were observed with B5cmycGlyc (data not shown). Therefore these modifications at the carboxyl-terminal end did not affect intracellular localization of the proteins. B5T7Glyc and B5cmycGlyc gave a single band on SDS-PAGE and were sensitive to both endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F and converted to a band about 3 kDa smaller (Fig. 4 C). Thereby they must remain as a glycoprotein of the high mannose type. On the other hand, B5syn26C7T7Glyc and B5syn26C7cmycGlyc gave higher molecular mass bands (25Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartman E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) as well as a band about 3 kDa larger than the non-glycosylated form, although in these cases a non-glycosylated form was sometimes observed (Fig. 4 C). The higher molecular weight bands were sensitive toN-glycosidase F but resistant to endoglycosidase H, whereas the lower band was sensitive to both endoglycosidases, as in the case of B5T7Glyc and B5cmycGlyc, indicating that proteins with higher molecular weight contain complex-type oligosaccharides. This implies that once proteins leak out from the ER to the latter compartment the proteins can be modified by the sugar chain to a complex type and that the molecule found in the ER is retained in the organelle without recycling. To confirm static retention of b5 in the ER, the fused protein was subjected to endoglycosidase D digestion. When Asn-linked glycosylated protein is transported to the cis-Golgi compartment, the oligosaccharide is converted from GlcNAc2Man8to GlcNAc2Man5 by mannosidase I which is located in the cis-Golgi compartment (26Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase D is active only to the latter structure, although endoglycosidase H digests both types (26Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27Mizuochi T. Amano J. Kobata A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, both B5T7Glyc and B5cmycGlyc were resistant to endoglycosidase D. The finding confirms that b5 is statically retained in the ER, without recycling. We propose that both transmembrane and carboxyl-terminal portions function as the static retention signal. We obtained evidence that retention of b5 in the ER membrane depends on both transmembrane and carboxyl-terminal luminal domains of the molecule and not on the cytoplasmic domain, although the transmembrane domain does have a major effect. Mutation of all or part of the transmembrane domain with an artificial hydrophobic sequence had practically no effect on the intracellular distribution of the cytochrome, whereas lengthening this domain by four or more residues greatly reduced retention in the ER. We thus concluded that length of the transmembrane serves as the retention signal and that there are no key residues responsible for the retention in the domain. Pedrazziniet al. (15Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion from data that insertion of five amino acids into the transmembrane domain of b5 resulted in localization of the mutant protein to the cell surface. Although the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain of b5 is highly homologous among sequences from various animal species (23Zhang H. Somerville C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) there are no known common amino acid sequences in the transmembrane domains between b5 and other ER membrane proteins (28Shibahara S.

Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the sequence of the transmembrane domain of OMb (33De Silvertis M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)2 (Fig. 1) is similar to that of b5, but the mutant with the transmembrane domain of OMb moved forward to the distal organelles in the secretory pathway. These observations lend support to our conclusion. Although it is difficult to define the absolute length or number of amino acids of the transmembrane domain, we calculated b5 to have 19 amino acid residues (14Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Progressive lengthening of the sequence resulted in an increased leakage of proteins from the ER, and a substantial portion of the protein with the domain of 22 residues was no longer retained in the ER. Addition of residues in the transmembrane domain of UBC6, a tail-anchored membrane protein in yeast, affected the efficiency of retention of the protein in the ER (34Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Length of the transmembrane domain of membrane proteins, at least of tail-anchored proteins, seems to be a general feature required for retention. The transmembrane domain of b5 seems to function as a static retention signal, not a retrieval one, although that of Sec12p was reported to function as a retrieval signal and the retrieval depended on Rer1p, a receptor protein (12Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A lipid-based mechanism has been proposed for transmembrane domain-mediated retention, as first stated by Munro (35Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The mixed lipid populations in the intracellular membrane would separate into lipid microdomains with distinct compositions, thickness, and degree of structural perturbability, and proteins would selectively partition into one domain and so be prevented from entering transport vesicles comprising the other domain by virtue of physical properties of their transmembrane domains (36Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 37Masibay A.S. Balaji P.V. Boeggeman E.E. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ER is the start of the secretory pathway and it has a lipid composition differing from the plasma membrane (38Van Meer G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The ER has low levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids, which creates a flexible environment suitable for insertion, modification, and assembly of proteins. There is no known mechanism to distinguish differences in length of transmembrane domains by three amino acid residues. When proteins moving through the pathway encounter points where the bilayer composition changes from ER-like to plasma membrane-like, proteins with a longer transmembrane domain would preferentially move forward. In this case, the shorter transmembrane domain, which is responsible for ER retention, seems to be a default signal, and the longer transmembrane domain may possibly have an affinity for cholesterol and/or sphingolipids and be selectively collected into forward-moving cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich vesicles. The present results also show that the carboxyl-terminal luminal domain of b5, in addition to the transmembrane one, has a role in its retention in the ER membrane. Because a fused protein in which the carboxyl-terminal portion of b5 was attached to the carboxyl-terminal end of syntaxin IA (39Bennet M.K. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 40Inoue A. Obata K. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a plasma membrane protein, could not be retained in the ER, this portion may be weak as the retention signal; the transmembrane domain seems to function as the major signal. The signal in the carboxyl-terminal portion appears to work as a static retention signal, like the transmembrane domain, since no Golgi-type carbohydrate moiety was evident in the mutant b5 present in the ER. In conclusion, both transmembrane and carboxyl-terminal luminal domains function as a static retention signal of b5 to the ER, and length of the transmembrane domain apparently has a major effect on the retention. Whether each domain functions independently or concertedly, how length of the transmembrane domain is measured, and how proteins are sorted in the ER remain to be subjects of ongoing studies."
https://openalex.org/W2107400489,"The protein WrbA had been identified as anEscherichia coli stationary-phase protein that copurified and coimmunoprecipitated with the tryptophan repressor. Sequences homologous to WrbA have been reported in several species of yeast and plants. We previously showed that this new family of proteins displays low but structurally significant sequence similarity with flavodoxins and that its members are predicted to share the α/β core of the flavodoxin fold but with a short conserved insertion unique to the new family, which could account for reports that some family members may be dimeric in solution. The general sequence similarity to flavodoxins suggests that the members of the new family might bind FMN, but their wide evolutionary distribution indicates that, unlike the flavodoxins, these proteins may be ubiquitous. In this paper, we report the purification and biochemical characterization of WrbA, demonstrating that the protein binds FMN specifically and is a multimer in solution. The FMN binding constant is weaker than for many flavodoxins, being ∼2 μm at 25 °C in 0.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The protein participates in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium over a wide range of solution conditions, with a midpoint at approximately 1.4 μm. One FMN binds per monomer and has no apparent effect on the multimerization equilibrium. WrbA has no effect on the affinity or mode of DNA binding by the tryptophan repressor; thus, its physiological role remains unclear. Although many proteins with flavodoxin-like domains are known to be multimers, WrbA is apparently the first characterized case in which multimerization is associated directly with the flavodoxin-like domain itself.

One FMN binds per monomer and has no apparent effect on the multimerization equilibrium. WrbA has no effect on the affinity or mode of DNA binding by the tryptophan repressor; thus, its physiological role remains unclear. Although many proteins with flavodoxin-like domains are known to be multimers, WrbA is apparently the first characterized case in which multimerization is associated directly with the flavodoxin-like domain itself. WrbA was first identified by Somerville and co-workers (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as a protein that copurified and coimmunoprecipitated with the tryptophan (Trp) repressor, TrpR. By band-shift assay, those workers concluded that WrbA influences the binding of TrpR to its operator sequence and that WrbA alone does not bind to that DNA. On this evidence, the protein was named tryptophan (W)-repressorbinding protein A. Sequence analysis and homology-based structural modeling (2Grandori R. Carey J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggested that WrbA was very likely to share the α/β twisted open-sheet fold characteristic of flavodoxins. Comparisons with flavodoxins and with the protein sequence data base (3Grandori R. Carey J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19 (107): 72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) identified WrbA as the founding member of a new class of flavodoxin-like proteins containing a well conserved insertion of 24 residues following predicted strand β4. Two other Escherichia coli proteins, MioC and the hypothetical protein YihB, are members of the new family but are more closely related to flavodoxins than to other family members, and both lack an insertion in this region. This insertion is itself predicted to form an additional α/β segment and is a strong candidate to be the structural element responsible for experimental reports that WrbA (Ref. 1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and this work) and its homolog in yeast, Ycp4 (4Toda T. Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yamano H. Adachi Y. Shirakawa M. Kyogoku Y. Yangida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5474-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), are dimeric in solution. The modeling results also suggested that the protein presents an active site crevice that could be suitable for flavin binding but with some notable differences from typical flavodoxins, making FMN binding a weak prediction and implying that experimental characterization of ligand binding by WrbA might reveal interesting features. These intriguing leads, coupled with the possibility that this protein might influence a thoroughly studied metabolic regulon, motivated the present biochemical characterization of WrbA. E. coli JM101 (Δlac pro supE thi/F′traD36 proAB + lacIq ZΔM15) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The expression strainE. coli CY15071(λ DE3) (ΔtrpRthr tnaA2 lacI q λDE3) was constructed (5Lavoie T.A. Molecular Origin of Specificity and Cooperativity in the trp Repressor System. Ph. D. dissertation. Princeton University, 1996Google Scholar) by lysogenizing CY15071 (6Paluh J.L. Yanofsky C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7851-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with bacteriophage λ (DE3) obtained from Novagen, Inc., according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genomic DNA was prepared from JM101 with the QIAamp tissue kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol for bacterial growth. 1 μg of DNA was used as template for 25 cycles of polymerase chain reaction amplification. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used as primers were as follows: 5′ CACACATATGGCTAAAGTTCTGGT 3′ (upstream of WrbA gene) and 5′ CACAGGATCCTTAGCCGTTAAGTTTAAC 3′ (downstream of WrbA gene). Start and stop codons are indicated in bold. Added restriction sites for cloning are underlined (NdeI upstream, BamHI downstream). The 596-base pairNdeI-BamHI fragment resulting from polymerase chain reaction amplification was cloned into the corresponding sites of pET3a (New England Biolabs), resulting in plasmid pKGWa. The DNA sequence was determined with the chain-terminator method (7Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar). One difference was found from the published sequence (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar): bases 711 and 712 of GenEMBL M99166 are given as CG, whereas we read GC. This change also implies a change from Ala to Gly at residue 141 of WrbA protein. Such an alteration is not likely to be the result of polymerase chain reaction amplification, and other members of the family have Gly at that position in the sequence, so it seems likely that the sequence in the data base should reflect this correction. For preparation of total protein extracts, cells were collected, washed with water, lysed by resuspension in the electrophoresis loading buffer (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and microfuged at 14,000 rpm. The soluble material was used for electrophoresis. Discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar) in a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus at 12% acrylamide concentration. After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with Coomassie R (1 g/liter in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) or blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 10 mm CHAPS, 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albumin. pH 11, 10% methanol for sequencing. N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation and amino acid analysis of proteins were performed by the staff of the Princeton University Molecular Biology Department sequencing facility using standard methods. 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin. Cells were collected from 1.5 liters of overnight culture grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, resuspended in 40 ml of buffer P (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and broken by one cycle of French press. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, the sample was applied to a 100-ml DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) column prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and equilibrated in buffer P. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer P and developed with a 300-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m in buffer P with a flux of 2 ml/min. The pool of fractions containing WrbA was dialyzed against buffer P and loaded onto a 25-ml Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) affinity column prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and equilibrated in buffer P. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer P and developed with a 300-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m in buffer P with a flux of 1 ml/min. The pool of fractions containing WrbA was dialyzed against buffer P and brought to 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate (final 314 g/liter). After 1 h of incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer P and concentrated in Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon). One volume of methanol was added to an aliquot of the dialyzed DEAE-fraction pool and mixed, and the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 × g to remove precipitated proteins. The supernatant was concentrated 2-fold by evaporation, additional methanol was added to 20%, and an aliquot was loaded onto a PepRPC HR 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography reverse-phase column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) running in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, 20% methanol. A standard solution of 10 μm each FMN (Sigma), FAD (Sigma), and riboflavin (Aldrich) was prepared in buffer P containing 50% methanol. Samples were loaded using a 100-μl loop for injection. Flavin concentrations were determined using their known extinction coefficients (9Whitby L.G. Biochem. J. 1953; 54: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Samples of pure WrbA were loaded onto a prepacked Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia) running at room temperature (22 °C) in buffer P. The column was calibrated with molecular weight standards (Sigma or Bio-Rad unless noted), horse heart cytochrome c (12,400 Da), carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da), ovalbumin (45,000 Da), and blue dextran (void volume). The buffer for TSK column separation was 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and standards were aldolase, gamma globulin (both 158,000 Da, Pharmacia), ovalbumin, and myoglobin (17,000 Da). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C in a Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge using an AN-60-Ti rotor (10Giebeler R. Rowe A.G. Hortons J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science , S. E. Harding. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 16-25Google Scholar). Data were collected using standard 12-mm path length, six-channel, charcoal-filled Epon cells with quartz windows. Continuous radial scanning at wavelengths between 238 and 285 nm was used for 5 to 10 μm samples. The cells were scanned every 0.001 cm at each of several rotor speeds, and 10 scans were averaged at each speed. The default value of 1.0017 g/ml was used without correction for the solvent density. The partial specific volume of WrbA was 0.735 ml/g as calculated from the weight-average partial specific volumes of the individual amino acids (11Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing, New York1943: 370-377Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra were acquired in buffer P at 25 °C on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter using a 0.1- or 1.0-cm path length quartz cell except for samples at submicromolar concentrations, where a 10-cm path length cylindrical cell was used. Fluorometry data were acquired using a SPEX 1680 Double Beam Spectrometer and analyzed using the SPEX dm3000 program (1 μm data) or a Perkin Elmer LS 50 luminescence spectrometer and analyzed using the Perkin Elmer FL program (5 μm data). 1-cm path length cuvettes with 300-μl volumes were used for 1 μm titrations, and cuvettes with 500-μl volumes were used for 5 μm titrations. Samples were equilibrated at room temperature for at least 1 h after mixing prior to measurements. Emission spectra were generated using an excitation wavelength of 459 nm. The decrease in the concentration of free FMN was determined from the fluorescence emission integrated over the range 480 to 680 nm. Determination of dissociation constants and binding stoichiometry was done by standard nonlinear least squares fitting procedures using MLAB (12Knott G.D. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1979; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar); (Civilised Software, Inc., Bethesda, MD), with posttransition baseline values determined from the fit as indicated in Fig. 3 B. Gel mobility shift titration experiments were performed as described by Yang et al. (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with some modifications. An 35S end-labeledBamHI-EcoRI 100-base pair DNA fragment containing the trp EDCBA promoter/operator sequence of Serratia marcescens was prepared as described previously (13Carey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) from plasmid pRK9 (14Nichols B.P. Yanofsky C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and purified from a 6% acrylamide gel by the crush-and-soak method of Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA concentration was estimated visually from ethidium bromide-stained gels. Approximately 0.03 nm DNA fragment was incubated with different amounts of protein(s) in a final volume of 20 μl of 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC)/poly(dI-dC) for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were loaded onto a pre-electrophoresed 10% polyacrylamide gel running at 100 V at room temperature. The gel and running buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mml-tryptophan. Electrophoresis was performed at constant voltage for 2.5 h with buffer recirculation. The WrbA gene was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA on the basis of the published sequence (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned in plasmid pET3a for expression under the control of T7 RNA polymerase (16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) in host strain CY15071(λDE3) (5Lavoie T.A. Molecular Origin of Specificity and Cooperativity in the trp Repressor System. Ph. D. dissertation. Princeton University, 1996Google Scholar), which is deleted in its chromosomal copy of the gene for TrpR (6Paluh J.L. Yanofsky C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7851-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to avoid TrpR contamination in protein purification. High level expression of a polypeptide with the expected relative molecular mass of ∼21,000 Da was observed after overnight growth in rich medium (Fig.1 A, lane 2). As already reported by Somerville's group (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we also see that addition of 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside does not increase expression levels, presumably because of the leakiness of the T7 expression system. Identity of the overproduced protein was confirmed by 10 cycles of N-terminal sequencing after blotting of a sample like that in lane 2 of Fig. 1 A. As already reported (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the mature protein starts with Ala following the initial Met. The purification strategy was based on published methods for flavodoxins (17Vervoort J. Heering D. Peelen S van Berkel W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 243: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in an attempt to retain the predicted flavin cofactor. The dark gray color of the harvested cell paste is typical of cells overexpressing flavoproteins (18Mayhew S.G. Ludwig M.L. Enzymes. 1975; 12: 57-118Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A French press extract of the cell paste was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column developed with a linear gradient of NaCl. A deep yellow peak eluted at around 300 mm salt. The pool of yellow fractions had an absorption spectrum typical of flavoproteins (Fig. 1 B) and was found to be enriched in WrbA by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Trial-scale experiments showed that WrbA bound to Affi-Gel Blue, as well as to Matrex Red A, resins, as do several other nucleotide-binding proteins (19Tollin G. Edmondson D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 392-406Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and could be eluted by salt but not by 100 μm FMN or by 10 mm NAD or NADP, but the flavin cofactor was invariably lost upon elution. A preparative Affi-Gel Blue column developed with a linear NaCl gradient yielded WrbA apoprotein at around 300 mm salt (Fig.1 A, lane 4). Following 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation, the supernatant was found to be essentially pure WrbA apoprotein (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). Typical final yields were ∼10 mg per liter of cell culture with final purity of at least 96%. The extinction coefficient of the pure apoprotein at 280 nm was determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar) to be 22,831m−1 cm−1. Enriched preparations of WrbA after DEAE-column chromatography were used as the starting material for analysis of flavin content. A sample of the DEAE pool was extracted with 50% methanol and analyzed by reversed-phase column chromatography. The methanol-extractable material eluted as a single peak (Fig. 1 C, right) with the same retention time as an FMN standard, which was clearly resolved from riboflavin and FAD (Fig. 1 C, left). The absorbance spectrum of the methanol extract was indistinguishable from that of the FMN standard (not shown). Estimation of extracted FMN and WrbA protein concentrations in the pool, calculated using their respective extinction coefficients, indicated approximately 1 FMN per 10 monomers. Pure WrbA apoprotein and an excess of commercial FMN were incubated together and resolved by size-exclusion column chromatography (Fig. 1 D). FMN was identified in the elution profile by its absorbance at 450 nm, where WrbA apoprotein has no absorbance, and was found in two peaks, one with the same retention time as WrbA apoprotein and the other with the retention time of free FMN. At similar concentrations, neither FAD nor riboflavin comigrated with WrbA, nor was the retention time of FMN affected by prior incubation with BSA (data not shown). Thus, WrbA binds FMN specifically and reversibly. Equilibration times as short as 5 min yielded equivalent results, indicating a relatively rapid association reaction. Although the facile loss of the cofactor during purification suggests a rapid dissociation rate, the very minor tailing in the elution profile of the reconstituted holoprotein indicates that the dissociation rate of FMN is slow on the time scale of this column. The amount of bound FMN changed with FMN or protein concentration and reached a plateau at high FMN concentrations, indicating saturation of available binding sites. Quantitation of free and bound species using the peak areas (data not shown) indicated an average stoichiometry of 0.97 FMN per WrbA monomer at saturation (S.D. 0.08; n = 6). The elution profiles of both apo- and holoprotein WrbA on the Superdex 75 size-exclusion column used for resolving the reconstituted holoprotein by fast protein liquid chromatography were little changed over a wide range of conditions (flow rate (0.1 or 1.0 ml/min), temperature (∼4° or ∼22 °C), and addition of 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton, or various concentrations of FMN), although the elution time decreased slightly as protein concentration increased over the range 0.1 to 10 μm, suggesting a rapid multimeric equilibrium. The protein elutes too close to the molecular weight cutoff of approximately 70 kDa on this column for accurate determination of its apparent molecular weight. Analysis on a TSK-G3000SWxl high pressure liquid chromatography size-exclusion column (molecular mass cutoff ∼150,000 Da) gave an apparent molecular mass of ∼62,000 Da at an initial WrbA concentration of 8 μm (data not shown), confirming the multimeric state of the protein on a second resin type. The protein-concentration dependence of the gel filtration results is indicative of a system involved in rapid subunit equilibria. The quaternary structure of WrbA was therefore further examined by analytical ultracentrifugation at several concentrations (Fig.2A and TableI), which confirmed the presence of a multimeric equilibrium. Simultaneous fitting of the sedimentation equilibrium data collected at different centrifugation speeds was used to derive an average apparent molecular mass (Mr) for each sample, assuming the presence of only a single species. At loading concentrations of 5–10 μm WrbA (monomer), this analysis resulted in an average apparent molecular mass of approximately 74 kDa, implying an association of 3.6 monomers. This result rules out the monomer as the dominant species of WrbA at micromolar protein concentrations and provides support for the existence of a dynamic equilibrium involving at least one higher order species in this range of initial protein concentrations.Table IAnalysis of sedimentation equilibrium data[WrbA]cConcentration of protein loaded.MrdMr, the apparent molecular mass in Daltons, determined from single-species analysis.SRVaSRV, square root of variance (×103).1nKab1nKa, natural log of the association constant; average values: 1–4, 38.2; 2–4, 13.5.SSeSS, single species.1–3fMonomer–n-mer or dimer–n-mer equilibria of increasing order.1–4fMonomer–n-mer or dimer–n-mer equilibria of increasing order.1–5fMonomer–n-mer or dimer–n-mer equilibria of increasing order.2–4fMonomer–n-mer or dimer–n-mer equilibria of increasing order.2–6fMonomer–n-mer or dimer–n-mer equilibria of increasing order.1–42–4μm5.074,144 ± 5,3004.38NSgNS, no solution.4.354.454.354.4439.0 ± 0.814.0 ± 0.49.073,288 ± 1,9002.93NSgNS, no solution.3.155.292.944.9037.9 ± 0.713.2 ± 0.310.074,360 ± 3,5002.58NSgNS, no solution.2.482.592.512.5837.7 ± 0.713.3 ± 0.4Data were collected at 4 °C with detection at 238 nm for 5 μm, 280 nm for 9 μm, and 285 nm for 10 μm samples and analyzed using the HID program from the Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility at the University of Connecticut.

To evaluate different possible scenarios for multimerization of WrbA, the square root of variance (Table I) and randomness of residuals, two measures of the goodness of fit, were compared for fitting of the data to various models of subunit equilibrium. Because of literature reports that members of the WrbA family may be dimeric in solution (1Yang W. Ni L. Somerville R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5796-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Toda T. Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yamano H. Adachi Y. Shirakawa M. Kyogoku Y. Yangida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5474-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we included both monomer–n-mer and dimer–n-mer models in our analysis. Several models could be excluded because of failure to converge on a solution (monomer–n-mer, wheren < 4) or because of poor fit, nonrandomness of residuals, and/or increased square root of variance (all single species models, and all monomer–n-mer or dimer–n-mer models where n > 4). Two models, monomer-tetramer and dimer-tetramer, gave nearly equally good fits as judged by square root of variance and the randomness of residuals. The sedimentation equilibrium data alone cannot distinguish between these two models, as the fits are essentially equivalent. As justified by the experiments reported in the following paragraphs, the fit shown in Fig.2 A is that for the dimer-tetramer model. The apparent dissociation constants describing these two models are 2.6 × 10−17m3 for the monomer-tetramer model and 1.4 × 10−6mfor the dimer-tetramer model. To directly compare these two values, we used the relation (mT)1/2 = 2(1/4Kd)1/3 introduced by Bujalowski and Lohman (21Bujalowski W. Lohman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1616-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to calculate (mT)1/2, the concentration of total protein (as monomer) at the transition midpoint for the monomer-tetramer model. The value of (mT)1/2, in this case 3.7 × 10−6 m, can be directly compared with the Kd for the dimer-tetramer model. Thus by either model, the midpoint of the oligomerization transition occurs in the micromolar concentration range. To determine which of the two models correctly describes the WrbA system, each dissociation constant for tetramer formation was used to calculate the predicted species distributions for monomer, dimer, and tetramer as a function of protein concentration according to each model. The monomer-tetramer model predicts essentially only monomer at protein concentrations between 0.1 and 1 μm, whereas the dimer-tetramer model predicts a significant fraction of dimer in this concentration range. These predictions were then evaluated experimentally by determining the average apparent molecular weight at various protein concentrations using size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown), taking advantage of the observation that the apparent molecular weight on gel filtration depended on loading concentration. The apparent molecular mass determined by size-exclusion chromatography on high pressure liquid chromatography at a loading concentration of 0.1 μm WrbA is approximately 48 kDa, in reasonable agreement with the average molecular mass expected (45 kDa) for a rapid dimer-tetramer equilibrium with a Kd of 1.4 μm, and inconsistent with the prediction of the monomer-tetramer model (21 kDa). The apparent molecular weights obtained by gel filtration at low protein concentrations cannot be explained by the presence of an unfolded monomer with a large hydrodynamic radius because CD analysis of WrbA apoprotein in the submicromolar concentration range, measured using a 10-cm path length cell, shows spectral features identical to those observed at higher protein concentrations (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, this is the far-UV CD spectrum expected for a well folded, mixed α/β protein. The spectrum is unaffected by addition of FMN. Thus, the combined analysis using ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, and circular dichroism allows a clear distinction between the two models for multimerization and indicates that WrbA participates in a rapid dimer-tetramer equilibrium over a range of protein concentrations and solution conditions, with a midpoint concentration of 1.4 μm dimer at pH 7.9 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 °C. Quantitative analysis of FMN binding was carried out by fluorescence titration. The high quantum yield of fluorescence emission by FMN is greatly reduced upon binding of WrbA, as is the case for many fl"

The Nudix family of proteins is widely distributed in nature and is structurally related by a highly conserved amino acid signature sequence designated the “Nudix” box:GX5 EX7 REUXEEXGU,where U is one of the bulky, hydrophobic amino acids I, L, or V (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In addition to this common structural feature, those proteins of the family characterized as enzymes, all catalyze the hydrolysis ofnucleoside diphosphates, linked to some other moiety x, hence the acronym “Nudix.” BLAST searches (2Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) of the data banks have uncovered over 130 putative proteins containing the Nudix box, and we have been systematically cloning the genes into expression vectors and attempting to identify, purify and then characterize the enzymes related to these genes. The Nudix family is well represented in Eukaryota and Prokaryota, and we have proposed that the physiological function of these enzymes is to sanitize the cell by removing potentially toxic nucleoside diphosphate derivatives or to modulate the accumulation of these derivatives during intermediary metabolism (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the cloning, purification, and characterization of a highly specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase expressed from a gene in the archaebacterium, Methanococcus jannaschii. This report is the first example of a Nudix hydrolase present in the Archaea. It documents the conservation of these enzymes in all three kingdoms, and it attests to the primordial origin of the Nudix hydrolase family. Common biochemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Oligonucleotide primers used in the polymerase chain reaction were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Stratagene, human semen phosphatase was prepared according to Wittenberg and Kornberg (3Wittenberg J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 431-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase was from Sigma, and enzymes used in standard cloning procedures were from Life Technologies, Inc., Stratagene, and United States Biochemical. MJ1149, the gene for ADP-ribose hydrolase in M. jannaschii (GenBankTM accession number D6443) was amplified from the construct, AMJAM72, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Oligonucleotide primers containing restriction sites NdeI (start site) andBamHI (end site) were used to amplify the gene by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified gene was purified and digested with NdeI and BamHI using the standard protocol as outlined by Sambrook et al. (4Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and ligated into pET11b under control of a T7 lac promoter. The resultant plasmid, pMJ1149, was transformed into HB101 cells for storage and into BL21 (DE3) cells for expression. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A600 of about 0.6 and induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 2 h, harvested, washed with an isotonic saline solution, and stored at −80 °C. All subsequent steps were conducted at 0–4 °C. To extract the protein, the cells were resuspended in 3 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated in a Branson sonifier. The crude extract was centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with buffer A (Fraction I). To Fraction I (100 ml), 10% streptomycin sulfate prepared in buffer A was slowly added with continuous stirring to a final concentration of 1%. After 30 min, the precipitate containing the enzyme was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A containing 1m ammonium sulfate (Fraction II). Fraction II was loaded onto a column of DEAE-Sepharose (2.5 × 24 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. Most proteins including ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase were eluted by washing the column with buffer A, whereas nucleic acids were retained on the column. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A (Fraction III). To Fraction III, 15 ml of 0.2 N acetic acid was slowly added with continuous stirring. The precipitate containing the enzyme activity was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (Fraction IV). Fraction IV was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient from 0–2 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A. The fractions containing enzyme were pooled and concentrated by pressure filtration (Fraction V). Fraction V was again loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 10 cm) to remove a trace amount of residual nucleic acids. The enzyme in the flow-through fractions was pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated as above (Fraction VI). All studies reported in this paper were done with this fraction. Activity was measured in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmADP-ribose, 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and 0.2–2 milliunits of enzyme. The reactants were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 20 mmEDTA, and the inorganic orthophosphate produced was quantitated by the colorimetric assay of Ames and Dubin (5Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ADP-ribose, and 0.5–3 milliunits of enzyme. The reactants were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of a mixture of four parts of Norit (20% packed volume) and one part of 7% HClO4. After centrifugation, 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn and added to 250 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Semen phosphatase was added to hydrolyze the ribose-5-phosphate formed, and the mixture was incubated an additional 15 min. The liberated phosphate was determined as described above. A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ADP-ribose/min in either assay. The standard assay mixture was scaled up 20-fold. At different time intervals, 100 μl were withdrawn and added to 500 μl of 20 mm EDTA, and an aliquot was analyzed on an high performance liquid chromatography column to determine the amount of ADP-ribose depleted and AMP formed. To another aliquot, alkaline phosphatase was added and incubated for 15 min, and the amount of Pi formed was determined. The gene, MJ1149, from M. jannaschii was cloned into pET11b as described under “Methods,” sequenced, and found to be in agreement with that reported by Bultet al. (6Bult C.J. Ahite O. Olsen G.J. Zhou I. Fleischman R.D. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). MJ1149 is the only gene in the entire genome of M. jannaschii containing the Nudix box signature sequence, characteristic of hydrolases specific for derivatives of nucleoside diphosphates. Expression of pMJ1149 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) resulted in the appearance of a new band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel not found for the parent vector, as shown in Fig. 1. Purification was carried out in several steps as outlined under “Methods.” It is interesting to note that the enzyme co-precipitates when streptomycin is used to remove nucleic acids from the crude extract. This could be because of the high content of basic amino acids in the protein (calculated pI of 9.4) interacting with the polyanionic nucleic acids. This association of the protein with nucleic acids during purification appears to be merely adventitious because addition of nucleic acids has no effect on the activity of the purified enzyme. From sequence alignments, Bult et al. (6Bult C.J. Ahite O. Olsen G.J. Zhou I. Fleischman R.D. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar) predicted that MJ1149 codes for a homolog of the E. coliMutT antimutator nucleoside triphosphatase (7Akiyama M. Horiuchi T. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This comparison is shown in Fig. 2. Accordingly, we tested the purified MJ1149 protein for nucleoside triphosphatase activity but found none. However, examination of other potential Nudix hydrolase substrates (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) uncovered a highly specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activity. A list of potential substrates for the enzyme is shown in Table I. The candidates tested represent cognate substrates of other members of the Nudix hydrolase family. Only ADP-ribose or its closely related derivative, 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose, are hydrolyzed to a significant extent. Notably absent is activity on the (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates, characteristic of the E. coli MutT protein (8Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for both substrates show no substantive differences between the two (Table II) and the Km values are similar to those of other characterized Nudix hydrolases (9Frick D.N.

A scaled-up reaction mixture was incubated under the standard conditions of assay 2 (see “Methods”), and aliquots were removed at intervals and analyzed for remaining substrate and formation of products. Another aliquot was incubated with alkaline phosphatase to release Pi from the products. The data in TableIII show that for each mole of ADP-ribose disappearing, 1 mole of AMP appears. Two moles of Pi are formed for each mole of ADP-ribose hydrolyzed when the products are treated with phosphatase. No inorganic phosphate is produced during the course of the reaction in the absence of alkaline phosphatase. Thus the stoichiometry of the reaction is: ADP-ribose + H2O → AMP + ribose-5-P.Table IIIStoichiometry of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase reactionTimeADP-riboseAMPΔADP-riboseaΔADP-ribose, ΔAMP, and ΔPi represent the quantities of the respective moieties measured at the indicated time, minus the zero time values.ΔAMPΔPiΔPi/ΔADP-riboseΔPi/ΔAMPminnmol010000000.00.058615−14+15+271.91.8107330−27+30+552.01.8205752−43+52+952.21.8304657−54+57+1142.12.0Incubation constituents for assay 2 (see “Methods”) were scaled up 20-fold, and aliquots were removed at the indicated time intervals.

The enzyme has a distinctly alkaline pH optimum around pH 8, characteristic of most of the other Nudix hydrolases (9Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

This is distinctly different from a Nudix ADP-ribose hydrolase in E. coli, Orf186, which can partially substitute Mn2+ or Zn2+ for Mg2+ (12O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The enzyme is highly resistant to heat inactivation. Fig.3 A shows that it can be heated to 80 °C for 5 min and retain full activity. At 85°, it loses about 30% of its activity in 5 min. It is also highly active when the incubation is carried out at elevated temperatures. As shown in Fig.3 B, the rate of hydrolysis of ADP-ribose at 75 °C is 15-fold higher than at 37 °C. Incubations at higher temperatures were impractical because of the spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate. The identification of a Nudix hydrolase in M. jannaschii, a member of the Archaea, is an important extension of our systematic study of the characterization and distribution of this interesting family of enzymes. As a result of this work, Nudix hydrolases are now represented in all three kingdoms, and a recent BLAST search (2Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 4 reveals the diversity in nature, of putative proteins (open reading frames) containing the Nudix signature sequence. This amino acid motif first attracted our attention when it was found that only a small region of homology existed between two proteins, MutT (E. coli) and MutX (Streptococcus pneumoniae), both of which are involved in preventing mutations in their respective organisms and both are enzymes having dGTP pyrophosphohydrolase activity (13Bullions L.C. Méjean V. Claverys J.P. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12339-12344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An early search of the protein data banks against MutT and MutX revealed about a dozen sequences containing the conserved motif (14Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Méjean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 11: 323-330Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) one of which we had already partly characterized as a dATP pyrophosphohydrolase (15Méjean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 11: 323-330Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At that time, the small group of related open reading frames was referred to as the “MutT family”, and the highly conserved amino acid motif was considered the escutcheon of a class of enzymes having nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity (13Bullions L.C. Méjean V. Claverys J.P. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12339-12344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, we discovered another enzyme having the conserved sequence that had no activity on dGTP or any other nucleoside triphosphate, had no MutT antimutator activity, but instead was highly active on NADH (9Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1529-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since that report, several other members of the family have been characterized, including those that catalyze the hydrolysis of GDP-mannose (10Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Ap4A (16Thorne N.M.H. Hankin S. Wilkinson M.C. Nunez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3192-3197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Some of these are shown in Fig. 4. along with their favored substrates. Where tested, none of these other enzymes play a role in the mutT mutator phenotype. 1S. F. O'Handley, C. A. Dunn, D. N. Frick, and M. J. Bessman, unpublished observations. Thus the antimutator nucleoside triphosphatase of the original MutT protein represents only a small subset of the family of enzymes specified by the conserved amino acid motif. There is a nexus, however, to this varied group of substrates. As mentioned in the introduction, they are all derivatives of nucleoside diphosphates linked to some other moiety, and we have proposed the term Nudix hydrolase to designate this family. The observations reported in this paper provide another example of a putative protein miscatalogued as a MutT homologue. The purified enzyme has no nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity, nor does the gene, MJ1149, complement mutT when introduced into E. coli (data not shown). It is noteworthy that M. jannaschii does not appear to contain a MutT orthologue because the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase is the only Nudix hydrolase predicted from its genome (6Bult C.J. Ahite O. Olsen G.J. Zhou I. Fleischman R.D. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Perhaps the ecological niche inhabited by this archaebacterium obviates the need for the MutT enzyme. The organism, isolated from a hydrothermal vent, a “white smoker” chimney at an ocean depth of about 1.5 miles, is an extreme anaerobe (19Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). If the mutagenic substrate of the MutT enzyme is 8-oxo-dGTP, as proposed by Maki and Sekiguchi (20Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), the oxidized nucleotide might be absent under these extreme anaerobic conditions, precluding the need for the enzyme. Fowler et. al. (21Fowler R.G. Erickson J.A. Isbell R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7727-7729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that E. coli mutT has a normal spontaneous mutation frequency when grown anaerobically, in keeping with this notion. On the other hand, it is possible that another protein, without the Nudix box, substitutes for MutT or that characteristics of DNA replication under the unusual growth conditions of a thermal vent eliminate the need for a specialized enzyme to control the specific AT→CG mutation pathway (22Cox E.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 390-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomes of other Archaea are being sequenced, and other putative Nudix hydrolases are emerging. Perhaps studies of these new candidates will help distinguish between the alternative possibilities. Another interesting correlation is apparent between the habitat of the organism and the heat stability of the enzyme (Fig. 3). Because the optimal growth rate for M. jannaschii is at 85 °C (19Jones W.J. Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the enzyme is stable and catalytically functional at these elevated temperatures. A recent publication by Villeret et al. (23Villeret V. Clantin B. Tricot C. Legrain C. Roovers M. Stalon V. Glansdorff N. Van Beeumen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) explains the heat stability of another archaeal enzyme on the basis of its quarternary structure. From crystallographic data, they showed that the ornithine carbamoyltransferase of Pyrococcus furiosis is a dodecamer composed of four trimers, and they suggest that oligomerization of subunits may be a strategy for conferring thermal stability. This might explain a puzzling observation we noted during the purification of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. The enzyme was eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column, suggesting it was much larger than the 19-kDa protein we expected. At the time, we thought that this might represent nonspecific aggregation or interaction with contaminating nucleic acid, but it is quite possible in the light of this new observation that the thermal stability of the M. jannaschii enzyme is another example of oligomerization as that cited above. The number of Nudix signature sequences uncovered in searches varies widely for different organisms and seems to be independent of genome size. For example, E. coli has about 11, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 5, Caenorhabditis elegans has 5,Deinococcus radiodurans has more than 18,Arabidopsis has 2, and so far about 7 have been found in the human genome. Contrast this with the single Nudix hydrolase present inM. jannaschii. It might be tempting to speculate that the single Nudix hydrolase is a feature distinguishing Archaea from prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but at least one other archaebacterium,M. thermoautotrophicum has 3, as yet uncharacterized. We have proposed that the cellular function of the Nudix hydrolases is to remove potentially toxic or deleterious metabolites or to modulate the accumulation of metabolic intermediates by diverting them to alternate pathways in response to changes in cellular processes (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase is an excellent representative, because it can fulfill both functions. Free ADP-ribose is a by product of the ubiquitous NAD+-linked ADP-ribosylation reactions implicated in a wide variety of cellular regulatory processes (for review, see Refs. 24Ueda K. Hayaishi O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar and 25Moss J. Zahradka P. Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, focused issue. ADP-Ribosylation: Metabolic Effects and Regulatory Functions. 138. Klewer, Hingham, MA1994Crossref Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of mono- or poly(A)DP-ribose from modified proteins results in free ADP-ribose, and also the large scale metabolic turnover of NAD+ itself contributes in part to the intracellular ADP-ribose pool (26Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Cordray P. Roth J.R. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. ADP-Ribose Transfer Reactions. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 353-360Crossref Google Scholar). This free ADP-ribose can then be recycled by hydrolyzing it to AMP and ribose-5-phosphate. A more important role of the enzyme may be to remove the potentially hazardous ADP-ribose from the cytoplasmic pool. Because of its free aldehydic group, ADP-ribose is an excellent nonenzymatic glycating agent capable of derivatizing the lysines, cysteines, histidines, and N termini of proteins (27Jacobson E.L. Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson M.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These nonspecific ADP-ribosylation reactions would have detrimental effects on protein (enzyme) function, and they could confuse those recognition or regulatory systems based on specific ADP-ribosylations. For example, diphtheria toxin kills cells by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2, thereby shutting down protein synthesis (28Honjo T. Nishizuka Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3553-3555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this or similar reactions were to occur nonenzymatically because of the accumulation of ADP-ribose, it would be disastrous for the cell. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the only other substrate of the purified ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase is 2′ phospho-ADP-ribose (a catabolite of NADP) which has also been shown to derivatize proteins nonenzymatically (29Hilz H. Fanwick W. Klapproth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6267-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). So far, the genomes of almost every cellular organism sequenced, as well as several viruses, contain at least one Nudix box signature sequence; most genomes contain several. This argues for the primordial origin of the Nudix box and for the physiological significance of the enzymes designated by it."

In addition to the endocrine functions attributed to secretory forms of the peptide, PTHrP also plays a local role as a mediator of cellular growth and differentiation presumably at least in part through intracellular pathways. In studying the post-translational regulation of PTHrP, we observed that PTHrP was conjugated to multiple ubiquitin moieties. We report here that the proteasome is responsible for the degradation of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated precursor, pro-PTHrP. Cells expressing prepro-PTHrP and exposed to lactacystin accumulate pro-PTHrP assessed by anti-pro specific antibodies. Brefeldin A-treated cells also accumulate pro-PTHrP suggesting that degradation does not occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Subcellular fractionation of both lactacystin and brefeldin A-treated cells indicated that accumulated pro-PTHrP resides in microsomal fractions with a portion of the protein exposed to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane as assessed by protease protection experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis identified pro-PTHrP in association with the ER molecular chaperone protein BiP. We conclude that pro-PTHrP from the ER can gain access to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane where it can undergo ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.

Henderson J.E. Endocrine Neoplasms.in: Arnold A. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1997Google Scholar). There is amino acid homology within the first 13 amino acids of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). This limited homology is sufficient for PTHrP to bind to a common PTH/PTHrP receptor and to share many of the biological properties of PTH (2Abou-Samra A.-B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W.

Unlike PTH, PTHrP is widely expressed in a variety of fetal and adult tissues where it is thought to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation (4Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F.

In addition, PTHrP plays a critical role in normal skeletal development as has recently been emphasized by gene deletion experiments in mice (10Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J.

Broadus A.E. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 205-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, PTHrP is proposed to enhance the proliferation of chondrocytes and delay their terminal differentiation (13Henderson J.E. He B. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This action is most likely in large part because of the secretion of PTHrP from normal proliferating and maturing chondrocytes. PTHrP also inhibits apoptosisin vitro (14Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell.

Taken together, these studies suggest an intracellular function for PTHrP distinct from the classical signal transduction cascades linked to the PTH/PTHrP receptor. PTHrP is synthesized as a prepro protein that encodes a mature 141-amino acid protein (in the rat) that is post-translationally cleaved to generate the bioactive peptide 1–36 as well as other poorly characterized fragments. While studying the post-translational regulation of PTHrP, we showed that full-length endogenously overexpressed PTHrP was degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway is responsible for the degradation of misfolded or aberrant polypeptides in the cytosol and nucleus (17Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). In addition to aberrant proteins, many normal short-lived proteins are also degraded, indicating that this system plays a role in regulated protein degradation (18Isaksson A. Musti A.M. Bohmann D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-dependent degradation is a reaction cascade that involves the conjugation of multiple ubiquitin moieties to a target protein through the action of three enzymes (E1, E2, and E3) followed by degradation through a multicatalytic protease, known as the 26 S proteasome. In several reports, however, proteasomal degradation of proteins was shown not to be dependent on ubiquitin conjugation (19McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20McGee T.P. Cheng H.H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 93: 13797-13801Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The degradation of proteins that are destined to be secreted or plasma membrane-bound can occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER-associated degradation is proposed to function, at least in part, as a quality control mechanism to ensure that only correctly folded, processed, and completely assembled proteins exit this compartment for further transport through the secretory pathway (24Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cellular Proteolytic Systems.in: Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanisms and proteases that mediate this ER degradation remain unclear. Recently, several studies have suggested a role for the proteasome in the degradation of ER proteins (25Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whereas proteasomes have never been localized within the lumen of the ER, they have been reported to stud the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (26Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Thus, ER retained forms of mutant integral membrane proteins, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (27Jensen T.J.

Proteasomal degradation of mutant ER lumenal proteins, such as prepro α-factor (19McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J.

Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), may also occur. Finally, we previously reported proteasomal degradation of PTHrP, a nonmutant secretory protein (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and others have recently reported proteasomal degradation of apolipoprotein B, another nonmutant protein (32Benoist F.

It has been proposed that lumenal proteins may be degraded by the proteasome after reverse transport from the ER back into the cytoplasm. This has been demonstrated for both soluble (19McCracken A.A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Reverse transport to the cytoplasm likely occurs through the Sec61-containing translocon (30Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 37Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K.

Alternatively, co-translational degradation by the cytosolic proteasome has also been described (32Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

In this study we have extended our previous observation that PTHrP can be ubiquitinated (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and can be degraded by the proteasome. We thus assessed whether ubiquitination is a prerequisite for proteasome-mediated degradation of PTHrP, whether the PTHrP form serving as a substrate for proteasome degradation has already entered the ER, whether the degradation occurs in the cytoplasm or the ER, and whether PTHrP in the ER is associated with a chaperone. Lactacystin was purchased from E. J. Corey (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) and prepared as a 10 mm(1000×) stock solution in water. Brefeldin A was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in methanol. The protease inhibitors, aprotinin and leupeptin, were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and N-ethylmaleimide were from Sigma. The anti-human PTHrP-(38–64) monoclonal antibody-1 was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), and the rat anti-grp78 (BiP) monoclonal antibody was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). Polyclonal antiserum to pro-PTHrP was raised in a rabbit using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids −12 to +1 conjugated to methylated bovine serum albumin. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad. The Chinese hamster lung E36 and ts20 cell lines were kindly provided by William Dunn (University of Florida Health Science Center). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (plus 4.5 g/liter glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere at 30 °C with 5% CO2. Stable transfection of prepro-PTHrP or a leaderless form of PTHrP (ΔP) in E36 and ts20 cells was with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the expression plasmids CMV PTHrP-His6 and CMV ΔP-His6 (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a control, cells were transfected with pRC/CMV vector alone. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for approximately 1 week. Clonal colonies were isolated, expanded, and maintained in medium containing 0.4 mg/ml G418. Clonal cell lines were screened for PTHrP production by Northern blotting. For heat shock experiments, E36 and ts20 cells stably expressing prepro-PTHrP were incubated for 18 h at either 30 or 40 °C in T25 flasks with the caps sealed shut. Cell extracts were prepared by first rinsing the cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysing the cells in 8 m urea, 0.1 m NaPO4, and 0.01m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were kept at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of total cell protein were analyzed by immunoblotting. For inhibitor-treated experiments, cells were plated on Petri dishes. The next day, fresh medium was added that contained either 10 μm lactacystin or 10 μg/ml brefeldin A, or both. Cells were treated for 18 h, and cell extracts were prepared as described above or subjected to subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was essentially as described (36Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼107) were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, then in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture of leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and N-ethylmaleimide (5 mm), and then scraped and resuspended in 800 μl of homogenization buffer. Cells were homogenized on ice using a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes) with a tight fitting pestle (Thomas, pestle type A). The homogenate was spun at 1000 × g for 10 min, which yielded the 1000 × g pellet. The supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min, which yielded the 10,000 × g pellet. Finally, the supernatant was subjected to 100,000 × g centrifugation for 60 min, providing the 100,000 × g pellet and the 100,000 ×g supernatant (cytosol). Pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer, and all fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Protease protection experiments were performed on fresh aliquots of the 100,000 × g pellets resuspended in homogenization buffer. Aliquots were incubated for 30 min on ice with trypsin (100 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) for 10 min on ice. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Equal amounts of total cell protein or equal proportions of each fraction from the subcellular fractionation were subjected to SDS-12% PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted as described previously (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with anti-PTHrP monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml), anti-grp78 (BiP) monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml), or anti-pro-PTHrP polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution). Detection was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Control and inhibitor-treated cells were lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) plus the protease inhibitor mixture as described above. Cell lysates were spun at 1000 × g for 10 min. For ATP-depleted extracts, 5 units/ml hexokinase and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose were added fresh to the lysis buffer. In the case where ATP was present, the lysis buffer was supplemented with 1 mm ATP. 50 μg of total cell protein was incubated with either 1 μg of anti-BiP antibody or 1 μg of anti-PTHrP antibody overnight at 4 °C. Following a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose, the beads were washed 3 times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and once with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the antibodies as described above. We have previously shown that the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated prepro-PTHrP when PTHrP was translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate, expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, and expressed in stably transfected E36 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we assess proteasome-mediated degradation of PTHrP using the highly specific and irreversible proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (40Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Lactacystin at 10 μm induced the accumulation of PTHrP in stably transfected E36 cells as assessed by immunoblotting total cell lysates with a monoclonal anti-PTHrP antibody (Fig. 1, compare lane 4 to lane 3). PTHrP expressed in E36 cells but lacked the secretory prepro leader sequence (ΔP) and thus expressed in the cytosol, which also accumulated in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 1, compare lane 2 to lane 1). As we have previously shown, anti-PTHrP-(38–64) monoclonal antibody cannot identify the higher molecular weight ubiquitin-PTHrP conjugates (16Meerovitch K. Wing S. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6706-6713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of prepro-PTHrP revealed a doublet (Fig. 1, lanes 3and 4). Based on the slower migration of this doublet compared with ΔP, we propose that these two bands represent precursor forms of mature PTHrP containing pre and/or pro sequences (see Fig. 3). The faster migrating bands appear to represent carboxyl-terminal cleavages or partially degraded intermediates.Figure 3Lactacystin and brefeldin A induce the accumulation of a precursor form of PTHrP and pro-PTHrP. E36 cells expressing leaderless PTHrP (ΔP; lanes 1 and 2) and E36 cells expressing prepro-PTHrP (lanes 3–6) were incubated with either 10 μm lactacystin (Lc) (lanes 2 and 4), 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (lane 5), or both (lane 6) for 18 h. Control incubations with nothing added are in lanes 1 and3. Cell extracts were prepared and equal amounts of total cell protein (30 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-PTHrP-(38–64) monoclonal antibody (A) or anti-pro-PTHrP-(−12 to +1) antibody (B). The closed arrowhead indicates the migration of prepro-PTHrP, and theopen arrowhead indicates the migration of pro-PTHrP. Note that the asterisks in B indicate cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antiserum with nonspecific proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address whether ubiquitin conjugation to PTHrP is important for its degradation, we expressed prepro-PTHrP in ts20 cells, which are derived from E36 cells and are temperature-sensitive for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E1 (39Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at the permissive temperature of 30 °C, the E1 enzyme is active whereas at the nonpermissive temperature of 40 °C, E1 is inactivated and substrate proteins accumulate because they cannot be ubiquitinated. Prepro-PTHrP degradation was investigated in E36 and ts20 cells at both 30 and 40 °C. Following incubation at the respective temperatures for 18 h, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting of equal amounts of total protein using a monoclonal antibody against PTHrP. As shown in Fig. 2, ts20 cells accumulate PTHrP at 40 °C. This result confirms that ubiquitin conjugation to PTHrP is a necessary prerequisite for its degradation. The in vivo finding that a specific inhibitor of the proteasome limited the degradation of prepro-PTHrP (Fig. 1), along with the result that an E1 mutant cell line was deficient in the degradation of a wild-type lumenal secretory protein, prepro-PTHrP (Fig. 2), demonstrates that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system is involved in the degradation of this mammalian secretory hormone. To determine the subcellular site for proteasomal degradation of PTHrP, we tested the effects of brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that is able to specifically block protein transport from the ER to the Golgi and has been used extensively to characterize the subcellular site of ER-associated degradation (41Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Treatment of E36 cells expressing prepro-PTHrP with 10 μg/ml BFA for 18 h resulted in a slight accumulation of PTHrP immunoreactive protein when compared with control-treated cells (Fig.3 A, compare lane 5to lane 3). BFA treatment also inhibited the secretion of PTHrP in the medium detected by radioimmunoassay by 65%, consistent with impaired transport of protein out of the ER. However, although the intracellular accumulation of PTHrP with BFA was not as great as with lactacystin alone (Fig. 3 A, lane 4), the fact that PTHrP accumulated in the presence of BFA suggests that PTHrP degradation does not occur by proteases active in the lumen of the ER. In the presence of both BFA and lactacystin there is a much greater accumulation of PTHrP than with each inhibitor alone (Fig.3 A, lane 6). This additive effect suggests that when PTHrP is prevented by BFA from leaving the ER, it becomes more available for proteasomal degradation. Western blot analysis of inhibitor-induced accumulation of prepro-PTHrP revealed two bands (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 A). To confirm that these bands were precursor forms of PTHrP, we immunoblotted inhibitor-treated samples with a polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide encoding the pro region (−12 to +1). The antiserum is specific as it does not recognize PTHrP that is lacking the prepro leader sequence (ΔP; Fig. 3 B,lane 2). This antiserum did recognize two bands,i.e. prepro-PTHrP and pro-PTHrP, which both contain pro sequences (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–6). The faster migrating band of the doublet must be pro-PTHrP, but the slower migrating band may be prepro-PTHrP or a post-translationally modified form of pro-PTHrP. These results therefore show that the pro form of PTHrP is accumulated in the presence of lactacystin (Fig.3 B, lane 4 versus lane 3), indicating that pro-PTHrP serves as a substrate for proteasomal degradation. To search for and characterize the subcellular localization of PTHrP degradation, we fractionated control and lactacystin-treated cells into soluble and particulate fractions by differential centrifugation. PTHrP localized almost exclusively to the particulate fractions, and lactacystin increased PTHrP accumulation in these fractions (Fig. 4 A). PTHrP in the pellet of the 1000 × g spin appeared to represent retention of the protein in incompletely lysed cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 3). PTHrP in the 10,000 × g pellet is consistent with its reported nuclear localization (14Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), although the 10,000 × gpellet also contains microsomal vesicles (36Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). PTHrP accumulation in both the 10,000 and 100,000 × g pellets is therefore compatible with its association with microsomal vesicles. The species of PTHrP accumulated in the presence of lactacystin in microsomal fractions also reacted with the pro antiserum (Fig.4 B, lane 1), suggesting that pro-PTHrP must have entered the ER. Furthermore, a faint but distinct band of pro-PTHrP was also observed in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). We then used protease protection assays to determine the site of pro-PTHrP accumulation associated with microsomal vesicles. Treatment of the microsomal membrane fraction with trypsin resulted in a substantial disappearance of pro-PTHrP, whereas the heat shock protein 70 analogue, BiP, which is localized in the lumen of the ER, remained resistant to trypsin treatment (Fig. 4 C). The additional treatment of the membrane fraction with Triton X-100 rendered pro-PTHrP fully and BiP partially susceptible to trypsin digestion (Fig.4 C). The BiP control suggests that the vesicles were intact during the trypsin treatment. Therefore, a significant portion of pro-PTHrP did not reside within the lumen of the ER but was adherent to the cyt"

To study their putative role in NADPH binding, His-162 and Arg-269 were selectively changed by site-specific mutagenesis. The catalytic properties of H162R, H162Y, and R269K were similar to the wild-type enzyme. However, less conservative His-162 and Arg-269 replacements strongly impaired NADPH binding without affecting the conformation of the flavin ring and the efficiency of substrate hydroxylation.The crystal structures of H162R and R269T in complex with 4-hydroxybenzoate were solved at 3.0 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures are virtually indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme-substrate complex except for the substituted side chains. In contrast to wild-type p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, H162R is not inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate. NADPH protects wild-type p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from diethylpyrocarbonate inactivation, suggesting that His-162 is involved in NADPH binding. Based on these results and GRID calculations we propose that the side chains of His-162 and Arg-269 interact with the pyrophosphate moiety of NADPH. An interdomain binding mode for NADPH is proposed which takes a novel sequence motif (Eppink, M. H. M., Schreuder, H. A., and van Berkel, W. J. H. (1997)Protein Sci. 6, 2454–2458) into account.

(1997)Protein Sci. 6, 2454–2458) into account. p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is the most thoroughly characterized member of a group of inducible flavoprotein monooxygenases which are involved in the biodegradation of aromatic compounds by soil microorganisms (1Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Van der Bolt F.J.T. Vervoort J. Rietjens I.M.C.M. Schreuder H.A. Stevenson K. Massey V. Williams Jr., Ch Flavins and Flavoproteins XII. University Press, Calgary, 1997: 305-314Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of 4-hydroxybenzoate to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate,i.e. the first step of the β-ketoadipate pathway (2Stanier R.Y. Ornston L.N. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1973; 9: 89-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), using NAD(P)H as electron donor shown in SchemeFS1. The dihydroxylated aromatic product is readily subject to ring fission and further catabolism, allowing the microbes to grow (2Stanier R.Y. Ornston L.N. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1973; 9: 89-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase has been isolated from many microorganisms, and several gene sequences are presently known (3Seibold B.

However, most information regarding its structure and function comes from studies on the strictly NADPH-dependent enzymes from Pseudomonas strains (4Entsch B. van Berkel W.J.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase have been elucidated (5Husain M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6657-6666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), together with the catalytic mechanism (6Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and related flavoenzymes can be separated in two half-reactions, both involving ternary complex formation. In the reductive part of the reaction, the substrate acts as an effector, highly stimulating the rate of flavin reduction by NADPH (8Spector T. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4679-4687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After NADP+ release, the substrate is hydroxylated in the oxidative part of the reaction through electrophilic attack of a transiently stable oxygenated flavin intermediate (6Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient hydroxylation requires substrate activation upon binding (4Entsch B. van Berkel W.J.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This prevents the uncoupling of the hydroxylation reaction from oxygen reduction which would result in the production of potential harmful hydrogen peroxide. The crystal structure of the enzyme-substrate complex ofp-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase is known in atomic detail (9Wierenga R.K. de Jong R.J. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol.

Biol. 1989; 208: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer of two independently acting 44-kDa polypeptide chains containing a noncovalently bound FAD molecule (11Müller F. Voordouw G. Van Berkel W.J.H. Steennis P.J. Visser S. Van Rooijen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Each subunit is built up from three domains, the FAD binding domain containing a characteristic βαβ-fold (12Wierenga R.K. Drenth J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the substrate binding domain, and the interface domain (10Schreuder H.A. Prick P.A.J. Wierenga R.K. Vriend G. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The substrate is deeply buried in the interior of the protein (Fig. 1) and residues from all three domains are involved in catalysis. Crystallographic studies have revealed that the flavin ring can attain different orientations in and out of the active site (13Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to many other pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase lacks a well defined domain for binding the coenzyme. Sequence alignments suggest that this might be a common property of the family of flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases (16Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). So far, no crystal structures of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase with NADP(H) or pyridine nucleotide analogs have been obtained (17Van der Laan J.M. Schreuder H.A. Swarte M.B.A. Wierenga R.K. Kalk K.H.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this model, the pyrophosphate moiety of NADPH binds in a cleft leading toward the active site and interacts with the side chains of His-162 of the FAD-binding domain and Arg-269 of the substrate binding domain (12Wierenga R.K. Drenth J. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Despite their location near the protein surface (Fig. 1), both residues are highly conserved in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase enzymes of known primary structure (3Seibold B. Matthes M. Eppink M.H.M.

To investigate the validity of the proposed NADPH binding mode in more detail, we have undertaken the characterization of His-162 and Arg-269 variants of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from P. fluorescens. In this work we show that the His-162 and Arg-269 replacements weaken the NADPH binding without affecting the protein structure and the efficiency of substrate hydroxylation. Based on these and additional experiments, a refined model for the interdomain binding of NADPH is proposed. A preliminary account of this work has been presented elsewhere (1Van Berkel W.J.H.

Site-specific mutagenesis of the gene encoding wtPHBH from P. fluorescens was performed in bacteriophage M13mp18 according to the method of Kunkel et al. (23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide 5′-GCGATGGCTTCXXXGGCATCTCG-5′ (where XXX denotes the replacement of CAC for GAC (H162D), AAC (H162N), TCC (H162S), ACC (H162T), TAC (H162Y), and AGG (H162R), respectively) was used as primer for the construction of His-162 mutants.

The mutations were introduced into the Escherichia coli gene encoding the microheterogeneity-resistant mutant C116S (24Eschrich K. van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G.

The enzyme solution obtained after protamine sulfate treatment was loaded onto Q-Sepharose FF, equilibrated in 20 mmTris/sulfate, pH 8.0. After washing, the enzyme was eluted with 0.2m KCl and dialyzed against the starting buffer. The enzyme was then loaded onto Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose, equilibrated in 40 mm Tris/sulfate, pH 8.0. R269D, R269N, R269S, R269T, and R269Y eluted during washing, whereas R269K and all His-162 mutants eluted with 0.2 m KCl.

Rapid-reaction kinetics were performed with a High-Tech Scientific SF-51 stopped flow spectrophotometer (Salisbury, Wilts, United Kingdom), equipped with an anaerobic kit and interfaced to an Hyundai 486 microcomputer for data acquisition and analysis (22Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J.

The amount of modified histidines was determined at 244 nm (Δε244 = 3.6 mm−1cm−1). Crystals of POHB complexed H162R and R269T were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The protein solutions contained 10–15 mg/ml enzyme in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reservoir solution contained 40% saturated ammonium sulfate, 0.04 mm FAD, 0.15 mm EDTA, 2 mm POHB, and 30 mmsodium sulfite in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Drops of 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution were allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals with dimensions of up to 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 grew within 5 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Siemens multiwire area detector and graphite monochromated CuKα radiation from an 18-kW Siemens rotating anode generator, operating at 45 kV and 100 mA.

Open table in a new tab A starting electron density map was calculated for H162R based on the structure of the wtPHBH·POHB complex (10Schreuder H.A. Prick P.A.J. Wierenga R.K. Vriend G. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), after a correction had been made for the slightly different cell dimensions (13Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Van der Bolt F.J.T. Van Berkel W.J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The 2Fo–Fc andFo–Fc maps clearly showed the replacement of His-162 by Arg. His-162 was changed into Arg and fitted in the electon density map with the graphics program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The complete protein model was inspected and corrected where necessary. Refinement consisted of four macrocycles of map inspection and rebuilding using O with subsequent energy minimization and temperature factor refinement using the X-plor package (37Brünger A.T. X-plor, Version 3.1, a system for the X-ray crystallography and NMR, Yale University Press, New Haven, CT. 1992; Google Scholar). For the FAD we used the parameters as described by Schreuder et al. (13Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Van der Bolt F.J.T. Van Berkel W.J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Water molecules were assigned by searchingFo–Fc maps for peaks of at least 4ς, which were between 2.0 and 5.0 Å of other protein or water atoms. Water molecules with temperature factors after refinement in excess of 70 Å2 were rejected. The refined structure has an R factor of 12.8% for 6695 reflections between 8.0 and 3.0 Å and contains 218 water molecules. The root mean square deviations from ideal values are 0.010 Å for bond lengths and 1.52° for bond angles. The same procedure as described above was used for the refining of the R269T structure, but the reflections were scaled by applying overall anisotropic B factor refinement, resulting in the following B factors: B11 = −0.798 Å2; B22 = −1.849 Å2; B33 = 0.983 Å2. The 2Fo–Fc andFo–Fc maps clearly showed the replacement of Arg-269 by Thr. The final structure was obtained after four cycles of map inspection and refinement and contains 289 water molecules. The final R factor is 17.7% for 26122 reflections between 8.0 and 2.0 Å. The root mean square deviations from ideal values are 0.010 Å for bond lengths and 1.45° for bond angles. The refinements statistics of H162R and R269T are summarized in Table I. Energetically favorable binding sites for the pyrophosphate moiety of NADPH in wtPHBH were computed with the GRID program (38Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) using HPO42− and PO43− as probe groups on a Silicon graphics Indigo workstation. The parameters used to evaluate the nonbonded interactions (including electrostatic, hydrogen bond, and Lennard-Jones functions) of probe groups are based on the “extended” atom concept used for the program CHARMM (39Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swiminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13764) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional contour surfaces generated at selected energy levels were displayed with the program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) together with wtPHBH (10Schreuder H.A. Prick P.A.J. Wierenga R.K. Vriend G. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The contour surfaces of the GRID calculations were used as a start for building a three-dimensional model of the enzyme-substrate complex in the presence of NADPH. The pyrophosphate part of the NADPH molecule was fitted on the position of the GRID contours with the graphics program O. The nicotinamide ring was placed at the re-side of the flavin ring by rotating around single bonds. Similarly, the 2′-phosphate group was placed next to helix H2 as indicated by mutagenesis studies (1Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Van der Bolt F.J.T. Vervoort J. Rietjens I.M.C.M. Schreuder H.A. Stevenson K. Massey V. Williams Jr., Ch Flavins and Flavoproteins XII. University Press, Calgary, 1997: 305-314Google Scholar). The model was then energy minimized by using the conjugate gradient method using the XPLOR package (37Brünger A.T. X-plor, Version 3.1, a system for the X-ray crystallography and NMR, Yale University Press, New Haven, CT. 1992; Google Scholar). The ternary complex was minimized allowing both NADPH and enzyme-substrate complex to move, but the protein Cα-atoms were fixed. The parameter set as determined by Engh and Huber (40Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar) was used for the protein part of the structure. The POHB, NADPH, and FAD parameters were originally derived from CHARMM parameters (39Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swiminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13764) Google Scholar). During energy minimization the charges of the residues Arg, Lys, Glu, and Asp were removed. The final model was obtained after 120 minimization cycles with an initial drop in the energy of 40 kcal/mol. All His-162 mutants were expressed at high levels (5–10% of total protein) in E. coli TG2, and their yield after purification was comparable to that of wtPHBH (26Van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Comparable levels of protein expression were observed with the Arg-269 variants. However, with the exception of R269K, the Arg-269 variants were not retained on the Cibacron blue 3GA column used in the standard purification protocol. Such change in binding characteristics has also been observed with malate dehydrogenase variants (41Breiter D.R. Resnik E. Banaszak L.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2023-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since Cibacron blue 3GA is a strong inhibitor of wtPHBH, competitive with respect to NADPH (42Müller F. Van Berkel W.J.H. Steennis P.J. Biochem. Int. 1983; 7: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to study the interaction of the His-162 and Arg-269 variants with the dye free in solution. Fig.2 shows that the absorption perturbation difference spectra of wtPHBH and R269T, recorded in the presence of increasing concentrations of Cibacron blue 3GA, were nearly identical. It has been suggested that the shape of these difference spectra is indicative of electrostatic enzyme-dye interactions (43Subramanian S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 16: 169-205Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 44Prestera T. Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). From analyzing the spectral data of Fig. 2 according to the procedure described by Thompson and Stellwagen (30Thompson S.T. Stellwagen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), it was deduced that the dissociation constant of the wtPHBH-Cibacron blue 3GA complex (Kd = 0.34 ± 0.05 μm) is about one order of magnitude lower than the dissociation constant of the R269T-Cibacron blue 3GA complex (Kd = 4.6 ± 1.2 μm). Similar results as with wtPHBH were obtained for R269K and the His-162 variants. However, the affinity between Cibacron blue 3GA and the other Arg-269 mutants compared more favorable with that of R269T (not shown). Neither the dissociation constant of the enzyme-dye complexes nor the shape of the difference spectra changed significantly in the presence of 1 mm POHB or 1 mm NADPH. The dissociation constants of the enzyme-dye complexes were also determined from fluorimetric binding studies, using an enzyme concentation of 2 μm. With all His-162 and Arg-269 variants and similar to wtPHBH, quenching of flavin fluorescence was observed. From the titration curves and treating the data according to 1:1 binding (30Thompson S.T. Stellwagen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), dissociation constants of 0.22 ± 0.05 μm and 1.2 ± 0.3 μm were estimated for the wtPHBH-Cibacron blue 3GA and R269T-Cibacron blue 3GA complex, respectively. These values are in reasonable agreement with the values deduced from the absorption difference spectral analysis. Altogether, the binding studies with Cibacron blue 3GA suggest that there is a corrrelation between the affinity of the mutant enzymes with the free and the immobilized dye. However, it is clear that the binding characteristics of the free dye do not simply predict the affinity of the mutant enzymes with the immobilized dye. The His-162 and Arg-269 replacements did not change the optical properties of the flavin prosthetic group. The flavin absorption spectra of all mutants were identical to wtPHBH (26Van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, the flavin perturbation difference spectra in the presence of POHB indicated the flavin “in” conformation (14Gatti D.L. Palfey B.A. Lah M.S. Entsch B. Massey V. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Similar to the wild-type enzyme (26Van Berkel W.J.H. Westphal A.H. Eschrich K. Eppink M.H.M. de Kok A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the flavin fluorescence of the His-162 and Arg-269 mutants strongly decreased upon POHB binding. For all mutants, substrate binding could be described by simple binary complex formation with dissociation constants ranging from 20 to 40 μm. O"
https://openalex.org/W2047651782,"The C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) has previously been shown to bind to a highly conserved six-amino acid motif very close to the C terminus of adenovirus early region 1A (Ad E1A) proteins. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that has facilitated the screening of synthetic peptides identical or similar to the binding site on Ad E1A for their ability to bind CtBP and thus inhibit its interaction with Ad12 E1A. It has been shown that amino acids both C-terminal and N-terminal to the original proposed binding site contribute to the interaction of peptides with CtBP. Single amino acid substitutions across the binding site appreciably alter the Kd of the peptide for CtBP, indicative of a marked reduction in the affinity of the peptide for CtBP. The solution structures of synthetic peptides equivalent to the C termini of both Ad5 and Ad12 E1A and two substituted forms of these have been determined by proton NMR spectroscopy. Both the Ad12 and Ad5 peptides dissolved in trifluoroethanol/water mixtures were found to adopt regular secondary structural conformations seen as a series of β-turns. An Ad12 peptide bearing a substitution that resulted in only very weak binding to CtBP (Ad12 L258G) was found to be random coil in solution. However, a second mutant (Ad12 V256K), which bound to CtBP rather more strongly (although not as well as the wild type), adopted a conformation similar to that of the wild type. We conclude that secondary structure (β-turns) and an appropriate series of amino acid side chains are necessary for recognition by CtBP.

Adenovirus E1A DNA encodes two major proteins that are expressed from differentially spliced mRNAs of sedimentation coefficients 13 and 12 S.

It is now clear that Ad E1A proteins have no enzymic properties of their own but exert their influence on the host cell through a series of protein-protein interactions with important cellular regulatory molecules. Thus, E1A has been shown to bind to pRb105 and the related p107 and p130 proteins, p300/CBP, ATF2, and TBP (reviewed in Ref. 6Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction sites for all of these proteins on E1A have been established by mutational and deletional analysis, and most have been shown to occur in regions conserved in the E1As from different virus serotypes. For example, the pRb family of proteins binds in conserved regions (CRs) 1 and 2 (7Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E.

A further region conserved between different E1As, although not generally included in the group of E1A conserved regions, occurs at the C terminus of the protein (17Kimelman D. Miller J.S. Porter D. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Moran E. Mathews M. Cell. 1987; 48: 177-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This amino acid sequence is involved in binding to the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), which appears to be involved in the regulation of E1A CR1-dependent control of transcription (19Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3347-3354Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This, in turn, plays a role in E1A-mediated transformation. Thus, deletion of the C-terminal portions of exon 2 enhances transformation by E1A and activated ras and the tumorigenesis of the resulting cell lines (20Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. LaRegina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Schaeper et al. (21Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G.

E1A to amino acids 279–284 by fine deletional analysis. We have enlarged on this previous study and examined the effects of deletions on either side of the six-amino acid sequence as well as the effect on binding of each amino acid in turn. Thus, we have used an ELISA to determine the contribution of each amino acid to the E1A binding site for CtBP. In addition, using NMR spectroscopy the structure of the C terminus of Ad E1A, which includes both the CtBP binding and the nuclear localization signal (22Lyons R.H. Ferguson B.Q. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2451-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), has been determined. The effects of mutations that disrupt binding to CtBP on the structure of the C terminus of E1A has also been examined. Twenty-nine synthetic peptides were prepared (Table I), using standard f-moc procedures and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile (0–100%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.

The interaction of peptides identical to the C-terminal region of Ad12 E1A or mutant peptides (peptides in which substitutions to the wild type sequence have been made are termed “mutants”) with CtBP was examined using ELISA techniques. Ninety-six-well plates were coated with purified Ad12 E1A (0.1 μg/well) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. E1A peptides, serially diluted from 1.5–400 μg/ml, were mixed with GST-CtBP (12 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature prior to adding to each well. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-80. CtBP bound to E1A on the plate was determined by incubation with an antibody against GST (antibody raised in goats, diluted 1:5000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody against goat IgG (1:1000 Santa Cruz). After the addition of substrate, absorbance was determined at 405 nm using a Bio-Tek plate reader. Determinations were carried out in quadruplicate, and kinetic analysis was performed (see below). The interactions between CtBP and full-length Ad E1A and between CtBP and synthetic peptides identical to portions of the C terminus of Ad E1A (Table I) were analyzed using a nonlinear least-squares approach. The standard binding function, Y=Ymax·[L]/([L]+Kd)Equation 1 was applied, where Y represents the percentage of E1A bound to GST-CtBP in the presence of varying amounts of E1A peptide, [L], Kd represents the equilibrium binding constant, and Ymax represents the end point for the binding interaction (see, for example, Ref. 24Malinski J.A. Zera E.M. Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12919-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The affinity of CtBP for synthetic peptides was measured by competition with native E1A, and Kd values are quoted as the mean values from four experiments (± S.E.). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX500 MHz spectrometer using samples of peptides of between 5 and 10 mm concentration in 50% (v/v)d3 TFE/40% H2O/10%2H2O, pH 5.5, at 285 K. Trifluoroethanol (TFE) was used as a co-solvent with water because TFE-water mixtures are known to promote hydrogen bond formation within peptides that already possess an intrinsic folding capability (25Shin H.C. Merutka G. Waltho J.P. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Where appropriate (for the Ad12 wild type and Ad5 E*8 peptides), deuterated dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to prevent intermolecular disulfide bridge formation. Two-dimensional experiments were acquired with 2000 data points in F2 with a sweep width of 11ppm and with 480–608 rows in F1. The water resonance was suppressed by either a weak presaturation applied during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) or by using a WATERGATE sequence (26Saudek V. Piotto M. Sklenár V. Bruker Rep. 1994; 140: 6-9Google Scholar). Solvent impurities were removed using pulsed field gradients. Standard pulse sequences were employed for one-dimensional (simple pulse-collect and two-pulse Carr-Purcell spin-echo) experiments and two-dimensional (TOCSY, NOESY, and COSY) experiments. Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments (32–64 transients) used an MLEV-17 mixing pulse of 60 ms duration (10 kHz spin locking field). Thirty-two transients were acquired for double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (COSY) experiments. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) experiments used mixing times of 100, 200, and 400 ms duration with between 96 and 128 transients. TOCSY and double quantum filtered COSY experiments were used to identify spin systems within residues that were linked to sequential NOE assignments (dαN(i, i+1)) in NOESY spectra. Inter-proton distances were calculated from NOESY spectra (200-ms mixing time) by integration of each cross-peak. Distances were then grouped into three classes between strong and very weak (strong and medium NOEs were allocated the same distance constraints in structural calculations). Backbone hydrogen bonding patterns within the peptides were assessed by following the movement of chemical shift of backbone amide protons with changes in temperature (at 285, 290, 295, 300, and 305 K) in TOCSY experiments. Temperature shift coefficients were calculated from the slope of a plot of temperature against chemical shift and were linear in every case. The structures of the peptides were calculated using X-PLOR 3.8.5.1 (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, Cambridge, MA1992Google Scholar). The CA, HA, N, HN, CB*, and CG* atoms of each residue were embedded using the distance geometry dg-sub-embed routine. The remaining atoms were ordered by template fitting, and the atomic coordinates were allowed to evolve under the applied NOE distance constraints during the dgsa and refine simulated annealing subroutines. From 100 structures calculated, approximately 30 were discarded (wrong-handed in the distance geometry routine). Of the remaining structures, only those (47 structures) with no violations of the applied NOEs greater than 0.5 Å were selected for further analysis. Donor-acceptor pairs were identified by analysis of the structures in the absence of hydrogen bond constraints. In every case the donor corresponded to a backbone amide proton signal with a temperature shift coefficient of between 1.0 and 3.0 ppb/K. Final structures were calculated by the inclusion of constraints for hydrogen bonds. Previous studies (21Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) have shown that a 6-a.a. sequence (279PLDLSC284), located close to the C terminus of Ad5 289-a.a. E1A, is responsible for binding to the 48-kDa cellular phosphoprotein, CtBP. An homologous sequence in the Ad12 protein (255PVDLSV260) was also suggested as a binding site. Western blotting was used to confirm that bacterially expressed purified Ad12 E1A protein interacts with GST-CtBP (data not shown). To quantify the interaction between E1A and CtBP, an ELISA was developed. This also had the advantage of allowing relatively rapid processing of a large number of samples so that the effects of substitutions within, and deletions of, amino acids adjacent to the binding site on E1A could be determined. The data presented in Fig.1 A show that on addition of increasing concentrations of GST-CtBP to either 266-a.a. or 235-a.a. Ad12 E1A (bound to the ELISA plate), binding occurred. Analysis of these data using Equation 1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”) gave values of 4.5 × 10−9 and 10.3 × 10−9m for the dissociation of GST-CtBP from Ad12 266-a.a. and 235-a.a. proteins, respectively, as has been reported previously (23Grand R.J.A. Gash L. Milner A.E. Molloy D.P. Szestak T. Turnell A.T. Gallimore P.H. Virology. 1998; 244: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In order to define structural elements within the C terminus of Ad12 E1A involved in the interaction with CtBP, four sets of synthetic peptides were prepared (TableI), and the ability of each to inhibit the binding of GST-CtBP to Ad12 E1A was determined. Examples of some competitive binding experiments are presented in Fig. 1 B. Initially, peptides equivalent to various lengths of the Ad12 wild type sequence were examined (Table I, set 1). It can be seen that deletion of the amino acids from either end of peptide A4 (Glu249–Val254 and Arg262–Asn266) increased theKd seen in peptides A5, A6, A7, B5, and B6, indicating that amino acids outside the suggested binding site of E1A (21Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) contribute to structural determinants required for optimal recognition by CtBP. This is particularly evident with peptides A6 and A7, which appear to bind CtBP much more weakly than A4. The absence of amino acids at either the N or C terminus will have structural implications for the binding site itself. However, these findings clearly demonstrate that the presence of the amino acid sequence255PVDLSV260 alone is not sufficient for recognition and strong binding by CtBP and that these residues must adopt an appropriate configuration. It is also possible that the deleted N- or C-terminal residues participate directly in the interaction. The increased Kd values determined for B5 and B6 and the peptides in set 2 (see below) certainly supports the proposition that amino acids on both sides of the proposed site make sufficient contribution to binding to change the Kdseveralfold. It should be noted, however, that although these truncations reduce the affinity (i.e. increaseKd), they do not totally abolish interactions. Thus, there is not an absolute requirement for a structured binding site, although its presence certainly strengthens binding. In the second set of peptides (Table I) individual residues across the binding site were substituted with alanine. Substitution at positions 253, 257, 260, and 261 (peptides C*8, D*4, D*7, and D*8, respectively) had essentially little or no effect on the determinedKd. However, when Ala replaced residues Val254, Pro255, Val256, Lys258, or Ser259, the ability of the peptide to bind CtBP was appreciably impaired. This confirms that Val254 contributes to binding to CtBP, although not to the same extent as the succeeding five amino acids. Particularly disruptive of binding is the substitution of P255A (D*2), which presumably alters a secondary structural element within the peptide. The observation that the replacement D257A does not affect the interaction implies that the nature of the Asp side chain is not directly involved in binding to CtBP and that the conformational integrity of the peptide is maintained by Ala at that position in the sequence. In set 3 peptides, rather more radical substitutions have been introduced into the proposed binding site (Table I). The replacement of Val256 by Glu increased the Kd of peptide C1 only modestly, whereas all of the other changes give peptides with much reduced affinity for CtBP. Some changes obviously have a greater effect than others. For example, the substitution L258A (D*5, set 2) or L258G (C4, set 3) gave peptides with affinities of 20 and 29 × 10−6m, respectively, but the substitution L258E (C5, set 3) reduced the affinity considerably more (Kd = 120 × 10−6m). These findings imply that in contrast to Asp257, the large hydrophobic moiety of Lys258 is required to participate directly in the binding interaction with CtBP. Because CtBP is able to interact with C-terminal regions of both Ad12 and Ad5 E1A, we investigated whether a synthetic peptide equivalent to the Ad5 protein would compete with the Ad12 E1A for CtBP. It was found that a peptide equivalent to Ad5 E1A (Table I, set 4, F*1) binds considerably more weakly to CtBP than peptide A4 (set 1), suggesting that the CtBP·Ad12 E1A complex may be inherently more stable than the CtBP·Ad5 E1A complex. However, a peptide, E*8 carrying the N-terminal Ad12 sequence and spanning the C terminus of Ad5, and thereby carrying Val254 (see set 1, above) was found to have a Kd similar to the wild type Ad12 peptide. These findings suggest again that Val254contributes to the interaction with CtBP. Having established that there are considerable conformational restraints imposed on the binding site for CtBP, we considered that it would be of appreciable interest to investigate the structure adopted by this region of Ad E1A. To obtain as much information as possible, a peptide identical to residues Glu247–Asn266 of Ad12 E1A was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig.2). Although this peptide bound to CtBP with affinity equivalent to that for A4, it was anticipated that the extra 2 a.a. at the N terminus would contribute to the stability of the solution conformation. The NOE cross-peaks observed in the amide-α region of a NOESY spectrum (mixing time, 200 ms) along with a summary of the observed NOEs are shown in Fig. 2. Whereas weak connectivities of the type dβN(i, i+2) Glu247–Glu249, Glu251–Thr253, and Gln252–Val254 were observed, the conformation over residues Glu247–Glu251 is poorly defined, and in the absence of medium range NOEs, residues Pro263–Asn266 show evidence of pronounced fraying (Fig. 3). However, NOEs of the type dαN(i, i+2) Val256–Leu258, Asp257–Ser259, Leu258–Val260, Ser259–Lys261, Val260–Arg262, dNN(i, i+2) Val256–Leu258, Leu258–Val260, and weakdαN(i, i+3) Val254–Asp257 and Asp257–Val260 (Fig. 2 B) indicate that on average, the backbone displays a considerable conformational preference between residues Val254 and Arg262, illustrated by good alignment between the superimposed structures (Fig.3).Figure 21H NMR assignments for the 20-a.a. wild type Ad12 peptide.

Myocardial growth is dependent upon a variety of extracellular factors, signaling through both receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled seven-span membrane receptors (1Chien K.R. Science. 1993; 260: 916-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A unique feature of myocardial growth is that it switches from a mitotic to a hypertrophic mechanism during ontogeny. The former process is characterized by proliferation of cardiomyocytes, and the latter by an increase in cell volume without DNA synthesis or cell division (2Zak R. Circ. Res. Suppl. 1974; 2: 17-26Google Scholar). This switch is associated with terminal differentiation of cardiomyocytes and occurs gradually during heart development, starting during the late embryonic stages and ending a few weeks after birth (3Ueno H. Perryman M.B. Roberts R. Schneider M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During this period, gene expression, particularly that involving the cell cycle and signaling, is reprogrammed. For example, expression of a number of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and other cell cycle components decreases (4McGill C.J. Brooks G. Cardiovac. Res. 1995; 30: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Liu Q. Yan H. Dawes N.J. Mottino G.A. Frank J.S. Zhu H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Concomitant with the switch to hypertrophic growth, cardiac muscle cells show a diminished response to receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated mitogenic stimuli, while maintaining or enhancing their responses to G-protein-coupled stimuli (6Bilsen V.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors can result in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, even when applied to cells derived from neonatal hearts, and the application of such stimuli to cultured cells has proved to be a useful model for evaluating the biochemical mechanisms of hypertrophy (8Zhou M. Henry M.S. Evans R.M. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E.

Hypertrophy associated with activation of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte α1-adrenergic receptors has been well studied and appears to involve both Gq- andras-dependent pathways (10Hunter J.J.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases may also be involved, as they can be independently induced by both heterotrimeric G-protein- andras-mediated pathways (12Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Feig L.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 236-240Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The mechanisms underlying the switch from a proliferative to a hypertrophic phenotype, or the potential regulators of the hypertrophic response, however, remain unknown. Since not only serine/threonine kinases but also tyrosine kinases are involved in the development of hypertrophy, it is possible that protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphatePTPasesprotein-tyrosine phosphataseRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphatePTPasesprotein-tyrosine phosphataseRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s). may be critically involved in the induction of hypertrophy, or the enhanced G-protein-mediated responsiveness and the diminished receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated effects observed with terminal differentiation. Indeed, PTPases have been demonstrated to both positively and negatively regulate signaling pathways.To this end, we have used a degenerate primer-based RT-PCR procedure to isolate cDNAs encoding PTPases from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The primers used in these studies were synthesized based on the catalytic domains of PTPases. Specifically, these domains each encompass approximate 240 residues that include the consensus signature motif, (I/V)HCXAGXXXR(S/T). Using this approach, four abundantly expressed PTPases were identified, including three that had been isolated previously (PTP-LAR, PTPδ, PTP-PEST) (14Tsai A.Y. Itoh M. Streuli M. Thai T. Saito H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10534-10543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Yang Q. Co D. Sommercorn J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6622-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a fourth that encoded a novel PTP-like protein, designated PTP-TD14. The full-length PTP-TD14 isolated from a rat brain cDNA library encodes a 164-kDa protein. Although its expression is not confined to cardiomyocytes, it contains a PTP-like catalytic domain at its C-terminal end. In addition, it contains a novel domain with homology to a yeast signaling protein, BRO-1, at its N-terminal end (17Nickas M. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When expressed in NIH-3T3 cells, PTP-TD14 inhibits ras-mediated focus formation. This inhibitory activity resides in the C-terminal PTP-like domain, since a mutant, in which the putative catalytic activity of PTP-TD14 is presumably inactive, fails to inhibit transformation. Although phosphatase activity was not evident with conventional substrates, p164PTP-TD14 may selectively interact with an as yet unidentified 115-kDa protein, which is phosphorylated in response to serum treatment. Thus, PTP-TD14 encodes a novel protein that is likely critically involved in regulatingras-mediated mitogenic activity.RESULTSThree hundred clones resulting from RT-PCR amplification of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte RNA were sequenced, and fragments containing PTP-like domains were identified. These 61 cDNA fragments encoded 16 different PTPases (Fig.1 b). The mRNAs of the first four PTPases isolated were relatively abundant in cardiac muscle cells, as evidenced by Northern analysis of total RNA prepared from cultured cardiomyocytes (data not shown). However, the others were not detectable by Northern analysis. Fig. 1 b shows the relative abundance of different PTPases among the PCR-generated cDNAs. The two most abundant cDNAs were PTP-LAR and PTPδ. They encode related receptor-linked PTPases with immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains in their extracellular regions and are involved in cell adhesion-dependent signaling pathways. The fourth most abundant clone, PTP-PEST, is a soluble cytoplasmic protein (16Yang Q. Co D. Sommercorn J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

The third most abundant cDNA encoded a novel PTPase, designated PTP-TD14. Northern blot analysis performed with the PTP-TD14 cDNA fragment revealed that, although its expression was not confined to heart, its mRNA was abundant in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We, thus, isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA for PTP-TD14.Specifically, the PTP-TD14 PCR fragment was used to probe a rat brain cDNA library. As shown in Fig. 1 c, three clones were isolated, which by sequence analysis are overlapping. The longest, clone 1 (4.8 kb) contains an open reading frame encoding a 164-kDa protein (1494 amino acids) as well as portions of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (Fig.2 a; GenBankTMaccession number AF077000). Clone 2 consists of a partial PTP-TD14 cDNA at its 5′ end that is fused to a partial cDNA for Na+/K+ ATPase at the 3′ end. Clone 3 is a partial PTP-TD14 cDNA (nucleotides 1321–4778 of clone 1). With all clones, the nucleotide sequence in the region around that encoding the boundary between the N-terminal BRO1 (see below) and C-terminal PTP-like domain is identical. To exclude the possibility that the 5′ end of clone 1, which is not present on clone 3, has resulted from fusion with a distinct gene, the presence of this 5′ region on the PTP-TD14 transcript was evaluated by RT-PCR and by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). This confirmed that the entire open reading frame of clone 1 is, indeed, a single transcript.Computer analysis of the 164-kDa protein, p164PTP-TD14, encoded by PTP-TD14, revealed that it lacks an apparent transmembrane segment, a signal peptide, or a targeting sequence for localization to a discrete intracellular organelle. It is, however, extremely proline-rich (17%), particularly in the midportion that separates two distinct domains (Fig. 2 a).The N-terminal domain shows no homology with any known mammalian protein in either the GenBankTM or Pro-Site data bases. However, it does show a high degree of identity with BRO-1 (Fig.2 b), a yeast protein involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (17Nickas M. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Like members of the BRO-1 family, PTP-TD14 contains the highly conserved sequence, KDNDFIYHEXV(S/P) (KDNDFIYHEAVP in PTP-TD14), at a position close to the N terminus, as well as two putative SH3 domain-binding sites near the C-terminal end of its BRO1-like domain.The C-terminal domain of p164PTP-TD14 contains a region that shows homology with the catalytic domains of PTPases and includes the sequence VHCSSGVGRTGAF. This differs by one residue (underlined) from the PTPase catalytic signature motif in which alanine is found instead of the serine (24Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Overall, this PTPase domain sequence is rather unique in comparison with the consensus sequences identified from others (Fig. 2 c). As shown in Fig.2 c, out of 54 consensus residues there are 13 variations in the PTPase domain of p164PTP-TD14 (double underlined residues in Fig. 2 c). To evaluate the phosphatase activity of p164PTP-TD14, it was expressed in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitates of the expressed protein were then tested using both a nonspecific PTPase assay in which a Tyr-phosphorylated peptide is the substrate (biotin-DGDFEEIPEEY(PO4), corresponding to hirudin 53–65, (Boehringer Mannheim)), or an assay in which Tyr-phosphorylated myelin basic protein is the substrate. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was used as a positive control for both assays. Phosphatase activity was not observed with either assay (data not shown).Nevertheless, evidence that p164PTP-TD14 may have the phosphatase activity was obtained from Ha-ras-mediated transformation experiments. In these studies, the wild-type PTP-TD14 or a mutant construct, PTP-TD14Δ, was separately co-transfected with a Ha-ras-expressing plasmid into NIH-3T3 cells. The PTP-TD14Δ mutant lacks residues 1099 to the C-terminal end that encompass the putative catalytic region residues 1139–1316, but retains the entire BRO-1 domain and two putative SH3-domain binding sites (Fig. 3 a). The purpose of these experiments was to examine whether p164PTP-TD14could influence ras-mediated mitogenic activity, since BRO-1 is involved in yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 3 b, expression of PTP-TD14 in NIH-3T3 cells inhibited Ha-ras-mediated foci formation to less than one-third. This inhibitory effect was dependent on the amount of PTP-TD14 cDNA transfected (data not shown) and was independent of variations in transfection efficiency, since these were controlled in all experiments by co-transfection with a green fluorescent protein expression vector. Thus, after normalization for transfection efficiency, PTP-TD14 produced a mean 3.3-fold decrease in Ha-ras-induced foci, compared with cells transformed with Ha-ras alone. This inhibitory effect of p164PTP-TD14 was dependent on its PTP-like domain, since no decrease in foci formation was observed with the PTP-TD14Δ construct. To obtain more confirmative data supporting the above result, a mutant (PTP-TD14c/s) was constructed, in which the Cys in the catalytic motif (VHCSSGVGRTGAF) was replaced by Ser. This point mutation resulted in abolishment of the negative regulation to Ha-ras-mediated transformation (Fig. 3 c).Figure 3Effect of PTP-TD14 on oncogenic Ha-ras-mediated NIH-3T3 cell transformation-focus formation. a, a diagram of structures of wild-type PTP-TD14 and the C-terminal deletion mutant, PTP-TD14Δ, which lacks most of the PTP catalytic domain. b , the pcDNA3 vector, PTP-TD14, and PTP-TD14Δ were separately transfected or cotransfected with Ha-ras into NIH-3T3 cells, as indicated, to examine the effect of PTP-TD14 or PTP-TD14Δ proteins on Ha-ras-mediated foci formation. c, a mutant, in which the Cys1250 was converted to Ser (top panel), was tested by the focus formation experiment (bottom panel).

In these studies, the wild-type PTP-TD14F or a deletion mutant, PTP-TD14ΔF, each containing a sequence encoding an N-terminal Flag epitope, was used in transfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 4,a and b, a 164- or 122-kDa protein was observed in COS-7 or NIH-3T3 cells transfected with either the wild-type or mutant construct, respectively. Transfected cells were either maintained in a serum-free medium or stimulated with 50% fetal bovine serum, as detailed in the figure legends and under “Materials and Methods.” Using an anti-Flag antibody to precipitate the 164- and 122-kDa proteins, and an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for the Western blot, a tyrosine-phosphorylated 115-kDa protein was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with PTP-TD14ΔF from both COS-7 (Fig.4 a) and NIH-3T3 (Fig. 4 b) cells. Phosphorylation of this 115-kDa protein was restricted to serum-stimulated cells. However, this 115-kDa protein could not be recognized with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after anti-Flag immunoprecipitation of cells transfected either with the wild-type construct, or with the Cys to Ser mutation construct, PTP-TD14c/s (data not shown), which contains the putative catalytic region of the PTP-like domain.Figure 4p164PTP-TD14 expression and co-immunoprecipitation of a 115-kDa protein with the p122PTP-TD14ΔF. PTP-TD14 and PTP-TD14Δ were, respectively, attached to a Flag epitope at their N terminus (PTP-TD14F and PTP-TD14ΔF) and expressed in COS-7 (a) or NIH-3T3 cells (b). p164PTP-TD14F or p122PTP-TD14ΔF proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag gel and analyzed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against the Flag-epitope or phospho-Tyr residues as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the subcellular localization of p164PTP-TD14and the influence of the catalytic region of the PTP-like domain on localization, expression of the wild-type PTP-TD14F and the truncated construct (PTP-TD14ΔF) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in COS-7 or NIH-3T3 cells. In these studies the wild-type protein was evident in cytoplasmic vesicular structures, and this localization was unaltered by deletion of the catalytic region of the PTP-like domain (Fig. 5). This localization was independent of serum stimulation, since the localization is not affected by culturing cells in serum-free medium or with addition of serum stimulation (data not shown).Figure 5Subcellular localysation of the Flag-PTP-TD14 and Flag-PTP-TD14Δ proteins in COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells.

Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus far, more than 75 PTPases have been identified in different species, including both receptor-linked and nontransmembrane types. These proteins are involved in various biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (25Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 54: 897-930Crossref Google Scholar). For example, PTP1B, a functionally well defined protein, is implicated as a negative regulator in insulin-mediated cell responses (26Cicirelli M.F. Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Weiel J.E. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5514-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Tonks N.K. Cicirelli M.F. Diltz C.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this PTPase has recently been proven to suppress v-crk-, v-src-, or v-ras-mediated 3Y1 cell transformation through binding with the SH3-domain of a docking protein, p130CAS (29Byon J.C. Kenner K.A. Kusari A. Kusari J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A mutation in the SH3-domain binding site of the PTPase resulted in the loss of the binding and suppression activities, indicating that the suppression is not due to a nonspecific PTPase catalytic activity.The PTPase family is characterized by the presence of a conserved catalytic domain of approximately 240 residues, including the signature motif (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T). The receptor-linked PTPases contain, in addition to their extracellular ligand-binding and single transmembrane domains, two catalytic domains located intracellularly on their cytoplasmic tail. However, with some receptor-linked PTPases, phosphatase activity is confined to only one of the two putative catalytic domains (31Saito H. Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Itoh H. Tsai A.Y. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphatase activity has not been demonstrated for some receptor-linked PTPases that contain only a single putative catalytic domain. These PTP-like proteins may therefore have regulatory functions by interacting with specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. In support of this notion, it has been demonstrated that a point mutation in the catalytic domain of PTP-PEST inactivates its phosphatase activity, but does not prevent tight substrate binding (22Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).In contrast with most receptor-linked PTPases, nontransmembrane PTPases contain only a single putative catalytic domain, with their noncatalytic regions being diverse and likely serving a targeting or regulatory function (32Stone R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31323-31326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a recently identified member of the nonreceptor PTPases, MEG2, has its catalytic domain linked to an N-terminal segment with sequence similarity to the cellular retinaldehyde binding protein and to SEC14p of Saccharomyces cerevisae, which acts as a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (33Gu M. Warshasky I. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal domain of this PTPase may control the activity of its catalytic domain by binding a lipid moiety.Here we report the isolation and initial characterization of a novel putative PTPase. Like MEG2, p164PTP-TD14 has a unique N-terminal segment consisting of a BRO1-like domain with two putative SH3-domain binding sites (17Nickas M. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, p164PTP-TD14 has a proline-rich central region, and a distinct putative catalytic domain, located in its C-terminal segment, that nonetheless shows critical regions of homology with other PTPases.The high degree of homology between the N-terminal segment of p164PTP-TD14 and the yeast BRO1 family of proteins suggests that it may represent the first identified mammalian homologue of this family. Yeast cells which either possess a mutant form of the BRO1 gene (which presumably produces an inactive protein) or lack the BRO1 gene, display phenotypes similar to those caused by deletion of BCK1, a gene encoding a methylethylketone kinase that functions in a mitogen-activated pathway mediating maintenance of cell integrity. Cells with BRO1 mutations exhibit a temperature-sensitive growth defect that is suppressed by addition of osmotic stabilisers or Ca2+ to the growth medium, or by additional copies of the BCK1 gene. Cells with double mutations of BRO1 andBCK1 are lethal, suggesting a critical role for BRO1 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.BRO1 proteins have two structural characteristics: one is that they contain a distinct 11-amino acid motif (KDNDFIYHEXV(S/P)), and the other is in the presence of several putative SH3 domain-binding sites. Proteins with these two characteristics are BRO1 homologues and have been implicated in an array of biological responses. For example, Pal A, a BRO1-like protein from Aspergillus, is involved in pH-dependent signaling (34Negrete-urtasun S. Denison S.H. Arst H.N. JR. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since vesicle transport is altered in BRO1 mutant yeast, 2M. Yaffe, personal communication. BRO1 signaling may also control vesicle docking or transport. As shown here (Fig. 5), p164PTP-TD14 is also associated with vesicle-like structures in mammalian cells. This association appears not to require the catalytic or C-terminal region of its PTPase domain, since both the full-length and C-terminal truncated proteins are vesicle-associated. Thus, the BRO1 domain of p164PTP-TD14 may determine its intracellular localization.The putative PTPase catalytic region of p164PTP-TD14 shows 34.7% sequence identity with the comparable region of PTP-PEST and contains the sequence VHCSSGVRTGAF. This differs only by an alanine to serine (underlined) substitution from the PTPase signature motif. It is thus tempting to speculate that despite the conservative nature of this substitution, the alanine in this position is critical for catalysis and thus explains the inability to detect phosphatase activity with p164PTP-TD14. In keeping with this notion, in PTPLP, which lacks phosphatase activity, this alanine is not present (35Kambrayashi Y. Takahashi K. Bardhan S. Inagami T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution of this alanine in PTP LAR abolishes phosphatase activity. However, in both cases the alanine is replaced by a very nonconservative residue, aspartic acid. Also, the receptor-linked PTPase, PTPε, has an alanine in this position in both of its putative catalytic domains, and yet only one has phosphatase activity. Finally, several dual function PTPases, which have both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatase activities, retain catalytic activity despite nonconservative substitution of this alanine with either a lysine or arginine (36Tonks N.K. Yang A.J. Flint M.F.B.G. Gebbink B.R. Franza JR. Hill D.E. Sun H. Brady-Kalnay S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp."
https://openalex.org/W2028987742,"The ErbB2 and ErbB3 proteins together constitute a functional coreceptor for heregulin (neuregulin). Heregulin stimulates the phosphorylation of both coreceptor constituents and initiates a variety of other signaling events, which include phosphorylation of the Shc protein. The role of Shc in heregulin-stimulated signal transduction through the ErbB2·ErbB3 coreceptor was investigated here. Heregulin was found to promote ErbB3/Shc association in NIH-3T3 cells expressing endogenous ErbB2 and recombinant ErbB3. A mutant ErbB3 protein was generated in which Tyr-1325 in a consensus Shc phosphotyrosine-binding domain recognition site was mutated to Phe (ErbB3-Y/F). This mutation abolished the association of Shc with ErbB3 and blocked the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by heregulin. Whereas heregulin induced mitogenesis in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with wild-type ErbB3 cDNA, this mitogenic response was markedly attenuated in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the ErbB3-Y/F cDNA. These results showed a specific interaction of Shc with the ErbB3 receptor protein and demonstrated the importance of this interaction in the activation of mitogenic responses by the ErbB2·ErbB3 heregulin coreceptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091586560,"No mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) activity is detected in crystalline bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex, which possesses full electron transfer activity. However, when the complex is treated with increasing concentrations of Triton X-100 at 37 °C, the electron transfer activity decreases, whereas peptidase activity increases. Maximum MPP activity is obtained when the electron transfer activity in the complex is completely inactivated with 1.5 mm of Triton X-100. This result supports our suggestion that the lack of MPP activity in the mammalian cytochrome bc1complex is because of binding of an inhibitor polypeptide to the active site of MPP located at the interface of core subunits I and II. This suggestion is based on the three-dimensional structural information for the bc1 complex and the sequence homology between subunits of MPP and the core subunits of the beef complex. Triton X-100, at concentrations that disrupt the structural integrity of the bc1 complex as indicated by the loss of its electron transfer activity, weakens the binding of inhibitor polypeptide to the active site of MPP in core subunits, thus activating MPP. The Triton X-100-activated MPP is pH-, buffer system-, ionic strength-, and temperature-dependent. Maximum activity is observed with an assay mixture containing 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer at neutral pH (6.5–8.5) and at 37 °C. Activated MPP is completely inhibited by metal ion chelators such as EDTA ando-phenanthroline and partially inhibited by myxothiazol (58%), ferricyanide (28%), and dithiothreitol (81%). The metal ion chelator-inhibited activity can be partially restored by the addition of divalent cations such as Zn2+ (68%), Mg2+(44%), Mn2+ (54%), Co2+ (62%), and Fe2+ (92%), indicating that metal ion is required for MPP activity. The cleavage site specificity of activated MPP depends more on the length of amino acid sequence from the mature protein portion and less on the presequence portion, when a synthetic peptide composed of NH2-terminal residues of a mature protein and the COOH-terminal residues of its presequence is used as a substrate.

Biochemical and biophysical studies of the three major subunits have been extensive and a wealth information has been obtained. However, the functions of the supernumerary subunits are largely unknown.

EMBO J. 1988; 8: 2605-2612Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and shown to contain two nonidentical subunits, α-MPP and β-MPP, that cooperate in processing. Both subunits are matrix proteins except for β-MPP fromN. crassa, which is partially attached to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Most mitochondrial precursor proteins are cleaved to the mature form in a single step by MPP. MPPs of different species share common amino acid motifs, including the zinc binding HXXEH(X)72–76E motif in the β-subunit and the HXXEK(X)72–76E or HXXD/ER(X)72–76E in the α-subunit (25Striebel H.-M. Rysavy P. Adamea J. Spizek J. Kalouek F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 235: 211-218Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both histidines and the distal glutamate in the HXXEH(X)72–76E motif of the β-subunit are zinc binding residues and constitute the active site of MPP. The spacing of about 72–76 amino acids between the putative 2nd and 3rd metal binding residues seems to be of importance for enzyme function, as this distance is conserved during evolution from S. cerevisiae to plant and mammalian MPPs. Sequence analysis reveals that core I protein of the bovinebc1 complex (26Gencic S. Schagger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) 2GenBankTM accession number X59692(revised 12/11/96). has 56% identity with the β-subunit of rat MPP, 38% with yeast, and 42% with potato, and core II protein (26Gencic S. Schagger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is 27% identical to the α-subunit of rat MPP, 28% to yeast, and 30% to potato. In addition, a sequence of Y57XXE60H61(X)76E137, similar to the zinc-binding motif, HXXEHX76E, in the β-subunit of MPP, is present in the core I protein of the bovine complex. The recent three-dimensional structural information on thebc1 complex shows that glutamic acid 137 is close to the other two metal binding residues, tyrosine 57 and histidine 61, in the putative zinc binding motif of the core I protein (no electron density is apparent for zinc atom in the structure at the current level of resolution (7Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar)). Also, lysine 286 and arginine 287 of the core II protein are structurally close to the putative zinc binding motif of the core I protein and may contribute to the active site (see Fig. 1). Despite the sequence homology between the core subunits of the beefbc1 complex and those of MPP and the presence of a zinc binding motif, similar to that of MPP, in the core I protein, no MPP activity is detected in the active beef bc1complex. In the bc1 crystal, the overall shape of each core protein resembles a bowl with approximate twofold integral symmetry. The NH2-terminal domain of core I is interacting with the COOH-terminal domain of core II and vice versa.Core I and core II enclose a big cavity. Because the two internal approximate 2-fold rotation axes of core I and core II differ in direction by 14.5°, the two bowls come together in the form of a ball, with a crack leading to the internal cavity. The crack is filled with part of the 50-residue sequence of an unassigned polypeptide (see Fig. 1B of Ref. 7Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Based on this structural information, we suggest that the lack of MPP activity in bovinebc1 complex is because of the binding of a polypeptide to the active site of MPP in the core subunits upon complex maturation. If this suggestion is correct, one would expect to see MPP activity when this inhibitor polypeptide is released or its binding to the core proteins is weakened. Herein we report the conditions for activation of MPP from the crystalline cytochromebc1 complex and the properties of activated MPP. Preliminary results on this subject have been reported (28Deng K.P. Xia D. Kachurin A.M. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 319aGoogle Scholar). Cytochrome c, Type III, Triton X-100, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma. Diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine was a product of Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. 2,3-Dimethoxyl-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinone (Q2) and its reduced form (Q2H2) were synthesized as reported previously (29Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4096-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Asolectin was a product of Associate Concentrate. Other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Polypeptides that are composed of COOH-terminal regions of presequences and NH2-terminal regions (as indicated by bold letters) of matured subunits of V, IV, and β-F1 were synthesized by the Recombinant DNA/Protein Resource Core Facility at Oklahoma State University. These synthetic polypeptides are: 1) V P A S V R Y S H T D I K(−7 V+6); 2) A S V R Y S H T D I K V P D F S D Y R R P E V L D(−5 V+20); 3) R P L V A S V S L N V P A S V R Y S H T D I K V P D F(−17 V+10); 4) A V A L H S A V S AS D L E L H P P S Y(−10 IV+10); 5) A V A L H S A V S AS D L E L H P P S Y P W S H R G L L S S(−10 IV+20); 6) A L Q P A R D YA A Q A S P S P K A(−8 β+10); and 7) A L Q P A R D YA A Q A S P S P K A G A T T G R I V A V(−8 β+20). Purified cytochromebc1 complex (ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase) suitable for protein crystallization was prepared as reported previously (2Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Crystals of the cytochromebc1 complex were obtained using diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine as detergent (2Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The crystals were collected and washed with precipitating buffer containing no detergent and redissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane base titrated to the appropriate pH with hydrochloric acid), pH 8.0, containing 0.2% potassium deoxycholate. For ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity assay, an appropriate amount of the bc1 complex was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mmpotassium/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μmQ2H2. Activity was determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase in absorbance at 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer at 22 °C. A millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 was used to calculate activity. Nonenzymatic oxidation of Q2H2,determined under the same conditions in the absence of enzyme, was subtracted. For MPP activity assay, an appropriate amount of the cytochromebc1 complex was added to an assay mixture (20 μl) containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mmTriton X-100, and 40 μg substrate polypeptide and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation the mixture was centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant solution was applied to a C-8 HPLC column. The column was eluted with a linear gradient formed from 72 ml each of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The peptides were monitored at 214 or 280 nm. The MPP activity calculation is based on the amount of product peak produced. The product peptide is indicated by its dependence on the amount ofbc1 used in the assay system. A typical HPLC assay profile for MPP activity is shown in Fig.2. The product peaks were collected, dried, and subjected to partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis to determine the cleavage site of MPP. Crystalline cytochrome bc1 complex dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2% deoxycholate, exhibits full activity in catalyzing antimycin-sensitive electron transfer from Q2H2to cytochrome c but shows no MPP activity. This is different from the plant mitochondrial cytochrome bc1complex in which both MPP and electron transfer activities are observed. Based on the three-dimensional structural information for the beef bc1 complex (7Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), the lack of MPP activity may be because of the binding of an inhibitor peptide to the putative active site of MPP located at the interface of the core subunits during complex maturation. One way to confirm this suggestion is to activate MPP in the beef cytochrome bc1 complex by removal of the binding of inhibitor polypeptide or by weakening its binding with the core subunits in the complex. Weakening the binding between inhibitor polypeptide and the core subunits can be achieved by disrupting the structural integrity (or loosening the structure) of the complex with detergents or protein denaturing reagents, such as urea or guanidine HCl. Because electron transfer activity requires the structural integrity of the complex, the extent of activity lost indicates the extent ofbc1 structure disruption. Fig.3 shows Triton X-100 concentration-dependent inactivation of the electron transfer activity and activation of MPP of the cytochromebc1 complex. Electron transfer activity decreases, whereas MPP activity increases with increasing concentrations of Triton X-100. Maximum MPP activity is obtained when Triton X-100 concentration reaches 1.5 mm at which point more than 98% of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity is lost. The MPP activity remains unchanged even at a Triton X-100 concentration of 4.5 mm. These results confirm our suggestion that MPP activity in the beef cytochromebc1 complex is inhibited by the binding of a polypeptide to its active site in the core subunits. Disruption of the structural integrity of the bc1 complex by Triton X-100, as indicated by the loss of its electron transfer activity, is most likely because of modification of the hydrophobic interactions in the complex. Because the core proteins are hydrophilic, they are expected to be less sensitive to the Triton X-100 treatment. Apparently the conditions that weaken the binding between the inhibitor peptide and MPP do not affect the enzymatic activity of MPP. Other nonionic detergents, such as Zwittergent, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide and octyl glucoside, also activate MPP in the beef cytochrome bc1 complex. Ionic detergents, such as sodium cholate, deoxycholate, and sodium dodecylsulfate, and chaotropic reagents, such as urea and guanidine HCl, do not activate MPP even though they inactivate the electron transfer activity of the complex. The failure to detect MPP activity in complex treated with ionic detergents or chaotropic reagents may result from their inhibitory effect on MPP rather than from ineffective weakening of the binding of inhibitory polypeptide with core subunits. Fig. 4 shows time course of MPP product generation, inactivation of electron transfer activity, and activation of MPP. Cytochrome bc1 complex in 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 mmTriton X-100 was incubated at 37 °C. Under these conditions the half-life of bc1 complex is less than 1 h. The cleavage of substrate peptide by activated MPP is a slow reaction. Product peptide formation increases as the reaction time increases, but at a decreasing rate, and reaches a maximum after 48 h. When MPP activity was determined after various lengths of incubation (activation) time, the maximal activity was observed with 2 h of activation. Prolonged incubation of the cytochromebc1 complex under activation conditions causes only a slight decrease in MPP activity. More than 75% of MPP activity remains after 40 h of incubation. Because in the routine assays a reaction time of 12–24 h was used, prior activation of MPP is not necessary. MPP is buffer system- and ionic strength-dependent. Its activity is higher in Tris-HCl buffer than in phosphate buffer, at pH 8.0. Maximal activity is observed at Tris-HCl buffer concentrations between 15 and 50 mm and gradually decreases at higher Tris-HCl concentrations. In 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer the activity is not affected by addition of KCl up to 100 mm, but decreases at higher salt concentrations. In phosphate buffer, maximal MPP activity is only about 80% of that observed in Tris-HCl buffer. The MPP activity decreases as the concentrations of phosphate buffer increase beyond 15 mm. The requirement of low ionic strength for maximal activity suggests involvement of ionic interaction during catalysis. This is consistent with the observation that MPP activity in spinach leaf bc1 complex is completely inhibited at 1.2 m KCl (30Eriksson A.C. Sjoling S. Glaser E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 283-290Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but not with the observation that MPP in potato bc1 complex is most active at high salt concentrations (17Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Emmermann M. Schmitz U.K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The optimal pH for MPP is between pH 6.5 and 8.5. At pH values higher than 8.5 a drastic decrease in activity is observed. At pH values below 6.5 the decrease observed is less drastic. The sharp decrease at pH values above 8.5 suggests involvement of an amino acid residue with a pKa between 8.5 and 9.0 in the catalytic or substrate binding site. This is consistent with the report of involvement of a histidine residue in the active site of MPP (25Striebel H.-M. Rysavy P. Adamea J. Spizek J. Kalouek F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 235: 211-218Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but inconsistent with the observation that MPP from plantbc1 complex is fully active at pH 9.0 (30Eriksson A.C. Sjoling S. Glaser E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 283-290Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Emmermann M.

As expected the MPP activity is temperature-dependent with a maximum at 37 °C. At 42 °C a drastic decrease is observed, indicating that activated MPP is unstable and becomes partially denatured. In contrast, MPP in the plant bc1complex is active at 50 °C (31Emmermann M. Schmitz U.K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Table I summarizes the effect of commonly used electron transfer inhibitors of thebc1 complex and of proteinase inhibitors on activated MPP. Myxothiazol, a Qo site inhibitor, at 1 mm, inhibits 58% of activated MPP in beefbc1 complex. Antimycin A, a Qi site inhibitor, and hemin, which have been reported to inhibit MPP activity in the plant mitochondrial bc1 complex, show no effect on activated MPP even at a concentration of 1 mm. Activated MPP is not sensitive to the commonly used proteinase inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N-ethylmaleimide, and pepstatin. Ferricyanide and dithiothreitol inhibit 28 and 81%, respectively.Table IEffect of electron transfer and proteinase inhibitors on the activated MPP activityCompoundsConcentration usedActivity remainingaSubstrate peptide was VPASVRYSHTDIK.%None100Myxothiazol142Antimycin1100Ferricyanide172Dithiothreitol519Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride1100Hemin1100Pepstatin1100N-Ethylmaleimide10100a Substrate peptide was VPASVRYSHTDIK. Open table in a new tab Activated MPP is inhibited by metal ion chelators such as EDTA oro-phenanthroline (Fig. 5). Activity decreases as chelator concentration increases. Complete inactivation is observed with o-phenanthroline at 0.5 mm or EDTA at 1.75 mm. A linear concentration-dependent inhibition is observed witho-phenanthroline; inhibition is 60% at 100 μm. The EDTA-inhibited MPP activity can be partially restored by addition of divalent cations, such as Fe2+ (92%), Zn2+(68%), Co2+ (62%), Mn2+ (54%), and Mg2+ (44%) (see Fig. 6), indicating that metal ion is required for activity. This is in line with the report that metal ion is required for MPP activity in the plant mitochondrial bc1 complex and in isolated MPP (19Glaser E. Eriksson A.C. Sjoling S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Ou W. Ito A. Okazaki H. Omura T. EMBO J. 1988; 8: 2605-2612Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several subunits of the beef cytochrome bc1 complex are nuclear gene-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol with presequences. Probably the function of MPP of core subunits I and II is removal of presequences from these subunits during maturation of the complex. Therefore, we synthesized polypeptides composed of various lengths of COOH-terminal presequences and NH2-terminal sequences of mature subunits to determine the substrate specificity of activated MPP. Table II summarizes the cleavage sites in the seven synthetic peptides tested.Table IISubstrate specificity of activated MPPPeptide 1:−7V+6V P A S V R Y S H T D I K↑⬆Peptide 2:−5V+20A S V R Y S H T D I K V P D F S D Y R R P E V L D⬆Peptide 3:−17V+10R P L V A S V S L N V P A S V R Y S H T D I K V P D F⬆Peptide 4:−10IV+10A V A L H S A V S AS D L E L H P P S Y⬆Peptide 5:−10IV+20A V A L H S A V S AS D L E L H P P S Y P W S H R G L L S S↑ ⬆Peptide 6:−8β+10A L Q P A R D YA A Q A S P S P K APeptide 7:−8β+20A L Q P A R D Y A A Q A S P S P K A G A T T G R I V A V⬆Twenty μl of the cytochrome bc1 complex (40 μg) in 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 mm Triton X-100 and 40 μg of the indicated synthetic substrate peptides were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Product peptides were separated on HPLC using a C-8 column and quantitated by peptide sequencing. Bold and thin arrows indicate the specific and nonspecific cleavage sites, respectively. Open table in a new tab Twenty μl of the cytochrome bc1 complex (40 μg) in 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 mm Triton X-100 and 40 μg of the indicated synthetic substrate peptides were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Product peptides were separated on HPLC using a C-8 column and quantitated by peptide sequencing. Bold and thin arrows indicate the specific and nonspecific cleavage sites, respectively. When a synthetic peptide composed of seven amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of the presequence and six from the NH2terminus of mature subunit V (the iron-sulfur protein) (−7V+6) is used as substrate for activated MPP, two product peptides are obtained: one with the NH2-terminal amino acid corresponding to that of mature subunit V and the other with the NH2-terminal amino acid one residue upstream from the NH2 terminus of mature subunit V. When−7V+6 substrate peptide is elongated by increasing the number of residues from the NH2terminus of mature subunit V to 20 (Table II), only one product peptide with the NH2 terminus corresponding to that of mature subunit V is obtained, indicating that activated MPP cleaves this peptide at a specific site. However, when the−7V+6 substrate peptide is elongated by increasing the number of residues from the COOH terminus of presequence to 17, a product peptide with the NH2-terminal amino acid three residues downstream from the NH2 terminus of mature subunit V is obtained, indicating that MPP cleaves this peptide at a different specific site. These results clearly indicate that length of the amino acid sequence from the NH2 terminus of mature protein determines the cleavage site specificity of activated MPP. It has been reported that the presequence of subunit V is processed in a single step and retained as subunit IX in the mature complex (34Brandt U. Yu L. Yu C.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8387-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first instance in which a cleaved targeting presequence has been shown to be retained in the cell. Because subunit IX is absent from the plant mitochondrial cytochrome bc1complex, it is possible that subunit IX, once it is clipped off from the iron-sulfur protein precursor by MPP of core subunits, binds to the active site of MPP to inhibit it prior to complex maturation. Final proof for this possibility must await definitive assignment of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide binding to the interface of core subunits. To further confirm that peptide length from the NH2terminus of mature protein is a determining factor for site-specificity of activated MPP, four peptides containing different lengths of presequence and mature protein of subunit IV (cytochromec1) and the β subunit of F1 ATPase were synthesized and used as substrates for activated MPP (see TableII). When a peptide containing 10 residues from the COOH-terminal end of presequence and 10 residues from the NH2 terminus of mature subunit IV (−10IV+10) is used, the MPP cleavage site is at 7 amino acid residues downstream from the NH2 terminus of mature subunit IV. When the length of the amino acid sequence from the NH2-terminal end of mature subunit IV is elongated to 20 residues (10IV+20), two product peptides are obtained: one with the correct partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of mature subunit IV and the other with the NH2terminus two residues upstream (Table II). These results suggest that MPP specificity increases with the length of the mature protein sequence. The recombinant β-subunit (with its presequence) of F1ATPase is the most commonly used substrate for assaying MPP activity. When a synthetic peptide containing 10 amino acid residues from the NH2-terminal end of mature β subunit of F1ATPase and 8 amino acid residues from its presequence (−8β+10) is used as substrate for MPP, no product peptide is obtained. However, when the NH2-terminal end of mature β subunit is increased to 20 residues (−8β+20), one product peptide with the correct NH2 terminus of mature β subunit is obtained (Table II). This further suggests that the amino acid sequence of the mature protein is a determining factor for cleavage site specificity of MPP. Although there is little doubt about the association between MPP activity and core proteins I and II of crystallinebc1 complex, the low turnover number of the activated processing activity merits some discussion. The activated MPP activity of the cytochrome bc1 complex is about one-hundredth that of rat liver mitochondrial intermediate peptidase estimated from the assay conditions reported (35Kalousek F. Isaya G. Rosenberg L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The low activity may be due partly to the incomplete removal of the inhibitor peptide, competition between substrate peptide and inhibitor peptide for the active site, and the association of core proteins with other subunits, except subunit VIII (36Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; (U. S. A. in press)Google Scholar). It is likely that before core proteins I and II are assembled into the mature cytochrome bc1complex, they may be present as soluble peptidases in the matrix. In this form, they may have better activity toward the precursors of the imported proteins than the activated MPP does toward the substrate peptides used. Thus MPP may play an essential role in the processing of imported proteins despite the observed low activity. Alternatively, the activated MPP of the cytochrome bc1 complex may represent an enzymatic activity which was located withinbc1 complexes from all organisms during establishment of endosymbiosis between mitochondria and eukaryotic cells. According to this hypothesis the core proteins are relics of an ancient processing peptidase (27Braun H-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Roger Koeppe for the critical review of this manuscript."

Notably, mutations in the human CRALBP gene can result in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J. Mukkadan J.K. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In vitro CRALBP serves as a substrate carrier protein for enzymes of the mammalian visual cycle, modulating whether 11-cis-retinol (11-cis-Rol) is stored as an ester in the RPE or oxidized by 11-cis-Rol dehydrogenase to 11-cis-retinal (11-cis-Ral) for visual pigment regeneration (2Saari J.C. Sporn M.A. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). In the RPE and Müller cells of the retina, CRALBP carries endogenous 11-cis-retinoids, the isomers of vitamin A utilized for phototransduction. However, CRALBP is not always associated with a retinoid ligand and more than one physiological role for the protein appears likely (3Saari J.L. Huang J. Possin D.E. Fariss R.N. Leonard J. Garwin G.G. Crabb J.W. Milam A.H. Glia. 1997; 21: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The protein is also present in ciliary body, cornea, pineal gland, optic nerve, brain, transiently in iris, but not in the rod and cone photoreceptors. CRALBP is expressed in developing retina and RPE before the tissues contain 11-cis-retinoids or the enzyme responsible for generating 11-cis-retinoids (3Saari J.L. Huang J. Possin D.E. Fariss R.N. Leonard J. Garwin G.G. Crabb J.W. Milam A.H. Glia. 1997; 21: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apparently the protein serves functions unrelated to visual pigment regeneration in brain and tissues not involved in the visual cycle and may bind ligands other than retinoids. cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein cellular retinol-binding protein electrospray mass spectrometry liquid chromatography ESMS phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein retinaldehyde serum retinol-binding protein recombinant CRALBP retinol retinal pigmented epithelium high performance liquid chromatography reverse phase-HPLC polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction nickel-nitriloacetic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein cellular retinol-binding protein electrospray mass spectrometry liquid chromatography ESMS phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein retinaldehyde serum retinol-binding protein recombinant CRALBP retinol retinal pigmented epithelium high performance liquid chromatography reverse phase-HPLC polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction nickel-nitriloacetic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. CRALBP was first detected in retina about 20 years ago and shown to carry 11-cis-Rol and 11-cis-Ral as endogenous ligands (4Futterman S. Saari J.C. Blair S. J. Biol.

Visual Sci. 1998; 39 (Abstr. 170): 539Google Scholar) have been determined and are ∼87% identical in protein sequence. Investigation of cis-elements and transcription factors required for tissue specific expression of CRALBP are in progress (16Kennedy B.N. Goldflam S. Chang M.A. Campochiaro P. Davis A.A. Zack D.J.

As part of ongoing efforts to better understand the normal functions of CRALBP, we are characterizing CRALBP-ligand interactions and the retinoid binding pocket. Recent studies have localized the retinoid-binding domain to the C-terminal region (17Chen Y. Johnson C. West K. Goldflam S. Bean M.F. Huddleston M.J. Carr S.A. Gabriel J.L. Crabb J.W. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry V. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 371-378Google Scholar) and characterized ligand interactions by NMR (18Luck L.A. Barrows S.A. Venters R.A. Kapron J. Roth K.A. Paradis S.A. Crabb J.W. Marshak D. Techniques In Protein Chemistry VIII. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 439-448Google Scholar) and circular dichroism (11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The report linking CRALBP mutations with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa also demonstrated that rCRALBP mutant R150Q lacks retinoid binding function (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J. Mukkadan J.K. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that 11-cis-Ral does not appear to be covalently attached to CRALBP. We further show by chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, and retinoid binding analyses that Gln-210 and Lys-221 are likely components of the CRALBP retinoid binding pocket. Native bovine CRALBP was purified from frozen bovine dark-adapted retinas (J. Lawson, Lincoln, NE) according to Saari and Bredberg (19Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human recombinant CRALBP (rCRALBP) was produced inEscherichia coli as described elsewhere (10Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Redfern C. Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol 89, Retinoid Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 91-104Google Scholar, 11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 11-cis-Ral was obtained from the National Eye Institute, NIH through R. Crouch and 9-cis-Ral was purchased from Sigma. To explore the possibility that 11-cis-Ral was covalently attached to CRALBP by a Schiff base linkage, CRALBP was labeled with [3H]11-cis-Ral as described previously (9Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and mixed in the dark (7.5 μm final concentration of CRALBP) at room temperature with either 50 mm NaBH4 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, or 300 mm borane dimethylamine in 5 mm MOPS, 30 mm sodium acetate, 4 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.0. Various denaturants were then added in the dark to give the following final conditions: pH 4, pH 10, 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 8 m urea, and 50% ethanol. After 20 min of further incubation at room temperature, an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol was added followed by 3 volumes of hexane. The upper phase was removed, and the extraction with hexane repeated. Radioactivity was determined in the combined upper phases by liquid scintillation counting. Extraction of the retinoid from the protein in the absence of reducing and denaturing agents served as the control. For some experiments, the hexane extract was dried in a stream of flowing argon, dissolved in 68% aqueous acetonitrile, and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (5Saari J.C. Bredberg L. Garwin G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13329-13333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a second approach exploring the possibility of a Schiff base linkage, a solution of CRALBP complexed with 11-cis-Ral was prepared in 10 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7 and a UV-visible absorption spectrum obtained. SDS and HCl were added to the solution under red illumination to give final concentrations of 1% and pH 4, respectively. A second spectrum was then obtained and a difference spectrum generated. Reductive methylation of native bovine CRALBP with bound 11-cis-Ral was performed essentially according to Longstaff and Rando (20Longstaff C. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 25: 6311-6319Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The CRALBP retinoid complex was incubated overnight in the dark with 2 mmformaldehyde and 20 mm pyridine/borane, 10 mmPIPES at pH 6.5. After 24 h, fresh formaldehyde and pyridine/borane were added. Spectral analysis after 48 h of methylation demonstrated no change in the 425- and 280-nm absorbance, indicating the protein-retinoid complex was still intact. The protein was then denatured in the light by dialysis against 6 mguanidine HCl, 0.1 m borate, pH 9, and acetylated with 4 mm [3H]acetic anhydride for 30 min at room temperature followed by exhaustive dialysis to remove background [3H] (21Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To identify acetylation sites, the modified CRALBP (20 μg) was digested with subtilisin in 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.5, 2 m urea at 37 °C for 2.5 h with 4% protease (w/w), peptides purified by RP-HPLC and radioactive chromatography fractions characterized by Edman degradation and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS). To measure the amount of acetylation, the modified protein was quantified by amino acid analysis and radioactive incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Total acetylation was found to be about 2.9 mol of [3H]acetate/mol of CRALBP based upon the specific activity of [3H]acetic anhydride (∼35 dpm/pmol). Radioactive peptide recovery following RP-HPLC was estimated by phenylthiohydantoin-derivative yield from Edman analysis of chromatography fractions. Four human rCRALBP mutants carrying a single substitution (K152A, I162V, K221A, and K294A) were prepared by co-annealing a mutagenic primer and a selection primer to remove the ScaI restriction site from the wild type rCRALBP pET19b vector essentially as described by Deng and Nicholoff (22Deng W.P. Nicholoff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and in the Altered-Sites Mutagenesis kit (Promega). The ScaI selection primer was 5′-AATGACTTGGTTGAGTATTCACCAGTCACAGAA-3′. The K152A mutagenic primer was 5′-CTCTCAGTCGGGACGCGTATGGCCGAGTGGTC-3′. The I162V mutagenic primer was 5′-GTCATGCTCTTCAACGTTGAGAACTGGCAAAGT-3′. The K221A mutagenic primer was 5′-ACTTCAGATCTCAGGGCGATGGTGGACATGCTC-3′. The K294A mutagenic primer was 5′-GGGGGCACGCTGCCCGCGTATGATGGCAAGGCC-3′. rCRALBP mutant Q210R was generated by sequential steps of PCR according to Ausubel et al. (23Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar) using the following primers: forward, 5′-CGTCGCGCTCCAGCGAAAGCGGTCCTCGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGTCACC-3′; 5′-mutagenic, 5′-ACCATGCAGCGGGCTGCTAGTCTCCGG-3′; 3′-mutagenic, 5′-ACTAGCAGCCCGCTGCATGGTAAAGCC-3′. Two partial cDNA fragments with overlapping sequences were generated in the first PCR step using the wild type rCRALBP pET3a vector as template with primer combinations forward and 3′-mutagenic or reverse and 5′-mutagenic. The two fragments were purified, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (Promega), and combined to generate the full-length mutant cDNA using primer combination forward and reverse in the second PCR step. PCR was performed for 25 cycles on a model 480 Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler using the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The final PCR product containing the Q210R substitution was subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and amplified in E. coli strain DH5α. For expression, the insert was excised, subcloned into the pET19b vector (Novagen), and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)LysS. Primers were synthesized on a model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer and the structures of all mutants verified by automated DNA sequence analysis using a model 373 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division instrumentation) (1Maw M.A. Kennedy B. Knight A. Bridges R. Roth K.E. Mani E.J. Mukkadan J.K. Nancarrow D. Crabb J.W. Denton M.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Details for producing and purifying milligram amounts of holo-rCRALBP have been described elsewhere (10Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Redfern C. Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol 89, Retinoid Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1998: 91-104Google Scholar, 11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The following procedure was used for purifying microgram amounts of either holo- or apo-rCRALBP. Ni-NTA silica spin columns (Qiagen) were washed and equilibrated with spin column buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm sodium chloride) and used for purification of rCRALBP essentially according to the manufacturer. Bacterial cell pellets (0.3 g) containing rCRALBP were suspended in 1 ml of spin column buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the clarified soluble lysate fraction was transferred to another tube. The clarified lysate (600 μl) was applied directly to a Ni-NTA spin column and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4 min at room temperature. The column was sequentially washed by centrifugation with 600-μl aliquots of (i) the spin column buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, (ii) the buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (2×), (iii) the buffer containing 90 mm imidazole (2×), and (iv) finally eluted twice with 85 μl of the buffer containing 250 mmimidazole. Apoprotein was purified under ambient room light conditions; holoprotein was purified under dark room conditions with dim red illumination to prevent photoisomerization of the retinoid. Buffer and protein preparations were kept on ice during the purification procedure except during centrifugation steps. Approximately 150 μg of rCRALBP was typically recovered by spin column purification. For purification of holoprotein, either 11-cis-Ral or 9-cis-Ral (∼72 nmol or ∼1.2-fold molar excess over rCRALBP) was incubated with the clarified bacterial lysate for 15 min at 4 °C in the dark prior to spin column purification. For retinoid labeling of purified apo-rCRALBP, either 11-cis-Ral or 9-cis-Ral (1.2-fold molar excess over CRALBP) was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with the protein in the Ni-NTA spin column buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Excess retinoid was removed from apoprotein preparations prior to UV-visible absorbance measurements by molecular sieve chromatography using Sephadex G-15. Retinoids were added from a concentrated solution (1–2 mg/ml) in ethanol (11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bleaching of rCRALBP samples and retinoid binding measurements by scanning UV-visible spectrophotometry (with either a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer or a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer) were as described previously (11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ratio of the extinction coefficients for 11-cis-Ral-labeled rCRALBP (ε280/ε425 = 3.2) and for 9-cis-Ral-labeled rCRALBP (ε280/ε400 = 2.2) approximate the spectral ratio values for rCRALBP fully saturated with these retinoids (11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Observed absorbance spectral ratios (A280/A425 andA280/A400) were used to estimate rCRALBP retinoid binding stoichiometries. Fluorescence spectroscopy was also used to evaluate apo wild type and apo mutant rCRALBP interactions with retinoid by monitoring the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon ligand binding. The amount of quenching is a function of the location and orientation of the ligand relative to the tryptophan residues. The protein was excited at 280 nm, and tryptophan fluorescence emission monitored at 340 nm (using a SPEX industries fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer). Titrations with 11-cis- and 9-cis-Ral were carried out by monitoring the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the apoprotein (0.5 μm rCRALBP) and analyzed by fitting the data to an equation derived from simple binding theory as described elsewhere (24Chen Y. Houghton L.A. Brenna J.T. Noy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20507-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 420H/130/920 automated analysis system (25Crabb J.W. West K.A. Dodson W.S. Hulmes J.D. Coligan J.E. Ploegh H.L. Smith J.A. Speicher D.W. Current Protocols In Protein Science, Unit 11.9 (Supplement 7). John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.9.1-11.9.42Google Scholar), and Edman degradation was performed using an Applied Biosystems gas phase protein sequencer model 470/120/900 (12Crabb J.W. Johnson C.M. Carr S.A. Armes L.G. Saari J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18678-18687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify [3H]acetyl-lysine, sequencer fractions from each Edman cycle were analyzed for tritium by liquid scintillation counting. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on 12% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli using a Mini-Protein II slab gel system (Bio-Rad). Apo-rCRALBP was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) calibrated with rCRALBP previously quantified by amino acid analysis. ESMS and liquid chromatography ESMS (LC-ESMS) were performed with a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Concord, Ontario, Canada) fitted with an articulated ion spray plenum and an atmospheric pressure ionization source (27Kapron J.T. Hilliard G. Lakins J. Tenniswood M. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Initial tuning and calibration was with a standard mixture of polypropylene glycol from Perkin-Elmer Sciex. Resolution was adjusted to about 50% valley between adjacent isotope peaks in a singly charged cluster, allowing singly charged ions to be identified by apparent spacing between peaks and doubly charged ions to be distinguished from those with higher charge states. Nitrogen was used as the nebulization gas (at 40 p.s.i.) and curtain gas and was supplied from a Dewar (XL-45, Taylor Wharton) of liquid nitrogen (Merriam-Graves, Claremont, NH). LC-ESMS were acquired in positive ion mode at an orifice potential of 50 V. For LC-ESMS of intact proteins a scan range of m/z 800–1750 was used with 0.1 atomic mass unit steps and a scan time of 7.5 s; for analysis of peptides a scan range of m/z250–2200 was used with 0.25 atomic mass unit steps and a scan time of 6 s. Synthetic peptides of known mass were used to verify correct calibration. RP-HPLC for LC-ESMS was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min on a Perkin-Elmer C18 capillary column (0.5 × 150 mm) using an Applied Biosystems model 140D HPLC system and aqueous acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid solvents. To verify the structures of the mutant rCRALBPs (11Crabb J.W. Carlson A. Chen Y. Goldflam S. Intres R. West K.A. Hulmes J.D. Kapron J.T. Luck L.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), purified mutant rCRALBP (40 μg) were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide in the presence of 8 m urea, 400 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. The carboxyamidomethylated proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega) in 1 m urea, 50 mmammonium bicarbonate (2.5% trypsin by weight, overnight at 37 °C) and the tryptic digest (∼4 μg) analyzed by LC-ESMS. A portion (50%) of the mutant I162V tryptic digest was further fragmented with endoproteinase Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim) (2% protease by weight, 6 h at 37 °C) under the same conditions and analyzed by LC-ESMS. Following subtilisin digestion of modified bovine CRALBP, portions of select chromatography fractions containing [3H]acetyl-lysine were dried, resuspended in 0.2–5% formic acid, 50% methanol and analyzed by infusion at 5 μl/min to confirm the presence of modified amino acids. Attempts to trap a putative Schiff base were based on previous studies (8Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 716: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Stubbs G.W.

Reducing agents (NaBH4, borane dimethylamine) were added in the dark to a solution of [3H]11-cis-Ral bound to CRALBP and then protein denaturants were added in the dark. Following a 20-min incubation period, retinoids were extracted into hexane and radioactivity determined. The results of these experiment are shown in Fig. 1. Nearly quantitative amounts of retinoid were extracted from CRALBP regardless of the denaturant or reducing agent (Fig. 1). HPLC analysis of the extracted retinoid from several of the treatments at neutral pH showed that [3H]11-cis-Rol was the only retinoid present (not shown). Treatments at low pH resulted in considerable destruction of the retinoid, but again 11-cis-Rol was the major product detected. If the CRALBP was bleached with white light in the presence of the reducing agents, the product of the reaction was all-trans-Rol, as reported previously (5Saari J.C. Bredberg L. Garwin G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13329-13333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another approach to identify a Schiff base, the absorption spectrum of CRALBP complexed with 11-cis-Ral was obtained for"

Using a purified CREB fusion protein, a novel dye-label technique, and sedimentation equilibrium analysis, we directly and conclusively demonstrate that, unlike Jun and Fos, CREB dimerization is DNA-dependent. CREB exists primarily as a monomer in solution and cooperatively assembles on DNA to form dimers. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis also indicates that dimerization is unaffected by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylation or by the symmetry of the cAMP-responsive element binding site. Filter binding assays reveal that CREB binding is unaffected by phosphorylation regardless of the symmetry of the cAMP-responsive element binding site. Our results suggest that structurally similar members of the same bZIP superfamily may differ significantly in their regulation at the level of dimerization.

Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 9Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R.

Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Like most members of the bZIP superfamily, CREB has a modular structure consisting of distinct and separable DNA binding, dimerization, and transactivation regions (12Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 101-168PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase-inducible domain, which harbors a cluster of consensus phosphorylation sites for various protein kinases, lies within the two glutamine-rich transactivation domains (Q1 and Q2) toward the amino terminus of CREB (12Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 101-168PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gonzalez G.A. Menzel P. Leonard J. Fischer W.H. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The DNA binding (basic) and dimerization (leucine zipper) domains are adjacent to each other and occupy the carboxyl terminus of the protein (12Hurst H.C.

While many protein kinases are able to modify CREB within its kinase-inducible subdomain, the effects of phosphorylation are not thoroughly understood. Most information on the effects of CREB phosphorylation has been obtained using cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which modifies a single serine site at position 133 (8Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 9Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser133 is known to increase the association of a 265-kDa nuclear protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and the homologous P300 (14Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachlinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 15Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKA does not appear to alter the global conformation of CREB (16Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Rather, recent structural studies support a model by which phosphorylation promotes direct electrostatic interaction between CREB and CBP/P300 (17Parker D. Ferreri K. Nakajima T. LaMorte V.J. Evans R. Koerber S.C. Hoeger C. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 18Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The binding of CBP cannot, however, account for all of the effects of CREB phosphorylation. For instance, CREB can also be modified by calmodulin kinase II at positions 133 and 142 (10Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). However, a CREB mutant that mimics the calmodulin kinase II-phosphorylated protein is unable to support transcriptional induction under these conditions although CBP is still able to associate with CREB (19Sun P. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7041-7044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at positions 133 and 142 may have effects other than abrogation of CBP binding. It is possible that CREB phosphorylation influences properties of CREB such as binding affinity or dimerization. It is generally accepted that bZIP proteins form dimers on DNA based on many in vitro and in vivo studies of yeast GCN4 and mammalian CREB/ATF and Jun/Fos families of transcription factors (20Spiro C.

Nature. 1988; 336: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether CREB is always self-associated as a dimer or whether the dimerization is always necessary for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. For example, the CREB monomer has been reported to be the “active” form (26Krajewski W. Lee K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7204-7210Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The DNA binding affinity of some ATF family members is known to increase via dimerization upon association with the human T-cell leukemia virus transactivator TAX protein, suggesting that CREB may not always exist as a dimer in solution (27Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). There has also been considerable disagreement as to whether phosphorylation of CREB influences its binding affinity or dimerization. In vitro, no differences in DNA binding of purified CREB have been observed upon PKA phosphorylation in gel shift assays (29Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs III, W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of cAMP, the DNA binding activity of CREB is known to increase, particularly at nonsymmetric CREs (31Boshart M. Weih F. Nichols M. Schutz G. Cell. 1991; 66: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Previously, the dimerization state of CREB has been inferred from use of truncated partners (33Yun Y. Dumoulin M. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and gel electrophoresis techniques (29Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs III, W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) in which the gel matrix has the potential to form or to disrupt DNA-protein complexes. However, solution kinetic and spectroscopic studies have suggested that CREB dimerization may be DNA-dependent (34Metallo S.J. Schepartz A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then binding isoforms that have assumed dimer binding to the CRE may be incorrect. If and under what conditions the full-length CREB transits between monomer and dimer remains uncertain. Further, how phosphorylation influences dimerization and binding by various kinases is largely unknown. To clarify the effects of phosphorylation on the dimerization potential of CREB, we have undertaken a systematic study of dimerization, binding, and transcriptional effects supported by CREB. In our studies, we employ exclusively solution techniques to avoid any potential artifacts produced by gel electrophoresis of CREB-DNA complexes. In this report, we focus on dimerization and binding properties of CREB before and after phosphorylation by PKA. The effects of PKA on the structure and function of CREB are well established, so there is no confusion concerning the site or extent of modification. In our experiments, we directly measure the dimerization state under solution conditions using sedimentation equilibrium analysis (35Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985: 110-136Google Scholar) including a novel dye-label technique and a purified CREB fusion protein. We demonstrate that, unlike Jun and Fos, CREB dimerization is completely DNA-dependent. CREB exists primarily as a monomer in solution and cooperatively assembles on DNA to form dimers. CREB binding as well as dimerization is unaffected by PKA-induced phosphorylation. Our results suggest a model in which structurally similar members of the same bZIP superfamily differ significantly in their regulation at the level of dimerization. The His6-CREB fusion protein was constructed by inserting the entire rat CREB-1 cDNA (9Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) together with a histidine tag into the pET22b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The histidine tag, comprising six consecutive histidines (His6), was located at the 5′ terminus of the coding region. BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) were transformed with the plasmid containing the fusion proteins, and expression of the protein was induced by treatment with 600 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by lysozyme followed by sonication in binding buffer (20 mmNa2HPO4-NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8). The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation and then directly applied to metal-chelated affinity resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) charged with Ni2+. The bound His6-CREB was eluted by a stepwise increase in imidazole from 50 to 500 mm. Purified His6-CREB, which eluted at 200 mm imidazole, was concentrated under N2 by an ultrafiltration apparatus (Amicon, Beverly, MA) with a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off filter. The concentrated protein was dialyzed with 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothrietol (DTT), pH 7.5. Phosphorylation of His6-CREB utilized the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega, Madison, WI). A ratio of 1 unit of enzyme/5 pmol of protein was employed in each phosphorylation reaction. Samples were incubated with PKA at 30 °C for 15 min in 20 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT after the addition of 1 mm ATP, 3 mmMg2+. The presence of phosphorylated CREB was verified by antibody detection using anti-phospho-CREB antibody (see below). The extent of phosphorylation was determined by gel mobility shift analysis using 32P-end-labeled 23-bp somatostatin CRE as a probe (see “Gel Mobility Shift Analysis”), the incorporation of [32P]ATP, and two-dimensional electrophoresis. For detecting His6-CREB and/or P-His6-CREB, samples (20 μl) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (16 cm × 16 cm × 1 mm) (SDS-PAGE) (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) at a constant current of 24 mA. After separation, the gel was transferred (in 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.04% SDS, 20% methanol) onto nitrocellulose membrane. The His6-CREB or P-His6-CREB could be detected by incubation with rabbit anti-CREB polyclonal antibody (CREB-1(240); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which detects both forms. P-His6-CREB could be distinguished from His6-CREB by detection with a rabbit anti-serum raised to the phosphorylated CREB (at Ser133) as described previously (20Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of purified His6-CREB was examined by a gel mobility shift assay as described previously (20Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,37Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide CRE probes included a 27-bp somatostatin CRE (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGA GCTAG-3′), a 26-bp Fos CRE (5′-TTCCGCTCATGACGTAGTAAGCCATT-3′), and a 23-bp dynorphin CRE1 (5′-GTACCTGGTACGTCACAGACATT-3′). Included as a negative control was a 26-bp AP-2 (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′) oligonucleotide. Roughly 6.4 μg of His6-CREB was incubated with 2.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA in gel shift buffer at room temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of 1 pmol of 32P-end-labeled probe. Complexes were analyzed by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Constant amounts of 32P-labeled 23-base pair duplex oligonucleotides or 23-mer strands containing the specific binding site (37Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentration of CREBs varied over 3–4 orders of magnitude. Each complex was gently filtered through nitrocellulose filters to obtain the fraction bound. Radioactivity retained on the filter was detected on a β-scanner (Ambis). Dissociation constants were calculated from the concentration of CREB protein that achieved half-maximal saturation for the specific site [CREBtotal]½ =KD + (½)[DNAtotal] (39Pappoulas O. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 12.8.1-12.8.9Google Scholar). African green monkey kidney cells CV-1 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids were introduced into cells by calcium phosphate precipitation followed by glycerol shock (38Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourm P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transient transfection studies utilized a CREB or His6-CREB expression vector, a somatostatin-CAT reporter plasmid, and a PKA expression vector that have been previously described (37Spiro C. Richards J.P. Chandrasekaran S. Brennan R.G. McMurray C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourm P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The CRE-containing somatostatin-CAT reporter was introduced into CV-1 cells with 5 μg of vector expressing native CREB, His6-CREB, or PKA catalytic subunit as indicated. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with interferometric optical system or on a Beckman Optima XL-A equipped with a UV-visible detection system (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Solutions of His6-CREB or P-His6-CREB ranged from 0.5 to 16.0 μm, and the reference used in all experiments was the dialysis buffer of the sample (see “Expression and Purification of His6-CREB”). Double sector cells (30-mm height with 12-mm pass length) were used in experiments. Generally, 200 μl of His6-CREB and P-His6-CREB were loaded into the sample sector, and 215 μl of dialysate was added into the reference sector of each cell. At room temperature, equilibrium was achieved at 24 h when the rotor speed was 12,000 rpm. The partial specific volume (νo) of His6-CREB was calculated to be 0.72 ml/g based on its amino acid sequence and the partial specific volume of each amino acid (νi) (40Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Utilizing the interferometric optical system, the interferogram was acquired on technical pan film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The distance (r) from the middle of each fringe to the axis of the centrifuge was determined by adding the distance from the middle of each fringe to the wire of the cell under the microcomparator and the distance from the axis to the wire of the cell (provided by the manufacturer). Utilizing the absorbance optical system, protein boundaries were monitored at 258 nm, the wavelength that gives maximal difference in absorbance between the sample and the reference. Molecular weights for one or two components were obtained from the best fit of the data using the nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routine (41Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vettering W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C. Cambridge University Press, New York1992: 656-706Google Scholar) according to the equation, A(r)=A(ra)eω2M(1−νo)(r2−ra2)/2RTEquation 1 where A is the absorbance, rais the distance from the meniscus to the axis of the rotor; r is the distance from each point on the boundary to the rotor axis; ω is the angular speed; νo is the partial specific volume of the component; and M is the molecular weight of the component, which is obtained from the fitting. Both optical systems yielded similar results. For DNA-protein complexes, His6-CREB and P-His6-CREB were incubated with 1.0–2.5 μmsomatostatin CRE (5′-GCCTCCTTGGCTGACGTCAGAGAGAG-3′) or dynorphin CRE3 (5′-GTGGCTGCTGCGTCAGAGCATGA-3′) that was end-labeled with fluorescein (42Schubert F. Ahlert K. Cech D. Rosenthal A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Complexes were formed after incubation of protein with DNA overnight at room temperature. All experiments were carried out at 20 °C and at speeds between 8,000 and 20,000 rpm until equilibrium was achieved. Equilibrium boundaries were detected by scanning the absorbance across the cell at 494 nm, the maximum absorbance wavelength for fluorescein. The use of a fluorescein tag on the DNA allows analysis of DNA-protein complexes without interference from free protein or DNA as long as the DNA is fully bound. Neither His6-CREB nor P-His6-CREB absorbs at 494 mm. Boundaries were analyzed as described above using relevant partial specific volumes. The νo value of the fluorescein-labeled CRE-containing oligonucleotides were calculated by inverting DNA effective density (ρ) in salt solution (43Meselson M. Stahl F.W. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1957; 43: 581-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since average DNA ρ is about 1.7 g/ml (44Sueoka N. Marmur J. Doty P. Nature. 1959; 183: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), νo of the DNA is 0.588 ml/g (νo = 1/ρ). The partial specific volumes of protein-DNA complexes were estimated by the equation, νo=νpfp+νnfnEquation 2 where νp and νn are partial specific volume of protein (p) and oligonucleotides (n) andfp and fn represent the weight fraction of CREB and oligonucleotides in the complex. The νo of the DNA-protein complex was 0.695 ml/g for a His6-CREB dimer and 0.679 ml/g for a His6-CREB monomer. For cooperativity studies, the molar ratio of protein to DNA ranged from 0 to 2.0. When subsaturating amounts of protein were used, fitting was performed assuming a two-component system. Between ratios of 0 and 0.8, one of the components was fixed to be the free DNA. Purified His6-CREB (6 ml) was applied to a 2.5 × 110-cm2 Sephacryl S-200 HR column that had been packed and equilibrated with Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5). The column was calibrated by blue dextran 2,000 and protein molecular mass standards between 13.7 and 232 kDa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Void volume (νo) of the column was 203 ml. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and collected as 4-ml aliquots. Fractions were concentrated 40-fold by a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) at 4 °C and were analyzed by antibody detection using a rabbit anti-CREB Ab as described under “Antibody Detection of His6-CREB and P-His6-CREB.” The His6-CREB-DNA complexes were formed by incubation of 1.1 nmol of His6-CREB or P-His6-CREB with 2.4 nmol of 27-bp somatostatin oligonucleotide at room temperature for 1 h. For limited proteolysis reaction, His6-CREB and P-His6-CREB or their DNA complexes were incubated with trypsin at a weight ratio of 100:1 (protein:trypsin). Since P-His6-CREB samples contained some PKA (which is also a substrate for trypsin), PKA was also added to the CREB samples. However, ATP was not included in these reactions to prevent phosphorylation. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and proteolytic fragments were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel. For amino acid sequencing, proteolytic products were transferred by electroblotting from SDS-PAGE separating gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in transfer buffer (190 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 15% methanol). After transfer, bands on the membrane were visualized by staining with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 solution (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, 40% methanol, 1% glacial acetic acid). Each proteolysis band was excised and sequenced by Edman degradation (pulsed liquid method) in a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 492 Precise Protein Sequencing System, Perkin-Elmer). The His6-CREB is purified almost to homogeneity in 200 mm imidazole elution from an Ni2+-charged affinity column (Fig. 1 A). Because the histidine tag adds 33 amino acids to native CREB-1, the purified fusion protein migrates more slowly on SDS-PAGE compared with native CREB (Fig. 1 B). That the protein band is His6-CREB is confirmed by antibody detection (Fig.1 B) and by its ability to specifically bind to CRE-containing oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 C). Further, the His6-CREB fusion protein was efficiently phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 1, D and E). In previous studies, we had found that the DNA-protein complex containing phospho-CREB migrates more slowly than CREB under gel shift conditions. After modification by PKA, we find that the entire His6-CREB-shifted band migrates more slowly relative to complexes of unmodified His6-CREB (Fig. 1 D). We confirmed that greater than 95% of the His6-CREB is modified by PKA phosphorylation using isolelectric focusing (data not shown) and incorporation of radiolabeled ATP. All of the modified CREB is detected by an antibody that recognizes only a Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB (20Spiro C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wu X. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27702-27710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and a regular anti-CREB-1 antibody (Fig.1 E). Taken together, these data suggest that our preparation of His6-CREB and P-His6-CREB represents a pure population of each form, suitable for physical studies. To ensure that His6-CREB functions normally, we tested its binding ability to CRE and non-CRE-containing oligonucleotides (Fig.1 C). The His6-CREB binds specifically to the oligonucleotides containing CRE sites but not to the non-CRE sites in gel shift assay (Fig. 1 C). Of most importance, the His6-CREB fusion protein functions normally in vivo (Fig. 2 A). Transient transfection of His6-CREB and with the somatostatin-CAT reporter plasmids reveals that His6-CREB is equal in efficiency to native CREB in supporting transcription of somatostatin (Fig. 2 A). Further, His6-CREB supports stimulated transcription after phosphorylation with equal efficiency to that of native CREB (Fig. 2 A). The CAT activity of expressed His6-CREB is indistinguishable from native CREB whether or not the CREB is phosphorylated by PKA. We conclude that histidine tag causes no unexpected alterations in form or function of CREB. Below we will refer to His6-CREB as CREB and to the phosphorylated form of His6-CREB as P-CREB. To quantify the effects of phosphorylation on the binding affinity of CREB in solution, we measured the dissociation constants of CREB and P-CREB by filter binding. We observed no change in the apparent KDamong the different templates containing both symmetric and asymmetric CREs (compare Som CRE and Dyn CRE-1; Fig.2 B). Binding is, however, CRE-dependent, since the dissociation constant is small for CRE-containing oligonucleotides (Som CRE and Dyn CRE-1; Fig. 2 B) and larger for non-CRE containing template (Enk AC; Fig.2 B) or for a point mutation (Dyn CRE-1.2; Fig.2 B) that abrogates CREB binding to dynorphin CRE-1 in gels (38Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourm P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For P-CREB, the binding constant is indistinguishable from CREB for any template examined (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that the apparent binding constant of CREB is not changed by PKA-dependent phosphorylation regardless of the symmetry of the CRE region. The apparent dissociation constants were calculated based upon an assumption that a preformed CREB dimer binds to the CRE in both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Many nonsolution studies using truncated or mutant molecules and gel shift analysis indicate that dimers of unphosphorylated CREB bind to a CRE (33Yun Y. Dumoulin M. Habener J.F. Mol.

We introduced site-directed mutations into two amino acids of the protein conserved among various ATP-binding proteins and examined functions of the mutated DnaA proteins, in vitro and in vivo. Both mutated DnaA proteins (Lys-178 → Ile or Asp-235 → Asn) lost the affinity for both ATP and ADP but did maintain binding activity for oriC. Specific activities in an oriC DNA replication system in vitro were less than one-tenth those of the wild-type protein. Assay of the generation of oriC sites sensitive to P1 nuclease, using the mutated DnaA proteins, revealed a defect in induction of the duplex opening at oriC. On the other hand, expression of each mutated DnaA protein in the temperature-sensitivednaA46 mutant did not complement the temperature sensitivity. We suggest that Lys-178 and Asp-235 of DnaA protein are essential for the activity needed to initiate oriC DNA replication in vitro and in vivo and that ATP binding to DnaA protein is required for DNA replication-related functions."
https://openalex.org/W2126605172,"Fatty acid cycling by chain shortening/elongation in the peroxisomes is an important source of fatty acids for membrane lipid synthesis. Its role in the homeostasis of nonessential fatty acids is poorly understood. We report here a study on the cycling of saturated fatty acids and the effects of troglitazone in HepG2 cells in culture using [U-13C]stearate or [U-13C]oleate and mass isotopomer analysis. HepG2 cells were grown in the presence of 0.7 mmol/liter [U-13C]stearate or [U-13C]oleate, and in the presence and absence of 50 μm troglitazone for 72 h. Fatty acids extracted from cell pellets after saponification were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Peroxisomal β-oxidation of uniformly 13C-labeled stearate (C18:0) and oleate (C18:1) resulted in chain shortening and produced uniformly labeled palmitate (C16:0) and palmitoleate (C16:1). In untreated cells, 16% of C16:0 was derived from C18:0 and 26% of C16:1 from C18:1 by chain shortening. Such contributions were significantly increased by troglitazone to 23.6 and 36.6%, respectively (p < 0.001). Desaturation of stearate contributed 67% of the oleate, while reduction of oleate contributed little to stearate (2%). The desaturation of C18:0 to C18:1 was not affected by troglitazone. Our results demonstrated a high degree of recycling of C18:0 and C18:1 to C16:0 and C16:1 through chain shortening and desaturation. Chain shortening was accompanied by chain elongation in the synthesis of other long chain fatty acids. Troglitazone specifically increased recycling by peroxisomal β-oxidation of C18 to C16 fatty acids, and the interconversion of long chain fatty acids was associated with reduced de novo lipogenesis.

The peroxisomes and the mitochondria are two separate fatty acid β-oxidation systems having distinct roles in fatty acids catabolism, energy production, and substrate cycling within the cell. The β-oxidation system of the peroxisomes, unlike that of the mitochondria, is not coupled to oxidative phosphorylation and is an important source of acetyl (2-carbon) units for the synthesis of long chain fatty acids by chain elongation (1Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Fatty acid cycling of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the peroxisomes has been shown to play an important role in the metabolism of essential fatty acids (2Sprecher H. Luthria D.L. Mohammed B.S. Baykousheva S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2471-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of fatty acid cycling by chain shortening/elongation of saturated fatty acids is not well known. Because of recycling of label and the lack of proper isotopic methods, the study of chain shortening/elongation of nonessential fatty acids has been difficult. Recently, we have developed stable isotope methods for the study of essential and nonessential fatty acid metabolism using uniformly labeled compounds and mass spectrometry (3Ajie H.O. Connor M.J. Lee W-N.P. Bassilian S. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E247-E252PubMed Google Scholar, 4Edmond J. Higa T.A. Korsak R.A. Bergner E.A. Lee W-N.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For example, chain shortening of [U-13C]stearate produces palmitate with a mass shift of 16 daltons due to 13C carbons, and the elongation of [U-13C]stearate produces arachidate (C20:0) and behenate (C22:0) with a characteristic mass shift of 18 daltons. Thus, chain shortening and elongation can be measured by the formation of these unique isotopomer species. We report here a study of chain shortening and elongation of stearate (C18:0) and the role of activation of peroxisome oxidation with troglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) 1The abbreviations used are: PPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γGCgas chromatographyMSmass spectrometryMEmolar enrichment. ligand, on stearate metabolism in HepG2 cells in culture using uniformly13C-labeled stearate and oleate and mass isotopomer analysis. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ gas chromatography mass spectrometry molar enrichment. Human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and it was grown in 75-ml flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium augmented with 10% fetal bovine serum (5Lee W-N.P. Byerley L.O. Bassilian S. Ajie H.O. Clark I. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the cells were ∼50% confluent (∼2.5 × 106 cells/flask), the medium was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the appropriate medium containing U-13C-fatty acids was added as described below to begin the experiment. The incubation lasted 72 h with changes of fresh medium daily. [U-13C]Stearic acid and [U-13C]oleic acid were obtained from Martek Biosciences (Columbia, MD) as their sodium salts. They were dissolved in warm water and added separately to the culture medium at a concentration of 0.7 mmol/liter. Troglitazone was obtained from Park Davis Pharmaceuticals (Ann Arbor, MI). It was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to the appropriate flasks to a final concentration of 50 μm. The same volume of Me2SO was added to the flasks that did not contain troglitazone. Each incubation condition was performed in triplicate, and each analysis was also run in triplicate. During the experiment, HepG2 cells doubled to approximately 0.5 to 1 × 107cells per plate, and remained 80–90% viable after harvest. Fatty acids were extracted according to the method described by Lowenstein et al. (6Lowenstein J.M. Brunengraber H. Wadke M. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 34: 279-287Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was saponified with 1 ml of 30% KOH:ethanol (v:v, 1:1) at 70 °C overnight. Neutral lipids were first removed with petroleum ether extraction. The solution containing the saponified fatty acids was then acidified, and palmitate and other fatty acids were recovered with another petroleum ether extraction. Fatty acids were methylated with 0.5 n HCl in methanol (Supelco, Bellfonte, PA) for GC/MS analysis (7Lee W-N.P. Bassilian S. Guo Z.K Schoeller D.A Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E372-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acids were analyzed as their methyl esters. Palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, and oleate were separated on HP5840A GC with a 3-foot SP2330 glass column using temperature programming. The GC conditions were as follows. Helium flow rate was 20 ml/min and the initial temperature was held at 180 °C for 1 min, and then the oven temperature was programmed to increase at 3 °C/min to a final temperature of 210 °C. Under these GC conditions, the retention times for palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, and oleate were 3.1, 3.7, 5.1, and 5.7 min, respectively. The temperature of the GC to mass spectrometer interface was maintained at 275 °C and the source temperature at 200 °C. Mass spectra were obtained on the HP5985 mass spectrometer using electron ionization at (−70 eV) and selected ion monitoring. Ion clusters monitored for the quantitation of isotopomers of palmitate were m/z 269–276 and 286–290 with m + 0 atm/z 270 and m + 16 at m/z 286. The corresponding clusters monitored for palmitoleate were m/z 236–240 and 251–255; stearate, m/z 298–302 (m + 0 at m/z298) and m/z 312–316 (m + 18 at m/z 316); and oleate, m/z 264–267 and 282–285. Normalized spectra of “unlabeled” 2A molecule is “unlabeled” when it is made up of atoms of natural isotopes, i.e. with 13C,2H, and 18O in their natural abundances. “Unlabeled” and “unenriched” are used interchangeably. and [U-13C]stearate and [U-13C]oleate are shown in Fig. 1. Arachidate (C20:0) and behenate (C22:0) were analyzed as their methyl ester using a HP5973 mass spectrometer/HP6890 GC. Fatty acids were separated on a Bpx70 column (25-m length, 220-μm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness from SGE Incorporated (Austin, TX). The oven temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature 160 °C for 1 min, then programmed at a rate of 5 °C/min to 230 °C. The split ratio was 15:1. Retention times for C20:0 and C22:0 were 6.18 and 8.09 min, respectively. Ion clusters monitored for methyl ester of C20:0 werem/z 325–330 and 342–347; and m/z 352–358 and 370–377 for C22:0. Electron ionization spectra of “unlabeled” C20:0 and C22:0 methyl esters showed base peaks (molecular ions) atm/z 326 and 354. The corresponding m + 18 peaks were found at clusters around m/z 344 and 372. Mass spectra were acquired in the traditional “normalized” 3The common practice is to normalize the intensities of all peaks to the base peak or the peak with the most intensity, which is set to 100%. format. For the purpose of determining enrichment and fractional uptake and conversion, the mass spectra were expressed as molar fractions,i.e. the fraction of molecules with a particular mass. This is achieved by dividing the intensity of each peak by the sum of intensities of all relevant peaks of that compound. The expression of spectral data as molar fraction allows the determination of average mass (or average molecular weight) by the sum of the products of molar fraction and mass over the relevant mass range (8Blom K.F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 966-971Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 4For example, the fraction of molecules of natural stearate with mass of 298 and 299 are 0.824 and 0.176. The average mass is given by the sum of the products 298 × 0.824 and 299 × 0.176, or 245.47 + 52.71 = 298.18. Since there are 18 carbons in stearate, the enrichment in 13C is (298.18 − 298)/18 or 1%, which is the natural abundance observed. Since the chance of [13C]acetyl-CoA condensing to form uniformly labeled fatty acids is almost zero, the sum of individual fractions of ions in the clusters corresponding to the uniformly labeled fatty acids gives the fraction of molecules converted by chain elongation or shortening. 5For example, the fractions of palmitate from HepG2 cells incubated with [U-13C]stearate having mass of 285, 286, and 287 (corresponding to m + 15, m + 16, and m + 17) are as follows: 0.094, 0.141, and 0.003. Thus the fraction of palmitate from chain shortening is 0.094 + 0.141 + 0.003 = 0.238 or 23.8%. Spectral data can further be processed to provide information on the distribution of labeled mass isotopomer (mi) and molar enrichment (ME) using the method of Lee et al. (9Lee W-N.P. Edmond J. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1990; 20: 451-458Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar) that corrects for the contribution of derivatizing agent and13C natural abundance to the mass isotopomer distribution of the compound of interest. The resultant mass isotopomer distribution represents the fraction of molecules containing 0, 1, 2, 3, …13C substitutions and is expressed as a fraction of the total number of molecules. The observed number of 13C atoms incorporated per molecule is the ME. ME is the stable isotope counterpart of specific activity of radioisotopes and is expressed in units of atoms of isotope per molecule. It is calculated from the mass isotopomer distribution (mi) by the formula Σ mi × ni (10Lee W-N.P. Guo Z.K. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), where ni is the number of isotope substitutions of the isotopomer species. Data reduction and regression analyses were performed using the computer software Excel® (version 5.0). Finally, the enrichment of the acetyl-CoA pool from β-oxidation of uniformly labeled fatty acids can be determined from the distribution of mass isotopomers of palmitate. De novosynthesis of palmitate produces palmitate with 2, 4, or 613C atoms (m2, m4, and m6). The distribution of these mass isotopomers has previously been shown to conform to that of a binomial distribution (10Lee W-N.P. Guo Z.K. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the acetyl-CoA enrichment can be obtained from the consecutive mass isotopomer ratio m4/m2according to the formula: m4/m2 = (n − 1)/2 p/q or 3.5 p/q, wheren is 8, the number of acetyl units in palmitate,p is the enrichment of [1,2-13C]acetyl-CoA, and q the unenriched acetyl-CoA. Once the precursor enrichment is determined, fractional synthesis can be calculated by dividing the observed to the predicted mass isotopomer (m2) fraction (10Lee W-N.P. Guo Z.K. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 21: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spectra of uniformly labeled and “unlabeled” stearate and oleate are shown in Fig.1. The molecular ion for saturated fatty acid is the methyl ester itself. The distribution of m + 1, m + 2, … isotopomers follows that of a binomial distribution reflecting the natural abundance of 13C. The spectrum of oleate does not follow that of a simple binomial distribution. The spectrum of oleate is more complex than that of stearate showing the loss of –OCH3 and –HOCH3 6m/z 265 is the result of loss of –OCH3 (296 − 31 daltons) and m/z 264 from the loss of –HOCH3 (296 − 32 daltons). The corresponding M − 31 and M − 32 ions are also observed for palmitoleate. from the methyl group. The molecular ions of stearate and oleate were shifted by 18 daltons in the uniformly labeled fatty acids. The presence of12C resulted in the formation of m + 17 peaks in the spectra of [U-13C]stearate and oleate. The13C enrichment of these labeled compounds can be determined as the change in average molecular weight using the average mass approach (8Blom K.F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 966-971Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We found the enrichment of [U-13C]stearate and [U-13C]oleate to be 97.6 and 91.0%, respectively. The interconversion of stearate and oleate with palmitate and palmitoleate is outlined in Fig.2. The horizontal pathways represent chain elongation or shortening and the vertical pathways, desaturation or reduction. When HepG2 cells were provided with [U-13C]stearate, chain shortening resulted in the formation of [U-13C]palmitate containing 1613C carbons. Desaturation at the Δ9 position of [U-13C]palmitate and [U-13C]stearate gave rise to [U-13C]palmitoleate and [U-13C]oleate (Fig. 3). The conversion of oleate to palmitoleate has not been reported. Chain shortening of [U-13C]oleate resulted in the formation of a Δ7 C16:1 fatty acid, which has to be further processed to give the Δ9 fatty acid ([U-13C]palmitoleate). Reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond of [U-13C]oleate produced a small amount of [U-13C]palmitate and [U-13C]stearate (Fig. 4). The operation of these pathways of fatty acid interconversion in HepG2 cells in culture was clearly demonstrated by the presence of m + 16 and m + 18 isotopomers of these fatty acids as shown.Figure 3Mass spectra of methyl esters of palmitate, palmitoleate, and oleate isolated from HepG2 cells incubated with [U-13C]stearate. The base peaks for palmitate, palmitoleate, and oleate were m/z 270, 236, and 264, respectively. A substantial percent of palmitate was produced by chain shortening of [U-13C]stearate. This is shown by the presence of [U-13C]palmitate (m + 16). Subsequent desaturation of [U-13C]palmitate produced m + 16 palmitoleate. The bottom panel shows the action of stearoyl desaturase forming m + 18 oleate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Mass spectra of methyl esters of palmitate, palmitoleate, and stearate isolated from HepG2 cells incubated with [U-13C]oleate. The base peaks for palmitate, palmitoleate, and stearate were m/z 270, 236, and 298, respectively. There was little formation of palmitate from oleate, which requires chain shortening and reduction. A substantial percent of palmitoleate molecules with mass shift of 16 daltons (m + 16) was produced by chain shortening of [U-13C]oleate. The lack of reductase action was also seen in the conversion of oleate to stearate (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chain elongation of [U-13C]stearate produces arachidate (C20:0) and behenate (C22:0) with 18 13C carbons (m + 18). However, if [U-13C]stearate undergoes β-oxidation and the labeled acetyl-CoA is recycled, chain elongation creates C20:0 and C22:0 with m + 20, and m + 22. These peaks (m + 18, m + 20, and m + 22) were present in relatively large amounts in the normalized spectra shown in Fig. 5. The presence of m + 18 suggests that the substrate for chain elongation can be C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, and C22:0 creating mixed products with different degrees of labeling. The isotopomer pattern due to incorporation of labeled acetyl units in arachidate and behenate could not be explained by a simple chain elongation model. The contributions of uptake of labeled fatty acids and their conversion by chain shortening/elongation to the fatty acids of HepG2 cells are shown in Fig. 6. When HepG2 cells were supplied with 700 μm of stearate or oleate, the uptake of medium fatty acids accounted for 93 and 84% of the cellular stearate and oleate suggesting suppression of de novo synthesis of these fatty acids. The incorporation of medium fatty acids was not affected by troglitazone (Fig. 6 A). Under the same incubation medium, 16% of the palmitate (C16:0) was derived from [U-13C]stearate and 26% of C16:1 from [U-13C]oleate by chain shortening. Such contributions were significantly increased by troglitazone to 23.6 and 36.6%, respectively (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 B). Chain elongation was much more active than chain shortening when cells were supplied with additional stearate. Chain elongation accounted for 88.3% of arachidate and 63.7% of behenate molecules. These fractions were reduced in the presence of troglitazone to 84.0% and 54.2% respectively (p < 0.001). Desaturation of stearate contributed 67% of the oleate (Fig.7 A), while reduction of oleate contributed little to stearate (2%) (Fig. 7 B). The formation of C16:1 from C18:0 and that of C16:0 from C18:1 requires the obligatory step of chain shortening. The effect of troglitazone on chain shortening was thus propagated onto the differences in the contribution of desaturation/reduction of these compounds between control and troglitazone treatment. The interconversions of C18:0 and C18:1 by desaturation/reduction were not affected by troglitazone. The β-oxidation of labeled fatty acids generate labeled acetyl-CoA, which can be recycled in de novo lipogenesis or chain elongation. In the case of de novo synthesis of palmitate, the incorporation of labeled acetyl-CoA produced isotopomers with even number of 13C atoms (m2, m4, and m6) (Table I). From the consecutive mass isotopomer ratio, we determined the precursor enrichment of acetyl-CoA to be 6.15% (i.e. 6.15% of the acetyl units were [1,2-13C]acetyl-CoA) from the oxidation of [U-13C]stearate and 4.12% from [U-13C]oleate. The precursor enrichments were almost doubled under the influence of troglitazone to 10.5 and 10.4%, respectively (p < 0.001). It should be added that precursor enrichment can also be determined from m + 20 to m + 18 ratios in arachidate. Since these isotopomers are derived from the addition of one unlabeled or labeled acetyl unit. This ratio is an approximation of tracer/tracee (p/q) ratio of the acetyl-units for chain elongation. We found that the precursor enrichments as determined from arachidate were much higher than those estimated from the palmitate isotopomer ratios (Fig. 5 and Table I) suggesting that chain elongation and de novo lipogenesis may have different precursor pools within the cells. Despite the increased in precursor enrichment, the total enrichments in palmitate under troglitazone treatment were less than those of palmitate from the untreated cells. Thus, the fraction of palmitate (not counting those from chain shortening) from de novo synthesis was decreased significantly from 41.25–33.18% to 22.0–15.3% by troglitazone treatment. Allowing for the contribution from chain shortening,de novo lipogenesis contributed to 34.75% of the total palmitate pool when cells were incubated with 0. 7 mmstearate, and 16.28% when incubated with 0.7 mm oleate. Troglitazone reduced these fractional contributions to 25.35 and 9.7%, respectively.Table IMass isotopomer distribution in palmitate from HepG2 cells incubated with [U-13 C]stearate or [U-13 C]oleate, and the determination of precursor enrichment (p) and fractional synthesis (FSR)13C SourceTroglitazone concentrationm0m2m4m4/m2pFSRμm[U-13C]Stearate0 (n = 3)0.8254 ± 0.0039aValues are mean ± S.D.0.1300 ± 0.00280.0298 ± 0.00130.2294 ± 0.01090.0615 ± 0.00270.4125 ± 0.016650 (n = 3)10.8724 ± 0.0350.0851 ± 0.00220.0349 ± 0.00140.4108 ± 0.00920.1050 ± 0.0021bSignificant difference between treated and untreated values by two-tail t test at p < 0.001.0.2202 ± 0.0055bSignificant difference between treated and untreated values by two-tail t test at p < 0.001.[U-13C]Oleate0 (n = 3)0.8980 ± 0.01340.0815 ± 0.00960.0124 ± 0.00270.1504 ± 0.01530.0412 ± 0.00400.3318 ± 0.019150 (n = 3)0.9130 ± 0.00400.0594 ± 0.00290.0242 ± 0.00120.4082 ± 0.00820.1044 ± 0.0019bSignificant difference between treated and untreated values by two-tail t test at p < 0.001.0.1539 ± 0.0077bSignificant difference between treated and untreated values by two-tail t test at p < 0.001.The mass spectra of methyl ester of palmitate from cells incubated with [U-13C]stearate and [U-13C]oleate were used to determine precursor enrichment and fractional synthesis of palmitate.

Supplementation of diet with fatty acids is known to regulate endogenous synthesis of lipids. Transcriptional regulation of lipogenic enzymes, hepatic fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, in hepatocytes by fatty acids has been extensively studied (12Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 13Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Lipids. 1996; 31: S7-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Clarke S.D. Romsos D.R. Leveille G.A. J. Nutr. 1997; 10: 1170-1180Google Scholar). The effects on enzymes of de novo lipogenesis appeared to be specific for polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-6 and n-3 families, and saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids did not have the same inhibitory effects on these lipogenic enzymes (15Allmanm D.W. Gibson D.W. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acids can also be recycled by chain shortening/elongation of other fatty acids. The existence of such a fatty acid cycling system has been well documented for essential fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid interconversion requires the participation of peroxisomal, microsomal and endoplasmic reticulum systems involving enzymes of β-oxidation, desaturases, isomerases and reductases. The function of some of these enzymes are often inferred from their precursor-product relationship, and the substrate specificity of these enzymes have not been well characterized (2Sprecher H. Luthria D.L. Mohammed B.S. Baykousheva S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2471-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that such a system also exists for the non-essential fatty acids. However, the enzymes involved in the reactions of the cycling of nonessential fatty acids remain to be elucidated. The present study examined the impact of stearate and oleate supplementation on fatty acid cycling and de novo synthesis of nonessential fatty acids. With supplementation of 0.7 mmof stearate or oleate, we observed a number of very specific effects on the synthesis of a series of C16, C18, C20, and C22 fatty acids. When stearate and oleate were provided in relative excess, the uptake of these fatty acids accounted for over 80% of these fatty acids found in HepG2 cells. The conversion of these fatty acids by chain shortening and desaturation were also important in the production of palmitate and palmitoleate and oleate. By inference, de novo lipogenesis of these fatty acids was suppressed. De novo lipogenesis of palmitate in HepG2 cells was previously shown to be 80% for the same period of incubation (5Lee W-N.P. Byerley L.O. Bassilian S. Ajie H.O. Clark I. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When supplied with stearate and oleate,de novo lipogenesis was suppressed to about 40%. Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione compound which is known to bind with the PPARγ. The binding of troglitazone to PPARγ stimulates peroxisome proliferation, and induces the expression of a number of genes regulated by the peroxisome proliferator response elements (16Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,17Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Among these genes are the acyl-CoA oxidase and dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyl transferase, which are enzymes of lipid oxidation and biosynthesis (18Hashimoto T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Hajra A.K. Das A.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The effect of troglitazone on lipid metabolism was previously studied in hepatocytes isolated from troglitazone treated rats (20Fulgencio J-P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J-P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Inoue I. Takahashi K. Katayama S. Harada Y. Negishi K. Itabashi A. Ishii J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1626-1630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial β-oxidation as measured by the release of radioactive CO2 or the release of acid soluble product (ketone bodies) from 14C-labeled palmitate or oleate was reduced by troglitazone treatment. However, conflicting observations were reported by Shimabukuro et al. (22Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y-T. Lee Y. Unger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3547-3550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) showing an increase in mitochondrial β-oxidation of [3H]palmitate in islets of troglitazone treated Zucker diabetic fatty rats. The discrepancies in these observations may be attributed to the difference in the isotopic methods used or in tissue specific responses. Troglitazone was shown to noncompetitively inhibit mitochondrial and microsomal acyl-CoA synthase of rat hepatocytes (20Fulgencio J-P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J-P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and decrease the mRNA of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and acyl-CoA synthase mRNA content in islets of Zucker diabetic fatty rats (21Inoue I. Takahashi K. Katayama S. Harada Y. Negishi K. Itabashi A. Ishii J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1626-1630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the esterification of fatty acid to triglycerides and the triglyceride content in cells were inhibited by troglitazone treatment. In the present study, we showed that troglitazone increased chain shortening of C18 fatty acids thus peroxisomal β-oxidation of these fatty acids in HepG2 cells in culture. The increased β-oxidation resulted in higher 13C enrichment of the acetyl precursor pools both for de novolipogenesis and chain elongation. However, de novolipogenesis of palmitate as well as the synthesis of arachidate and behenate by chain elongation were significantly inhibited by troglitazone treatment. The action of stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity contributed significantly to the formation of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from palmitate and stearate. The desaturation of saturated fatty acids to mono-unsaturated fatty acids was not affected by troglitazone. Mitochondria and peroxisomes are the main cellular systems for fatty acids β-oxidation. Mitochondrial β-oxidation which is coupled to oxidative phosphorylation results in the complete breakdown of the fatty acid to acetyl-CoA, CO2, high energy phosphate bonds and reducing equivalents. Peroxisomal β-oxidation system on the other hand is not coupled to oxidative phosphorylation, and produces acetyl-CoA and the fatty acids of shorter chain lengths. The action of peroxisomal β-oxidation system is responsible for chain shortening/elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and for the recycling of acetyl (2-carbon) units and essential fatty acids in the homeostasis of these essential fatty acids (2Sprecher H. Luthria D.L. Mohammed B.S. Baykousheva S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2471-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substantial amount of palmitate and palmitoleate formed by chain shortening in our experiments suggests that the peroxisomal system also plays a significant role in the β-oxidation of long chain saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids, just as in the case of the very long chain fatty acid (23Poulos A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This process was stimulated by the peroxisome proliferator troglitazone. Chain shortening/elongation by peroxisomal β-oxidation characteristically allows energy to be stored or used without significant changes in the number of fatty acid molecules. Furthermore, chain shortening/elongation is a less “futile” process involving the recycling of 1–3 acetyl units as compared with eight via mitochondrial β-oxidation and de novo synthesis of palmitate. Peroxisome β-oxidation is potentially an energy saving system for the interconversion of fatty acids needed for membrane lipid synthesis. It is conceivable that these effects of troglitazone on oxidation, interconversion, and synthesis saturated fatty acids play a major role in cellular energy metabolism, and membrane lipid composition and turnover. However, the mechanism relating these effects to its “insulin-sensitizing” effect in the treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes is not known and deserves further investigation."

In EDL and soleus from wild type control mice, hypoxia increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake 2–3-fold. Conversely, hypoxia did not alter 2-deoxyglucose uptake in either EDL or soleus from either male or female GLUT4-null mice. Next we introduced the fast-twitch skeletal muscle-specific MLC-GLUT4 transgene into GLUT4-null mice to determine whether changes in the metabolic milieu accounted for the lack of hypoxia-mediated glucose transport. Transgenic complementation of GLUT4 in EDL was sufficient to restore hypoxia-mediated glucose uptake. Soleus muscles from MLC-GLUT4-null mice were transgene-negative, and hypoxia-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was not restored. Although ablation of GLUT4 in EDL did not affect normoxic glycogen levels, restoration of GLUT4 to EDL led to an increase in glycogen under hypoxic conditions. Male GLUT4-null soleus displayed reduced normoxic glycogen stores, but female null soleus contained significantly more glycogen under normoxia and hypoxia. Reduced normoxic levels of ATP and phosphocreatine were measured in male GLUT4-null soleus but not in EDL. However, transgenic complementation of GLUT4 prevented the decrease in hypoxic ATP and phosphocreatine levels noted in male GLUT4-null and control EDL. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GLUT4 plays an essential role in the regulation of muscle glucose uptake in response to hypoxia. Because hypoxia is a useful model for exercise, our results suggest that stimulation of glucose transport in response to exercise in skeletal muscle is totally dependent upon GLUT4.

However, recent studies with GLUT4-overexpressing transgenic mice were not able to provide a clear link between increased GLUT4 content and enhanced hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake (33Brozinick J.T.

Thus, overexpressed GLUT4 may be targeted to an insulin-sensitive, rather than a muscle contraction/hypoxia-sensitive pool. This raises the question of whether exercise/hypoxia-induced glucose transport is totally dependent upon GLUT4 or whether other members of the glucose transporter family play a role. Previously we examined the consequences of genetic ablation of GLUT4 on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle (34Stenbit A.E. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Tsao T.-S. Gautier N.

More surprisingly, in soleus from female GLUT4-null mice, insulin induced a 2-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake, with no difference under basal conditions. These results provide evidence for the existence of a compensatory glucose transport system in oxidative muscles of GLUT4-null mice.

Hypoxia exposure led to a 2–3-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in EDL and soleus muscle from male and female control mice. Conversely, in muscle from male and female GLUT4-null mice, hypoxia exposure did not stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Because the magnitude of increase in hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake can be influenced by the duration of exposure to a hypoxic environment, intramuscular glycogen, ATP, phosphocreatine, and lactate levels were measured to assess muscle viability and to compare metabolic effects of hypoxia between GLUT4-null and control muscles. With the exception that male soleus muscle lacking GLUT4 exhibited lower ATP content, no significant differences were observed in the levels of these metabolites between GLUT4-null and wild type control groups in both muscle types from both sexes after hypoxia treatment. These results suggest that the lack of hypoxia-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in GLUT4-null muscles cannot be attributed to differences in metabolite levels following hypoxia. GLUT4-null mice display altered whole body glucose and lipid metabolism (35Katz E.B. Stenbit A, E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J.

Thus, we have introduced a GLUT4 transgene driven by the myosin light chain 1 promoter (MLC) that targets expression to fast-twitch skeletal into GLUT4-null mice to provide direct evidence that GLUT4 ablation, rather than changes in the metabolic milieu, accounts for the lack of hypoxia-mediated glucose transport. The resulting MLC-GLUT4-null mice display normal glucose homeostasis and insulin action (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In EDL muscles of MLC-GLUT4-null mice, GLUT4 complementation fully restored hypoxia-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Soleus muscles from MLC-GLUT4-null mice were transgene-negative (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and hypoxia-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was not restored. These results strongly suggest that GLUT4 is essential for hypoxia-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. MLC-GLUT4-null mice were obtained by crossing GLUT4-null mice to MLC-GLUT4 mice (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The GLUT4 locus segregates independently from the MLC-GLUT4 transgene locus. MLC-GLUT4-null mice were genotyped for the MLC-GLUT4 transgene and GLUT4 gene disruption as described previously (31Tsao T.S. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Huang L. Charron M.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 26-28Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Katz E.B. Stenbit A, E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Mice between 10 and 14 weeks old were used in this study. Animals were fed ad libitum and maintained in a murine hepatitis virus-free barrier facility on a 12-h light and dark cycle. All protocols have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in accordance with the Public Health Service Animal Welfare Policy. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and soleus and EDL muscles were rapidly isolated. Muscles from an individual mouse were randomly divided such that one was used for normoxic and the other for hypoxic incubations. Muscles were incubated in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (118.6 mm NaCl, 4.76 mm KCl, 1.19 mmKH2PO4, 1.19 mm MgSO4, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, RIA grade, Sigma). Normoxic medium was pre-gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2, and hypoxic medium was pre-gassed with 95% N2/5% CO2. Muscles were pre-incubated under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 45 min (30 °C) in KRB medium supplemented with 5 mmd-glucose. The specific gas mixture was maintained throughout the pre-exposure period. Following pre-incubation, muscles were transferred to oxygenated KRB containing 2 mm pyruvic acid and 3 mm mannitol (Sigma). Muscles were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C under a gas phase of 95%O2/5%CO2. This incubation step was included to remove glucose from the extracellular space before measuring glucose transport and, in the case of hypoxia-stimulated muscle, to allow for resynthesis of high energy phosphates (8Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described previously (37Hansen P. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Schluter J. Mueckler M.M. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C30-C35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rate of intracellular 2-deoxyglucose accumulation is expressed as nmol × mg muscle protein−1 × 20 min−1. Protein was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Following incubation as described above, muscles were immediately freeze-clamped on a block of dry ice and stored at −80 °C for subsequent metabolic analysis as described earlier (38Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zetan N. Henriksson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7665-7671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, and glycogen were assessed fluorometrically on perchloric acid extracts of freeze-dried muscle according to Lowry and Passonneau (39Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar) with modifications indicated by Wallberg-Henriksson et al. (38Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zetan N. Henriksson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7665-7671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycogen was assessed in the extract and pellet, and results were combined for total muscle glycogen concentration. Results are expressed as mmol glucose units × kg−1 dry weight. To asses effects between genotypes (control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null), statistical differences were determined by one-way ANOVA. When a significant F ratio was obtained, Fisher's PLSD post hoc test was employed to identify statistical differences (p < 0.05) between the means. To evaluate differences between treatment (normoxicversus hypoxic) within a genotype, Student's unpairedt test was employed. Isolated EDL and soleus muscles were incubated for 45 min under normoxic (95% O2/5% CO2) or hypoxic (95% N2/5% CO2) atmosphere. Thereafter, muscles were exposed to oxygenated glucose-free medium for 15 min, followed by assessment of 2-deoxyglucose uptake under aerobic conditions. Hypoxia induced a significant 2.0–2.5-fold increase (p < 0.005) in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in EDL (Fig.1) and soleus (Fig.2) muscle from male and female wild type control mice. No effect of hypoxia was noted on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in either EDL or soleus muscle from male or female GLUT4-null mice. Restoration of GLUT4 in EDL muscle from male or female MLC-GLUT4-null mice led to a significantly marked increase in hypoxia-mediated glucose transport by 3.7- and 3.1-fold, respectively (p < 0.0001) when compared with GLUT4-nulls. Soleus muscles from MLC-GLUT4-null mice were transgene-negative (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin.

However, 2-deoxyglucose uptake was 40–45% lower in EDL muscle from GLUT4-null versus control and MLC-GLUT4-null animals. In soleus muscle (Fig. 2), similar rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake were noted between male and female control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null mice under normoxic conditions. We next examined glycogen content in EDL and soleus muscles from male and female wild type control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null mice. Muscles were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, as described above for glucose transport measurements. Although glycogen content tended to be lower in EDL (Fig. 3) and soleus (Fig.4) muscles following hypoxia exposure, significant decreases were only noted in muscles from control female mice (p < 0.05). In EDL muscle, glycogen content was similar between the different genotypes under normoxic conditions and similar between control and GLUT4-null mice under hypoxic conditions. However, glycogen content in EDL muscle following hypoxia was approximately 2-fold lower in male GLUT4-null than MLC-GLUT4-nulls (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, female MLC-GLUT4-null EDL displayed an approximately 30–40% increase in glycogen content when compared with control or GLUT4-null EDL after hypoxic treatment (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to EDL, soleus muscle from male GLUT4 null and MLC-GLUT4-null mice contained approximately 40% less glycogen than controls under normoxic conditions (Fig. 4 A). In female GLUT4-null mice, soleus muscle glycogen levels were increased approximately 1.8-fold under normoxic conditions compared with control and MLC-GLUT4-null mice (Fig. 4 B). Under hypoxic conditions, soleus muscle glycogen content was similar among control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null soleus, except in female GLUT4-null mice where a 2.0-fold increase compared with control mice was noted following hypoxia exposure (Fig. 4).Figure 4Skeletal muscle glycogen levels in soleus muscle from wild type control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null mice following exposure to oxygenated or hypoxic conditions.

Generally, ATP and phosphocreatine levels were slightly lower in hypoxia-stimulated muscles. Levels of ATP (TableI) and phosphocreatine (TableII) in EDL or soleus were not significantly different between female wild type control and GLUT4-null mice under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. In males, levels of ATP and phosphocreatine did not differ between control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null EDL muscle under normoxic conditions or between control and GLUT4-null EDL muscle under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, ATP and phosphocreatine levels in normoxic GLUT4-null soleus were decreased 37 and 51%, respectively. Similar reductions in ATP and phosphocreatine levels were measured in the transgene-negative soleus of male MLC-GLUT4-null mice. Upon hypoxia treatment, the phosphocreatine levels of GLUT4-null and MLC-GLUT4-null soleus muscles were not significantly different from normoxic levels. However, the ATP levels of GLUT4-null and MLC-GLUT4-null soleus muscles under hypoxic conditions were further reduced when compared with normoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, ATP levels in GLUT4-null and MLC-GLUT4-null soleus muscles were decreased by 57 and 38%, respectively, compared with controls.Table ISkeletal muscle ATP levels in control, GLUT4-null, and MLC-GLUT4-null miceNormoxiaHypoxiaP valueaP value for unpaired, two-tailedt test.Male EDL Control29.5 ± 1.021.5 ± 2.90.05eNS, not significant.

We provide the first direct evidence that GLUT4 is required for hypoxia-mediated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. This observation is based on our finding that GLUT4 ablation in isolated soleus and EDL muscles prevented increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake following exposure to hypoxia. Furthermore, transgenic complementation of GLUT4 was sufficient to fully restore hypoxia-induced glucose transport in EDL muscle from MLC-GLUT4-null. In vitro exposure of isolated skeletal muscle to hypoxia, followed by re-oxygenation, is known to increase glucose transport (8Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl.

Physiol. 1991; 70: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Because hypoxia appears to be a relevant model for exercise-stimulated glucose transport (8Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), our results suggest that GLUT4 is the only downstream effector of the muscle contraction/hypoxia pathway to glucose transport. In contrast, proteins other than GLUT4 may mediate the insulin-sensitive glucose transport process. Although we have reported that EDL muscles from GLUT4-null mice fail to demonstrate a significant increase in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake (34Stenbit A.E. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Tsao T.-S.

Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Tsao T.-S. Gautier N. Charron M.J. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results provide evidence for a novel compensatory glucose transport system that is sensitive to insulin but not hypoxia. In a previous study using transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT4 using its endogenous promoter, contraction of EDL muscles by in situ electrical stimulation resulted in a greater increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with wild type control muscle (32Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Pessin J.E. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that contraction-induced glucose uptake is mediated by GLUT4. However, a similar GLUT4 transgenic model was shown to exhibit increased insulin-mediated, but not hypoxia-mediated, glucose transport in skeletal muscle (37Hansen P. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Schluter J. Mueckler M.M. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C30-C35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the reported findings with in situ contraction and in vitro exposure of muscle to hypoxia are unclear because hypoxia is believed to activate glucose transport via the same mechanism as muscle contraction (8Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that GLUT4 is essential for hypoxia-mediated glucose uptake. Furthermore, we show that GLUT4 overexpressed from a transgene can be targeted to a hypoxia-sensitive compartment. Consistent with Brozinick and co-workers (33Brozinick J.T. McCoid S.C. Reynolds T.H. Wilson C.M Stevenson R.W. Cushman S.W. Gibbs E.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we did not observe a greater increase in hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake in EDL muscle of MLC-GLUT4-null compared with control mice. GLUT4 content in EDL muscle from female MLC-GLUT4 mice is similar to controls (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); thus, a greater level of hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake between transgenic complemented and control mice might not be expected. However, in male MLC-GLUT4-null mice, GLUT4 content in EDL muscle is increased by 360% (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), consequently, a greater increase in hypoxia-mediated glucose uptake can be predicted. Indeed, we reported that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is significantly greater in EDL muscle from male and female MLC-GLUT4-null mice compared with wild type controls (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, differences may exist between the recruitment machinery for insulin- and hypoxia/exercise-induced GLUT4 translocation. Our results indicate that there may be a limit in the hypoxia-induced glucose transport system, which cannot be overcome by overexpression of GLUT4. To achieve a further increase in hypoxia-mediated glucose uptake, overexpression of additional components of the translocation machinery for GLUT4 may be required. An alternative explanation for the lack of a further increase in hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake in GLUT4-overexpressing muscles is that the hypoxic conditions used in the present study were unable to generate a stimulatory signal sufficient for the translocation of overexpressed GLUT4. Unlike male control and male and female GLUT4-null EDL muscles, ATP levels in transgene expressing MLC-GLUT4-null EDL muscles were not lower with hypoxia treatment. Male MLC-GLUT4-null EDL muscles also exhibited higher phosphocreatine and glycogen levels than control and GLUT4-null EDL muscles following hypoxia. These results indicate that MLC-GLUT4-null EDL muscle was not affected by hypoxia to the same extent as GLUT4-null or control EDL. It is possible that increased basal glucose uptake seen in male MLC-GLUT4-null EDL muscle (36Tsao T-S. Stenbit A.E. Jing L. Houseknecht K.L. Zierath J.R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) can confer a superior ability to maintain glycogen and high energy phosphate levels and minimize cellular stress caused by hypoxia. It is unknown whether hypoxia stimulates glucose transport solely by mobilizing calcium stores or also by causing cellular stress. Although no correlation exists between levels of in vitro muscular glucose transport and ATP concentration, the degree of increase in glucose transport is affected by the amount of time exposed to hypoxic environment (8Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 70: 1593-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, glucose transport rates are negatively correlated with intramuscular concentrations of phosphocreatine following hypoxia (43Idstrom J.P. Rennie M.J. Schersten T. Bylund-Fellenius A.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggest that hypoxia-induced cellular stress is a potentiating factor in determining the magnitude of hypoxia-mediated increase in glucose uptake. Although overexpression of GLUT4 in MLC-GLUT4 EDL muscle prevented the decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine levels with hypoxia treatment, lack of GLUT4 did not appear to influence the level of ATP or phosphocreatine in EDL muscle from either male or female mice under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. In soleus muscle, GLUT4 ablation resulted in dramatically reduced levels of ATP and phosphocreatine in male but not female animals. Decreased ATP levels in male GLUT4-null and MLC-GLUT4-null soleus muscle following hypoxia exposure can be attributed to decreased ATP and phosphocreatine levels under normoxic conditions. In addition, one striking difference between soleus muscle from male and female GLUT4-null mice is the level of muscle glycogen, with approximately 50% lower levels noted in male versusfemale GLUT4-null mice. Although glycogen content in male GLUT4-null soleus was reduced 43%, glycogen content in female GLUT4-null soleus was increased 75% when compared with sex-matched controls. Reduced muscle glycogen levels may be one factor leading to the compromised energy state observed in the soleus muscle from male GLUT4-null mice. Similarly, elevated glycogen content in female GLUT4-null soleus muscle appears to have a sparing effect on depletion of ATP and phosphocreatine following hypoxia exposure. We have previously reported sexually dimorphic responses to GLUT4 ablation (34Stenbit A.E. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Tsao T.-S. Gautier N. Charron M.J. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Katz E.B. Stenbit A, E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J.

Invest. 1997; 100: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Female GLUT4 null soleus muscle displays significant, although blunted, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (34Stenbit A.E. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Tsao T.-S. Gautier N. Charron M.J. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon careful examination of the glycogen, ATP, and phosphocreatine levels of female soleus muscles under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, a strong similarity can be drawn to the control male soleus under similar conditions (Fig. 4 and TablesI and II). The underlying factor(s) responsible for this observation is presently unknown. Several important points can be made regarding the effects of variable GLUT4 expression on skeletal muscle glycogen content. First, transgenic complementation of GLUT4 in EDL muscle from male and female GLUT4-null mice led to a significant increase in muscle glycogen levels. This finding is in agreement with several reports whereby increased muscle glycogen levels have been noted in GLUT4 transgenic mice (29Treadway J.L. Hargrove D.M. Nardone N.A. McPherson R.K. Russo J.F. Milici A.J. Stukenbrok H.A. Gibbs E.M. Stevenson R.W. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29956-29961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A.

Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and suggests that enhanced glucose flux, presumably because of increased expression of GLUT4, leads to greater glycogen storage in skeletal muscle. Our finding that glycogen content in soleus muscle of male GLUT4-null mice was 45% lower than control levels supports this concept. However, the relationship between GLUT4 expression and glycogen content may not be as strong as previously suggested. For example, glycogen levels were significantly elevated in soleus muscle from female GLUT4-null mice compared with controls under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. This finding is consistent with our previous report of increased glycogen levels and enhanced glucose incorporation to glycogen in soleus muscle from female GLUT4-null mice (34Stenbit A.E. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Tsao T.-S. Gautier N. Charron M.J. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and provides evidence that GLUT4 expression may not be directly linked to muscle glycogen content. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GLUT4 plays an essential role in the regulation of skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to hypoxia. As hypoxia is a useful model for exercise, our results suggest that exercise, a potent stimulator of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, is totally dependent upon GLUT4. Furthermore, the compensatory glucose transport system expressed in soleus muscle of GLUT4-null mice is not sensitive to hypoxia.

Here we show CNTF could increase TR4 expression and enhance the DNA-binding capacity of TR4. Interestingly, the expression of TR2, a close family member of TR4, could also be induced by CNTF. In return, TR2 induced CNTFRα transcriptional activity through binding to a direct repeat response element of AGGTCA within CNTFR-I5. The possibility of this mutual influence between TR2 and the CNTF signaling was further strengthened by in situ hybridization. Similar expression patterns of TR2 and CNTFRα were observed in most of the developing neural structures such as the ganglia, neural epithelia, spinal cord, and the periventricular areas of brain. Together, our data suggest that an interaction between TR2/TR4 and the CNTF signaling pathway may occur, supporting the hypothesis that TR2/TR4 may play important roles in neurogenesis.

This association is then followed by signal transduction (11Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D.

Whereas gp130 and LIFRβ are ubiquitously distributed, CNTFRα expression is restricted to CNTF-responding cells of the nervous system (13Ip N.Y. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L. Li Y.

Interestingly, CNTFRα does not merely act as a receptor; a soluble form of CNTFRα can potentially interact with LIFRβ following its release from the membrane (14Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N.

Mice with null mutation in CNTFRα gene died shortly after birth and exhibited profound deficits in all motor neuron populations examined (15DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C.

Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting that CNTFRα is essential for the developing nervous system.The regulation of the CNTFRα gene expression remains unclear. A previous report published by Valenzuela et al. (16Valenzuela D.M. Rojas E. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Brannan C.I. McClain J. Masiakowski P. Ip N.Y. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed that the fifth intron of the CNTF α receptor gene (CNTFR-I5) contains six copies of AGGTCA-like sequences, which are preferentially bound by RA receptors, retinoid X receptors, and many orphan receptors (3Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar, 4Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These AGGTCA-like sequences accumulated in a 176-base pair small intron, including a direct repeat of the AGGTCA sequence with one base pair spacing (DR1) and one consensus NBRE sequence (17Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrant J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The sequences of both DR1 and NBRE response elements are conserved among many species (9Young W.-J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When CNTFR-I5 was present in a reporter gene construct, it could enhance the transcriptional activity in the presence of TR4, suggesting that TR4 may be involved in the regulation of CNTFRα gene expression (9Young W.-J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We further hypothesized that TR2 and/or TR4 may be regulated by CNTF. Thus, a two-way interaction could result with CNTF to regulating TR2/TR4 expression and also TR2/TR4 to regulating CNTFRα expression.CNTF is a neurocytokine that promotes the survival and differentiation of a variety of neuron cell types, including motor, sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, cerebellar, and hippocampal neurons (18Sendtner M. Carroll P. Holtmann B. Hughes R.A. Thoenen H. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1437-1453Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar); it also inhibits apoptotic cell death of cultured oligodendrocytes (19Louis J.-C. Magal E. Takayama S. Varon S. Science. 1993; 259: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Exogenous CNTF effectively blunts the progression of motoneuropathy (20Forger N.G. Wong V. Breedlove S.M. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Sendtner M. Schmalbruch H. Stockli K.A. Carroll P. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. Nature. 1992; 358: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Clinical trials of the CNTF application have been launched to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative human motoneuropathy (22ALS CNTF Treatment Study (ACTS) Phase I-II Study Group Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1995; 18: 515-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whereas CNTF may have important clinical significance, the mechanism of CNTF in neuron protection is not fully understood.In the present study, we used P19 cells as a model system because these cells can be induced into the neuronal differentiation pathway in the presence of inducers, such as CNTF and RA (23Gupta S.K. Haggarty A.J. Carbonetto S. Riopelle R.J. Richardson P.M. Dunn R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), and at a high cell density. Interestingly, the pattern of responsiveness to inducers appeared to be specifically influenced by cell-cell interactions: astrocytes showed greatly enhanced differentiation in three-dimensional aggregating cell cultures, whereas in monolayer cell cultures a predominantly mitogenic response has been observed (24Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). As our preliminary data indicated, P19 cells endogenously express TR2, TR4, and CNTFRα (23Gupta S.K. Haggarty A.J. Carbonetto S. Riopelle R.J. Richardson P.M. Dunn R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can test the effect of CNTF on the expression of TR2 and TR4 during neuronal differentiation. Here, our results show that CNTF treatment increased the population of TR2 and TR4 in P19 cells, and the DNA-binding ability of TR2/TR4 was enhanced. Such an increase may result in the induction of the enhancer activity of CNTFR-I5 and contribute to the expression of the CNTFRα gene. In addition, the distribution pattern of TR2 in the developing neural tissues correlated well with the pattern of CNTFRα reported by Ipet al. (13Ip N.Y. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L.

Mice with null mutation in CNTFRα gene died shortly after birth and exhibited profound deficits in all motor neuron populations examined (15DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C.

Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting that CNTFRα is essential for the developing nervous system. The regulation of the CNTFRα gene expression remains unclear. A previous report published by Valenzuela et al. (16Valenzuela D.M. Rojas E. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Brannan C.I. McClain J. Masiakowski P. Ip N.Y. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed that the fifth intron of the CNTF α receptor gene (CNTFR-I5) contains six copies of AGGTCA-like sequences, which are preferentially bound by RA receptors, retinoid X receptors, and many orphan receptors (3Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar, 4Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These AGGTCA-like sequences accumulated in a 176-base pair small intron, including a direct repeat of the AGGTCA sequence with one base pair spacing (DR1) and one consensus NBRE sequence (17Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrant J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The sequences of both DR1 and NBRE response elements are conserved among many species (9Young W.-J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When CNTFR-I5 was present in a reporter gene construct, it could enhance the transcriptional activity in the presence of TR4, suggesting that TR4 may be involved in the regulation of CNTFRα gene expression (9Young W.-J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We further hypothesized that TR2 and/or TR4 may be regulated by CNTF. Thus, a two-way interaction could result with CNTF to regulating TR2/TR4 expression and also TR2/TR4 to regulating CNTFRα expression. CNTF is a neurocytokine that promotes the survival and differentiation of a variety of neuron cell types, including motor, sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, cerebellar, and hippocampal neurons (18Sendtner M. Carroll P. Holtmann B. Hughes R.A. Thoenen H. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1437-1453Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar); it also inhibits apoptotic cell death of cultured oligodendrocytes (19Louis J.-C. Magal E. Takayama S. Varon S. Science. 1993; 259: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Exogenous CNTF effectively blunts the progression of motoneuropathy (20Forger N.G. Wong V. Breedlove S.M. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Sendtner M. Schmalbruch H. Stockli K.A. Carroll P. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. Nature. 1992; 358: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Clinical trials of the CNTF application have been launched to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative human motoneuropathy (22ALS CNTF Treatment Study (ACTS) Phase I-II Study Group Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1995; 18: 515-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whereas CNTF may have important clinical significance, the mechanism of CNTF in neuron protection is not fully understood. In the present study, we used P19 cells as a model system because these cells can be induced into the neuronal differentiation pathway in the presence of inducers, such as CNTF and RA (23Gupta S.K.

Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), and at a high cell density. Interestingly, the pattern of responsiveness to inducers appeared to be specifically influenced by cell-cell interactions: astrocytes showed greatly enhanced differentiation in three-dimensional aggregating cell cultures, whereas in monolayer cell cultures a predominantly mitogenic response has been observed (24Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). As our preliminary data indicated, P19 cells endogenously express TR2, TR4, and CNTFRα (23Gupta S.K. Haggarty A.J. Carbonetto S. Riopelle R.J. Richardson P.M. Dunn R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can test the effect of CNTF on the expression of TR2 and TR4 during neuronal differentiation. Here, our results show that CNTF treatment increased the population of TR2 and TR4 in P19 cells, and the DNA-binding ability of TR2/TR4 was enhanced. Such an increase may result in the induction of the enhancer activity of CNTFR-I5 and contribute to the expression of the CNTFRα gene. In addition, the distribution pattern of TR2 in the developing neural tissues correlated well with the pattern of CNTFRα reported by Ipet al. (13Ip N.Y. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L.

https://openalex.org/W2084108041,"The STAT5 activation has important roles in cell differentiation, cell cycle control, and development. However, the potential implications of STAT5 in the control of apoptosis remain unexplored. To evaluate any possible link between the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) JAK2/STAT5 transduction pathway and apoptosis, we have investigated apoptosis-resistant cells (ApoR) that arose from positive selection of the erythroid-committed Ba/F3EpoR cells triggered to apoptosis by ectopic expression of the HOX-B8 homeotic gene. We show that JAK2 is normally activated by Epo in both Ba/F3EpoR and ApoR cells. In contrast, both STAT5a and STAT5b isoforms are uniquely activated in a C-truncated form (86 kDa) only in ApoR cells. Analysis of ApoR and Ba/F3EpoR subclones confirmed that the switch to the truncated STAT5 isoform coincides with apoptosis survival and that ApoR do not derive from preexisting cells with a shortened STAT5. In addition, ApoR cells die in the absence of Epo. This indicates that resistance to apoptosis is not because of a general defect in the apoptotic pathway of ApoR cells. Furthermore, we show that the 86-kDa STAT5 protein presents a dominant-negative (DN) character. We hypothesize that the switch to a DN STAT5 may be part of a mechanism that allows ApoR cells to be selectively advantaged during apoptosis. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a functional correlation between a naturally occurring DN STAT5 and a biological response."

The many activities of Ku appear to depend on its prolific and unique ability to interact with multiple forms of DNA.

Torrance H. Saffran H. MacLeod H.L. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Rodda D.J. Giffin W. Haché R.J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The identity of these factors and their role in NRE1-mediated transcriptional regulation is not known. The potential for these strand-specific factors to interact with NRE1in vivo is particularly intriguing in light of the helicase activity of Ku (46Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and our previous observation that nuclear factor binding to double-stranded NRE1 induces Mg2+-dependent structural transitions in MMTV LTR flanking sequences that are sensitive to the single strand-specific agents, KMnO4 and S1 nuclease (50Giffin W. Haché R.J.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study we have initiated a characterization of the nuclear factors that bind specifically to the polypurine rich upper strand of NRE1. A single-stranded oligonucleotide affinity column separated NRE1 binding activity into two fractions. One of the factors was purified to homogeneity. Remarkably, this sequence-specific, single-stranded NRE1 binding activity was revealed to be Ku. Both purified Ku and recombinant Ku expressed in insect cells from baculovirus vectors bound specifically and stably to the single, upper strand of NRE1. While the affinity of Ku for single-stranded NRE1 was slightly lower than its affinity for the double-stranded element, the DNA-sequence requirements for binding to the two forms of DNA overlapped closely. Cross-linking experiments indicated that while only the 70-kDa subunit of Ku (Ku70) appeared to contact double-stranded NRE1, Ku binding to the upper, single strand of NRE1 also involved direct participation of the 80-kDa Ku subunit (Ku80) with the DNA. Intriguingly, the addition of Mg2+ and/or ATP to a binding reaction containing double-stranded NRE1 induced contact of Ku80 with the upper strand of NRE1 without completely unwinding the oligonucleotide tested. The implication of these findings for the regulation of MMTV transcription are discussed. Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. TheSpodoptera frugiperda cell line Sf9 was grown in TMN-FH medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Anti-Ku antibody Ab162 (51Reeves W.H. Rheum. Dis. Clinic. N. Am. 1992; 18: 391-415PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by W. Reeves. To prepare a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide affinity column for the purification of proteins binding to the upper strand of NRE1 (upNRE1), an 80-mer oligonucleotide containing four copies of the upNRE1 sequence 5′-(ACTGAGAAAGAGAAAGACGA)4-3′ was synthesized on a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer. This oligonucleotide was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-2B as described previously (52Kadanaga J. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar,53Jansen-Durr P. Boshart M. Lupp B. Bosserhoff A. Frank R.W. Shutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the double-stranded NRE1 affinity chromatography, synthetic oligonucleotides containing sequences corresponding to upper and lower NRE1 strands: upMTV = 5′-ACCGGACTGAGAAAGAGAAAGACGAC-3′, loMTV = 5′-GTCGTCTTTCTCTTTCTCAGTCCGGT-3′ were annealed to form double-stranded MTV, phosphorylated, and ligated to form oligomers which were then coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose according to Kadonaga and Tjian (52Kadanaga J. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells as described by Dignam et al. (54Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), except that KCl was substituted for NaCl. 6 mg of crude Jurkat nuclear extract was loaded onto a 2-ml upMTV-Sepharose column equilibrated to 100 mmKCl in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A in 0.1 m KCl, then eluted with a stepwise gradient of 3 volumes of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8m KCl in buffer A. Double-stranded NRE1 affinity chromatography was accomplished by combining and diluting the 0.2 m KCl fractions from the upNRE1 column in buffer A to 0.1 m KCl and loading the sample onto a 1-ml double-stranded sMTV affinity column equilibrated to 0.1 m KCl with buffer A. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A, then eluted with a stepwise gradient of 3 volumes of 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl in buffer A. To analyze the protein content of individual fractions, samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad). All oligonucleotides employed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were labeled at their 5′ ends with γ-[32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides employed in these experiments included the double-stranded MTV oligonucleotide, the upper and lower single strands of the MTV. Single-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the upper strands of the NRE1 element in the C3H strain of MMTV, the c-Myc plasmacytoma repressor element, an NRE1-like transcriptional repressor in the HTLV LTR, an octamer motif and a heat shock response element, that have been previously described (47Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), were also employed in some assays. Oligonucleotide affinity column fractions were assayed for NRE1 binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using the 23-base pair double-stranded MTV oligonucleotide or the 23 nucleotide single, upper strand of MTV. Both probes were labeled. Protein samples were incubated for 20 min at 20 °C in Buffer B (0.6× Buffer A containing 60 mm KCl and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin), and 2–20 ng of labeled specific probe and 100 ng to 1 μg of highly sheared calf thymus DNA. For experiments examining binding to single-stranded oligonucleotides, the calf thymus DNA was denatured by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and rapidly cooled on ice immediately prior to the binding assays. Electrophoresis was performed on native 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA for 1.5 h at 150 V. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed on NEF496 film (Dupont). In some experiments, antibodies were preincubated with the protein samples for 30 min prior to the addition of DNA to the binding reactions. All experiments examining the DNA binding of recombinant Ku were performed under the binding conditions described above. Determination of the Kd of Ku binding to the upper strand of NRE1 was performed exactly as described previously for double-stranded Ku binding (47Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed with a constant amount of recombinant Ku incubated with an increasing concentration of upMTV in a volume of 20 μl. The concentration of upMTV oligonucleotide was determined by spectrophotometry. The concentration of bound upMTV was calculated from the fraction of total upMTV as determined by phosphorimage analysis. Kd was determined by Scatchard analysis in three independent trials and is expressed as the mean ± S.E. Kinetic analysis of recombinant Ku binding to the upper strand of NRE1 was also performed essentially as described previously (49Rodda D.J. Giffin W. Haché R.J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The on rate was determined by EMSAs in which binding reactions were allowed to progress for 1 to 60 min prior to electrophoresis. The percentage of equilibrium binding was determined by phosphorimage analysis and plotted as mean ± S.E. The half-time (t½) of initial binding was calculated using linear regression of the data in the linear range. The off rate was determined by EMSAs in which NRE1 binding was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min and was subsequently monitored over a 24-h period following the addition of 200 ng of unlabeled upMTV competitor DNA. The percentage of initial binding was determined by phosphorimage analysis and plotted as mean ± S.E. Half-time (t½) of binding was calculated using logarithmic regression of the data. Two reagents, KMnO4 and DNase I, were used to footprint protein-DNA interactions over the MMTV LTR. 5–10 ng of a fragment from −421 to −106 of the MMTV promoter radiolabeled on the upper strand or lower strands was mixed with 100 ng of calf thymus DNA, heat denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, then rapidly cooled on ice. Binding was performed in buffer B with crude nuclear extracts and purified factors as described for 20 min at 20 °C. Treatment with 4 mmKMnO4 was for 1 min as described previously (20Giffin W. Torrance H. Saffran H. MacLeod H.L. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Rodda D.J. Giffin W. Haché R.J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Treatment with DNase I was performed for 1 min in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2. DNase I treatment was stopped by adding SDS to 0.1% and Na2EDTA to 10 mm. Footprints were visualized following electrophoresis of the samples on DNA sequence gels. Cleavage was positioned relative to guanine and thymidine sequencing reactions. Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus vectors encoding Ku-80 and histidine-tagged Ku-70 as described previously (55Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ku heterodimer was purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Sepharose® 6B (Novagen) as described previously (47Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As Ku-70 is only poorly soluble in Sf9 cells as a monomer, effectively only the Ku heterodimer is obtained. The purity of the recombinant preparation and the Ku-70/Ku-80 ratio was verified by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels as shown previously (47Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The upper strand of NRE1 was labeled by extension of a 6-nucleotide primer (5′-AACTGA-3′) hybridized to the loMTV with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP to produce a double-stranded MMTV oligo radiolabeled throughout NRE1, on the upper strand. Denaturation of the double-stranded fragment mixed with 1 μg of calf thymus DNA in buffer A was accomplished by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by rapid cooling on ice. Binding was performed in buffer B under conditions identical to those employed for EMSA and used comparable amounts of Jurkat purified or recombinant Ku. 10 mm MgCl2and 4 mm ATP were added as indicated. Cross-linking was performed in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) for 12 min at 4 °C. Protein DNA complexes were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels We have previously demonstrated in EMSA and in single-stranded DNA footprinting experiments with the thymidine specific reagent KMnO4, that nuclear factors in human Jurkat T Cell nuclear extracts bound to both the upper and lower single strands of the MMTV LTR over NRE1 (20Giffin W. Torrance H. Saffran H. MacLeod H.L. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the KMnO4footprinting, however, nuclear factor binding to the upper strand of NRE1 was reflected only by the protection of a single thymidine adjacent to the polypurine sequence. To increase our understanding of the interaction of nuclear factors with the separated single strands of the MMTV LTR in and around NRE1, we examined nuclear factor binding by single-stranded DNase I protection footprinting (Fig. 1). An LTR fragment extending from −421 to −364 was labeled at the 5′ end of the upper strand or the 3′ end of the lower strand. Strand separation was accomplished as we have previously described for single-stranded KMnO4 footprinting (20Giffin W. Torrance H. Saffran H. MacLeod H.L. Haché R.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1449-1459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the strands from the LTR fragment remain single-stranded for the duration of the binding and footprinting reactions. DNase I is considered a double-stranded endonuclease. However, the majority of DNA contacts made by DNase I occur on the DNA strand that is cleaved and all contacts occur on the same face of the DNA (56Suck D. Oefner C.

It is found in the mitochondrion, where it functions to transfer electrons from flavoprotein dehydrogenases involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, choline, and amino acids to a further flavoprotein, named ETF-CoQ oxidoreductase. The latter enzyme passes the electrons to the terminal electron transfer chain (1Thorpe C. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). Mammalian ETF is a heterodimer that contains one FAD and one AMP (2Sato K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. J. Biochem.

The FAD is the redox center in the protein, while the AMP is thought to have only a structural role. The genes that encode the human enzyme have been cloned (4Finocchairo G. Ito M. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure of the recombinant protein shows that the FAD interacts mainly with the α-subunit, while the AMP is buried in the β-subunit (6Roberts D.L.

Proteins similar to mammalian ETF have been isolated from bacteria. ETFs from Paracoccus denitrificans and the methylotroph W3A1 are also heterodimers with one FAD and one AMP per molecule (3DuPlessis E.R. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. Thorpe C. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

Although the physicochemical properties of methylotroph W3A1 ETF are similar to those of the other ETFs, the methylotroph protein is not able to replace the other ETFs in catalytic assays (10Steenkamp D.J.

Sequence analysis identified similar genes in a variety of other organisms. Thus, the proteins encoded by the fixB andfixA genes of nitrogen-fixing bacteria have similar sequences to the α- and β-subunits, respectively, of ETF, and their genetic organization is similar to that of bacterial ETF (5Finocchairo G.

The ETF in the anaerobic bacterium Megasphaera elsdeniifunctions in a similar way to the ETFs described above, but it differs in several of its physicochemical and catalytic properties. The organism is found in the rumen of sheep and cattle, where it ferments lactate (18Elsden S.R. Volcani B.E. Gilchrist F.M.C. Lewis D. J. Bacteriol. 1956; 72: 681-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disposing of excess reducing equivalents either by forming molecular hydrogen or through the production of short-chain fatty acids (19Ladd J.N.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 92: 421-432PubMed Google Scholar). The ETF mediates electron transfer from the flavoprotein d-lactate dehydrogenase to a third flavoprotein, termed butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD), that functions physiologically by reducing enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA (21Baldwin R.L.

M. elsdenii ETF has two subunits of different molecular mass, and it contains FAD, which acts as its sole redox group (24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the ETF preparations from other sources described above,M. elsdenii ETF contains approximately 1.4 mol of FAD in the form in which it is isolated, and it binds additional FAD so that when saturated with flavin it has 2 mol of FAD/dimer (24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A variable fraction of the flavin in this ETF comprises two hydroxylated derivatives of FAD: 6-OH-FAD (6-hydroxy-7,8-dimethyl-10(5′-ADP-ribityl)-isoalloxazine) and 8-OH-FAD (7-methyl-8-hydroxy-10(5′-ADP-ribityl)-isoalloxazine) (24Whitfield C.D.

The hydroxyflavins usually occur in small amounts, but at the highest levels observed they make up about half the flavin in the enzyme. There is evidence that they are artifacts generated during isolation of this ETF (22Mayhew S.G. Ludwig M.L. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 12. Academic Press Inc., New York1975: 109-118Google Scholar). Their optical properties differ from those of FAD, and they also affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme. They have not been observed in preparations of ETF from other sources. In further contrast to other ETFs, the M. elsdenii enzyme does not contain AMP (26Mayhew S.G. Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, it catalyzes the oxidation of NADH, thus allowing electron transfer from NADH to BCD and to other electron acceptors including 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) (22Mayhew S.G. Ludwig M.L. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 12. Academic Press Inc., New York1975: 109-118Google Scholar, 24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the apoenzyme of M. elsdenii ETF with 8-halogenated FAD derivatives led to covalent attachment of flavin to the β-subunit, suggesting that the flavin sites are on this subunit (30O'Nualláin E.M. Mayhew S.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 440-441Crossref Google Scholar, 31O'Nualláin E.M. Mayhew S.G. Edmondson D.E. McCormick D.B. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1987. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1987: 361-364Crossref Google Scholar). The analogue-substituted ETF is reducible by NADH, and it retains diaphorase activity, but it is inactive with BCD. Similar experiments using triazine dyes as affinity labels led to the conclusion that the NADH binding site is also on the β-subunit (32O'Nualláin E.M Structure and Function of Electron-transferring Flavoprotein from Megasphaera elsdeni. Ph.D. thesis. University College, Dublin1989Google Scholar). M. elsdenii ETF stabilizes the red anionic form of the flavin semiquinone during reductive titration with dithionite ion, as also occurs with ETFs from other sources (1Thorpe C. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar, 24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, semiquinone is not observed during electrochemical reduction of the enzyme in the presence of mediator dyes, leading to the conclusion that stabilization of the semiquinone is kinetic rather than thermodynamic (33Pace C.P. Stankovich M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The midpoint potential for the overall two-electron reduction of the enzyme is −0.259 V. The properties of M. elsdenii ETF show that although overall it resembles ETF preparations from other sources, it is unique in binding two molecules of FAD, in lacking AMP, and in catalyzing NADH oxidation. With the aim of using structural analysis to further elucidate the similarities with and differences from other ETFs, we have cloned the genes encoding the M. elsdenii protein. The base sequences of the genes and the predicted amino acid sequences of the subunits have been compared with those of other ETFs. Purified recombinant protein has been produced using an Escherichia coli expression system, and the properties of the recombinant protein have been compared with those of native ETF. These studies lay the foundation for more detailed structural analysis by x-ray crystallography (34Sharkey C.T. Walsh M.A. Mayhew S.G. Higgins T.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis. A preliminary report of some of the findings has been published (35O'Neill H.M. Butler G. Mayhew S.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 379SCrossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cells of M. elsdenii (strain LC1, NCIMB 8927) were prepared as described previously (24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains TG1 and DH5α were maintained and propagated aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Anaerobic cultures of E. coli were also grown in Luria-Bertani medium using the techniques described for M. elsdenii. A large scale culture of E. coli (40 liters) was grown under anaerobic conditions to obtain sufficient quantities of the recombinant protein for biochemical characterization. The growth medium (1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 17 mm KH2PO4, 72 mmK2HPO4) was supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin, and the culture was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mm in early log phase whenA590 = 0.13. Native ETF was purified from M. elsdenii as described previously (24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant M. elsdenii ETF was purified from E. coli transformed with pBETFfl.1 as follows. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The buffers contained 0.3 mm EDTA, and they were at pH 6 unless otherwise noted. A crude extract of E. coli was made by suspending cell paste in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (3 ml/g); lysing the cells by sonication (Branson sonicator, type 7532B operated at 80% full power); and centrifuging (23,500 × g for 20 min). The extract (350 ml) was applied to a column of Q-Sepharose (42 × 2.1-cm diameter) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer. The column was washed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (460 ml), and the ETF eluted using a linear salt gradient made by continuously diluting 500 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer with 500 ml of 0.33m potassium phosphate buffer. Fractions that contained diaphorase activity were pooled, diluted to 50 mm potassium phosphate, and applied to a second Q-Sepharose column (37.5 × 1.6-cm diameter). It was washed with 300 ml of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer and eluted with the gradient used earlier except for the total volume of buffer in the gradient, which was 600 ml. Fractions with an absorbance ratio (A272:A450) less than 10 were pooled. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to a concentration of 1m. The solution was then applied to a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (44 × 2.1-cm diameter) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate and 1 m ammonium sulfate. A yellow band with bright yellow-green fluorescence was bound tightly to the top of the column. The column was washed with 600 ml of the same buffer, and the ETF was eluted with a linear gradient in which 500 ml of 1 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer was continuously diluted with 500 ml of 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol in the same buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Those that gave only two bands corresponding to the two subunits of ETF were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PM30 (Amicon Corp.) membrane, dialyzed versus 0.1m potassium phosphate, and stored at −20 °C. ETF activity was measured by coupling the oxidation of NADH to the reduction of crotonyl-CoA in the presence of butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (21Baldwin R.L. Milligan L.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 92: 421-432PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained in a final volume of 1 ml at 25 °C 30 μm crotonyl-CoA, 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, 0.1 mm NADH, 2.3 μm BCD, and ETF. One unit of ETF activity in this assay is defined as an absorbance change of 1 per min at 340 nm. Diaphorase activity was measured by coupling the oxidation of NADH to the reduction of DCPIP. The reaction mixture contained 0.14 mm NADH, 32 μm DCPIP, 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and ETF in a final volume of 1 ml at 25 °C. The decrease in absorbance at 600 nm was measured. One unit of diaphorase activity is defined as an absorbance change of 1 per min. Protein was determined (37Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and a Biuret coefficient of 0.833 (24Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flavin chromophore was extracted from recombinant ETF by heat treatment in a sealed 1.5-ml centrifuge tube at 90 °C (27Mayhew S.G. Whitfield C.D. Ghisla S. Jorns M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The precipitated protein was removed centrifugation (20,500 ×g, 10 min). The enzyme was prepared for N-terminal sequencing by first using SDS-PAGE to separate the subunits. The areas of the gel that contained the two subunits were then excised separately, and the two proteins electroeluted (40Wilson K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 2.4.1-2.4.5Google Scholar). They were precipitated with 12.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was carried out by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 4778 protein sequencer. PAGE and SDS-PAGE analyses were performed (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) using a vertical slab gel (ATTO AE-6450). The separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue or for NADH dehydrogenase activity as described later. Cloning and transformation techniques were carried out essentially as described (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). M. elsdeniigenomic DNA was isolated and purified using the procedure described (40Wilson K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 2.4.1-2.4.5Google Scholar). Approximately 2.5 mg of DNA was obtained from 0.12 g of cell paste when the culture was harvested after 10–12 h of growth. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify genomic DNA sequences. Reactions were carried out in a reaction volume of 100 μl that contained 0.1 μg of genomic DNA; a 1 μmconcentration each of the primers A and B as given below; 2.0 mm MgCl2; 50 mm KCl; 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 25 °C; 0.1% (w/v) Triton® X-100; a 0.25 mm concentration each of the four dNTPs; 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega Corp.). PCR amplifications were carried out in a Techne thermocycler. The conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of denaturation, 94 °C for 1.5 min; annealing, 40 °C for 1 min; extension, 72 °C for 3 min. Primer A is nondegenerate: GATTTTAGGAGGCAAAACG. Primer B is degenerate with the sequence T(G/A/T/C)CC(C/T)TC(A/G)AA(C/T)TG(C/T)TC(G/A/T/C)GC. The reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplified fragments were electroeluted from the gel and subcloned into the pCR®2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) to generate plasmid pB900. The nucleotide sequences of the fragments were determined, and the correctly amplified sequence was identified by comparing the open reading frames with the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two ETF subunits. Nucleotide sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain-termination method (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) with [α-35S]dATP and Sequenase® version 2.0 with double-stranded template DNA. Subclones were generated using restriction sites within the cloned segment of DNA. These plasmids were sequenced using M13 primers (Sigma). The DNA sequence was used to design synthetic primers, which in turn were used to sequence the complete fragment. dITP replaced dGTP as necessary when secondary structure in the DNA made it difficult to read the sequence. The DNA fragment amplified by PCR was used as a probe in Southern blot analysis and colony hybridization. The probe was labeled with digoxygenin-11-dUTP (DIG) in a random-primed DNA-labeling reaction (Boehringer Mannheim kit, catalogue number 1175033). Purified genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes both singly and in pairs to generate DNA molecules that could be cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The restriction digests were separated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Biodyne® (42Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar). DNA fragments that contained the genes that encode ETF were identified by direct hybridization of the blots with the DIG-labeled probe and subsequent detection in the specific antibody-mediated chemiluminescence reaction. Larger amounts of DNA were digested with the enzymes that produced fragments of DNA that hybridized to the probe and were likely to contain the full-length genes. Size-selected fragments were isolated from agarose gel and ligated with pBluescript SK+ that had been digested with the same enzymes. The ligation products were transformed into E. coli TG1, and the colonies that contained recombinant plasmids were screened by colony hybridization using the DIG-labeled probe. Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformants that contained DNA that hybridized to the probe. These plasmid preparations were than screened by restriction mapping analysis and DNA sequencing. One plasmid with a 2.1-kb insert was found to contain the complete genes for ETF except for the 5′-end that encodes the N terminus of the β-subunit. A plasmid with the full-length genes was constructed by ligating this insert with the 5′-end of pB900 and pBluescript SK+. The plasmid was termed pBETFfl.1. E. coli was grown either aerobically or anaerobically at 37 °C in the presence or absence of IPTG as indicated. Crude lysates of E. coliwere made by resuspending the cell pellets in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), to which lysozyme was added (1 mg/ml). After incubation on ice (30 min) and centrifugation (18,500 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were analyzed by native PAGE using 10% gels and a discontinuous buffer system (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The gels were stained for NADH dehydrogenase activity using 0.01 mm p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet and 0.1 mm NADH in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. DNA sequence analysis was carried out using the Macmolly package (Softgene, Berlin). The amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (43Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of polypeptide sequences was determined using Predict Protein (44Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar, 45Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 46Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). The relative physical proximity and arrangement of the genes for the two ETF subunits within the M. elsdenii genome was not known at the beginning of the investigation. The N-terminal sequences of the α-subunit (30 residues) and the β-subunit (32 residues) were determined with the intention of using them to generate primers for PCR. However, a sequence similarity search of the protein/DNA data bases using the BLAST search algorithm (47Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar) revealed that the N-terminal sequence of the β-subunit of M. elsdenii ETF is encoded by a region downstream from the gene encoding butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (bcd) (48Becker D.F. Fuchs J.A. Banfield D.K. Funk W.D. MacGillivray T.A. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10736-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The assumption was then made that the gene for the α-subunit (etfA) would occur directly downstream from the β-subunit gene. Consequently, two oligonucleotide primers were designed and synthesized for use in a PCR amplification of the ETF genes. Primer A was derived from the sequence of bcd (48Becker D.F. Fuchs J.A. Banfield D.K. Funk W.D. MacGillivray T.A. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10736-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), beginning 22 bases upstream from the initiation codon ofetfB. Primer B was degenerate (256-fold), and it corresponded to the amino acid sequence of the α-subunit from residue 19 to 13. The amplified products were cloned into pCR®2.1 (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequencing showed that a 900-base pair PCR product contained base sequence that corresponded to parts of the two ETF subunits; this was designated pB900. The sizes of the subunits of ETF predicted that the complete ETF genes would occur on a 2.1-kb fragment of DNA. A Southern blot was carried out with M. elsdenii genomic DNA that had been digested with restriction enzymes that were selected from restriction maps of the base sequences for bcd (48Becker D.F. Fuchs J.A. Banfield D.K. Funk W.D. MacGillivray T.A. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10736-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and pB900. Size-selected fragments (2.0–2.2 kb) produced from the digestion of genomic DNA withPstI and HindIII were ligated into pBluescript SK+ to produce a subgenomic DNA library. The labeled 0.9-kb PCR product was used to screen the library. Of 2059 colonies screened, 38 were found to contain DNA that hybridized to the probe. One of these plasmids, with a 2.1-kb PstI–HindIII insert, was found to contain the complete genes for ETF except for the 5′-end that encodes the N terminus of the β-subunit. A plasmid that contained the full-length genes was constructed by ligation of the 2.1-kb fragment of DNA together with the 5′-end of pB900 and pBluescript SK+. This plasmid was designated pBETFfl.1. The partial restriction map and sequencing strategy used to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment of DNA is shown in Fig. 1. Each base in the 2102-base pair fragment was sequenced an average of 2.96 times. The amino"
https://openalex.org/W1986010440,"Abstract Mitochondrial biogenesis requires translocation of numerous preproteins across both outer and inner membranes into the matrix of the organelle. This translocation process requires a membrane potential (ΔΨ) and ATP. We have recently demonstrated that the efficient import of a urea-denatured preprotein into the matrix requires GTP hydrolysis (Sepuri, N. B. V., Schulke, N., and Pain, D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 1420–1424). We now demonstrate that GTP is generally required for efficient import of various preproteins, both native and urea-denatured. The GTP participation is localized to a particular stage in the protein import process. In the presence of ΔΨ but no added nucleoside triphosphates, the transmembrane movement of preproteins proceeds only to a point early in their translocation across the inner membrane. The completion of translocation into the matrix is independent of ΔΨ but is dependent on a GTP-mediated “push.” This push is likely mediated by a membrane-bound GTPase on the cis side of the inner membrane. This conclusion is based on two observations: (i) GTP does not readily cross the inner membrane barrier and hence, primarily acts outside the inner membrane to stimulate import, and (ii) the GTP-dependent stage of import does not require soluble constituents of the intermembrane space and can be observed in isolated mitoplasts. Efficient import into the matrix, however, is achieved only through the coordinated action of a cisGTP-dependent push and a transATP-dependent “pull.”"

Vascular endothelial cells form the primary interface between the blood and the underlying tissue. These cells not only provide a barrier of varying permeability between the blood and the smooth muscle of the vessel wall, but are a major contributor to the processes of vascular growth and repair, vascular autoregulation, and control of vascular tone by secretion of both relaxant and contractile factors (1Jaffe E.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 454: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Vanhoutte P.M. Rubanyi G.M. Miller V.M. Houston D.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells are known to possess a broad spectrum of ion channels that open in response to a variety of stimuli, including membrane potential, receptor occupation, elevation of [Ca2+]i, and mechanical deformation induced by flow (3Revest P.A. Abbott N.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 404-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Levels of [Ca2+]i are an important factor in the control of endothelial cell function (4Marsden P.A. Goligorsky M.S. Brenner B.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1991; 1: 931-948PubMed Google Scholar), and ion channels, with their ability to allow both Ca2+ entry either directly or indirectly, via control of membrane potential, are critical to this process (5Adams D.J. Barakeh J. Laskey R. van Breemen C. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Definitive data regarding the exact repertoire of ion channels expressed by endothelial cells are still sparse, particularly in venous endothelium. In this study, we report the presence of a voltage-gated Na+ current present in human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVECs). 1The abbreviations used are: HSVECshuman saphenous vein endothelial cellsTTXtetrodotoxinPBSphosphate-buffered salineTEAtetraethylammoniumRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This type of channel is normally only expressed by classically excitable cells that generate action potentials such as neurons and cardiac and skeletal muscle. Voltage-gated Na+ channels are characterized by their kinetics; voltage dependence; and sensitivity to the guanidinium toxin, tetrodotoxin (TTX). TTX-sensitive Na+ channels are blocked by nanomolar concentrations of TTX and are found in tissues such as mature skeletal muscle (6Cohen S.A. Barchi R.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 55-103PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TTX-resistant channels have a substantially lower affinity for the toxin, requiring 0.1–10 μm for inhibition (7Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). TTX-resistant channels are found in a wide variety of tissue types, including cardiac cells (8Brown A.M. Lee K.S. Powell T. J.

HSVECs were obtained by enzymatic release from saphenous vein harvested during high ligation of varicose veins or bypass surgery. After removal of any residual external connective tissue, the vein was carefully opened along its longitudinal axis with a scalpel blade. HSVECs were obtained by placing the vein luminal face down in a shallow Petri dish containing Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Na2HPO4) and 1 mg/ml collagenase (Type II, Sigma) and incubating at room temperature (20–22 °C) for 30 min. Cells were placed in culture on fibronectin-coated dishes or flasks as appropriate and grown in M199 medium supplemented with heparin, endothelial cell growth supplement, antibiotic solution (200 units/ml penicillin and 200 μg/ml streptomycin), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated human serum. Serum was obtained either from non-diabetic patients with peripheral arterial disease (>65 years old) or from healthy donors (<30 years old). Cultures, characterized by positive immunostaining for von Willebrand factor, were maintained at 37 °C in humidified CO2 in air atmosphere and used in experiments at passages 0–3. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (13Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. J.

These were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), visualized with phase-contrast optics, and continuously superfused at 2 ml/min with extracellular solution. The standard pipette and extracellular solutions were designed to isolate INa (pipette: 120 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 0.5 mmNa2GTP; extracellular: 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm TEA-Cl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with CsOH), although all current-clamp and some preliminary experiments employed “quasiphysiological” solutions (pipette: 140 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mmNa2ATP, and 0.5 mm Na2GTP; extracellular: 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with NaOH). Patch-clamp pipettes were manufactured from borosilicate glass (GC150-15TF, Clark Electromedical, Reading, United Kingdom) using a two-stage puller (PB7, Narashige, Tokyo, Japan) and fire-polished to give final resistances of 1–3 megaohms when filled with pipette solution. Whole-cell membrane currents (voltage-clamp) and potentials (current-clamp) were recorded using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) with analogue cell capacitance (mean cell capacitance = 35.1 ± 1.4 picofarads,n = 131) and series resistance (routinely <5 megaohms) maximally compensated. Signals were low pass-filtered with an 8-pole Bessel-type filter at either 2 or 5 kHz prior to digitization at 10 kHz by a Digidata 1200 interface (Scientific Solutions, Solon, OH) and storage on a computer hard disk (486DX2, Opus Technology). Analysis was performed using pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments Inc.), which was also employed to generate voltage step protocols. When recordingINa linear leakage, currents were subtracted using a 4-subpulse (P/4) method (14Bezanilla F. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), and INaamplitude was measured as the difference between the maximal inward current and the holding current level. Junction potentials were measured as described previously (15Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 331: 577-597Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar), although only determinations of the INa reversal potential were corrected. Total cellular RNA was extracted from HSVECs grown to confluence in T75 culture flasks by incubation with 6 ml of RNAzol reagent (Cinna/Biotecx Labs Inc.) at 4 °C for 10 min. Contaminating DNA was removed (Message Clean kit, GenHunter Corp.) prior to reverse transcription (Reverse Transcriptor kit, R&D Systems Ltd., Abingdon, UK), both according to the manufacturers' protocols. Sodium channel cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers directed against the 3′-untranslated region of the human cardiac hH1channel (16Gellens M.E. George A.L. Chen L. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used were 5′-GACCTGTGACCTGGTCTGGT-3′ and 5′-CCATGTCCATGGAAAAATCC-3′ (Perkin-Elmer, Warrington, UK). HSVEC RNA (1 μg) was used for PCR amplification using 1 μmprimers for 30 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 50 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min) at a MgCl2 concentration of 1 mm. The resulting PCR fragments were analyzed on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and sequenced using an ABI 373 automated sequencer to confirm fragment identity. Immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels in HSVECs was performed on intact tissue sections and cultured HSVECs using a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against the highly conserved cytosolic linker region between domains III and IV (peptide sequence TEEQKKYYNAMKKLGSKKP, amino acids 1490–1508) of known Na+ channel α-subunits (“anti-Naα”; TCS Biologicals, Botolph Claydon, UK). Small lengths of human saphenous vein were fixed overnight in Zamboni's solution (consisting of 1.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 15% (v/v) saturated picric acid in PBS) and washed daily in PBS/sucrose solution (PBS supplemented with 440 mm sucrose) for 7 days prior to mounting in OCT compound (Miles Inc.). Veins were cryosectioned using a microtome (Bright Instruments, Huntingdon, UK) to produce 8–10-μm thick transverse sections, which were transferred to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides prior to overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibody (anti-Naα, 7.5 μg/ml in PBS buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1% (v/v) human serum). Specific binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (Vector Red®, Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK) subsequent to primary antibody detection using a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1:200 dilution, 1 h) and a tertiary streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate incubation (1:200 dilution, 1 h; Dako, High Wycombe, UK). The presence of endothelium on intact vein sections was verified by using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against thrombomodulin. A protocol similar to that described above was employed for cultured HSVECs, which were, however, fixed by incubation in 100% methanol at 4 °C for 2 min. Controls for both intact vein sections and HSVECs were prepared by omitting either the primary or secondary antibodies. HSVECs, grown to confluence in T25 culture flasks, were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C using 1 ml of lysis buffer that consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium metavanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Lysed samples were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to separate membrane (particulate) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions, which were suspended in loading buffer (40 μl for particulate and 80 μl for cytosolic fractions). Aliquots (16 μl) of sample lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an 8–25% gradient gel (PhastGel, Pharmacia, St. Albans, UK) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filter membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Amersham, UK) for Western blotting. Membranes were incubated in blocking solution containing 5% (w/v) milk powder, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 2% (v/v) human serum in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 solution (20 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.4) with HCl) for 6 h at room temperature and washed prior to overnight incubation at 4 °C in primary antibody solution (5 μg/ml anti-Naα antibody) prepared in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 solution and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After washing, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1:1000) and a tertiary streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000; Dako). Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, Amersham, UK). Using this method, we could routinely detect protein levels as low as 0.5 pg/sample. HSVECs (105/well) were seeded onto 24-well plates and grown to confluence over 48 h. HSVECs were fixed by incubation in 100% methanol at 4 °C for 2 min and washed with Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with the anti-Naα antibody (2 μg/ml) for 40 min at 37 °C, washed, and subjected to two further incubations (30 min each at 37 °C) with a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500) and a final streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:500). Cells were thoroughly washed prior to assessment of anti-Naα antibody binding by colorimetric assay using o-phenylenediamine as the substrate, and the optical density was measured at 492 nm. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = number of observations). Normalized activation curves for INa were calculated by dividing conductances (gNa), derived from peak currents divided by the Na+ driving force (Vm − ENa), by the largest conductances measured. Steady-state inactivation curves (h∞) and activation curves (m∞) were fitted with a Boltzmann function, where V0.5 is the midpoint andKV is the slope factor:I/Imax = 1/1 +exp((V− V0.5)/KV). Kinetic analysis of INa was only performed if the peak current exceeded 500 pA, and time constants for current activation and inactivation were derived by fitting a Hodgkin-Huxley model (17Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1952; 117: 500-544Crossref Scopus (14521) Google Scholar) to the data as described elsewhere (18Sontheimer H. Waxman S.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 68: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for TTX was calculated by fitting the concentration inhibition curve to a logistic plot incorporating Hill coefficients (nH) using MicroCal Origin (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA): bound = [drug]nH/[drug]nH+ IC50. Reversal potentials (Erev) were obtained by fitting a second-order polynomial to the current-potential (I-V) plots over the appropriate voltage regions (usually +20 to +80 mV). Where appropriate, results were tested for significance using Student's unpairedt test. Culture materials were obtained from Gibco Laboratories (Paisley, UK), and the thrombomodulin antibody was a gift from Dr. J. Amiral (Serbio Research, Paris, France). TTX, purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK), was dissolved in water prior to addition to the appropriate solution. Unless indicated, all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK). Under whole-cell current clamp using quasiphysiological K+-containing solutions, the resting membrane potential of single HSVECs was found to be −28 ± 6 mV (n = 24, range of −3 to −71 mV). Hyperpolarizing voltage-clamp pulses from a holding potential of −50 mV produced small inward currents in 14 of the 24 cells (58%) investigated (Fig.1 A). These currents showed marked time-dependent inactivation at strongly negative potentials, inwardly rectified, conducting little outward current, and reversed close to the potassium equilibrium potential (Fig.1 B). Currents were fully eliminated by substituting Cs+ for K+ in the pipette solution and by the addition of 10 mm TEA in the extracellular solution, suggesting that they were carried by potassium ions. Depolarizing voltage steps from a potential of −120 mV to more positive potentials (−40 to +60 mV) elicited transient inward currents in HSVECs (Fig.2 A). These currents were present in 10 of the 24 cells (42%) investigated using K+-containing intracellular solutions, but unlike the inward current described above, these currents remained even when intracellular K+ was substituted with Cs+. All further electrophysiological experiments performed in this study used the Cs+/TEA-containing solutions to isolate this transient inward current and to avoid contamination from K+currents. With the use of the Cs+/TEA solutions, the current was found to be present in 75 of the 131 cells (57%) investigated, with a peak inward amplitude that varied between −70 and −1700 pA (mean of −595 ± 49 pA). The current was voltage-gated, activating at −50 mV and reaching a peak near −10 mV (Fig. 2, A(inset) and B), and had a mean reversal potential of +68 ± 4.2 mV (n = 36), close to the calculated Nernst potential for Na+ of +63 mV (ENa) for these solutions at 22 °C. The fast activation and inactivation kinetics of the inward current and its reversal close to ENa suggested that this was likely to be a Na+ current. To confirm this, extracellular Na+ was replaced with equimolar choline chloride, which totally abolished the inward current (n = 6) (data not shown). These results indicate that the rapidly activating and inactivating inward current in HSVECs is a voltage-gated Na+ current, which we have designated asINa. To facilitate comparison of INa in HSVECs with other known Na+ currents, we determined the sensitivity of the current to the guanidinium toxin, TTX. TTX has been shown to block a wide range of Na+ channels of different origins (7Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), which are classified as TTX-sensitive, TTX-resistant, or TTX-insensitive based on the IC50 value for TTX blockade. In HSVECs, as the concentration of TTX in the extracellular solution was increased,INa decreased, with 100% blockade occurring at 30 μm (Fig. 2). An equal reduction in the amplitude ofINa was observed across the entire voltage range of activation, suggesting that TTX binding was not voltage-dependent (Fig. 2 B). A logistic plot fitted to the concentration inhibition curve yielded an IC50 value for TTX of 4.7 μm (Fig.2 C), suggesting that INa belongs to the TTX-resistant classification of Na+ channels (19Sculptoreanu A. Morton M. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C724-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state activation and inactivation properties of INa were assessed by the construction of normalized m∞ and h∞curves. Fits to the normalized activation curves (m∞; Fig. 3), generated by conversion of theI-V relationship to conductances, gave a mean half-activation voltage (Vm) of −29.2 ± 1.2 mV (n = 17) and an average K value (slope factor) of 7.2 ± 0.3 mV. The steady-state inactivation parameter (h∞) of INawas measured using a standard two-pulse protocol. Cells, clamped at −120 mV, were conditioned with a 1-s prepulse to potentials between −120 and −20 mV prior to a 30-ms test pulse to −10 mV, the potential that routinely evoked the maximal current (Fig. 3 A). These data show that significant inactivation was observed at −80 mV and that INa was inactivated completely at −40 mV. h∞ curves were calculated by normalizing the peak current recorded during the test pulse to the maximum current measured on stepping from −120 mV to the test potentials and were plotted as a function of the prepulse level. The averaged data indicate that INa was half-inactivated at −75.4 ± 1.3 mV (Vh; n = 17), with a slope factor of 5.7 ± 0.2 mV (Fig. 3 B). There were not any areas of significant overlap between m and hcurves. The time dependence of recovery from inactivation also was evaluated using a double-pulse protocol. Cells were stepped from a holding potential of −120 mV to 0 mV for 20 ms to elicit and inactivate INa. The cells were then clamped at −120, −100, or −80 mV for a variable duration of between 4 and 64 ms in 4-ms increments, prior to a second test pulse to 0 mV (Fig.4 A). Recovery from inactivation was found to be strongly voltage-dependent, with complete recovery requiring potentials more negative than −80 mV (Fig. 4 B). By fitting a single exponential function to the data, the recovery time constants were calculated to be 3.3 ± 0.3, 9.4 ± 1.2, and 32.2 ± 1.7 ms for cells held at −120, −100, and −80 mV, respectively (n = 4). Time constants for activation (τm) and inactivation (τh) were obtained by fitting a Hodgkin-Huxley model (see “Experimental Procedures”) to the inward currents. Both τm and τh were voltage-dependent, becoming more rapid as the test potential became increasingly more depolarized (Fig.5). This was much more marked with τh, which was reduced from 3.77 ms at −30 mV to 0.43 ms at +50 mV. The hyperpolarized half-maximal inactivation potential (Vh) and the inactivation time course are consistent with those reported for the cardiac isoform of Na+ channels (7Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar, 20Chahine M. Deschene I. Chen L.Q. Kallen R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H498-H506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4Recovery from inactivation ofINa. A, series of current traces elicited by a double-pulse protocol. The cell was clamped at −120 mV, and a 20-ms voltage step to 0 mV was used to elicit and inactivateINa. The cell was then clamped at −100 mV for 4–64 ms in 4-ms increments before a second test pulse to 0 mV. B, recovery from inactivation occurs as a function of the holding potential (Vhold). Plots are of the ratio of the amplitude of the second and first current pulses as a function of the interval between the two. The lines represent a single exponential curve fitted to the data. Time constants estimated from these fits were 3.6 ms at −120 mV, 9.7 ms at −100 mV, and 34.6 ms at −80 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Analysis of the time course ofINa in HSVECs.

In four cells, τh at 0 mV was increased from 0.71 ms to 1.25 ms within 15 min of establishing whole-cell configuration without any effect on peak current amplitude (data not shown). On the basis of electrophysiological data, particularly the current kinetics and sensitivity to TTX, the voltage-gated Na+ current in HSVECs appeared to closely resemble the human cardiac sodium channel, hH1. To test this hypothesis, mRNA isolated from HSVECs was reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was amplified (RT-PCR) with specific primers targeted against the 3′-untranslated region of the hH1 cDNA (16Gellens M.E. George A.L. Chen L. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The expected product of 180 base pairs was produced only in those samples that had been reverse-transcribed. In the absence of a RT step, no product was present after PCR (Fig. 6). DNA sequencing of the RT-PCR product confirmed that it was identical to the 3′-untranslated region of the human hH1 sodium channel. Using Western blotting and employing the anti-Naα antibody, we were able to detect Na+ channel protein in the membrane (but not the cytosolic) fraction of HSVECs with guinea pig cardiac myocytes acting as a positive control (Fig.7). The antibody routinely recognized a single protein band that had an apparent molecular mass of 242 ± 9 kDa when separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (n = 5). This value is close to the molecular mass of the human hH1 α-subunit of 230 kDa as calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. Subconfluent HSVECs, which were electrophysiologically confirmed to be expressing INa, also immunostained positively with the anti-Naα antibody (Fig. 8). This antibody was used to demonstrate the presence of Na+channels in the endothelium of freshly excised human saphenous vein. In intact saphenous vein endothelium, the immunostaining for Na+ channel α-subunits was intermittent, with not all endothelial cells being stained (Fig.9).Figure 9Immunohistochemical detection of voltage-gated sodium channels in intact human saphenous vein sections. A, vein section immunostained with thrombomodulin antibody to confirm the presence of intact endothelium; B, serial section as in A, showing positive immunoreactivity to the anti-Naα antibody. Note that not all cells staining positive for thrombomodulin expression are expressing Na+channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the effects of serum on expression of INa by subconfluent HSVECs, we measured the magnitude and prevalence ofINa in cells that had been incubated for 48 h in growth medium that was serum-free or supplemented with 10% (v/v) human serum either from peripheral arterial disease patients 65 years of age and over (“aged”) or from healthy donors under 30 years of age (“young”). Under serum-free conditions and in medium supplemented with aged serum, INa was of small magnitude and was found in relatively few cells (TableI). However, medium supplemented with young serum was found to increase significantly both the magnitude ofINa and the number of HSVECs in whichINa was observed (Table I). The stimulatory effect of serum upon INa expression was confirmed by cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of confluent HSVECs using the anti-Naα antibody. Inclusion of 2 or 10% (v/v) young serum in the incubation medium of HSVECs for 6 h increased the relative concentration of sodium channel protein 2- and 4-fold, respectively. The absorbance increased from 0.10 ± 0.03 (n = 8) in serum-free medium to 0.19 ± 0.03 (n = 7) and 0.36 ± 0.06 (n = 6) for HSVECs cultured in 2 and 10% (v/v) young sera, respectively.Table IEffects of growth conditions upon presence of INa in HSVECs as assessed by electrophysiologyGrowth conditionsINaoccurrenceINa magnitude (mean ± S.E.)pAM199 + 10% (v/v) aged serum7/18 (39%)−153 ± 22M199 + 10% (v/v) young serum19/33 (58%)−559 ± 119aSignificantly different from serum-free M199 medium (p < 0.01, Student's unpaired t test).Serum-free M1996/18 (33%)−196 ± 36Subconfluent HSVECs were cultured for 48 h under three growth conditions"

The bacteriophage λ relies on interactions with theEscherichia coli host cell transcription apparatus and regulatory systems for the orderly expression of its genes. The temporal regulation of λ gene expression is achieved in part by control of transcript elongation, termination, and anti-termination (1Friedman D.I. Calendar R. The Bacteriophages.

Landick R. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994: 297-321Google Scholar). An accessory factor with a central role in the λ life cycle is the host Rho protein (7Roberts J.W. Nature ( Lond. ). 1969; 224: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Rho causes transcription termination in a multistep interaction with the elongating RNA polymerase complex that involves an initial high affinity binding to the nascent transcript and subsequent secondary RNA interactions, which lead to the release of the RNA and disassociation of the transcription complex (8Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These two RNA interactions are thought to involve two distinct types of RNA binding sites on the Rho hexamer (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the corresponding regions in the RNA, beyond a requirement for low secondary structure (10Morgan W.D.

The Lambda tR1 Rho-dependent terminator limits transcription initiated at the PR promoter to the proximalcro gene relative to cII and other downstream genes of the major rightward operon. Like other Rho-dependent terminators, tR1 is composed of two parts, an upstream rut sequence that encodes regions of the nascent transcript to which Rho binds tightly, and a downstream tspsequence containing points at which paused polymerase complexes are disassociated by Rho (13Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21597-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The tR1 rut site is interrupted by the N-utilization element, boxB, with the upstream 17 nucleotides designated rutA, and the only partially defined downstream element designated rutB (14Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription terminated by Rho at tR1 produces RNAs with heterogeneous 3′ ends corresponding to the pauses in transcription elongation at transcription stop point subsites I, II, and III (15Lau L.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21597-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that the upstream rutsequences are the major determinants of termination at tR1, as substitution of the transcription stop point region with foreign sequences did not preclude efficient termination at pause sites in the substituted sequence. The tR1 rut sequences were identified by studies of transcription termination in vitro using highly purified RNA polymerase and Rho without other accessory protein factors (14Chen C.-Y.A.

Here we report the effects of deletions ofrut site sequences on the function of tR1 in vivoand in vitro and on the abilities of modified crogene transcripts to bind to Rho and activate Rho ATPase activity. We show that tR1 terminators lacking rutA are more defective than those lacking rutB or boxB, and that the relative importance of these parts for in vivo function is the same as in a purified system with no factors other than Rho. Enzymes used for DNA manipulations were obtained from New England Biolabs and RNAsin from Promega. Exonuclease III was from Bethesda Research Labs, T7 DNA polymerase from U. S. Biochemical and proteinase K from Beckman. E. coli RNA polymerase was from Epicentre Technologies or purified according to Andrews and Richardson (21Andrews C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli Rho was purified from BL21(DE3)[pCB111, pLys] by Lislott Richardson as described by Nowatzke et al. (22Nowatzke W.L. Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was also prepared by Lislott Richardson as described by Tabor and Richardson (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nitrocellulose Bio-Trace NT filters for Rho RNA binding studies were purchased from Gellman Scientific and polyethylenimine thin layer chromatography plates from Brinkman. Ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]UTP were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals. Hosts for plasmids containing the λ PR promoter were lysogenized by λ+ to repress transcription and increase plasmid stability. Strain JG20 (F′{Δ(lacZ)H220lacY + proAB +} Δlacpro supE thi recA938(cm R)::Tn9–200Δ(ara)174), the host for transcriptional tR1 fusions, was transduced to Δ(ara)174,recA938(cmR)::Tn9–200 by two sequential transductions (24Miller J.H.

To construct plasmid pJGLC, a 560-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reaction. λ HinfI fragment from pCYC2 (16Chen C.-Y.A. Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. Cell. 1986; 46: 1023-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was made blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into the SmaI site of pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene) such that cro and lacZα shared the same orientation. Plasmid pJGBTZ was constructed from pJGLC in a somewhat indirect series of ligations involving an initial placement of the pTac promoter from pKK233–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) upstream of the cro-lac fusion. A 589-bpHindIII-BamHI fragment from pJGLC was ligated to the HindIII-BamHI vector fragment of thelac fusion plasmid pTL61T of Linn and St. Pierre (26Linn T. St. Pierre R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After excising a 70-bp EcoRI fragment from the resulting construct, an HgiAI-BamHI fragment containing the pTac promoter from pKK233–3 was ligated to the 8856-bpPstI-BglII vector fragment. A 7062-bp fragment containing the cro-lac fusion region generated byBspHI cleavage and partial BspMI digestion was then made blunt-ended and ligated into the SmaI site of a modified low-copy plasmid pCL1921 (27Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) from which the lacpromoter containing EcoRI fragment had been deleted. The resulting cro-lac fusion was oriented in the opposite direction from the remaining pCL1921 lacZαfragment. Upstream cro sequence beginning with the fifth nucleotide of the cro transcript was then restored on the plasmid by replacing the 210-bp SmaI-NsiIcro fragment with a 280-bp RsaI-NsiI fragment from pJGLC. Construction of pJGBTZ was completed by the addition of the F1 phage origin of replication from plasmid pUCF1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a HincII-KpnI DNA fragment between unique BalI and KpnI sites, and ligation of an EcoRI-NsiI fragment containing thearaBAD promoter and divergent araC coding region from plasmid pBAD18 2L.

To estimate relative plasmid copy number in tR1-lacZ fusion strains, cultures were grown as described below for β-galactosidase assays and mixed with equal amounts of JG20 pCYC177 cultures before copurification of both plasmids. The yield of tR1 fusion plasmid relative to the reference plasmid pCYC177 was then determined by densitometric analysis of photographic images of ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels on which linearized plasmids had been separated. Plasmids deleted for rut site sequences as shown in Fig. 2 were constructed by a variety of methods depending on the availability of appropriate restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. Plasmids pJGLCΔrutA-B and pJGLCΔboxB were created by annealing deoxyoligonucleotides to single-stranded pJGLC templates so that specific residues were “looped-out” and therefore excluded from the complementary DNA strand synthesized in vitro (28Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). In plasmid pJGLCΔrutA, 33 base pairs immediately downstream of thecro stop codon were removed by the sequential action ofEcoNI, E. coli exonuclease III, mung bean exonuclease, and T4 DNA ligase. In pJGLCΔrutB, a 26-bp deletion was created by removing an EcoNI-BstXI restriction fragment from pJGLC and recircularizing the vector fragment after T4 DNA polymerase treatment. Deletions were transferred from pJGLC to reporter gene fusion plasmid pJGBTZ asBglII-NsiI restriction fragments containing the altered regions. The entire tR1 rut site region was removed in the derivation of pJGBZ from plasmid pJGBTZ by replacement of a 184-bp AvaI-BamHI fragment with a linker fragment obtained from the digestion of the annealed and extended oligodeoxynucleotides CCTTCCCGAGTAACAAAAAAACAACAGC and GTTAGGATCCTTATGCTGTTGT. JG20 strains containing transcriptional fusions were grown in a defined medium (M9 salts, 0.2% glucose, 0.4% casamino acids, 40 μg/mll-leucine, 10 μg/ml thiamine, 0.2% arabinose, and 70 μg/ml spectinomycin), and β-galactosidase activity representing transcriptional readthrough of tR1 was determined. For β-galactosidase assays, frozen stocks were inoculated into defined medium lacking arabinose and grown 4 h before the addition of arabinose. Cultures were then grown overnight before inoculation at 0.15% (v/v) into 2 ml of complete defined media. Experimental cultures were grown for 4 h (approximately 5 doublings) on a tube roller at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.3–0.4 and placed on ice for exactly 20 min before the determination ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis rates in cells permeabilized by SDS and chloroform (24Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 268-274Google Scholar). DNA fragments equivalent to the 560-bp λ HinfI fragment containing PR and tR1 (15Lau L.F. Roberts J.W. Wu R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6171-6175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were synthesized by 17 cycles of PCR (29Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Transcription templates were prepared by addition of proteinase K (50 μg/ml) to PCR reactions and incubation for 20 min at 37 °C followed by a single chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extraction. Aqueous phases were then loaded directly onto 0.8% low-melting agarose gels before recovery of the desired DNAs by a modified freeze-thaw extraction (30Qian L. Wilkinson M. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 736-738PubMed Google Scholar). Templates were then desalted on Sephadex G50 spin columns (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8). Standard 25-μl in vitro transcription reactions (32Zou L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10201-10209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained 150 mm potassium glutamate (pH 7.8), 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 4 mm magnesium acetate, 20 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 20 units/ml RNAsin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Template DNAs were at 5 nm, Rho at 2.5 nm, and RNA polymerase at 7 nm except where otherwise indicated. These components in a 20-μl volume were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of 5 μl of a mixture of four NTPs and rifampicin (10 μg/ml). All ribonucleotides were present at 150 μmfinal concentration with 5 μCi of radiolabeled [α-32P]UTP per reaction. After 4 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of a solution containing 0.4% SDS, 60 mm EDTA, 5 μg of E. coli tRNA, and 2.5 μg proteinase K. After 10 min of digestion at 37 °C, transcripts were precipitated by the addition of 0.5 volumes of 7.5 mammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol before analysis on 6% acrylamide gels as described previously (21Andrews C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen or x-ray film. Termination efficiencies were calculated as the percentage of transcripts reaching the end of the template relative to all the transcripts produced from PhosphorImager quantitation of the amounts of radioactive label in the gel-separated transcripts adjusted for the relative content of labeled nucleotides in the transcripts. Templates for synthesis of microgram quantities of tR1 containing RNAs were prepared by incorporating a T7 promoter upstream of the crocoding sequence by PCR. Primers T7croG (GCAAGAATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATCTACTAAGGAGGAGGTTGTATGG) and L (CGATTCGTAGAGCCTCGTTG) were extended on pJGLC and deletion plasmid templates for the synthesis of wild-type and mutantcro RNAs. These RNAs are identical to those synthesized byE. coli RNA polymerase on the 560-bp λ HinfI fragment except for replacement of “AUG” by “GGAUC” at the 5′ termini. Such 5′-modified full-length cro RNAs showed very similar Rho binding and maximum ATPase cofactor activities to unmodified cro RNAs and RNAs with different 5′-terminal base modifications (33Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Templates encoding truncated cro RNAs used in some experiments were synthesized with alternate downstream primers rather than L. Rho binding and ATPase assays were performed as described previously (13Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21597-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The binding data were fitted to theoretical binding curves using the curve-fitting program GraFit (Erithacus Software, Ltd. Staines, United Kingdom). To test the role of therut site and its sequence elements in termination at tR1in vivo, we constructed a transcriptional fusion plasmid that is well suited for quantitative analysis of transcription termination. Plasmid pJGBTZ (Fig. 1) contains a complete translated cro coding sequence and tR1 terminator positioned between the tightly regulated araBADpromoter and the lacZ reporter gene on a low-copy pSC101-derived replicon. The fusion junction contains an RNase III processing site allowing a uniform β-galactosidase message to be generated in all tR1 constructs, and the entire region is insulated from transcription initiated outside the region by flankingrrnB terminators, features developed by Linn and St. Pierre (26Linn T. St. Pierre R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The araBAD promoter allows adjustment of β-galactosidase expression levels to those readily tolerated by the host cell. The relative level of β-galactosidase expressed from fusion constructs lacking all or parts of the tR1 rut site (Fig.2) are shown in Fig.3. Levels are given as a percentage of downstream gene expression in a control construct lacking tR1 (pJGBZ). In our system, the efficiency of termination at tR1 in vivoranged from 70 to 82% in different experiments, which is slightly higher than previous estimates (1Friedman D.I. Calendar R. The Bacteriophages. Plenum Press, New York1988: 263-319Crossref Google Scholar). The results show that a deletion of the whole rut region (ΔrutA-B) allowed almost as much downstream gene expression as seen in a fusion that lacked any terminator, thus confirming the importance of the rut region for in vivo termination function in the natural context of cotranslation of the cro message and in the presence of all accessory host factors. The reductions in the level of termination with the various partial deletions indicate that rutA,rutB, and boxB contribute approximately 64, 24, and 5%, respectively, to the level of termination of the entire region. Thus this result shows that in vivo rutA contributes significantly more to the function of tR1 than does rutB,whereas the boxB element contributes very little. To determine whether intracellular factors other than Rho contributed to the different relative importance of rutA and rutB in termination, the efficiency of Rho-dependent transcription termination in vitro with purified RNA polymerase was measured for these terminator deletions. Fig. 4 shows the products of a single round of transcription initiated at PRwhere transcripts were elongated in the presence of relatively high levels of all four nucleoside triphosphates. Under conditions in which a nearly saturating level of Rho caused termination at a level of 73%, 3The main reason this value is significantly lower than values we have obtained previously (14Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zou L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10201-10209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is because we purposely used higher levels of NTPs. the efficiencies of termination with the ΔrutA, ΔrutB, and ΔboxB templates were 27, 48, and 70%, respectively, indicating that rutA, rutB, and boxBcontribute 63, 34, and 4%, respectively, to the level of termination of the complete sequence. Within experimental error, these values are the same as those found with the in vivo measurement. Thus, the relative contributions appear to be intrinsic to the basic interaction between Rho and the transcription complex and are not dependent on other cellular factors, including those known to interact with the overlapping nutR region (3Friedman D.I. Court D.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies (14Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Washburn R.S. Jin D.J. Stitt B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have indicated that in the absence of cro translation, regions upstream ofrutA-B may also play some role in Rho interactions leading to termination at tR1. When the ΔAL131 DNA template, which carries a previously characterized 131-bp upstream deletion (14Chen C.-Y.A. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11292-11299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used,in vitro transcription termination was reduced to 54% (Fig.4), which was less than that with either the 33-bp rutAdeletion or the 28-bp rutB deletion. This result confirms that Rho can interact with the upstream region although with less potency per nucleotide than with the rutA or rutBsequences. Deletion of these upstream regions was previously shown to reduce electrostatic interactions between Rho and the RNA (33Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because any change in RNA sequence is likely to be associated with an alteration of RNA structure, and because Rho's interactions with RNA are very sensitive to RNA secondary structure, we used the Mulfold program (35Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 183: 281-306Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar) to predict secondary structures of rut-deletion transcripts. Computer modeling did not predict any new secondary structural elements in the remaining rut sequences for any of the deletion RNAs (data not shown). This analysis suggests that the loss of tR1 function can be attributed to the loss of rutsite sequences and not to the sequestering of the remainingrut sequences in a base-paired secondary structure. Because the efficiency of transcription termination is dependent on Rho's ability to interact with a paused transcription complex, we analyzed the kinetic progress of transcript elongation on the tR1 deletion templates described. Fig. 5 shows the products of an in vitro transcription reaction in which the progress of the transcription complex can be followed in terms of the discrete RNA products synthesized at particular intervals. Although analysis of transcriptional pausing is approximate at best on such templates of unequal length in which different multiple early pause sites lead to asynchronous later pausing at relevant transcription stop points, it can be seen that polymerases continued to make substantial pauses at all three tR1 subsites on each deletion template. A critical aspect of Rho's termination activity is the ability to make stable ATP-independent interactions with nascent transcripts. A filter binding assay developed by Ceruzzi and Richardson (36Ceruzzi M.A. Bektesh S.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9412-9418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the nature of the defects in termination associated with the tR1 deletions described. Rho bound wild-typecro messages extended to the third tR1 subsite with the previously established high affinity (TableI) (33Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ΔrutA deletion reduced Rho's apparent Ka for the RNA approximately 9-fold, whereas ΔrutB resulted in a more modest 3-fold decrease (Table I). Deletion of boxB had little effect on Rho's ability to bind the corresponding transcript, whereas theΔrutA-B deletion reduced Rho binding approximately 13-fold, similar to a more extensive rut deletion previously characterized (ΔAR70; Ref. 33Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As well as being required for a high affinity Rho-cro interaction, addition of the 23rutA nucleotides in their native context immediately downstream of the cro coding sequence was sufficient to allow high affinity Rho binding of transcripts truncated at thecro stop codon (data not shown).Table IBinding dissociation constants, free energies, and ATPase activation with λ cro RNAsRNAKdΔG°′ΔΔGATPasekcataMolar rates of ATP hydrolyzed/mol of Rho hexamer, determined with 20 nm RNA and 4.3 nm Rho.nmkcal/mols−1cro wild-type0.07 ± 0.01−14.364ΔboxB0.1 ± 0.01−14.20.160ΔrutA0.95 ± 0.17−12.81.521ΔrutB0.3 ± 0.05−13.50.735ΔrutA-B1.3 ± 0.5−12.51.85The Kd values were determined in a solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol.

ΔΔGrepresents ΔG°′ mutant − ΔG°′ wild-type. Table I also presents values for the free energies associated with the formation of Rho-RNA complexes and the changes in the free energy of this interaction related to deletion of rut site sequences. Of the total increase in free energy associated with deletion of the entire rut region, ∼70% can be accounted for by therutA deletion, ∼30% by the rutB deletion and <5% by the boxB deletion. These differences correlate very well with reduced termination at mutant tR1 terminators lacking the corresponding rut sequences. In addition to binding to the nascent transcript, interactions between Rho and RNA that are coupled to ATP hydrolysis are necessary for Rho-dependent transcription termination (37Howard B. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2520-2524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Galluppi G.R. Lowery C. Richardson J.P. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 657-665Google Scholar). The ability of a transcript to elicit this type of productive interaction can be assessed by the degree to which it can activate ATP hydrolysis by Rho when the RNA is present at a concentration well above the Kd for dissociation of the Rho-RNA complex. As shown by the data in Table I, Rho had virtually no ATPase activity with the ΔrutA-B RNA as a cofactor and only partial activity with other rut site deletion RNAs as cofactors; again the reduction in ATPase activity was well correlated with the reduced termination activity of the corresponding mutant tR1 terminators. We have shown that the rut sequences of λ tR1 are necessary for efficient terminator function in vivo. As these sequence elements were identified from studies of transcription termination in vitro, our results establish their central role in transcription termination in E. coli in the presence of all accessory transcription factors and in the normal context of coupled translation of the nascent cro mRNA. With our assay system, we found that the in vivo termination efficiency at tR1 was 70–80%, which is at the high end of what has been previously reported when various other methods were used to measure in vivo tR1 function (18Dambly-Chaudiere C. Gottesman M. Debouck C. Adhya S. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 45-56PubMed Google Scholar, 19Warren F. Das A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3612-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Robert J. Slaon S.B. Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. Robledo R. Harbrecht D.

Biol. 1980; 138: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the relatively greater efficiency of termination at tR1 as we determined it may represent a more accurate assessment with our assay system, the possibility remains that differences at the 5′-end of thecro mRNA related to the substitution ofaraPBAD for PR influenced terminator function. Although all fusions were made such that transcripts contained the entire cro open reading frame and native Shine-Dalgarno sequence, possible upstream structural differences would still have the potential to affect the efficiency of translation initiation and therefore interactions between Rho and the nascentcro transcript. However, whereas these differences, as well as the specific choice of host genetic background and culture conditions, have the potential to alter the absolute level of termination at wild-type tR1, such effects would not be expected to prevent the determination of the relative termination defects in the deletion mutants studied. The tR1 rut region encodes two single-stranded RNA regions, which are interrupted by the small boxB RNA hairpin (40Faus I. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar small hairpin structures were previously shown to be a conserved component among Rho-binding RNAs affinity-selected from a large pool of random sequence RNAs (41Schneider D. Gold I. Platt T. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found thatboxB can be deleted with essentially no effect on termination efficiency at tR1, and without reducing Rho's affinity forcro RNA. Thus, the boxB hairpin structure is not an important component of the RNA-binding region of tR1. Of the two remaining components of the rut region, the upstream rutA was more important than rutB for both terminator function and in terms of the contribution of each to the binding affinity of Rho for the cro RNA. The RNA region encoded by rutA is much richer in cytidylate residues than that encoded by rutB (see Fig. 2), confirming the importance of this residue in both terminator function (11Hart C.M.

Cell. 1991; 64: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and binding of Rho to RNA (43Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 44McSwiggen J.A. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RutA also contains a boxA sequence (45Friedman D.I. Olson E.R. Cell. 1983; 34: 143-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which differs by only a single residue from a consensus motif that has been shown to bind the NusB-S10 complex (46Nodwell J.R. Greenblatt J. Cell. 1993; 72: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Deletions of rutAand upstream sequences that had the greatest effect on termination also eliminated boxA, and 5′ nucleotides specifically proposed as capable of binding an unidentified “inhibitory host factor” in λ N-mediated antitermination (3Friedman D.I. Court D.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 47Patterson T.A. Zhang Z. Baker T. Johnson L. Friedman D.I. Court D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Rho is this host factor but do not rule out the possibility that Rho is also a competitor for the same RNA site as the NusB-S10 complex and an unidentified inhibitor of antitermination. Although such host factor-nutR interactions have the potential to modulate Rho interactions at tR1, the finding that the relative contributions ofrutA and rutB to the terminator function were the same in vitro and in vivo suggests that if NusB-S10 or other cellular factors are binding to sites in therut region, they are doing so in a way that does not alter the relative recognition of those segments by Rho. The E. coli trp t′ terminator, like λ tR1, is capable of remaining partially functional despite significant deletion of upstream regions (48Zalatan F. Galloway-Salvo J. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17051-17056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This bacterial terminator was, however, much more resilient to deletions of the size that our results show drastically reduce termination at tR1, and no single region of trp t′ appeared to be required for efficient termination under the conditions examined (48Zalatan F. Galloway-Salvo J. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17051-17056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). trp t′ therefore appears to contain a greater redundancy of sequence necessary for productive interaction with Rho than does tR1. Our results confirm the previous finding of Faus and Richardson (33Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the deletion of the rut region causes a surprisingly small change in the binding affinity of Rho for the isolated full-length cro transcript, yet results in a nearly complete loss of termination and ATPase cofactor activity of the encoded transcript. One explanation for the apparently small difference in binding affinities is that Rho makes a number of different kinds of nonproductive interactions with the rut deletion RNAs that are comparable with the complexes a repressor protein makes with nonoperator DNA sites. The overall binding affinity of Rho for an RNA lacking a rut site would therefore represent the sum of separate weak interactions at a large number of different nonspecific sites. In that case, the true difference in energy between Rho complexed with a single nonspecific site and Rho binding a specificrut site is probably much greater than the 2 kcal/mol that we calculated by comparison of the ability of Rho to bind full-lengthcro RNAs with and without the rut sites. cro RNAs that lack rut sequences are unable to activate significant Rho ATP hydrolysis even when they are present at a concentration that is well above the Kd for the Rho-RNA binding interaction. This observation suggests that the complexes that do form with the nonspecific sites do not appear to have the RNA positioned correctly for subsequent ATP-dependent interactions. Hence, these nonspecific interactions that do form do not lead to ATP hydrolysis or the processes coupled to ATP hydrolysis that lead to the disruption of the RNA-DNA helix in the transcription complex (49Steinmetz E.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 50Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The rut site thus appears to serve two roles; it provides a strong attachment site for Rho, and it positions the RNA on the protein for the ATP-dependent reactions that result in transcription termination."
https://openalex.org/W2046158544,"Arfaptin 1, a approximately 39-kDa protein based on the deduced amino acid sequence, had been initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using dominant active ARF3 (Q71L) as bait with an HL-60 cDNA library. It was suggested that arfaptin 1 may be involved in Golgi functions, since the FLAG-tagged protein was associated with Golgi membranes when expressed in COS-7 cells and could be bound to Golgi in vitro in an ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)- and GTPgammaS-dependent, brefeldin A-inhibited fashion. Arfaptin 2, found in the same two-hybrid screen as arfaptin 1, is 60% identical in amino acid sequence and may or may not have an analogous function. We now report some effects of arfaptin 1 on ARF activation of phospholipase D and cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase. Arfaptin 1 inhibited activation of both enzymes in a concentration-dependent manner and was without effect in the absence of ARF. Two ARF1 mutants that activated the toxin, one lacking 13 N-terminal amino acids and the other, in which 73 residues at the N terminus were replaced with the analogous sequence from ARL1, were not inhibited by arfaptin, consistent with the conclusion that arfaptin interaction requires the N terminus of ARF. This region has also been implicated in phospholipase D activation, but whether the two proteins interact with the same structural elements in ARF remains to be determined. Arfaptin inhibition of the action of ARF5 and ARF6 was less than that of ARF1 and ARF3; its effects were less on nonmyristoylated than myristoylated ARFs. Arfaptin effects on guanine nucleotide binding by ARFs were minimal whether or not a purified ARF guanine nucleotide-exchange protein was present. These findings indicate that arfaptin acts as an inhibitor of ARF actions in vitro, raising the possibility that it has a similar role in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2100046013,"We have studied the interaction of the menaquinol analog 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HOQNO) with dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC) and the effect of a mutation in the DmsC subunit (DmsABCH65R) using fluorescence titration and stopped-flow methods. The titration data show that the HOQNO fluorescence is quenched when HOQNO binds to DmsABC. The binding stoichiometry is determined to be about 1:1.

Escherichia coli is capable of growing anaerobically by inducing specialized respiratory chains that consist of a group of primary dehydrogenases, an intermediate electron carrier (menaquinone or ubiquinone), and a series of terminal reductases. Dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DmsABC) 1The abbreviations used are: DmsABCdimethyl sulfoxide reductaseHOQNO2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxideNQNO2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxideMQH2menaquinolEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. is one of the terminal reductases (1Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This membrane-associated heterotrimer contains a catalytic subunit with a molybdenum cofactor (DmsA, 87.4 kDa), an electron-transfer subunit with four [4Fe-4S] clusters (DmsB, 23.1 kDa), and a membrane-intrinsic anchor subunit (DmsC, 30.8 kDa) (3Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). dimethyl sulfoxide reductase 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide 2-n-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide menaquinol electron paramagnetic resonance 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. DmsC is a hydrophobic polypeptide that traverses eight times and anchors the DmsAB dimer to the membrane (4Weiner J.H. Shaw G. Turner R.J. Trieber C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3238-3244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is involved in menaquinol (MQH2) binding and oxidation, and in electron transport. DmsABC is able to draw electrons from the menaquinol pool to DmsC and transfer them through DmsB to the catalytic subunit, DmsA. In a recent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study (5Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it was shown that DmsCH65 is involved in MQH2 binding and oxidation. It was suggested that a mutation of the DmsC subunit, DmsCH65R, may block binding of the MQH2 analog HOQNO to the protein. However, there was no direct observation available about this possible blockage of HOQNO binding. For another terminal reductase, fumarate reductase, it has been reported that there are two separate MQH2 binding sites located in subunits C and D of the enzyme, respectively (6Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 19560-19567Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 7Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cecchini G. Sices H. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4587-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MQH2 binding affinity of the site in subunit D is higher than that of the site in subunit C. For DmsABC, however, the number and the location of MQH2 binding site(s) have not been determined. HOQNO is a structural analog of MQH2, and it is known as a classical inhibitor of the mitochondrial cytochrome creductase. An earlier study showed that the fluorescence of HOQNO was completely quenched by binding to submitochondrial particles of beef heart (9van Ark G. Berden J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 459: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the inhibition of electron transfer by HOQNO was caused by binding to the specific binding site. Fluorescence quenching was also observed when an HOQNO analog, NQNO, bound to the mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase (10Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NQNO is a specific inhibitor of the inner facing quinone-reaction center (Qi) of the mitochondrial cytochrome creductase. The fluorescence of HOQNO has provided a convenient means for studying HOQNO binding and inhibition reactions. It is expected, therefore, that a fluorescence spectroscopic study of the interaction of HOQNO with DmsABC could provide useful information for determining the number and the location of MQH2 binding site(s) in DmsABC. In this paper, we examine the binding stoichiometry and kinetics for the interaction of HOQNO with DmsABC using fluorescence titration and stopped-flow methods. We show that HOQNO binds to DmsABC with approximately 1:1 stoichiometry and the interaction can be described by a two-step equilibrium model. We also provide evidence that a mutation of the DmsC subunit, DmsABCH65R, blocks the binding of the MQH2 analog HOQNO to the protein as suggested recently in an EPR study (5Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). E. coli HB101 [supE44 hsdS20 2(rB− mB− ) recA13 ara-14 proA2 lacY1 galK2 rpsL20 xyl-5 mtl-1] (11Boyer H.W. Roulland-Dussoix D. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar) was used for expression of wild-type and mutant DmsABC. For overexpression of DmsABC and DmsABCH65R, bacteria were transformed with pDMS160 and pDMS160-H65R, respectively (5Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Trieber C.A.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were grown anaerobically in 20-liter batches at 37 °C on a glycerol-fumarate minimal medium for 48 h as described previously (15Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested using a Pellicon membrane system (16Weiner J.H. MacIssac D.P. Bishop R.E. Bilous P.T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), washed, lysed by passage through a French pressure cell, and subjected to differential centrifugation. The isolated membranes were resuspended in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −70 °C until use (12Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay in the presence of 1% SDS using a Bio-Rad serum albumin protein standard (17Markwell M.A.D. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5328) Google Scholar). The concentration of DmsABC was calculated from the total concentration of [4Fe-4S] clusters measured by the EPR spin quantitation and by assuming that there are four [4Fe-4S] clusters per DmsABC molecule (18Paulsen K.E. Stankovich M.T. Orville A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 396-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Cammack R. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8410-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HOQNO was obtained from Sigma. The concentration of HOQNO was determined spectrophotometrically after diluting the ethanolic stock solution in 1 mm sodium hydroxide using an extinction coefficient of 9450m−1 cm−1 at 346 nm (20Cornforth J.W. James A.T. Biochem. J. 1956; 63: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. The fluorescence emission spectrum of HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) exhibits a maximum at 479 nm with the excitation at 341 nm (data not shown). In fluorescence titration experiments, aliquots of a 50 μmHOQNO stock solution were added to the cuvette containing the protein in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), and fluorescence emissions were measured at 479 nm (with excitation at 341 nm). The background fluorescence of the protein sample in the absence of HOQNO was subtracted from the fluorescence of the sample in the presence of HOQNO. The stopped-flow experiments were performed using a Sequential Bio SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK). In a typical experiment, DmsABC or DmsABCH65R (1 or 2 μm) in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) was mixed with an equal volume of various concentrations of HOQNO (1–14 μm) in the same buffer. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The fluorescence of HOQNO was excited at 341 nm, and the emissions above 400 nm were recorded through a cut off filter SGG-400-1.00 (CVI Laser Co., Albuquerque, NM). For each concentration of HOQNO, at least three runs were performed and 1000 or 2000 data points were collected. After averaging, data were fitted to an appropriate equation using the software supplied by Applied Photophysics. Under our experimental conditions, quenching of HOQNO fluorescence by binding to DmsABC was biphasic, and the observed fluorescence, F, was best fitted to a double exponential equation, F=Afe−kft+Ase−kst+bEquation 1 where Af and As are the amplitudes of the fast and slow phase, and kf andks are the observed rates for the fast and slow phase, respectively, t is time and b is an off set value of the stopped-flow instrument. The interaction of HOQNO with DmsABC can be described by the following model (21Halford S.E. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 187-286Google Scholar, 23Hammes G.G. Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation. Academic Press, New York1982: 61-75Crossref Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”), E+L⇌k2k1EL⇌k4k3EL*Equation 2 where E represents DmsABC; L, the ligand (HOQNO); EL, the initial complex of DmsABC with HOQNO before the isomerization takes place; EL*, the final complex product; k1 and k3 are the rate constants for the forward reactions inm−1 s−1 and s−1, respectively, and k2 andk4 are the rate constants for the reverse reactions in s−1. In the case where the bimolecular process is much faster than the unimolecular process and the initial concentration of L is much higher than the concentration ofE, the observed first-order rates for the fast phase (kf) and the slow phase (ks) are given by Equations 3 and 4, respectively, kf=k2+k1[L]Equation 3 ks=k4+k3/1+Kd1/[L]Equation 4 where Kd1 =k2/k1 is the dissociation constant of the first equilibrium in Equation 2. Under our experimental conditions, the plot of HOQNO fluorescence against the concentration of HOQNO was linear up to 7 μmof HOQNO (after mixing) (data not shown). This was, therefore, the highest concentration of HOQNO used in this work. Toward the low end of the HOQNO concentrations used herein, the condition that initial concentration of L is much higher than the concentration ofE (0.5 μm after mixing) does not hold. However, the observed first-order rates for the fast phase,kf, can still be analyzed using Equation 3 as demonstrated by Halford (21Halford S.E. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From the fit of the observed kf data to Equation 3,k1 and k2 can be obtained. Under our experimental conditions, deviations of the observedks were too large to be fitted to Equation 4 to yield reliable k3 and k4. To evaluate the values of k3 andk4, another approach using the Glint program (Applied Photophysics) was employed. This program enables one to globally analyze a complete data set measured at all wavelengths according to a proposed reaction scheme and to obtain the reaction parameters from the best fit of the calculated data to the experimental data. Kinetic data irrelevant of wavelength (the case of this work) or measured at a single wavelength can also be analyzed using this program. In this work, using the reaction scheme (Equation 2), and thek1 and k2 determined from Equation 3, kinetic traces measured at various HOQNO concentrations were analyzed using the Glint program, and the values ofk3 and k4 were evaluated from the good fits of the calculated kinetic traces to the observed traces. The binding of HOQNO to DmsABC was examined by measuring the HOQNO fluorescence emission (at 479 nm with excitation at 341 nm) in the absence and in the presence of DmsABC. In the absence of DmsABC, the plot of fluorescence measured by titrating the buffer (100 mm MOPS and 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.0) against the concentration of HOQNO gave a straight line with a positive slope as shown in Fig.1 A. This fluorescence was attributed to free HOQNO molecules (not bound to other compounds). In the presence of DmsABC, however, the initial portion of each titration curve was flat (Fig. 1 A), indicating that there was no increase of fluorescence intensity upon the addition of a certain concentration of HOQNO to the protein. In other words, there was no free HOQNO present in the system to emit fluorescence. It was clear that the fluorescence of HOQNO was quenched in the presence of DmsABC and this quenching was because of HOQNO binding to DmsABC. Further addition of HOQNO to the protein caused a sudden increase of fluorescence intensity, suggesting that free HOQNO became available when the amount of HOQNO added to the protein was higher than a certain concentration at a given concentration of DmsABC. It was not possible to construct a Scatchard plot from the titration data in Fig. 1 A because of the sharp transition of the titration curves. To obtain the stoichiometry of HOQNO binding to DmsABC, four concentrations of DmsABC (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 μm) were titrated with HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.0 (Fig. 1 A). The extrapolations of the linear portions of the titration curves to zero fluorescence yield four intercepts on the x-axis of the plot. These intercepts represent the concentrations of HOQNO bound to DmsABC at the given concentrations of DmsABC. Therefore, from the plot of the intercepts against the concentration of DmsABC, Fig.1 B, the stoichiometry of HOQNO binding to DmsABC can be determined to be approximately 1:1. It has been suggested in a recent EPR study (5Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that residue His-65 in the DmsC subunit may be involved in MQH2binding and a His to Arg mutation, DmsABCH65R, may block binding the MQH2 analog HOQNO to the protein. To verify this, titrations of 0.4 μm wild-type DmsABC and mutant DmsABCH65R with HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) were carried out and the data obtained were compared as shown in Fig. 2. For the wild-type protein, the initial portion of the titration curve was flat indicating quenching of HOQNO fluorescence because of HOQNO binding to the protein. Further increase of HOQNO concentration caused a sharp increase of fluorescence intensity. For the mutant DmsABCH65R, however, the titration data gave a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that there was no quenching of HOQNO fluorescence. In other words, in the case of titration of DmsABCH65R, the HOQNO added to the protein was in the free form and not bound to the protein. Fig. 2, thus, demonstrates that the mutation of DmsABCH65R blocks HOQNO binding to the protein. To investigate the kinetics and mechanism of the interaction of HOQNO with DmsABC, the stopped-flow fast kinetic technique was employed. Fig.3 shows a plot of the observed fluorescence intensities against the concentration of HOQNO obtained by mixing various concentrations of HOQNO in buffer of 100 mmMOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) with the same buffer or with 2 μm wild-type DmsABC (in the buffer). After mixing the protein with HOQNO, a decrease of fluorescence intensity with time was observed as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 indicating quenching of HOQNO fluorescence. The magnitude of the initial fluorescence intensity measured immediately after mixing HOQNO with DmsABC was very similar to the magnitude of the fluorescence intensity measured in the absence of the protein, indicating that no detectable reaction occurred during the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument. The same results were also obtained by mixing 1 μm of DmsABC with various concentrations of HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mmEDTA (pH 7.0) under the conditions in Figs. 5 B and 6 (data not shown). On the other hand, for the final fluorescence intensity measured 50 s after mixing, the initial portion of the curve was flat and the intercept on the x-axis (about 1 μm) obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to zero fluorescence was in good agreement with the 1:1 binding stoichiometry obtained under the steady-state conditions (Figs. 1 and2). Fig. 3 demonstrates that the fluorescence quenching observed after mixing HOQNO with DmsABC is because of HOQNO binding to the protein.Figure 5Kinetic analysis of fluorescence quenching because of the interaction of HOQNO with DmsABC.

Fig. 4 shows the plot of the fluorescence intensities against the concentration of HOQNO obtained by mixing 2 μm mutant DmsABCH65Rwith various concentrations of HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). In contrast to Fig. 3, the plot of the initial fluorescence intensity (measured immediately after mixing) and the final fluorescence intensity (measured 50 s after mixing) against the concentration of HOQNO gave two straight lines that not only had the same slope but also overlapped each other within experimental error. Clearly, there was no significant quenching of HOQNO fluorescence in this case. Fig. 4 indicates that the mutation of DmsABCH65R blocks HOQNO binding to the protein, which agrees with the steady-state titration data (Fig. 2). Furthermore, this result serves as a good control for the stopped-flow experiment, confirming that the nonlinear feature of the curve for the final fluorescence intensity in Fig. 3 is not because of an artifact. As shown in Fig. 3, binding HOQNO to DmsABC causes a quenching of HOQNO fluorescence, and this quenching process can be followed using the stopped-flow method. To further investigate the kinetics of HOQNO binding to DmsABC, 1 μm DmsABC was rapidly mixed with various concentrations of HOQNO using the stopped-flow method. Fig.5 A shows a typical trace of fluorescence quenching observed after mixing 1 μm of DmsABC with 2 μm HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.0 (25 °C) and the residuals for fitting these data to Equation 1. The fluorescence quenching process was completed about 50 s after mixing. The observed quenching trace had two phases, a fast phase followed by a slow phase, and it was best fitted with the double exponential equation, Equation 1. This was also true at other HOQNO concentrations used in this work (Fig.5 B). From the fit, the observed first-order rates and the amplitudes for the fast and slow phase at the given concentration of HOQNO, kf, ks,Af, and As, can be determined. The first-order rate for the fast phase (kf) observed by mixing 1 μm DmsABC with various concentrations of HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mmEDTA at pH 7.0 (25 °C) was plotted against the concentration of HOQNO and the data obtained were fitted to Equation 3 as shown in Fig.5 B, from which the rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions of the first equilibrium in Equation 2 were determined to be k1 = (3.9 ± 0.3) × 105m−1 s−1 andk2 = 0.10 ± 0.01 s−1respectively. Thus the dissociation constant for the first equilibrium,Kd1 =k2/k1, was calculated to be about 260 nm. The rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions of the second equilibrium in Equation 2, k3 andk4, were evaluated with the Glint program (Applied Photophysics). Using the reaction scheme described in Equation2, and the k1 (=3.9 × 105m−1 s−1) andk2 (= 0.10 s−1) determined from the fit as shown in Fig. 5 B, k3 = 0.40 ± 0.04 s−1 and k4 ≤ 0.01 s−1 were obtained from the good fits of the calculated kinetic traces to the observed traces (data not shown). Therefore, the association constant of the second equilibrium,Ka2 =k3/k4 ≥ 40, was obtained. The upper limit of the overall dissociation constant for Equation 2 was thus estimated to be about 6 nm,i.e. Kdoverall =Kd1/(1 +Ka2) ≤ 6 nm. To investigate the effect of the ligand (HOQNO) concentration on the kinetics of HOQNO binding to DmsABC, the amplitudes for the fast phase (Af) and the slow phase (As) were plotted against the concentration of HOQNO (Fig.6). The Af andAs were obtained by mixing 1 μm DmsABC with various concentrations of HOQNO in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA at pH 7.0 (25 °C) and by fitting the observed traces with Equation 1. The amplitude for the fast phase increased with the increase of HOQNO concentration up to about 4 μm then became saturated, whereas the amplitude for the slow phase increased initially with HOQNO concentration up to 1 μm and then it started to decrease with the increase of HOQNO concentration. In bacterial anaerobic electron transport menaquinol shuttles reducing equivalents from the primary dehydrogenases to the terminal reductases within the cytoplasmic membrane. However, relatively little is known about the interaction of menaquinol with these enzymes. In this study, we have utilized direct steady state and rapid reaction methodologies to investigate the binding of a fluorescent analog of menaquinol to DmsABC. We have shown that HOQNO interacts with very high affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry at a site within the DmsC subunit. Mutation of His-65 to Arg in DmsC blocks quinol activity and eliminates HOQNO binding. Our finding of only one exchangeable binding site, by direct measurement, differs from studies with fumarate reductase (6Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), where two quinol binding sites have been proposed by indirect methods. In the stopped-flow studies, the biphasic nature of the observed quenching process and the nonlinear increase of the observed slow rate (ks) with HOQNO concentration reaching a plateau at higher concentrations of HOQNO (data not shown) suggest that the two-step mechanism (Equation 2) (21Halford S.E. Biochem. J. 1975; 149: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 187-286Google Scholar, 23Hammes G.G. Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation. Academic Press, New York1982: 61-75Crossref Google Scholar), a fast bimolecular process followed by a slow unimolecular process, can be applied to describe the quenching process resulting from binding HOQNO to DmsABC. In this mechanism, it is assumed that a loosely bound complex of the HOQNO (L) with DmsABC (E), EL, is formed rapidly by a bimolecular association and then it is converted to a more tightly and specifically bound complex, EL*, by a slow unimolecular process (isomerization). The isomerization may take place through several possible pathways, such as rearrangement ofEL without any conformational change in E orL, a conformational change in either E orL, or conformational changes in both E andL (22Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979: 187-286Google Scholar). It is expected that stopped-flow kinetic studies can provide some useful information about the bimolecular association of HOQNO with DmsABC and the subsequent isomerization process. The effect of HOQNO concentration on the amplitudes of the fast and slow phase may be interpreted as follows. When the concentration of HOQNO is lower than or comparable with the dissociation constant of the first equilibrium in Equation 2, Kd1, but higher than the overall dissociation constant, only a small amount of protein is associated with the ligand (HOQNO) to form the complex EL by the fast bimolecular process, which is observed as a fast phase of quenching. The subsequent slow isomerization process of convertingEL to EL* would shift the first equilibrium in Equation 2 to the right-hand side slowly. This slow shift of the first equilibrium is observed as a subsequent slow phase of quenching. Alternatively, when the concentration of HOQNO is increased to higher than Kd1, more and more DmsABC molecules are associated with HOQNO to give EL through the fast bimolecular process, thus, less and less free DmsABC molecules are available for the subsequent shift of the first equilibrium to the right-hand side caused by the slow isomerization process. Therefore, the amplitude of the observed fast phase of quenching increases with increase of HOQNO concentration until becoming saturated, whereas the observed slow phase of quenching decreases with increase of HOQNO concentration, and this would finally result in that the amplitude of the slow phase would be negligible compared with the amplitude of the fast phase. These results suggest that the quenching of HOQNO fluorescence occurs in the bimolecular step of the association ofE with L rather than in the unimolecular step of forming EL* (see Equation 2). Primary dehydrogenases and terminal reductases have been the subject of a large number of steady-state kinetic investigations (see Refs. 24Giordani R. Buc J. Cornish-Bowden A. Cardenas M.L. Eur. J.

We have now shown that fluorescent HOQNO can be used to monitor the quinol binding reaction. Although the steady-state methodology is useful for stoichiometry, the affinity is so tight that Scatchard plots are not useful. The stopped-flow method allows determination of rates and dissociation constants. Although the three-dimensional structures of several quinone-binding proteins have been determined (32Roy C.

https://openalex.org/W2141265048,"The thermal stability and domain interactions in the mannitol transporter from Escherichia coli, enzyme IImtl, have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry. To this end, the wild type enzyme, IICBAmtl, as well as IICBmtl and IICmtl, were reconstituted into a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer. The changes in the gel to liquid crystalline transition of the lipid indicated that the protein was inserted into the membrane, disturbing a total of approximately 40 lipid molecules/protein molecule. The thermal unfolding profile of EIImtl exhibited three separate transitions, two of which were overlapping, that could be assigned to structural domains in the protein. Treatment with trypsin, resulting in the degradation of the water-soluble part of the enzyme while leaving the binding and translocation capability of the enzyme intact, resulted in a decrease of the Tm and enthalpy of unfolding of the membrane-embedded C domain. This effect was much more apparent in the presence of the substrate but only partly so in the presence of the substrate analog perseitol. These results are consistent with a recently proposed model (Meijberg, W., Schuurman-Wolters, G. K., and Robillard, G. T. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7949–7946), in which the B domain takes part in the conformational changes during the substrate binding process."

In particular, the photoresponse in Drosophila was found to be absolutely dependent on PLC activity. Until recently, it was thought that IP3 is the second messenger involved in the photoresponse in invertebrates because a brief injection of IP3 mimicked the quantal response to light (4Brown J.E. Rubin L.J. Ghalayni A.J. Tarver A.P. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Anderson R.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 5Fein A. Payne R. Corson D.W. Berridge M.J.

More recent evidence, however, indicates that the mechanism is more complex. For example, many contradictions arise if Ca2+/Na+ exchange is assumed to be the only mechanism involved in phototransduction: 1) the light response precedes the rise in Ca2+ (1Hardie R.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), 2) excitation occurs in the absence of an IP3-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ in Limulus (17Faddis M.N. Brown J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 909-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), 3) abrupt Ca2+elevation using caged Ca2+ fails to activate any channels in Drosophila photoreceptor membrane (18Hardie R.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 889-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 4) theDrosophila mutant deficient in IP3 receptors still produces the native photoresponse (19Acharya J.K. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Hartenstein V. Zucker C.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cGMP induces an inward current in photoreceptor cells in Limulus (20Johnson E.C. Robinson P.R. Lisman J.E. Nature. 1986; 324: 468-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) andDrosophila (21Bacigalupo J. Bautista D.M. Brink D.L. Hetzer J.F. O'Day P.M. J.

A. 1991; 88: 7938-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is still uncertain, however, whether intracellular cGMP concentration is altered by light (23Brown J.E. Kaupp U.B. Malbon C.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1984; 353: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Saibil H.R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Brown J.E. Faddis M. Combs A. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity of the system is the possibility of second messenger cross-talk between IP3, Ca2+, and cyclic nucleotides to activate intracellular chemical cascades (26Gomez M.P. Nasi E. Neuron. 1995; 15: 607-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hermissenda provide an ideal animal model in which to examine invertebrate visual transduction mechanisms. The photoreceptors are relatively large (50 μm in diameter) and are well characterized electrophysiologically (27Dennis M. J.

They possess two types of photoreceptors: A and B (28Alkon D.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 61: 444-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Alkon D.L. J. Gen Physiol. 1976; 67: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor B responds to a bright flash with a complex potential change involving an initial depolarization, a hyperpolarization, and a depolarizing tail, corresponding to a rapid and transient Na+ conductance increase, a slower increase in K+ permeability, and a delayed decrease in K+ permeability, respectively (32Detweiler P.B. J. Physiol. 1976; 256: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The initial Na+ current appears to be the primary phototransduction event because 1) following light adaptation, light flashes produce only the hyperpolarization component (32Detweiler P.B. J. Physiol. 1976; 256: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and 2) the hyperpolarization is Ca2+-dependent (33Grossman Y. Schmidt J.A. Alkon D.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 68A: 487-494Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) andHermissenda photoreceptors respond to single photons even in TTX containing, low Ca2+ high Mg2+ solution (34Takeda T. Vision Res. 1982; 22: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our previous work also indicates that the photoresponse may be generated through a TTX-resistant Na+ channel (36Alkon D.L. Sakakibara M. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 983-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on investigating the second messengers underlying the initial Na+ current component of the photoresponse. Recently, channels directly gated by IP3have been described in other cell lines (37Hatt H. Ache B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38Honda E. Teeter J.H. Restrepo D. Brain Res. 1995; 703: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), including Na+ channels in rat megakaryocytes (39Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16638-16644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the native photoresponse in Hermissenda is generated by an IP3-gated Na+ channel. To further characterize the role of IP3 and the possible role of cGMP, cAMP, and Ca2+ in invertebrate phototransduction, the effects of injection of these second messengers were examined electrophysiologically in Type B photoreceptors ofHermissenda. Hermissenda crassicornis obtained from the Sea Life Supply (Sand City, CA) were maintained in artificial sea water (ASW) at 14 °C. Type B photoreceptors were dissected in ASW (430 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Dissection and intracellular recording were performed as described previously (13Sakakibara M. Alkon D.L. Kouchi T. Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). cGMP, cAMP, and IP3 (Sigma) were dissolved in intracellular solution (67 mm sodium acetate, 400 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1 mm. Isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with intracellular solution to 1 mm. The intracellular solution alone or with Me2SO had no effect on the photoresponse. A microelectrode containing the drug was inserted into the photoreceptor cell, and the drug was injected using a pressure injector (Medical System, Greenvale, NY) at 30.0 p.s.i. for 200 ms. In some experiments the drug was iontophoresed into the photoreceptor for at least 3 min with DC current of 2.5 nA, after 10 min of dark adaptation. A photoresponse was elicited every 90 s during the entire experimental period to keep the adaptation level constant. Unattenuated light of 34.0 μW/cm2 at 550 nm delivered from a halogen lamp source was administered to the underside of the preparation. Isolated Hermissenda eyes were incubated in 10 μl of ASW containing 10 μCi of [3H]inositol (Amersham International) in darkness at 23 °C for 16 h. Then one eye of each pair was exposed to light for 30 s. The incubation was stopped by adding chloroform/methanol/12 n HCl (200:100:0.75), and PIP2 standard was added as a carrier and to aid in the identification of the lipids. Phospholipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (9Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Hotta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Lipids were visualized with I2 vapor, and appropriate bands were scraped and counted. PIP2-PLC activity was assayed using the particulate fraction obtained from theHermissenda circumesophageal nervous system as described previously (13Sakakibara M. Alkon D.L. Kouchi T. Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The IP3-evoked response was highly dependent on the distance between the injection site and the rhabdomeric membrane, the light-sensitive region (Fig.1 a). Immediately after IP3 was injected into a microvilli of the Type B photoreceptor close to the rhabdomeric membrane, a large transient response was observed (Fig. 1 a). No response was observed after injection approximately 10 μm away from the photosensitive region. The latency of the photoresponse decreased with increasing light intensity (Fig. 1 b). With low light intensity, the rate of rise and the peak amplitude of the photoresponse were low. With increased light intensity, a more complex response was observed, consisting of an initial depolarization, a hyperpolarization, and a depolarizing tail, consistent with previous reports (32Detweiler P.B. J. Physiol. 1976; 256: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first component was because of a rapid and transient Na+conductance increase, the hyperpolarization was because of a slow increase in K+ permeability, and the depolarizing tail was because of a slow decrease in K+ permeability (33Grossman Y. Schmidt J.A. Alkon D.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1981; 68A: 487-494Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Na+ current was a graded response, consistent with previous observations in Hermissenda (36Alkon D.L. Sakakibara M. Biophys. J. 1985; 48: 983-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and photoreceptors of other species (40Payne R. Fein A. J. Gen.

The spontaneous firing activity superimposed on the photoresponse is known to arise from the distal portion of the axon and is not involved in the visual transduction process (31Alkon D.L. Grossman Y. J. Neurophysiol. 1978; 41: 1328-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many characteristics of the response to IP3 injection were similar to the response to a relatively weak light flash, including the latency and the generation of action potentials (Fig. 1 c). Simultaneous light flash and IP3 injection were additive (Fig. 1 d). Furthermore, both responses were completely inhibited upon removal of extracellular Na+ (Fig.1 d). Similar to the native photoresponse, the IP3-evoked response was not dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration (data not shown). Successive injection of IP3 resulted in a broadening and a decrease in the amplitude of the first peak and a higher frequency of spontaneous firing. This response mimicked the photoresponse to flickering light stimulation (Fig. 1 e). Flickering light stimulation elicited an increase in the Na+ conductance and a decrease in the hyperpolarization. To examine whether a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+activated the visual transduction channel, Ca2+ (1 mm) was injected into the photosensitive region of the Type B photoreceptor. In contrast to results obtained in Limulus (14Frank T.M. Fein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 697-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), injection of Ca2+ alone did not induce any significant response (Fig.2 a), but when a light flash was applied to the photoreceptor preinjected with Ca2+, the amplitude of the initial peak of the photoresponse and the hyperpolarization were potentiated (Fig. 2 b). This response was similar to the response to an intense light flash shown in Fig. lb. When BAPTA (a Ca2+ chelator; 1 mm) was injected intracellularly prior to a light flash, the latency of the photoresponse increased, and the amplitude decreased (Fig.2 c) and was eventually completely inhibited (data not shown). The decrease in the initial peak of the response may be because of a decline in PLC activity dependent on the levels of cytosolic Ca2+. Next we examined the involvement of PLC in the photoresponse by injecting PLC inhibitors such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and polyamines. Our previous data indicate that neomycin completely inhibits PLC activity in Hermissenda at concentrations higher than 0.1 mm and spermine inhibits PLC activity at concentrations higher than 0.5 mm (13Sakakibara M. Alkon D.L. Kouchi T. Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These suppressive effects are also carefully reconfirmed in this experiment (data not shown). Iontophoretic injection of 1 mm neomycin into Type B photoreceptors caused the response to light to be almost completely abolished 90 s after the injection without a change in the resting membrane potential (Fig. 3 a). The amplitude of the initial depolarization recovered gradually but incompletely. The amplitude of the depolarizing tail did not recover within 5 min after injection (data not shown) but recovered completely within 18 min. Gentamicin and higher concentrations of neomycin produced more prolonged inhibition of the photoresponse (data not shown). Injection of spermine (1 mm) produced a minor suppressive effect on the photoresponse without changing the resting membrane potential (Fig. 3 b). The amplitude of the initial depolarization was suppressed to 50% but recovered to 90% of the control response within 10 min after the injection (Fig.3 b). Injection of spermidine (1 mm), a weaker inhibitor of PLC, produced a smaller (less than 40%) inhibition of the photoresponse (data not shown). Inhibition of the hyperpolarization and the depolarizing tail of the photoresponse by spermine and spermidine is consistent with the fact that these compounds are Ca2+-activated K+ channel blockers (42Nomura K. Naruse K. Watanabe K. Sokabe M. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IBMX is a well characterized phosphodiesterase inhibitor and also a potent blocker of PIP2 synthesis (43Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Takagi M. Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Iontophoretic injection of IBMX transiently suppressed the initial depolarization and the depolarizing tail and was completely reversible within 9 min (Fig.3 c). IBMX also reduced the light-induced Na+current in a similar manner (Fig. 3 d). These results resemble those obtained from the photoreceptor cells of octopus (43Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Takagi M. Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Limulus (23Brown J.E. Kaupp U.B. Malbon C.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1984; 353: 523-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other inhibitors of phosphoinositide metabolism, such as lithium and R59022, also decreased the initial depolarization (13Sakakibara M. Alkon D.L. Kouchi T. Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The order of potency of suppression of the initial depolarization is as follows: gentamicin > neomycin > LiCl > spermine > R59022 > spermidine. Although a significant change in the concentration of cyclic nucleotides in invertebrate photoreceptors during light irradiation has not been observed (25Brown J.E. Faddis M. Combs A. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Takagi M. Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that these cyclic nucleotides are involved in visual transduction (44Feng J.J. Frank T.M. Fein A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Intracellular pressure injection of 1 mm cAMP generated a train of action potentials without a significant change in resting membrane potential (Fig. 4 a). Consistent bursts of action potentials were observed in response to successive injections of cAMP (Fig. 4 b). Successive bursts were not significantly different from the first burst, indicating that the effects of the injection were transient, unlike the effects of IP3, Ca2+, or BAPTA injection. The responses to cAMP injections were abolished in Na+-free ASW, similar to the response to IP3 injection (Fig. 4 b). The response to cAMP inHermissenda also differed from that in Limulus (44Feng J.J. Frank T.M. Fein A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting further that the phototransduction mechanism in Hermissenda is different from the ventral eye in Limulus. Injection of cGMP-induced transient depolarizing responses that were dependent on the distance between the photosensitive area and injection site (Fig. 5 a). Interestingly, only the amplitude of the response, not the latency, was dependent on this distance. In contrast to previous observations inLimulus (20Johnson E.C. Robinson P.R. Lisman J.E. Nature. 1986; 324: 468-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (21Bacigalupo J. Bautista D.M. Brink D.L. Hetzer J.F. O'Day P.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7196-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transient response to injection of cGMP occurred without any change in the resting potential. The time course of the cGMP-induced response was different from that of the native photoresponse; simultaneous stimulation with cGMP injection and light flash resulted in a double-peaked response (Fig. 5 b). We examined the effect of long term iontophoretic injection of cGMP on the photoresponse and found that the photoresponse observed after the injection of cGMP was dramatically reduced compared with the photoresponse before the injection. The initial depolarization was suppressed almost completely after a 3-min cGMP injection but then gradually recovered (Fig. 6 a). This response is consistent with responses recorded previously in light-adapted Type B photoreceptors (32Detweiler P.B. J. Physiol. 1976; 256: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The effect of cGMP or phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the photoresponse has been reported to vary with the extracellular Ca2+concentration (45Johnson E.C. O'Day P.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6586-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (43Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Takagi M. Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we also found that cumulative cGMP, by pretreatment with cGMP via iontophoretic injection, dramatically decreased the photoresponse of light-adapted photoreceptors maintained in normal ASW but enhanced the photoresponse of cells maintained in low Ca2+ ASW (1 mm; Fig.6 b). The inhibitory effect of cGMP recovered after returning to normal ASW (data not shown). The cGMP-induced response was found to be insensitive to changes in extracellular Na+concentration (Fig. 6 c), unlike native photoresponses (Fig.6 e). Moreover, the cGMP-induced response was abolished in Ca2+-free ASW (Fig. 6 d), unlike native photoresponses, which were independent of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6 f). The results of the present study demonstrate for the first time that IP3 may mediate invertebrate visual transduction, particularly in Hermissenda. Although cAMP, cGMP, and Ca2+ have been proposed to activate several types of channels, injection of these second messenger candidates did not reproduce the native photoresponse. In contrast, injections of IP3 produced responses that were very similar to the native photoresponse, whereas Ca2+ acted as a modulator of the photoresponse (46Levy S. Fein A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 805-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that IP3 may be the second messenger involved in visual transduction in Hermissenda is supported by the results of the present study and by results obtained previously: 1) light flashes result in greater increases in intracellular IP3 than cyclic nucleotides (25Brown J.E. Faddis M. Combs A. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and 2) inhibition of PLC activity and reduction of phosphoinositide turnover result in a reduction in the amplitude of the native photoresponse (13Sakakibara M. Alkon D.L. Kouchi T. Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the primary role of IP3 has been considered to be the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, several IP3-gated ion channels have been recently characterized in olfactory cilia (37Hatt H. Ache B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38Honda E. Teeter J.H. Restrepo D. Brain Res. 1995; 703: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and rat megakaryocytes (39Somasundaram B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16638-16644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that IP3 directly activates a transduction channel in Hermissenda. The possibility that IP3 may be a second messenger inDrosophila visual transduction is supported by observations by Inoue et al. (10Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Hotta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that a reduction of PIP2-PLC activity is closely correlated with electrophysiological abnormality in the Drosophilaphototransduction mutant norpA (no receptor potential A) eye. Furthermore, the norpA gene has been shown to encode PLC (11Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 47Toyoshima S. Matsumoto N. Wang P. Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Hotta Y. Osawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14842-14848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yoshioka et al. (43Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Takagi M. Hayashi F. Amakawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 755: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have also reported previously that IBMX inhibits phosphoinositide turnover and that the photoresponse is dependent on PIP2 hydrolysis by PLC in squid photoreceptor. The photoresponse in Limulus has also been shown to be diminished by the injection of the PLC inhibitor neomycin without affecting the response to IP3 (14Frank T.M. Fein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 697-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and by polyamine injection (17Faddis M.N. Brown J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 909-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that IP3produced from PIP2 hydrolysis via PLC activation is an essential component of invertebrate visual transduction. The question remains about whether IP3 acts directly or via Ca2+ in Hermissenda visual transduction. In the present study, injection of Ca2+ into the photoreceptor inHermissenda induced no response in darkness, suggesting that Ca2+ is not directly involved. Furthermore, excitation occurs even in the absence of an IP3-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ in Limulus (17Faddis M.N. Brown J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 909-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and inDrosophila mutants lacking IP3 receptors in photoreceptor cells (19Acharya J.K. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Hartenstein V. Zucker C.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the photoresponse precedes the rise of intracellular Ca2+ inLimulus (48Steive H. Benner S. Vision Res. 1992; 32: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49Ukhanov K.Y. Flores T.M. Hsiao H.S. Mohapatra P. Pitts C.H. Payne R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, Hardie (18Hardie R.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 889-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a transient elevation of Ca2+ using a caged Ca2+compound did not directly excite Drosophila photoreceptors. These results indicate that Ca2+ is unlikely to be directly involved in phototransduction in Drosophila,Hermissenda, and Limulus but may act as a modulator of the photoresponse. Several previous studies indicate that Ca2+ excites photoreceptors (50Payne R. Corson D.W. Fein A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 51Payne R. Corson D.W. Fein A.J. Berridge M.J. J. Gen Physiol. 1986; 88: 127-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 52Shin J. Richard E.A. Lisman J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that the injection of a Ca2+buffer reduced the photoresponse in Limulus (50Payne R. Corson D.W. Fein A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Also, in the present study, reduction of intracellular Ca2+ by a Ca2+ chelator resulted in a reduction of the photoresponse; however, the mechanism underlying this response is presently unclear. It may be because of reduced activation of PLC and a subsequent decrease in IP3; however, a decrease in protein kinase C activity cannot be ruled out. According to Thio and Sontheimer (53Thio C.L. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4889-4897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phorbol esters reduced the peak of the TTX-sensitive Na+current by 25–60% and potentiated the TTX-resistant Na+current by 60–150%. In the present study, the Ca2+-induced increase in the photoresponse was 60–80% of control, which is consistent with the phorbol ester-induced increase in the TTX-resistant Na+ current. Involvement of cyclic nucleotides in visual transduction is also unlikely. The cAMP-evoked response was very different from the light-evoked response; injection of cAMP induced short bursts of Na+-dependent action potentials. Repeated injection evoked trains of similar bursts, indicating that these action potentials may be mediated by fast-inactivating cAMP-sensitive Na+ channels. Interestingly, cGMP-evoked responses were similar to light-evoked responses, but the following differences were observed: the amplitude of the cGMP-evoked responses depended on the distance from the rhabdomeric membrane, but the latency of the response was constant for all trials; the rising phase of the responses to cGMP was faster than that of responses to light; the cGMP-evoked response depended on external Ca2+, whereas the light-evoked response depended on external Na+; and the response induced by long term cGMP injection and the light-evoked response from light-adapted cells were very similar. Taken together, these findings indicate that neither cAMP nor cGMP act as second messengers in invertebrate visual transduction. Thus the results of the present study suggest that the transduction channels of Drosophila and Hermissenda eye may be IP3-gated Na+ channels. Cloning of IP3-gated Na+ channels may help clarify the mechanisms underlying invertebrate visual transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2052258246,"We previously showed that 6-trans isomers of leukotriene B4 but not leukotriene B4itself are converted to dihydro metabolites by human neutrophils. The first step in the formation of these metabolites is oxidation of the 5-hydroxyl group by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase. The objective of the present investigation was to characterize the second step in the formation of the dihydro metabolites, reduction of an olefinic double bond. We found that the olefin reductase reduces the 6,7-double bond of 5-oxoeicosanoids, is localized in the cytosolic fraction of neutrophils, and requires NADPH as a cofactor. Neutrophil cytosol converts a variety of both 5-oxo- and 15-oxoeicosanoids to dihydro products. However, conversion of 5-oxoeicosanoids to their 6,7-dihydro metabolites is inhibited by EGTA and a calmodulin antagonist and stimulated by the addition of calcium and calmodulin, whereas the reduction of 15-oxoeicosanoids to their 13,14-dihydro metabolites is slightly inhibited by calcium. Furthermore, eicosanoid Δ6- and Δ13-reductases could be separated by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose. 5-Oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) is converted by the Δ6-reductase to 6,7-dihydro-5-oxo-ETE, which is 1000 times less potent than 5-oxo-ETE in mobilizing calcium in neutrophils. We conclude that neutrophils contain both 5-oxoeicosanoid Δ6-reductase and prostaglandin Δ13-reductase. Metabolism of 5-oxo-ETE by the Δ6-reductase results in loss of its biological activity.

A major pathway in the metabolism of many eicosanoids is initiated by oxidation of one of the hydroxyl groups by an NAD+- or NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase. This is usually followed by reduction of an adjacent double bond by an olefin reductase in the presence of NADH or NADPH.

These products can then be reduced by cytosolic PG Δ13-reductases to biologically inactive 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-PGs (1;4), which in turn can be further reduced to dihydro-PGs by ketoreductases (5Hamberg M.

Lipoxygenase products can be metabolized by analogous pathways. We have shown that leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is converted to 12-oxo-LTB4 by an NAD+-dependent 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase in neutrophils (6Wainwright S.L. Powell W.S. J. Biol.

This is followed by reduction of the 10,11-double bond by a cytosolic NADH-dependent Δ10-reductase to give 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4, which is then reduced to the corresponding dihydro compound by a ketoreductase (6Wainwright S.L.

However, in this case, the 10,11-dihydro metabolite of 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid has been reported to be a potent proinflammatory agent (12Masferrer J.L. Rimarachin J.A.

However, in the latter case, the 12-hydroxy dehydrogenase is clearly distinct from the neutrophil enzyme (14Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18128-18135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that neutrophils convert 6-trans isomers of LTB4, which are formed nonenzymatically from LTA4, to dihydro metabolites (15Powell W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This reaction proceeds by a sequence analogous to that described above for LTB4, the initial step being oxidation of the 5-hydroxyl group, followed by reduction of one of the double bonds and the oxo group (16Powell W.S. Gravelle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2170-2177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We initially speculated that the dihydro products of these reactions might have been 6,11-dihydro metabolites, due to migration of the two remaining double bonds. However, mass spectral evidence subsequently suggested that the products were 6,7-dihydro metabolites (17Wheelan P. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19845-19852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The initial step in the formation of these substances is oxidation of the 5-hydroxyl group by a microsomal NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase that is highly specific for eicosanoids containing a (5S)-hydroxyl group followed by a 6-trans double bond (18Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LTB4, which has a 6-cis double bond, is not metabolized by this pathway. The best substrate for 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase is (5S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), which is converted to 5-oxo-ETE (18Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol.

Relatively little is known about the olefin reductase that converts 5-oxoeicosanoids to their dihydro metabolites. The objectives of this study were to investigate the regulation of this enzyme, its substrate specificity, and its subcellular localization. We also wanted to determine whether 5-oxo-ETE could be converted to a dihydro metabolite by this pathway and, if so, how this would affect its biological activity. Calmodulin was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), whereas the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium chloride (R24571) was obtained from Calbiochem. PGB2 was obtained from Sigma. 6-trans-LTB4, 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4, 15-oxo-PGF2α, and 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-PGF2α were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). A number of the eicosanoids used in this study were prepared by total chemical synthesis. 5-Oxo-ETE, 8-trans-5-oxo-ETE, and 6,7-dihydro-5-oxo-ETE were prepared as described previously (24Khanapure S.P. Shi X.X. Powell W.S. Rokach J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 337-342Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 5-Oxo-[11,12,14,15-3H]ETE and 8-trans-5-oxo-[11,12,14,15-3H]ETE were prepared by reduction of an 11,14-diyne precursor with tritium gas (performed by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) (25Khanapure S.P. Shi X.X. Powell W.S. Rokach J. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 4098-4102Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Various eicosanoids were prepared biochemically. 5-Oxo-6-trans-LTB4 and 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 were synthesized by incubation of 6-trans-LTB4 (2 μm) and 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 (2 μm) (Cayman Chemical Co.), respectively, with a microsomal fraction from human neutrophils for 90 min in the presence of NADP+ (1 mm) (18Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5-Oxo-15-hydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15-HETE) and 5-oxo-15-hydroxy-6E,8E,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (8-trans-5-oxo-15-HETE) were prepared by incubation of 5-oxo-ETE and 8-trans-5-oxo-ETE, respectively, with soybean lipoxygenase (18Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5-HETE was synthesized by incubation of arachidonic acid (NuChek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN) with potato 5-lipoxygenase (26Shimizu T. Honda Z. Miki I. Seyama Y. Izumi T. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 5,15-Dihydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,15-diHETE) was prepared by incubation of 5-HETE with soybean lipoxygenase (27Maas R.L.

Chem. 1982; 257: 7056-7067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5-Hydroxy-15-oxo-6E,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-oxo-5-HETE) was prepared by incubating 5,15-diHETE (2 μm) with the cytosolic fraction obtained from pregnant rabbit lungs in the presence of NAD+ (28Bergholte J.M.

Similarly, 15-oxo-[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]PGF2α was synthesized by incubation of [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]PGF2α (180 Ci/mmol (NEN Life Science Products) with pregnant rabbit lung cytosol (1 ml, equivalent to 20 mg of tissue) for 10 min at 37 °C (29Sun F.F. Armour S.B. Prostaglandins. 1974; 7: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This product cochromatographed with authentic unlabeled 15-oxo-PGF2α. Human neutrophils were purified by treatment of blood with Dextran T-500, centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque, and hypotonic lysis of the remaining red cells (30Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (25 × 106/ml) were suspended in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3m sucrose, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and aprotinin (2 μg/ml). The neutrophils were then disrupted by sonication (model 4710 Ultrasonic Homogenizer; Sonics & Materials, Danbury, CT) in an ice bath for 2 × 5 s at a power setting of 1 and for a further 5 s at a power setting of 2. The sonicate was centrifuged successively at 1500 × g for 10 min, 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 200,000 × g for 60 min. The 10,000 ×g and 200,000 × g pellets were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1.25 times the original volume) containing calcium and magnesium. The 200,000 × gsupernatant fraction (10 ml) was incubated with 1 ml of DEAE-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C with constant mixing. The gel suspension was packed into a column that was eluted with 1) 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (10 ml); 2) 50 mm NaCl in 20 mm phosphate (10 ml); and 3) 250 mm NaCl in 20 mm phosphate (10 ml). The initial unretained fraction contained the Δ13-reductase, which was monitored using 15-oxo-5-HETE as substrate, whereas the 250 mm NaCl fraction contained the Δ6-reductase, which was monitored using 8-trans-5-oxo-[3H]ETE as substrate. Fractions obtained as described above were incubated with various substrates, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of methanol (0.6 ml) and stored at −80 °C until analysis by RP-HPLC. After the samples were thawed, water was added to give a final volume of 4 ml (i.e.15% methanol). Eicosanoids were analyzed by automated precolumn extraction/RP-HPLC as described previously (31Powell W.S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Products were detected and UV spectra recorded using a Waters model M991 diode array detector. Dihydro products were quantitated on the basis of UV absorbance or (when 5-oxo-[3H]ETE, 8-trans-5-oxo-[3H]ETE, or 15-oxo-[3H]PGF2α were the substrates) measurement of radioactivity. Different conditions were used for the analysis of metabolites of oxoeicosanoids (i.e. 5-oxo-ETE and 8-trans-5-oxo-ETE), hydroxyoxoeicosanoids, and 15-oxo-PGF2αa. All mobile phases contained 0.02% acetic acid. Conditions for oxoeicosanoids were as follows: Spherisorb ODS-2 column (3.2 × 250 mm; 5-μm particle size; Phenomenex); 60% acetonitrile in water, isocratic for 40 min at 0.5 ml/min. Conditions for hydroxyoxoeicosanoids were as follows: Novapak C18column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters); linear gradient between 37 and 45% acetonitrile over 30 min at 1 ml/min. Conditions for 15-Oxo-PGF2αa were as follows: Novapak C18column; 31% acetonitrile, isocratic at 1 ml/min. PGB2 (250 ng/sample) was used as an internal standard. 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4(2 μm) was incubated with the 1500 × gsupernatant fraction from human neutrophils for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence of NADP+ (1 mm). The reaction was terminated by the addition of methanol (0.5 volumes). Water was added to give a final concentration of methanol of 15%, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was extracted without acidification on a C18 Sep-Pak (Waters-Millipore) as described previously (32Powell W.S. Prostaglandins. 1980; 20: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The methyl formate fraction was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and the residue (containing 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4) was incubated with the 200,000 × g supernatant fraction from human neutrophils for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence of calcium (1 mm) and NADPH (1 mm). The products were extracted using octadecylsilyl silica as described above. RP-HPLC analysis of an aliquot of the methyl formate fraction after the first extraction (material from the incubation with the 1500 ×g supernatant) confirmed that the major product was 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 (18Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dihydro-5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4, the major product of the incubation with the 200,000 ×g supernatant fraction, was purified by RP-HPLC as described above and incubated at a concentration of 2 μm with the 200,000 × g pellet obtained from porcine neutrophils, prepared as described previously (6Wainwright S.L. Powell W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20899-20906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence of NAD+ (1 mm). The products of the reaction were analyzed by precolumn extraction/RP-HPLC as described above. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Calcium levels were measured in indo-1-loaded neutrophils as described previously (34Powell W.S. MacLeod R.J. Gravel S. Gravelle F. Bhakar A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar), using a Photon Technology International (PTI) Deltascan 4000 spectrofluorometer with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder equipped with a magnetic stirrer. We had previously shown that 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 is converted to dihydro and dihydro-5-oxo metabolites by a 1500 × gsupernatant fraction from human neutrophils. To investigate the subcellular localization of the olefin reductase required for the formation of these products, 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 was incubated with subcellular fractions from neutrophils in the presence of different cofactors. When 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 was incubated with a microsomal fraction from neutrophils in the presence of NADPH, the major metabolite was the ketoreductase product, 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4(12e-6t-B4) (Fig.1 A). Only a small amount of a dihydro product (dh-12e-B4) was formed under these conditions. In contrast, the major product formed when 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 was incubated with the cytosolic fraction from neutrophils in the presence of NADPH was its dihydro metabolite (dh-5o-12e-B4) (Fig. 1 B). The amounts of the above metabolites of 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 formed by different subcellular fractions from neutrophils are shown in TableI. The major product formed by both the 10,000 and 200,000 × g pellets was the ketoreductase product 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4. Formation of this product by particulate fractions was dependent upon the presence of NADPH, NADH being much less effective. It was formed to a lesser extent by the 200,000 × g supernatant, but in this case its formation was not affected by the addition of cofactors, perhaps because the level of endogenous cofactor was sufficient. In contrast, the two particulate fractions tested displayed relatively little or no olefin reductase activity, whereas the 200,000 ×g supernatant was quite active in the formation of dihydro metabolites of 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4. The cytosolic olefin reductase activity was highly dependent on the presence of NADPH, with much smaller amounts of dihydro metabolites being formed in the absence of exogenous cofactors or in the presence of NADH.Table IMetabolism of 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 by subcellular fractions from human neutrophilsFractionCofactorProduct12e-6t-B4dh-5o-12e-B4dh-12e-B4pmol/ml/30 min10,000 pelletsNone12NDaND, not detectable.NDNADH24NDNDNADPH322NDND200,000 pelletsNone10NDNDNADH154NDNDNADPH862ND106200,000 supernatantNone23846NDNADH222166NDNADPH2509101745-Oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 (2 μm) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with different subcellular fractions from human neutrophils (equivalent to 2 × 107 cells/ml) in the presence or absence of NADH (1 mm) or NADPH (1 mm).

Open table in a new tab 5-Oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 (2 μm) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with different subcellular fractions from human neutrophils (equivalent to 2 × 107 cells/ml) in the presence or absence of NADH (1 mm) or NADPH (1 mm). The products were quantitated by RP-HPLC as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The abbreviations are as described in the legend to Fig. 1. We had previously suggested that 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 was converted to a 6,11-dihydro metabolite by intact neutrophils (16Powell W.S. Gravelle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2170-2177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, identification of the positions of the double bonds in this product was not very conclusive, because the diagnostic fragment ions in its mass spectrum were not very intense and could possibly have arisen as a result of rearrangements. A recent study employing mass spectral analysis of fragments formed by oxidative ozonolysis provided evidence that it is the 6,7-double bond of 6-trans isomers of LTB4that is reduced by these cells (17Wheelan P. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19845-19852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We used a different approach to investigate the position of the reduced double bond of 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4. As shown in Fig.2, 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 could potentially be reduced to three products by an olefin reductase, resulting in 6,7-dihydro, 6,11-dihydro, or 10,11-dihydro metabolites. Reduction of the 9,10-double bond in the middle of the triene chromophore is unlikely, whereas reduction of the 14,15-double bond is theoretically possible but would not result in a change in the UV spectrum of the product. Reduction of the 10,11-double bond of 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 (Fig. 2) can also be excluded, since the resulting product would have a λmax around 280 nm, which is not observed. To determine whether 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 is converted to a 6,7-dihydro or a 6,11-dihydro metabolite, this substance was incubated with microsomal 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase from porcine neutrophils in the presence of NAD+. Oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group of 6,7-dihydro-5-oxo-12-epi-LTB4 by 12-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase would give a 5,12-dioxo product absorbing at 280 nm, whereas oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group of 6,11-dihydro-5-oxo-12-epi-LTB4 would not result in any change in the λmax of the substrate (Fig. 2). RP-HPLC analysis of the metabolites of dihydro-5-oxo-12-epi-LTB4 formed by porcine microsomes indicated that two fewer polar products were formed, presumably due to oxidation of the 12-hydroxyl group (Fig.3 A). The major product had a λmax at 280 nm and was therefore a 6,7-dihydro product (structure I in Fig. 2), whereas a minor product had a λmax at 231 nm and was probably identical to the 6,11-dihydro compound (structure II in Fig. 2) (Fig. 3 B). This demonstrates that the cytosolic fraction from human neutrophils reduces 5-oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 principally by 1,2-addition to the triene chromophore and suggests that 1,6-addition may also occur to some extent. For the purpose of clarity, this activity will be referred to below as Δ6-reductase activity. Other 5-oxoeicosanoids were also metabolized by cytosolic fractions from neutrophils in a manner analogous to that shown for 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 in Fig.1. 5-Oxo-15-HETE was converted to 5,15-diHETE and two dihydro products, presumably 6,7-dihydro-5-oxo-15-HETE and 6,7-dihydro-5,15-diHETE. The time course for the formation of these three metabolites is shown in Fig. 4. The initial Δ6-reductase and ketoreductase products (dihydro-5-oxo-15-HETE and 5,15-diHETE) were formed fairly rapidly and reached maximal levels by about 90 min, after which time the amounts declined. The product formed by a combination of the two pathways (dihydro-5,15-diHETE) was formed much more slowly and did not appear to have reached maximal levels by 120 min. To investigate the substrate specificity of the neutrophil cytosolic olefin reductase, a variety of oxoeicosanoids were prepared either chemically or biochemically and incubated with neutrophil cytosol in the presence of NADPH. The products were analyzed by RP-HPLC, and the amounts of dihydro products (dihydro plus dihydro-oxo) were determined. The cytosolic olefin reductase converted a variety of 5-oxoeicosanoids to dihydro metabolites (TableII). Of these, the best substrates were 5-oxo-6-trans-LTB4 and 8-trans-5-oxo-15-HETE. 5-Oxo-ETE and its 8-trans isomer appeared to be metabolized more slowly, but this may have been due at least in part to the conversion of these substances by a competitive pathway to 15-hydroxy products due to the presence of 15-lipoxygenase in the cytosol. The Δ6-reductase appears to prefer substrates with an 8-trans double bond, since both 8-trans-5-oxo-ETE and 8-trans-5-oxo-15-HETE were metabolized more rapidly than the corresponding 8-cis compounds. However, of all of the products tested, 15-oxo-5-HETE was by far the best substrate, being metabolized at a rate at least 3 times that of the 5-oxoeicosanoids tested. This raised the possibility that the cytosolic reductase was actually a Δ13-reductase that was also capable of reducing the 6,7-double bond of 5-oxoeicosanoids.Table IISubstrate specificity of cytosolic olefin reductases in human neutrophilsSubstrateOlefin reductase activityCytosolaValues are sums of dihydro-oxo (olefin reductase) and dihydro (olefin reductase plus ketoreductase) products.DEAE boundDEAE flow-throughpmol/min/mg protein5-Oxo-6-trans-LTB411.5 ± 0.8NDbND, not detectable.5-Oxo-12-epi-6-trans-LTB44.93 ± 0.27ND5-Oxo-15-HETE (8-cis)7.0 ± 0.94.13 ± 0.23ND8-trans-5-Oxo-15-HETE12.6 ± 0.95.30 ± 0.10ND5-Oxo-ETE (8-cis)2.0 ± 0.1cThese values are underestimates because both 5-oxo-ETE and 8-trans-5-oxo-ETE, but not the other substrates, were converted to 15-hydroxy products by cytosolic 15-lipoxygenase.1.73 ± 0.18ND8-trans-5-Oxo-ETE5.3 ± 0.5cThese values are underestimates because both 5-oxo-ETE and 8-trans-5-oxo-ETE, but not the other substrates, were converted to 15-hydroxy products by cytosolic 15-lipoxygenase.6.13 ± 0.28ND15-Oxo-5-HETE38.1 ± 0.8d15-oxo-5-HETE was converted only to a dihydro-oxo product.ND32.67 ± 1.2615-Oxo-PGF2αND48.53 ± 4.29Various oxoeicosanoids (1 μm) were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of NADPH (1 mm) with neutrophil cytosol (30 min; 1 mm Ca2+), the 250 mm NaCl fraction following chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (60 min; 1 mm Ca2+), or the DEAE-Sepharose flow-through fraction (30 min; 1 mm EGTA).

All of the experiments described above were performed in the presence of calcium (1 mm). To determine whether the conversion of oxoeicosanoids to dihydro products was affected by calcium, neutrophil cytosol was incubated with various substrates in calcium-free medium in the presence of EGTA (1 mm). Removal of calcium inhibited the conversion to dihydro metabolites of the three 5-oxoeicosanoids tested (5-oxo-6-trans-LTB4, 5-oxo-15-HETE, and 8-trans-5-oxo-15-HETE) by between 70 and 80% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5). In contrast, conversion of 15-oxo-5-HETE to its dihydro metabolite was stimulated by about 25% (p < 0.05) in the presence of EGTA. This experiment thus provides strong evidence that neutrophil cytosol contains at least two distinct olefin reductases and that the activity of one of these is enhanced by calcium.

Additionally, chemoattractants stimulate different levels of MAPK activity. For example, interleukin 8 and platelet-activating factor stimulate a weaker ERK response than C5a and FMLP (25Knall C.

These findings suggest that specific domains of chemoattractant receptors regulate MAPK activity by stimulating different G protein-coupled pathways or by disparate rates of activation of the same pathway. The present study was designed to determine the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail in FPR-mediated activation of ERK and p38 MAPKs. A deletion mutant of the carboxyl-terminal tail of FPRs was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and both mutated and wild type receptors were stably expressed in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Activation of MAPK cascades and G proteins by wild type and mutant receptors was examined. Our results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal tail of FPRs plays a significant role in control of basal activity and ligand-stimulated Gi protein-dependent activation of both ERK and p38 kinases.DISCUSSIONDefining the structural basis for divergent PMN functional response and signal transduction pathway activation to chemoattractants provides the opportunity to develop strategies for pharmacologic regulation of these responses. The present study was designed to determine the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail of FPRs in the activation of MAPK cascades. Our data show that undifferentiated HL-60 cells provide a useful model in which to examine structure-function relationships of chemoattractant receptor activation of MAPKs. Stable expression of wild type FPRs permitted FMLP to stimulate a 3–5-fold increase in ERK and p38 kinase activities. The time course, concentration response, and pertussis toxin sensitivity were all similar to those seen in differentiated HL-60 cells and human PMNs (26Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W.

Additionally, FMLP stimulation of GTPγS binding and GTPγS inhibition of FMLP binding to membranes from FPR HL-60 cells was similar to that seen in PMNs and HL-60 granulocytes. Our findings are consistent with a previous report showing that stable expression of FPRs in undifferentiated HL-60 cells resulted in the ability of FMLP to stimulate pertussis toxin-sensitive calcium mobilization (34Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5704-5715PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, stable expression of FPRs in undifferentiated HL-60 cells permits examination of chemoattractant receptor activation of G proteins and MAPK cascades.Various receptors use different domains to couple to G proteins, and specific rules or consensus sequences that determine G protein coupling do not exist. In PMNs and HL-60 cells, FPRs couple to G proteins containing αi2 and αi3 (21Bommakanti R.K. Dratz E.A. Siemsen D.W. Jesaitis A.J.

Physical interaction of FPRs with Gi proteins is interrupted by synthetic peptides derived from the carboxyl-terminal tail but not those derived from the third intracellular loop (19Schreiber R.E.

To determine the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail in FPR activation of MAPKs, we constructed a mutant FPR in which carboxyl-terminal amino acids 301–346 were deleted and stably expressed this mutant receptor in undifferentiated HL-60 cells.Recently, our laboratory has reported that FMLP stimulation of HL-60 granulocytes, a model for PMNs (39Klinker J.F. Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 33-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), activates ERK and p38 kinases (30Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar), similar to results obtained in human PMNs (25Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19828-19832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail of FPRs in receptor function, the ability of FMLP to stimulate ERK and p38 MAPK activation, calcium transients, and G protein activation was compared between undifferentiated HL-60 cells stably transfected with FPRwt and FPRdel. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail prevented FMLP-stimulated ERK and p38 kinase activities and blocked FMLP-stimulated calcium transients. The observed differences in MAPK activation and calcium responses are unlikely to be due to differences in expression of FPRwt and FPRdel. Expression of both receptor types by transfected HL-60 cells was similar, as determined by fluorescein-labeled formyl peptide binding. It remains possible that the deletion mutation results in changes in the tertiary structure that impair ligand binding. However, the ability of the fluorescent formyl peptide to specifically bind to FPRDEL HL-60 cells suggests that any conformational change does not significantly affect ligand binding. Taken together, our data and the previously published results with synthetic peptides strongly suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of FPRs is required for G protein-coupled activation of MAPKs and phospholipase C-dependent calcium mobilization. Our data suggest that the mechanism of inhibition of MAPK activation and calcium mobilization in FPRdel HL-60 cells is uncoupling of the receptor-G protein interaction. This conclusion is based on several findings. First, FMLP failed to stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange by G proteins in FPRdel membranes, as shown by the absence of a concentration-dependent increase in GTPγS binding. Second, basal GTPγS binding was significantly reduced in FPRdel membranes, compared with FPRwt membranes. We have previously shown that uncoupling of formyl peptide receptors from G proteins by pretreatment with pertussis toxin results in a reduction of basal GTPγS binding (6McLeish K.R. Gierschik P. Schepers T. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Third, GTPγS failed to inhibit FMLP binding in FPRdel membranes. Guanine nucleotides reduce G protein-coupled receptor affinity for ligand, resulting in a reduced level of ligand binding (36Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Steisslinger M. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 172: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37McLeish K.R. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 384-390PubMed Google Scholar, 38Koo C. Lefkowitz R.J. Snyderman R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fourth, photoaffinity labeling of G proteins in FPRwt and FPRdel membranes showed that FMLP failed to stimulate increased labeling of G proteins in FPRdel membranes, and basal labeling was reduced compared with FPRwt membranes. Fifth, the concentration of fluoresceinated formyl peptide required to saturate binding sites was greater in FPRdel HL-60 cells. Because the number of receptors was similar in the two groups of cells, this finding suggests a reduced affinity for ligand of FPRdel. Finally, pertussis toxin pretreatment did not alter either stimulated or basal ERK and p38 activities in FPRdel HL-60 cells.Basal ERK and p38 kinase activities were significantly higher in FPRdel HL-60 cells, than in FPRwt HL-60 cells. This finding suggests that removal of the carboxyl-terminal tail of FPR may result in a constitutively active receptor. The differences in basal MAPK activity was not due to selection of a specific clone of FPRdel cells with high MAPK activity, because transfected HL-60 cells were selected by antibiotic resistance. Immunoprecipitation of specific Gα subunits following AA-GTP photoaffinity labeling in the presence of FMLP confirmed that FPRwt couple to G proteins containing αi2but not to those containing Gαq. FPRdel are not constitutively active for Gi proteins, because there was reduced basal photoaffinity labeling of immunoprecipitated αi2 in membranes from FPRdel HL-60 cells, and pertussis toxin did not alter this labeling. The increased basal MAPK activity in FPRdel cells was not the result of uncoupling of FPR from Gi2 proteins, because pertussis toxin pretreatment of FPRwt cells failed to reproduce the increase in basal ERK or p38 kinase activity. Okamoto et al. (43Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21589-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that removal of a portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail of endothelin B receptors resulted in uncoupling from Gi proteins, but their ability to activate Gq was not affected. Co-transfection of FPRs and Gα16 into COS cells results in FMLP-stimulated phospholipase C activation (11Amatruda III, T.T. Dragas-Graonic S. Holmes R. Perez H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28010-28013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that FPRdel constitutively activate other G proteins. Immunoprecipitation of αq/11 subunits failed to demonstrate increased photoaffinity labeling in FPRdel membranes or following FMLP stimulation of FPRwt and FPRdel membranes. No basal or stimulated labeling of α12 or α13 was seen, and immunoblotting did not detect these subunits in HL-60 cells. We were unable to directly examine photoaffinity labeling of α16, because an immunoprecipitating antibody was unavailable. However, the absence of increase basal or FMLP-stimulated photolabeling in solubilized membranes from FPRdel HL-60 cells suggests that this pathway was not activated. Our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail acts to inhibit activation of an alternative signal transduction pathway when FPRs are uncoupled from αi2-containing G proteins. Elimination of the carboxyl-terminal tail not only uncouples FPRs from Gi proteins but alters the FPR by either unmasking of an active site upon removal of stearic hindrance of the carboxyl-terminal tail or a conformational change in the remaining receptor. The mutant receptor is then constitutively active for an alternative pathway resulting in ERK and p38 MAPK activation. The failure of FPRdel membranes to show increased basal photolabeling with AA-GTP suggests that the alternative pathway is G protein-independent; however, the components of this pathway remain to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2075324767,"Advances in the understanding of the retinoid signaling mechanism has allowed the discovery of highly selective retinoids that activate only one specific receptor class, subtype, or signaling pathway. These novel compounds lack certain of the common retinoid toxicities and therefore suggest promising new approaches for therapeutic applications. We describe here a new compound, 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid methyl ester (MX84), that is selectively activated in macrophages, leading to killing of only macrophage monocyte type cells in vitro. We provide evidence that MX84 is an inactive precursor that is converted into an active apoptosis-inducing retinoid in macrophages. The macrophage activity is also secreted, and our data suggest that the secreted activity is a phospholipase D type activity. Our observation may lead to the development of molecules that are highly macrophage-selective apoptosis inducers in vivo and that could represent important novel therapeutics against diseases caused by excessive macrophage activity."

Preformed B2C5-UvrB immunocomplexes, however, inhibited formation of those intermediates. B2C5 mAb seems to interfere with the formation of the UvrA-UvrB complex due to overlapping of its epitope and the UvrA binding region of UvrB.

Precise dual incision is achieved by the combined action of three proteins, UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC, comprising the Uvr(A)BC. Remarkably, these three proteins do not seem to physically associate (at least in vitro) but rather act in a sequential manner generating relatively stable intermediates (3Grossman L. Thiagalingam S.

The correct structural architecture of the macromolecular intermediates of Uvr(A)BC seems to be critical for repair-proficient incision. Amino acid substitutions in the components of Uvr(A)BC as well as artificial in vitro conditions result in reduced or anomalous incision because of the alterations in the preincision complex architecture (8Moolenaar G.F.

To approach this problem the anti-UvrA, -UvrB, and -UvrB* 2UvrB* is a proteolytic fragment of UvrB lacking its C-terminal domain.

Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and manufacturer's recommendations as described (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol.

The concentrations of all proteins were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The binding buffer (BB) is composed of 50 mm K+MOPS (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol (v/v). The supercoiling buffer consists of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm ATP; and the nicking buffer was BB supplemented with 2 mm ATP. The UvrB (25 nm) protein was preincubated with excess mAb (100 nm) in BB buffer for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of UvrA (75 nm) and ATP (final concentration 108 μm) containing [3H]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In those cases where the ATPase is associated with Uvr nucleoprotein complexes, DNA or uvDNA (plasmid pTZ18R DNA at 30 μm base pair concentration, containing 0 or ∼12 cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers per circle) was also added at this point. The hydrolysis of ATP was assayed as described (18Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18382-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were conducted essentially as described previously (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation of UvrA-UvrB complexes was performed essentially as described (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except detection of Uvr proteins in the immunoprecipitate Western blotting and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were employed. The mAbs B2E2, B2A1, and anti-UvrA mAb A2D1 (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) were used for the probing of blots. Immunoprecipitation of UvrA-UvrB-DNA complexes was performed as follows: UvrA (2 nm), UvrB (50 nm), and 50 fmol undamaged 3H-pHE6 plasmid DNA (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were preincubated for 30 min in the presence of 1 mm ATPγS followed by the addition of mAbs at 500 nm. Precipitation proceeded further as described (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UvrB-uvDNA complexes were preformed by incubating UvrA, UvrB, and 3H-pHE6 uvDNA (∼12 dimers per circle) in the presence of 2 mm ATP for 30 min. Then mAbs and excess unirradiated pTZ18R plasmid DNA were added followed by immunoprecipitation (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of Uvr protein-uvDNA complexes was assessed by band shift assays (9Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Snowden A. Van Houten B. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Uvr proteins were preincubated with mAbs. 1 μl of 32P-labeled DNA or uvDNA was added to a final concentration of 5 nm. The DNA was an 82-base pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the pTZ18R plasmid, possessing the sequence ATGCATGCTTAACATGCGTAC in theBamHI site. It was 3′-end labeled at an EcoRI site. This fragment was irradiated by ∼1 kJ/m2 of UV to produce uvDNA. After 20 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped and nucleoprotein complexes were analyzed by 4% PAGE with 1× TBE, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP in the gel and running buffers as described (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases Uvr nucleoprotein complexes were preformed by a 20-min incubation period of UvrA, UvrB, and uvDNA. Then mAbs were added and incubation continued for an additional 20 min. Samples were then treated and electrophoresed as above. UvrB was preincubated with excess anti-UvrB/UvrB* mAb (200 nm) in BB plus 2 mm ATP for 20 min at 37 °C. Then immunoreactions were mixed with uvDNA (3′-32P-labeled fragment described under “Band Shift Analysis”) and UvrA followed in 20 min by the addition of UvrC. Final concentrations of UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC are 5, 10, and 20 nm, respectively; final reaction volume is 10 μl. In experiments involving “reverse order of addition,” UvrA, UvrB, and uvDNA were first incubated in BB plus 2 mm ATP followed by the sequential addition of anti-Uvr mAb and UvrC. The incision reactions were stopped 10 min after the addition of UvrC by 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and placing the reaction tubes on ice. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by 10% PAGE. The positions of 3′-incisions by Uvr(A)BC were assigned by comparison with those generated by the Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). UvrA and UvrB in the presence of ATP interact with an apparent stoichiometry of UvrA2B1 (21Orren D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Orren D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of this complex results in a 30–50% inhibition of the UvrA-associated ATPase (23Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If the immunocomplex of mAb and UvrB interferes with the formation of the UvrA-UvrB complex then this inhibitory effect should not be observed provided the mAb itself does not inhibit UvrA-associated ATPase. It was found that none of the mAbs in question significantly inhibited UvrA-associated ATPase (data not shown). Further, incubation of ATP with mAbs alone did not result in its hydrolysis above background level (data not shown). Only mAb B2C5 reduced the inhibitory effect of the UvrB binding on UvrA-associated ATPase (TableI). Immunocomplexes of other mAbs did not interfere with the specific inhibition effect suggesting that the respective mAbs do not interfere with UvrA-UvrB complex formation. These results were consistent with those obtained by immunoprecipitation of preformed UvrA-UvrB complexes (Fig.1). B2C5 was unable to immunoprecipitate these complexes; only UvrB was detected in the immunoprecipitate even when both proteins were in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1, B2C5,lane 3). Moreover, an excess of UvrA significantly reduced the amount of precipitated UvrB (Fig. 1, B2C5, cf. lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that it blocks access to the epitope. Conversely, B3C1 mAb interacted with preformed UvrA-UvrB complexes, judging from its ability to co-precipitate UvrA (Fig. 1, B3C1, lane 3). B2A1 mAb was also able to immunoprecipitate UvrA-UvrB complexes, although less efficiently than B3C1 (Fig. 1, cf. lane 3). Under these conditions UvrA alone was not precipitated (Fig. 1, lane 1). B*2E3 mAb only marginally immunoprecipitated UvrB alone but not in complex with UvrA. It, however, efficiently interacted with UvrB* and its complex with UvrA (Fig. 1, B*2E3, lanes 4 and 5). These observations are consistent with findings that: (i) B*2E3 has a much higher affinity for UvrB* than for UvrB in solution, although it efficiently recognizes the denatured forms of both species on Western blot (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar); (ii) UvrB*, the proteolytic fragment of UvrB, is able to interact with UvrA (cf. Refs. 8Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol.

The concentration of UvrA is 25 nm, and the concentration of UvrB is 75 nm. Open table in a new tab Nanomoles of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mol of UvrA are shown. The concentration of UvrA is 25 nm, and the concentration of UvrB is 75 nm. The next step in the functioning of Uvr(A)BC is initiated by binding of the UvrA-UvrB complex to undamaged regions of DNA (3Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of such a complex is manifested in several ways. In particular, the ATPase associated with this complex is catalytically more active than the UvrA- or (UvrA-UvrB)-associated ATPases (Ref. 23Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and Fig. 2,cf. left and middle bars). The immunocomplexes of UvrB with either B2C5, B*2B9, and B2A1 mAbs resulted in a decrease of the stimulating effect of undamaged DNA, whereas other mAbs had little or no significant effect (Fig. 2, middle bars). This suggests that B2C5, B*2B9, and B2A1 interfere with either the formation of the UvrA-UvrB-DNA complex or with its ATPase activity. The stimulation of the ATPase associated with the UvrA-UvrB-DNA complex is even more profound when DNA is damaged (Ref. 23Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and Fig. 2,cf. middle and right bars). As with undamaged DNA, the B3C1 and B*2E3 mAbs had no significant effect on stimulating the ATPase activity by uvDNA, whereas B2A1, B2C5, and B*2B9 mAbs significantly reduced that stimulation (Fig. 2, right bars). However, B*3E11, having no effect on the stimulation by intact DNA, inhibited the additional stimulation attributed to damage (Fig. 2, B*3E11, cf. middle and right bars). The accumulation of positive supercoils in closed circular plasmid DNA, when incubated with UvrA and UvrB in the presence of E. colitopoisomerase I, reflects the DNA helix-tracking activity of the UvrA2B complex (19Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This activity is thought to be essential for damage recognition and/or prepriming (3Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Koo H.-S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Examining the effect of mAbs on the extent of positive supercoiling provides some insight into the state and accessibility of respective epitopes in this intermediate UvrA-UvrB DNA helix-tracking complex (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that preincubation of UvrB with B*2E3 mAb had no significant effect on the extent of positive supercoiling (Fig.3). However, preincubation with B2A1, B2C5, and B*2B9 inhibited positive supercoiling, whereas B3C1 and B*3E11 mAbs significantly stimulated positive supercoiling (Fig. 3). The absence of the effect of immunocomplex on positive supercoiling suggests that B*2E3 mAbs does not interact with the DNA helix-tracking complex; the decrease in positive supercoiling implies that B2A1, B2C5, and B*2B9 mAbs inhibit formation or functioning of these complexes, and stimulation of positive supercoiling indicates that B3C1 and B*3E11 can interact with translocating UvrA-UvrB-DNA complexes (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive supercoiling was not observed when only mAbs or only one of each of the Uvr proteins was present in the reaction mixture (data not shown). The accessibility of epitopes in preformed Uvr nucleoprotein complexes can be assessed directly by immunoprecipitation of these complexes with mAbs. In this type of assay the presence of radiolabeled3H-pHE6 plasmid DNA in the immunoprecipitate was measured (14Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27421-27426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed in excess UvrB over UvrA to allow UvrA-UvrB-DNA complexes to prevail over UvrA-DNA complexes (9Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Snowden A. Van Houten B. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Bertrand-Burggraf E.

With undamaged DNA, the UvrA-UvrB-DNA complexes were not precipitated if ATP was present in the reaction mixture (data not shown). This emphasizes the dynamic nature of Uvr complexes with undamaged DNA in the presence of ATP, stimulated by the promotion of dissociation reactions when catalyzed by ATP hydrolysis (3Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Grossman L.

Therefore, immunoprecipitation with undamaged DNA was carried out in the presence of the poorly hydrolyzable analog ATPγS. The latter, in excess UvrB over UvrA, results predominantly in the formation of relatively stable UvrA-UvrB-DNA complexes (26Ahn B. Effect of RNA Polymerase on Nucleotide Excision Repair in Escherichia coliPh.D. thesis. The Johns Hopkins University, 1995Google Scholar). Only mAb B3C1 was able to immunoprecipitate the above complexes (Fig.4, middle bars). The localization of the preincision complex at the site of damage results in UvrA dissociation from the damaged site and formation of stable UvrB-uvDNA complexes (9Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Snowden A. Van Houten B.

Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accessibility of epitopes on UvrB protein in the preincision complex was probed by immunoprecipitation in the presence of ATP and competitor nonradioactive DNA (Fig. 4, right bars). These conditions seem to favor UvrB-DNA preincision complex formation (9Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Orren D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Orren D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was no radioactivity in the immunoprecipitates of mAbs B2A1, B2C5, B*2B9, and B*3E11. This suggests that these mAbs were unable to interact with Uvr nucleoprotein complexes under these conditions. On the other hand, mAb B3C1 and, surprisingly, B*2E3 were able to precipitate preincision complexes (Fig. 4, right bars). Band shift techniques were used to detect UvrB-uvDNA complexes (9Visse R. de Ruijter M. Moolenaar G.F. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Snowden A. Van Houten B. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Preincubation of UvrB with mAbs B2A1, B2C5, B*2B9, and B*3E11 significantly inhibited UvrB-uvDNA complexes (Fig.5 A). The B*2E3 (Fig.5 A) mAb had almost no effect on such complexes. Preincubation of UvrB with B3C1 mAb resulted in an upward shift and “smearing” of the band corresponding to the UvrB-uvDNA complex (Fig. 5 A). If, however, UvrB-uvDNA complexes were first preformed then followed by incubation with mAbs, the inhibitory effects of mAbs B2A1, B2C5, B*2B9, and B*3E11 were significantly reduced, whereas B3C1and B*2E3 showed almost the same pattern as in the case of immunocomplex preformation (Fig. 5 B). Incubation of uvDNA with mAbs alone did not result in any band shift effect (data not shown). We studied the influence of anti-Uvr mAbs on 3′-incision as a reflection of the overall incision reaction. It was found that the neutralizing effects of mAbs correlate in general with their ability to inhibit UvrB-uvDNA preincision complexes. B2A1, B2C5, B*2B9, and B*3E11 efficiently inhibited incision, whereas B3C1 did not influence the extent of incision if preincubated with UvrB protein (Fig.6 A). Preforming preincision complexes resulted in a decrease of the inhibitory effect of all of the above neutralizing mAbs, although the decrease was less profound in case of B*3E11 (Fig. 6, cf. A and B). Surprisingly, the B*2E3 mAb, which does not seem to interfere with UvrB-uvDNA preincision complexes (Fig. 5), strongly neutralized 3′-incision regardless of the “order of addition” (Fig. 6,cf. A and B). The dual incision of damaged DNA by Uvr(A)BC endonuclease is a multistep process involving a number of intermediate Uvr protein-protein and nucleoprotein complexes (3Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lin J.-J. Sancar A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M.H. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the relation between the structural architecture of these intermediates and their role in the incision process is an ultimate goal of structure-functional analysis. In the absence of not only three-dimensional structures of intermediate complexes but even those of individual Uvr proteins, alternative experimental approaches are required to study this problem. mAbs allow one to assess the accessibility of their epitopes in different intermediates and thus to gain information about structural rearrangements taking place during the incision process as well as the roles of the protein regions carrying epitopes in the intermediates. mAbs can also be used to probe naturally occurring protein-protein and nucleoprotein complexes underin vivo-like conditions, for instance, in crude extracts or fractionated cells (27Lin C.-L. Kovalsky O.I. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The anti-Uvr mAbs used in this study exhibit a high affinity for native proteins in solution and are nonintrusive in terms of their influence on conformation and/or flexibility of antigens (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The latter finding facilitates interpretation of the results of the functional assays of Uvr proteins and their complexes (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 28Goldberg M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 358-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The accessibility of anti-UvrB mAb epitopes on UvrB protein was probed directly by immunoprecipitation of different intermediate Uvr protein complexes and/or indirectly by studying the influence of these mAbs on functional activities associated with those complexes (summarized in Fig. 7). It was found that B2C5 interferes with the first intermediate of Uvr(A)BC, UvrA-UvrB complex. The inhibition of this complex formation appears to result from the steric hindrance created by the B2C5 in immunocomplex. Supporting this conclusion, B2C5 epitope, mapped to amino acids 171–278, overlaps with the N-terminal UvrA binding region of UvrB (amino acid residues 115–250) deduced from mutational analysis (7Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). B2C5 mAb does not seem able to access its epitope even after UvrA dissociates from UvrB-uvDNA preincision complex. This suggests that its epitope is either hidden in the UvrB-uvDNA complex or is disrupted because of the conformational change in UvrB upon this complex formation. B*2B9 mAb is a very potent inhibitor of all functional activities associated with the formation of Uvr nucleoprotein complexes; stimulation of UvrA-UvrB ATPase by DNA and uvDNA, UvrA-UvrB DNA helix-tracking activity, preincision complex formation and overall incision. The B*2B9 epitope region encompassing amino acids 470–630 3The C-terminal boundary of B*2B9 epitope was assigned based on its recognition of UvrB* (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which is thought to lack 43 C-terminal amino acids (12,13). However, evidence has been presented recently that UvrB* may actually lack 64 or 66 C-terminal amino acids (8Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This would place C-terminal boundary of B*2B9 epitope at amino acids 607 or 609 of UvrB. includes helicase motifs V and VI (29Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The latter motifs were found by mutational analysis to be essential for functions associated with UvrA-UvrB nucleoprotein complexes and were implicated in DNA binding (10Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Hence, B*2B9 binding could interfere with these structural-functional determinants, thus inhibiting respective complexes. An alternative explanation of B*2B9 inhibitory effects is that it may interfere with UvrA-UvrB complex formation. The epitope of this mAb may overlap with the second UvrB region (amino acids 547–673) implicated in UvrA binding (7Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This region, however, seems to be less significant for UvrA binding, because UvrB* and other truncated proteins lacking this region are still able to productively bind UvrA (Fig. 1 and Ref. 10Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistently, the B*2B9-UvrB immunocomplex did not result in significant reduction of the characteristic inhibitory effect of UvrB binding on UvrA-associated ATPase. However, we were unable to unambiguously assess accessibility of B*2B9 epitopes on UvrB in Uvr complexes because of the lack of immunoprecipitating ability by this mAb. B2A1 mAb was found to recognize the region of UvrB containing an ATPase site. Moreover, this mAb seems to compete with ATP for UvrB (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This mAb, however, did not interfere with UvrA-UvrB complex formation in solution, suggesting that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis by UvrB does not seem to be required for UvrA-UvrB interaction in solution. The ATP binding and/or hydrolysis by UvrA, however, seem to be crucial for productive UvrA-UvrB interaction (30Myles G.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3824-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The B2A1-UvrB immunocomplex did not support formation of any of the successive functional Uvr intermediates as well as the very incision of uvDNA by Uvr(A)BC. ATP binding/hydrolysis was shown to be absolutely required for the formation and functioning of those intermediates (3Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, B2A1 mAb seems to prevent the development and functioning of the intermediates and overall incision by blocking the ATP binding site of UvrB. This underscores the importance of ATP hydrolysis/binding by UvrB for the processing of DNA damage by Uvr(A)BC. B*3E11 seems to inhibit complexes and functions associated with DNA damage; additional stimulation of UvrA-UvrB-associated ATPase by uvDNA, UvrB-uvDNA preincision complex, and the 3′-incision of uvDNA. This is consistent with the B*3E11 epitope being located within amino acids 378–472 of UvrB (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the region flanked by Phe-365 and Phe-496, which were implicated in direct interaction with DNA bases in the UvrB-DNA preincision complex (7Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of B*3E11 to this region may create steric hindrance to the formation of the latter complex. The fact that B*3E11 can still interact with the UvrA-UvrB DNA helix-tracking complex, but fails to interact with UvrB-uvDNA complex, emphasizes the structural rearrangement of the Uvr nucleoprotein complex during UvrB delivery to a damaged site. As a result of this rearrangement at least part of the 378–472 amino acid stretch of UvrB either becomes hidden or changes conformation, so that the “conformational” epitope of B*3E11 (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) is disrupted. It should be noted that this mAb seems to be able to access its epitope in the preformed UvrB-uvDNA preincision complex. The latter, however, seems to destabilize this complex as judged by the persistence of the considerable inhibitory effect of B*3E11 on the UvrB-uvDNA preincision complex and 3′-incision even when preincision complexes were formed before addition of mAb. B*2E3 mAb is also diagnostic for structural rearrangements of Uvr functional intermediates. UvrB is a very poor substrate for this mAb in solution (Fig. 1 and Ref. 15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Consistently, B*2E3 was not able to efficiently interact or interfere with Uvr intermediates involving UvrB. However, it demonstrates the neutralizing effect regardless of the order of protein addition. This suggests that the B*2E3 epitope, barely accessible in UvrB, becomes accessible in the UvrB-DNA preincision complex. Hence, UvrB undergoes conformational changes as a result of preincision complex formation. These conformational changes are compatible with the suggested shift of the C-terminal domain of UvrB, which otherwise sterically hinders binding of B*2E3 to its epitope (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In support of this, limited immunoprecipitation of Uvr nucleoprotein complexes by B*2E3 was observed under conditions favoring formation of UvrB-uvDNA complexes. The B*2E3-UvrB-uvDNA immunocomplex does not seem to be stable, however, because it was not detected by band shift assay. The B*2E3 epitope is localized within the same region of UvrB as the B2C5 epitope (amino acids 171–278) (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, it should be emphasized that these epitopes are of different types (B2C5 is conformational, whereas B*2E3 is linear) and do not seem to overlap, because both mAbs are able to simultaneously bind UvrB (15Kovalsky O.I. Lin C.-L. Grossman L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It was found that the region of these epitopes contains one of the two putative coiled coils of UvrB (8Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The second putative coiled coil encompassing amino acids 640–673 of UvrB was implicated in the interaction of the UvrB-DNA preincision complex with UvrC (8Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The coiled coil located in the region of B*2E3 epitope could also participate in the UvrB-UvrC interaction. This is consistent with the proposed existence of the second dynamic mode of the latter interaction required for the dual incision (7Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, presumed binding of B*2E3 to the UvrB-uvDNA complex could interfere with UvrC binding causing the inhibition of incision. We have recently obtained diffraction quality crystals of UvrB and UvrB*. 4A. Kiyatkin, O. I. Kovalsky, L. Grossman, and W. Minor, unpublished results. Solution of the protein structures is in progress. The results described here will help to fit the static three-dimensional structure of UvrB into a pattern of complex rerrangements of this protein during incision revealed with the aid of mAbs (Fig. 7)."
