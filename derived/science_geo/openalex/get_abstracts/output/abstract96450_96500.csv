https://openalex.org/W1989841259,"The complete sequence of the 16,295 bp mouse L cell mitochondrial DNA genome has been determined. Genes for the 12S and 16S ribosomal RNAs; 22 tRNAs; cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II and III; ATPase subunit 6; cytochrome b; and eight unidentified proteins have been located. The genome displays exceptional economy of organization, with tRNA genes interspersed between rRNA and protein-coding genes with zero or few noncoding nucleotides between coding sequences. Only two significant portions of the genome, the 879 nucleotide displacement-loop region containing the origin of heavy-strand replication and the 32 nucleotide origin of light-strand replication, do not encode a functional RNA species. All of the remaining nucleotide sequence serves as a defined coding function, with the exception of 32 nucleotides, of which 18 occur at the 5' ends of open reading frames. Mouse mitochondrial DNA is unique in that the translational start codon is AUN, with any of the four nucleotides in the third position, whereas the only translational stop codon is the orthodox UAA. The mouse mitochondrial DNA genome is highly homologous in overall sequence and in gene organization to human mitochondrial DNA, with the descending order of conserved regions being tRNA genes; origin of light-strand replication; rRNA genes; known protein-coding genes; unidentified protein-coding genes; displacement-loop region."
https://openalex.org/W2170055916,"The kinetic parameters of the conversion of bovine prothrombin into thrombin by activated bovine blood clotting factor X (Xa) have been determined in the absence and presence of Ca2+, activated bovine factor V (Va) and phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/dioleoylphosphatidylserine, 1:1; mol/mol). In the absence of accessory components, the Km for prothrombin is 131 microM, which is well above its concentration in bovine plasma of about 1.5 microM. The Vmax of thrombin formation is 0.61 mol min-1 mol of Xa-1 under these conditions. In the presence of 7.5 microM phospholipid, the Km drops to 0.058 microM and the Vmax slightly increases to 2.25 mol min-1 mol of Xa. For the complete prothrombinase complex (Xa, Va, Ca2+, and 7.5 microM phospholipid), a Km for prothrombin of 0.21 microM and a Vmax of 1919 mol min-1 mol of Xa-1 is found. The Vmax of thrombin formation slightly increases when more phospholipid is present in our experiments and there is a considerable increase of the Km for prothrombin at higher phospholipid concentrations. Preliminary calculations show that the prothrombin density at the phospholipid surface at the Km is independent of the phospholipid concentration. This indicates that the Km measured in the presence of phospholipid has to be regarded as an apparent Km and the local prothrombin concentration determines the kinetics of activation. Prothrombin activation by prothrombinase complexes of different compositions was followed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Both in the absence and presence of phospholipid but without factor Va, prethrombin 2 is the main product formed during the initial stages of steady state prothrombin activation. In the presence of factor Va, thrombin is the main end product and minute amounts of prethrombin 2 are formed. This shift in the reaction pathway of prothrombin activation caused by factor Va will contribute to the observed increase of the Vmax measured in the presence of factor Va."
https://openalex.org/W2058795593,"Results obtained with certain adenovirus host range mutants (d1312 and hr1) have demonstrated that a functional viral E1A gene is required for the accumulation of early viral mRNA. In this report, it is demonstrated that the failure to accumulate early viral mRNA in E1A mutant-infected cells is due to a lack of transcription of the appropriate transcription units. The E1A gene product appears to enhance transcription of the early transcription units since there is not an absolute requirement for its function. At low multiplicities of infection, transcription from the early transcription units can be detected but at a later time. By increasing the multiplicity of infection, this slow activation of early transcription can be enhanced, even though at this multiplicity all input viruses are still mutant. It was also found that early transcription could be detected in mutant-infected cells if the virus was added to cells in which protein synthesis was inhibited prior to infection. Thus inhibition of cellular protein synthesis can mimic the function of the E1A gene. It is proposed that the role of the E1A gene product in the activation of early viral transcription is to inactivate a cellular factor that prevents transcription from the other early viral promoters."

https://openalex.org/W1972240128,"The nucleotide sequence of 11.4 kilobase pairs (kb) of human DNA that includes the two fetal globin genes, Gγ and Aγ, shows that they are part of a 5 kb tandem duplication. A small segment of DNA occurs three times, on either side of and between the two duplicates. We present two models that account for these observations. One model is simple but requires the assumption of a preexisting repetitive element; the other is more complex but does not require the assumption of preexisting repeats. Over much of the 5 kb duplicated region, the present duplicate copies differ by an average of 14% of their bases, from which we calculate that the duplication was first formed about 34 million years ago. However, 1.5 kb of DNA are vitually identical in the two genes analyzed here, probably as a consequence of an intergenic exchange (gene conversion) that replaced part of the diverging Aγ gene with the corresponding part of the Gγ gene. This conversion took place around 1 million years ago. A sequence of repeated dinucleotides may be one signal involved in exchanges leading to this and similar conversions. Cycles of duplication, triplication, deletion and gene conversion are probably common in many multigene families."

https://openalex.org/W1550771087,"The proteoglycan of articular cartilage provides this tissue with its elastic properties, and the structure of these molecules plays a major role in determining the resilience of the tissue to compression. In the present paper we have shown that the structure of the proteoglycan subunits in human articular cartilage changes considerably between the fetus and the mature adult. These changes occur gradually and are essentially complete by the end of growth. With increasing age the following changes were most pronounced: 1) a decrease in the proteoglycan content of the cartilage, 2) a decrease in the size of the proteoglycan subunit, 3) an increase in keratan sulfate relative to chondroitin sulfate, 4) an increase in 6-sulfation relative to 4-sulfation along the chondroitin sulfate chains, 5) an increase in protein relative to glycosaminoglycan, and 6) a decrease in serine and glycine and an increase in arginine content of the core protein. The susceptibility of the proteoglycan to proteolytic degradation by pepsin also showed age-related variations, but papain always produced the same degradation products. Irrespective of age, the majority of the proteoglycan subunits possessed the ability to interact with hyaluronic acid. Thus, although large structural changes take place in the glycosaminoglycan attachment region of the proteoglycan, the hyaluronic acid-binding region would appear to be relatively invariable. Decreases in the concentration, size, and charge of the proteoglycan would be expected to lower the elastic properties of the older cartilage."

https://openalex.org/W2074971250,"By nucleotide sequence analysis and S1 nuclease mapping we have determined the structural organization of early region E1b of Ad12. We have also revised the nucleotide sequence of the E1b region of Ad5. Both regions have an identical structural organization and show considerable homology at the nucleotide level. The major tumor antigens (Ad12, 19 and 54 kilodaltons [kd]); Ad5, 21 and 55 kd) are encoded in two overlapping reading frames. A single mRNA of 2.2 kilobases codes for both these proteins, depending on which AUG triplet serves as the start codon: the 19-21 kd protein initiates at the 5'-promximal AUG; the 54-55 kd protein initiates at the second AUG in another reading frame. Peptide mapping shows that the small and large tumor antigens do not share common tryptic peptides, in accordance with the nucleic acid sequence data. In addition, the 19-21 kd protein can also by synthesized from a one kilobase mRNA. Finally, the gene for the Ad12 analog of protein IX is characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2013639360,"Abstract We have studied specific transcription by RNA polymerase I in vitro using a mouse tissue-culture cell extract and cloned mouse rDNA containing the transcription initiation region of a 45S rRNA gene. In vitro, transcription initiates at a unique site on the rDNA, which we have located using runoff transcription and S1 nuclease mapping. This site is several hundred base pairs upstream from the presumptive initiation sites previously identified by others. Using runoff transcription and pulse-chase experiments, we further show that our primary transcript is specifically processed in vitro to generate a smaller RNA species. This defines a new rRNA-processing site within the external transcribed spacer of 45S RNA. Ribosomal RNA made in vivo also is longer than previously thought. The farthest upstream, in vivo 5′ end we detect by S1 nuclease mapping is at the in vitro initiation site; the only other in vivo 5′ end we detect maps at the in vitro processing site. This suggests that in vitro, both the initiation of rDNA transcription and the initial processing of this primary transcript mimic the in vivo situation. Both in vivo and in vitro, transcription extends through several large clusters of T residues (37 of 40 and 15 of 15) located approximately 450 and 350 nucleotides downstream from the initiation site. This demonstrates that T clusters, which have a central role in specifying termination for RNA polymerase III and E. coli RNA polymerase, are not the sole determinants of RNA polymerase I termination. In addition, there is a striking sequence homology between the nucleotide sequences immediately surrounding the initiation sites of mouse and frog rRNA genes."

https://openalex.org/W2105910482,"Abstract It had not been established whether influenza virus, an RNA virus of negative polarity, synthesizes its mRNA in the nucleus or cytoplasm of infected cells. To determine the site of synthesis, we fractionated infected chicken embryo fibroblasts and BHK-21 cells using both aqueous and nonaqueous procedures, and assayed the pulse-labeled viral RNA transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm by hybridization to virion RNA covalently linked to filter paper discs. With infected BHK-21 cells, most of the 3 Huridine-pulse-labeled viral RNA transcripts, synthesized during both primary and amplified transcription, were found in the nuclear fraction after both aqueous and nonaqueous fractionation. The results with infected chicken embryo fibroblasts were not as clear-cut, but also pointed to the nucleus as the site of viral RNA transcription. Gel electrophoretic analysis of the pulse-labeled viral RNA transcripts in BHK-21 cells indicated that all eight viral mRNAs are synthesized in the nucleus. A pulse-chase experiment suggested that most of the viral RNA transcripts synthesized in the nucleus are transported to the cytoplasm. On the basis of these experiments as well as labeling experiments with 3 H-methyl methionine (to label the caps of the viral mRNAs), it was established that: the nucleus is the site where cellular capped RNAs (that is, heterogeneous nuclear RNAs) prime viral RNA transcription and donate their 5′ caps and about 10 to 13 nucleotides to the viral mRNAs; and essentially only those capped cellular RNAs synthesized after infection, and not those synthesized before infection, are used as primers. Influenza virus is thus unique among nononcogenic RNA viruses in synthesizing its mRNA in the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2031176504,"For the faithful initiation of transcription of exogenously added fibroin gene, a crude cellular extract was prepared from the posterior silk glands where fibroin gene is specifically transcribed. The faithful initiation was demonstrated by the assay with use of truncated fibroin gene templates and confirmed by nuclease S1 mapping. The transcription initiation of fibroin gene was detected also in the extract from the middle silk glands where fibroin gene is not transcribed, indicating that an expected suppression machinery for the gene was left behind during the extraction procedures. The promoter sequence of fibroin gene required in these homologous extracts (the nucleotide position -29 to +6) is the same as that in a heterologous HeLa cell extract. This result guarantees a limited usefulness of the HeLa cell extract in determining promotor sequence or analyzing general transcription machinery. In the homologous extracts, but not in the heterologous extract, however, it has been shown for the first time in vitro that the 5' flanking sequence upstream from -74 enhances the transcription initiation of fibroin gene. In addition, a remarkable fibroin gene preference in transcription over mouse beta globin and adenovirus 2 major late genes was observed in the homologous extracts. The fibroin gene preference is partly caused by the sequence element upstream from -74 of fibroin DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1544986566,"Shigella shigae cytotoxin was isolated from pressure-dialyzed culture medium and from a 26-year-old sample of partially purified toxin. The toxin was adsorbed to a column of acid-treated chitin at low salt concentration and eluted with 1 M NaCl. The partially purified toxin was labeled with 125 I and resubmitted to chromatography on acid-treated chitin. The labeled material eluted with 1 M NaCl was mixed with unlabeled rabbit hemoglobin as a carrier and the toxin was further purified by chromatography on a DE52 column and by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the pure Shigella toxin migrated as two bands corresponding to molecular weights of 30,500 and of about 11,000. The intact toxin may consist of one heavy chain and four to five copies of the light chain. In isoelectric focusing experiments, Shigella toxin was recovered from a broad zone between pH 5.8 and pH 7.5. This appears to be due to charge heterogeneities both in the large and the small chain. Most cell lines tested were completely resistant even to high concentrations of Shigella toxin. Vero cells and one strain of HeLa cells were very sensitive, 2.5 pg/ml of pure toxin induced 50% inhibition of protein synthesis overnight in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992607960,"We have studied a line of 3T6 mouse fibroblasts grown in progressively increasing concentrations of methotrexate. Initially, drug resistance results from amplification of the gene encoding the normal dihydrofolate reductase. Growth of these methotrexate-resistant populations at higher methotrexate concentrations results in the emergence of cells expressing high levels of dihydrofolate reductase with a reduced methotrexate affinity. Using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter, we demonstrate that the variant gene is not present in the population of cells resistant to lower levels of methotrexate, and hence we postulate that the mutational event occurred in cells already containing multiple normal dihydrofolate reductase genes. Growth of the variant cells in the absence of selection is associated with the permanent loss of the altered genes and the disappearance of double-minute chromosomes, on which these genes reside. The pattern of accumulation and loss of double-minute chromosomes is reproduced following transformation of methotrexate-sensitive cells with the altered genes. Our results are consistent with autonomous replication of double-minute chromosomes and a selective advantage of cells with the smallest number of extrachromosomal elements necessary for survival at a given methotrexate concentration."
https://openalex.org/W73472706,"scription in vitro in the presence of (CU-~~P)UTP. The 32P transcripts then were hybridized to immobilized recom- binant DNA containing the double-stranded transferrin cDNA sequence. Transcripts from control liver nuclei contained 0.009% transferrin mRNA; iron deficiency and estrogen treatment caused an increase in the rate of transferrin mRNA synthesis of 1.5- and 2-fold, re- spectively. These increases in the transcriptional activ- ity of the transferrin gene were accompanied by in- creases in the cellular level of transferrin mRNA, the rate of transferrin synthesis, and the concentration of serum transferrin. The combined treatment of iron de- ficiency and estrogen resulted in a synergistic response in all parameters of transferrin induction, including the rate of transferrin mRNA synthesis which increased 3.2-fold to 0.029% of total RNA synthesis. Although estrogen stimulation leads to a 40% decrease in liver non-heme iron, the estrogen-mediated induction of transferrin mRNA was not blocked when liver iron was maintained at high levels with injected ferritin. These results suggest that iron deficiency and estrogen inter- act with the liver transferrin gene through separate regulatory mechanisms. The transferrin gene is also expressed in oviduct and we compare and discuss the tissue-specific response of this gene to iron and steroid hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2013206801,"Zeins, the major endosperm proteins of maize, represent about 50% of total seed proteins and consist of several alcohol-soluble polypeptides encoded by at least four families of genes. The accumulation of zeins is under the control of several broadly defined regulatory genes. One of these, the opaque-2 mutant, lowers the level of zeins, thus improving the nutritional quality of maize meals. We demonstrate here that a salt-soluble protein of molecular weight 32,000 (b-32) is under control of O2. Seven o2 recessive alleles are CRM- when assayed with b-32 antibody. The O2 gene does not encode protein b-32, which apparently is the gene product of the O6 locus. 06 endosperms are CRM- for b-32 protein and are almost devoid of zeins. This indicates that b-32 plays an important role in accumulation of zeins."

https://openalex.org/W1571264337,"Nutritional iron deficiency was produced experimentally by raising newly hatched chicks on an iron-deficient diet for several weeks. During this time, hematocrit and hemoglobin values declined, iron stores were depleted, and the circulating level of transferrin increased 2- to 4-fold. The increase in serum transferrin was related to a similar increase in the rate of transferrin synthesis in liver. In addition, the level of transferrin mRNA sequences, as determined by hybridization to a specific cDNA, increased 2- to 3-fold, and more than 80% of the transferrin mRNA was associated with polyribosomes in both control and iron-deficient liver. These results demonstrate that the induction of transferrin synthesis in iron-deficient chicks is regulated directly by an increase in transferrin mRNA. The iron-mediated effects on transferrin also appear to be gene-specific since the rate of synthesis of serum albumin, the major secretory product of liver, was unaffected by any of the experimental conditions. Furthermore, when iron stores were rapidly replenished by the administration of iron-saturated ferritin, both the rate of transferrin synthesis and the level of transferrin mRNA returned to control values with 2 to 3 days."

https://openalex.org/W2126773761,"Cleavage stage mouse embryos were incubated with cytochalasin D, which inhibited cytokinesis, intercellular adhesion and junction formation but not aspects of the morphological polarization associated with compaction. If the drug was removed when controls had formed blastocysts, the embryos compacted within 1 hr, assembled junctional complexes at the apices of their cells and accumulated fluid to form “blastocyst-like vesicles” within the next 8 to 12 hr. The molecular and morphological development of these blastocyst-like vesicles and embryos cultured continuously in cytochalasin D followed the same temporal sequence as untreated controls, indicating that they are similar to normal intact blastocysts despite their decreased number of cells, altered ploidy and the absence of an overt inner cell mass. Since maturation of the embryo can take place in the absence of the intercellular features of compaction, the cellular polarization of blastomeres may be important for initiating the differentiation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm in the normal compacting morula."

From these stably suppressed hybrids, rare tumorigenic segregants have been isolated. We prepared antiserum against one tumorigenic segregant, ESH5T, by injecting live cells into rabbits, then absorbed this antiserum extensively against the corresponding nontumorigenic hybrid, ESH5, to remove any cross-reacting antigenic specificities. Immunoprecipitation of iodinated cell surface proteins with this absorbed antiserum revealed a 75 kilodalton (kd) protein on the cell surface of tumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrids and HeLa, but not on normal fibroblasts or any nontumorigenic hybrids examined. Under nonreducing conditions in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 75 kd protein migrated as a 150 kd dimer. Immunoprecipitation of cells metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine confirmed that the 75 kd protein is synthesized in tumorigenic cells but not in nontumorigenic hybrids or normal fibroblasts. Metabolic labeling with 32PO4 revealed that the 75 kd protein is phosphorylated, and immunoprecipitation of galactose-oxidase/3NaBH4-labeled cells with absorbed antiserum identified it as a glycoprotein. This protein does not appear to be a major cell surface iodinated component and represents only 0.03% of the total cellular protein. The exclusive correlation of the expression of this cell surface phosphoglycoprotein with tumorigenicity in HeLa-fibroblast hybrids suggests that it may be an important determinant for in vivo growth potential."

Comparison to the functional beta A gene indicates that these two pseudogenes share several identical mutations. These include alterations of the ATA box, an early frameshift mutation in exon 1 and alterations of the universal GT/AG excision sequence of IVS1. The shared deleterious mutations indicate that the two pseudogenes diverged from a common defective sequence. Comparison of the pseudogenes with the functional beta A and beta C genes reveal that the psi beta X-beta C pair and psi beta Z-beta A pair may have been created by a single en bloc duplication event. The persistence and duplication of defective sequences may indicate a role for these pseudogenes as a spacer or regulator."

https://openalex.org/W1572563309,"Transcarboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase catalyze the elimination of HF from beta-fluoropropionyl-CoA to form acrylyl-CoA. No carboxylation products of fluoropropionyl-CoA could be detected. The elimination proceeds at approximately the same rate as the normal carboxylation reactions. With propionyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP was required (HCO3- was also present) and was hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. The rate of ADP formation was equal to that of acrylyl-CoA formation. A previous report (Stubbe, J. A., and Abeles, R. H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8338--8340) that acrylyl-CoA formation is faster than ADP formation is in error. With transcarboxylase, oxalacetate was required for acrylyl-CoA formation, and pyruvate was produced. The rate of pyruvate formation was equal to that of acrylyl-CoA formation. We conclude that the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the elimination of HF from beta-fluoropropionyl-CoA indicates that the enzyme can catalyze the abstraction of the substrate alpha-proton without concomitant carboxylation of the substrate. We also conclude that the normal catalytic reaction, therefore, probably involves a carbanion intermediate and does not proceed through a concerted process as has frequently been proposed."

When bone marrow cells from these mice were subjected to a single wash in alpha medium, the proportion of BFU-E synthesizing DNA dramatically rose to levels as high as those normally seen among the BFU-E of congenic B6.S mice of genotype Fv2ss (sensitive to Friend erythroleukemia virus). Washing Fv2rr marrow cells did not significantly affect the proportion of CFU-S, CFU-nm (CFU-C) or CFU-E engaged in DNA synthesis. An activity responsible for keeping low the proportion of BFU-E in DNA synthesis was recovered in supernatants of Fv2rr (but not Fv2ss) bone marrow cells; its effect could be demonstrated on the BFU-E of either Fv2rr or Fv2ss washed bone marrow cells. This activity was nontoxic to the BFU-E, rapidly reversible and effective at, but not far below, the concentrations normally found in adult Fv2rr marrow. It was stable to 56°C for 30 min, was nondialyzable, appeared in the void volume on G-25 Sephadex gel filtration and could be filtered through membranes that permitted passage of particles of less than 100,000 but not less than 50,000 daltons. Thus the Fv2 locus (or a locus closely linked to it) appears to act not in the BFU-E itself, but elsewhere, to control the amount or activity of a macromolecular negative regulator to which the BFU-E population responds by a reduction in the proportion synthesizing DNA. This study reveals the existence of a negative growth control mechanism for early erythropoletic progenitor cells, which is apparently physiological in nature and under strict genetic control."
https://openalex.org/W1981234720,"Tetrahymena thermophila cells transferred from growth medium into a dilute salt (starvation) medium shortly (∼6–8 hrs) become more resistant to the in vivo inhibitory effects of the antibiotics cycloheximide, tetracycline and emetine. They also become more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of paromomycin and anisomycin. By comparing ribosomes from growing and starved cells we have found that for at least two of these drugs differences between growing cell and starved cell ribosomes exist with respect to drug-ribosome interactions. In addition, we found that isolated monosomic ribosomes from starved cells are more resistant to thermal denaturation than are monosomic ribosomes from growing cells. The kinetics of all these changes following transfer of growing cells to starvation medium is the same and correlates with a change in the extent of phosphorylation of a single small subunit ribosomal protein. As judged by our in vitro assays, enzymatic removal of this phosphate converts “starved cell” ribosomes into “growing cell” ribosomes. We have extended these studies to show that the phenomenon of drug adaptation in Tetrahymena, at least with respect to cycloheximide, is associated with this ribosome phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1566921791,"Perfusion of rabbit kidney ex vivo, removed 72 h after ureter obstruction, results in a dose-dependent increase in bioassayable prostaglandin Ez (PGE2). In addition, there are progressive increases in PGEz release with time and by 5 h of perfusion, there is a markedly enhanced PGEz release in response to bradykinin. Previous work has demonstrated that this increased basal and hormone-stimulated PGEz biosynthesis is in part dependent on de novo synthesis of cyclooxygenase. Measurement of arachidonic acid released into the venous effluent as a marker of renal phosphatide acyl hydrolase activity following bradykinin stimulation of the perfused kidneys showed dose-dependent release of arachidonic acid that was markedly enhanced by 5 h of perfusion. Kidneys removed from normal rabbits exhibited dose-dependent release of arachidonic acid in response to bradykinin with no enhancement by 5 h of perfusion. The ureter-obstructed kidney exhibited a time-dependent enhanced arachidonic acid release reflecting increase phosphatide acyl hydrolase activation, which was inhibitable by cycloheximide, thus suggesting that the enhanced arachidonate release was dependent on de novo synthesis of phosphatide acyl hydrolase. Thus, perfusion of the hydronephrotic kidney apparently results in the simultaneous induction of new protein synthesis of phosphatide acyl hydrolase, cyclooxygenase, and thromboxane synthetase. Earlier studies have demonstrated enhanced prostaglandin biosynthesis in response to peptide stimulation in the isolated perfused kidney of the rabbit perfused ex vivo 72 h after unilateral ureteral ligation in vivo (1). Furthermore, ureteral ligation unmasked the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 (2,3). Inhibition of the endogenous cyclooxygenase (in vivo) with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), which irreversibly acetylates this regulatory enzyme in the cascade of prostaglandin biosynthesis (4), inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis by 95% very early in perfusion (5). During the perfusions, however, there was a progressive increase in basal and bradykinin-stimulated prostaglandin biosynthesis after a 60- to 90-min delay which suggested that there was new cyclooxygenase being synthesized and further experiments confirmed that this was dependent on de novo synthesis of new enzyme (5).

Thus, the above experiments did not exclude alterations in phosphatide acyl hydrolase activity. We therefore measured the release of endogenous arachidonic acid from peptide-stimulated perfused rabbit kidneys after 72-h ureter obstruction with the assumption that release of arachidonic acid is an indirect measure of phosphatide acyl hydrolase activity.

This result, together with our previous observation that deuterium of [2-2H1]isobutyrate was lost before the formation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, indicates that isobutyric acid is dehydrogenated stereospecifically at the (2-pro-S)methyl and alpha-methine groups.
