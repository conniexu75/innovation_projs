https://openalex.org/W2011403734,"We examined the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in preventing apoptosis in primary human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells. VEGF was capable of preventing serum starvation-induced apoptosis at concentrations between 10 and 100 ng/ml. The addition of VEGF to serum-starved HUVE cells led to a 5.2-fold induction of Bcl-2 after 36 h and to a transient, 2.4-fold induction of A1 after a 7-h incubation, as quantitated by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 2–3-fold induction of Bcl-2 protein after 18–36 h of exposure to VEGF and a transient induction of A1 after 7 h of VEGF stimulation. Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-2 by means of transient biolistic transfection experiments of HUVE cells was sufficient to prevent endothelial cells from apoptotic cell death in the absence of VEGF. These findings indicate that Bcl-2 plays an important role in mediating the survival activity of VEGF on endothelial cells.

These findings indicate that Bcl-2 plays an important role in mediating the survival activity of VEGF on endothelial cells. Bcl-2 belongs to a growing family of apoptosis regulatory gene products, which may either be death antagonists (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, Brag-1, Mcl-1, and A1) or death agonists (Bax, Bak, Bcl-Xs, Bad, Bid, Bik, and Hrk; for review, see Ref. 1Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is an intracellular protein that localizes to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear envelope (2Monaghan P. Robertson D. Amos T.A.S. Dyer M.J.S. Mason D.Y. Greaves M.F. J.

In vitro, many growth factors and cytokines have been shown to promote survival in different cell lines tested by activation of the Ras–Raf–mitogen-activated protein kinase module (for review, see Refs. 6Cobb M.H.

However, the mechanisms by which growth factors control proliferation and regression of endothelial cells remain poorly understood. In human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells, 1The abbreviations used are: HUVE cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: HUVE cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescent protein. increased levels of apoptosis and necrosis were observed when cells were incubated with lipopolysaccharide. Vitamins C and E reduced the levels of apoptosis, which was paralleled by an increase in Bcl-2 expression and a decrease in Bax protein levels (8Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of HUVE cells with transforming growth factor-β, decreased levels of Bcl-2 correlated with increased levels of apoptotic cell death (9Tsukada T. Eguchi K. Migita K. Kawabe Y. Kawakami A. Matsuoka N. Takashima H. Mizokami A. Nagataki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 2-Methoxyestradiol was found to induce apoptosis of cultured bovine pulmonary endothelial cells (10Yue T.L. Wang X. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G. Feuerstein G.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A1, a homolog of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins originally cloned from phorbol ester-stimulated endothelial cells, was shown to be induced by the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 (11Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Infection of microvascular endothelial cells with retroviral constructs encoding A1 led to inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death in the presence of actinomycin D (11Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Similar findings were reported when Bcl-2 was overexpressed by means of retroviral infection of murine aortic endothelial cells. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 prevented apoptosis of these cells when cultured in fibroblast growth factor-depleted medium (12Kondo S. Yin D. Aoki T. Takahashi J.A. Morimura T. Takeuchi J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The endothelial cell-specific mitogen vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be a key positive regulator of normal and pathological angiogenesis (13Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that VEGF may also act as a survival factor for newly formed blood vessels. In the developing retina, vascular regression in response to hyperoxia has been correlated with inhibition of VEGF release by glial cells (14Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies results in regression of established tumor-associated vasculature in xenograft models (15Yuan F. Chen Y. Dellian M. Safabakhsh N. Ferrara N. Jain R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14765-14770Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). More recently, using a tetracycline-regulated VEGF expression system in xenografted C6 glioma cells, it has been shown that decreased levels of VEGF production lead to detachment of endothelial cells from the walls of preformed vessels in the tumor (16Benjamin L.E. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We have found recently that VEGF can counteract endothelial cell apoptosis induced upon serum starvation of HUVE cells in culture (see Fig. 3). 2H. P. Gerber, A. McMurtrey, H. Nguyen, Y. Minhong, V. Dixit, and N. Ferrara, submitted for publication.2H. P. Gerber, A. McMurtrey, H. Nguyen, Y. Minhong, V. Dixit, and N. Ferrara, submitted for publication. This survival activity was critically dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In this report, we found increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins A1 and Bcl-2 but not Bax or Bcl-XL upon challenging primary HUVE cells with VEGF. Thus Bcl-2 and A1 are two novel VEGF target genes. HUVE cells, human microvascular endothelial cells, and CS-C medium were purchased from Cell System (Kirkland, WA). HUVE cells are pooled primary isolates from 300 individual donor umbilical veins. Cells were maintained in CS-C complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and mitogens, according to the recommendations of the supplier. 24 h before initiation of serum starvation, cells were treated with trypsin and plated to a density of 20–25 × 103 cells/cm2 on six-well dishes (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis) or 6-cm dishes (biolistic transfection experiments). Immediately before the experiment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. For serum starvation, CS-C medium without serum and mitogen, complemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, was added for the indicated amount of time. After biolistic transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in medium containing 10% serum. After washing the cells twice with Tris-buffered saline, minimal medium (without mitogen and serum) complemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added, and the levels of apoptosis were analyzed 24 h after induction of serum starvation. HUVE cells were initially expanded for 8–10 days in the presence of completed medium. Routinely, cells between passages 4 and 10 were used in the different experimental procedures. 24 h before serum starvation, cells were split and seeded in complete medium at a density of 200,000 cells/well in six-well plates, following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were washed for 5 min before adding Cell System basic medium complemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After incubations of various duration, cells were harvested by the STAT 60 method (TEL-TEST “B”, Inc., Friendswood, TX), and total RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RNA was dissolved in 50 μl of H2O, and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometer (A 260/280 nm). To monitor gene expression we used real time RT-PCR analysis. This novel approach has been described previously (18Gerber H.-P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA was added to a 50-μl RT-PCR (PCR-Access, Promega). The reaction master mix was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol to give final concentrations of 1 × avian myeloblastosis virus/Tfl reaction buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 unit/ml avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 0.1 unit/μl Tfl DNA polymerase, a 250 nm concentration of the primers, and a 200 nm concentration of the corresponding probe. Primers and probes for real time PCR analysis Bcl-2, A1,Bax, and Bad genes were designed by the Primer Express Program according to Heid et al. (19Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4940) Google Scholar). For sequence information of all oligonucleotides, see TableI. The primers for the humanBcl-2 gene were HUMBCL-2 555.F and HUMBCL-2 639.R, and the probe was HUMBCL-2 598.FP. For A1 analysis, the following primers were used: HUMA1 14.F and HUMA1 131.R; the probe was HUMA1 59.FP. For Bcl-XL analysis we used HSBCLXL 408.F and HSBCLXL 851.R primers, the probe was HSBCLXL 585.FP. For Bax-Aanalysis, we used HUMBAXA 155.F and HUMBAXA 301.R as primers and HUMBAXA 235.FP as probe. Primers and probes were synthesized at Genentech using conventional nucleic acid synthesis chemistry. The β-actin primer and probe (TaqMan β-actin detection reagents) were purchased from Perkin-Elmer.Table ISequences of oligonucleotide primers and real time RT-PCR probesHUMBCL-2 598.FP5′(FAM)-TGT GCG CGC GTA TAA ATT GCC GA-(TAMRA)p3′HUMBCL-2 555.FAAG CGG TCC CGT GGA TAG AHUMBCL-2 639.RTCC GGT ATT CGC AGA AGT CCHSBCLXL 585.FP5′(FAM)-TGC GTG GAA AGC GTA GAC AAG GAG ATG C-(TAMRA)p3′HSBCLXL 408.FGAG GCA GGC GAC GAG TTT GAAHSBCLXL 851.RGGG GTG GGA GGG TAG AGT GGAHUMA1 59.FP5′(FAM)-TGC TCT CCA CCA GGC AGA AGA TGA CA-(TAMRA)p3′HUMA1 14.FCAG CAC ATT GCC TCA ACA GCHUMA1 131.RTGC AGA TAG TCC TGA GCC AGCHUMBAXA 235.FP5′(FAM)-ATG ATT GCC GCC GTG GAC ACA GAC TCC-(TAMRA)p3′HSBAXA 155.FAGG ATG CGT CCA CCA AGA AGHSBAXA 301.RCCA GTT GAA GTT GCC GTC AGA Open table in a new tab RT-PCRs and the resulting relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission were monitored in real time by the 7700 sequence detector (Perkin-Elmer). Signals were analyzed by the sequence detector 1.6 program (Perkin-Elmer). Conditions were as follows: one cycle at 48 °C for 45 min; one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min. Data were generated as indicated in the legend to Fig.1. Cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, and 0.6 ml of RIPA buffer (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm sodium orthovanadate) containing freshly added protease inhibitors was added. Mouse monoclonal antibody directed against human Bcl-2 (Bcl-2(100)) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody against human A1 (A1(N-20)) was from the same manufacturer. The secondary antibody to Bcl-2(100) was goat anti-mouse Ig (biotin-labeled) from Southern Biotechnologies (Birmingham, AL). The secondary antibody to A1(N-20) was biotinylated anti-goat IgG from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Total endothelial cell extract, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotting, and immunodetection were performed according to the Santa Cruz Biotechnology protocol. 60 μg of whole cell extract was loaded on each lane of a 4–16% polyacrylamide gel. The ECL reaction kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and horseradish peroxidase streptavidin from Vector Laboratories was used. Experiments were done using the Bio-Rad 500 optimization kit in the Biolistic PDS-1000/He* Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). In a series of pilot experiments using luciferase reporter gene DNA, conditions were established which yield the highest levels of luciferase activity in HUVE cells (data not shown). The settings used are as follows: particle size, 1.0 μm; rupture disc, 1,100 p.s.i.; bombardment chamber vacuum, 25 mmHg; and target shelf position 3 (from the top). Gold particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations and stored as 50-μl aliquots for several months at −20 °C. Aliquots were coated with DNA immediately before gene transfer following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, for five samples, a 50-μl aliquot of gold particles was Vortex mixed for 3 min, and plasmid DNA (1 mg/ml) was added to a total of 10 μg. Vortexing was continued for 2 min. Thereafter, 100 μl of a 2.5m CaCl2 solution was added to the mix. After 2 min of additional vortexing, 20 μl of a freshly prepared 0.1m spermidine solution was added followed by 2 min of constant vortexing. The mixture was allowed to settle for 1 min before tubes were centrifuged for 5 s in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the gold pellet was washed first with 140 μl of 70% EtOH followed by 140 μl of 100% EtOH. After removing the supernatant, the gold particles were taken up in 55 μl of 100% EtOH, and 10 μl was used per biolistic transfection. Immediately after bombardment, 5 ml of complemented medium was added. To find putative VEGF target genes mediating the VEGF survival activity, we analyzed total RNA of HUVE cells treated with VEGF by quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan). We designed primer probe sets for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of genes known to be involved in mediating antiapoptotic activities such as Bcl-2,A1, Bcl-XL, or apoptosis-inducing genes such asBax (for sequence information, see Table I). In the primary human endothelial cell types tested, umbilical vein and lung microvascular endothelial cells, we have observed induction ofBcl-2 as early as 7 h after the addition of VEGF (Fig.1 and data not shown). The levels of Bcl-2 in HUVE cells increased over time and reached 5.2-fold after 33 h of incubation with VEGF. No significant induction of A1 orBcl-2 message in response to VEGF stimulation was observed when endothelial cells were grown in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (data not shown). Interestingly, the A1 message was transiently increased 2.4-fold after 7 h of VEGF addition and decreased after prolonged incubation time. In a previous report, Northern blots of HUVE cells did not reveal an increase in the A1 message after incubation with a mixture of VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor for 3 h (20Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The failure to observe increased levels for A1 message in response to VEGF may be caused by the decreased sensitivity of the Northern blot analysis, or because the cells were exposed to a mixture of basic fibroblast growth factor (4 ng/ml) and VEGF (10 ng/ml), or because of the different incubation length with VEGF (3 hversus 7 h). When we analyzed total RNA from HUVE cells for Bcl-XL andBax expression, we could not detect any significant change in their expression levels in response to VEGF under serum starvation conditions (data not shown). To verify if increased expression of A1 and Bcl-2in response to VEGF stimulation is also reflected in increased protein levels, we performed Western blot experiments with whole cell extracts of HUVE cells cultured under the same conditions as those employed for the RT-PCR analysis. We found a direct correlation between the mRNA and the protein levels (Fig. 2) of Bcl-2 and A1 in human endothelial cells in response to VEGF stimulation. These findings suggest that VEGF exerts its up-regulatory activity on the Bcl-2 and A1 genes primarily at the transcriptional level. We found decreased levels of Bcl-2 and A1 proteins in endothelial cells cultured in the absence of VEGF, suggesting that these genes may be involved in mediating survival activity of VEGF on endothelial cells (Fig.3).2 It has been shown previously that A1 levels are induced upon incubation of human endothelial cells to inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, and a possible role for theA1 gene in inflammation was suggested. By taking advantage of the biolistic transfection technique to transiently transfect primary human endothelial cells, we wanted to test whether Bcl-2 was sufficient to mediate survival in our assay conditions. Transfected endothelial cells were identified by cotransfection of an expression vector for green fluorescent protein (pEGFP, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) 24 h after the beginning of serum starvation and identified by fluorescence microscopy. To assess the effects of Bcl-2, we scored transfected cells in a blinded manner as healthy or apoptotic by morphology (21Li Y. Horwitz M.S. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Healthy endothelial cells are flat and well attached to the plate. Apoptotic endothelial cells are rounded, and some are fragmenting with the small cytoplasmic blebs that are characteristic of apoptosis. When we stained the cells with the DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258), apoptotic endothelial cells showed pronounced nuclear condensations. As shown in Fig. 3, Bcl-2 was sufficient to inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis in the absence of VEGF. We have observed lower levels of apoptosis when cells were transfected with Bcl-2 compared with untransfected cells grown in the presence of VEGF (100 ng/ml) or 10% fetal calf serum. These findings suggest that the levels of Bcl-2 are critical for endothelial cell survival when cultured under serum starvation conditions. VEGF exerts its biological effects by binding to its respective transmembrane receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR, which are expressed mainly on endothelial cells. Stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF and subsequent immunoblot analysis demonstrated that VEGF induces phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, p190-rhoGAP, p62, PLC-y, the oncogenic adaptor protein NcK, p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125 FAK), paxilin, and several others (22Terman B.I.

Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways involved in mediating the various biologic functions of VEGF on endothelial cells such as migration, proliferation, or survival remain to be characterized. Both VEGF receptors, Flk-1/KDR and Flt-1, were found previously to be expressed on HUVE cells by cell binding and cross-linking studies with VEGF or the Flt-1-specific ligand PlGF (32Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by RT-PCR analysis (18Gerber H.-P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The HUVE cells used in our experiments were pooled primary isolates from 300 individual donor umbilical veins and thus are likely to represent an average population of endothelial cells. Upon incubation of primary human endothelial cells with VEGF, we found increased expression of two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and A1. The increase in Bcl-2 message in response to VEGF can reflect the sum of an increase in the transcriptional level as well as an increase in RNA stability. The overall increase of the Bcl-2 protein observed in these cells may represent higher levels of Bcl-2 mRNA as well as the result of an increase in the protein stability. Recently, several reports identified altered Bcl-2 levels in endothelial cells engaged in physiologic as well as pathologic angiogenesis. In human corpora lutea, Bcl-2 was found to be expressed in the vascular endothelium of some luteal arterioles and venules (33Rodger F.E. Fraser H.M. Duncan W.C. Illingworth P.J. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During normal luteal phase or after treatment with chorionic gonadotrophin, the corpus luteum undergoes a rapid and massive increase in size and vasculature. This process was completely inhibited by administration of a truncated soluble Flt-1 receptor in a rat model of hormonally induced ovulation (34Ferrara N. Chen H. Davis-Smyth T. Gerber H.P. Nguyen T.H. Peers D. Chisholm V. Hillan K.J. Schwall R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). These findings indirectly suggested a correlation between the levels of VEGF and Bcl-2 in endothelial cells. However, the numbers of blood vessels exhibiting Bcl-2 staining showed little variation throughout the luteal phase implying that other mechanisms are involved in luteal maintenance (33Rodger F.E. Fraser H.M. Duncan W.C. Illingworth P.J. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An increase in the levels of Bcl-2 expression within the vascular endothelial spindle-shaped cells in Kaposi sarcoma lesions in humans was observed, indicating that up-regulation of Bcl-2 may be important in the pathogenesis of both classical and AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma (35Morris C.B. Gendelman R. Marrogi A.J. Lu M. Lockyer J.M. Alperin-Lea W. Ensoli B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1055-1063PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, overexpression of Bcl-2 in a bovine endothelial cell line blocked the effects of oxidative stress such as lipid peroxidation. In these cells, Bcl-2 also blocked hyperglycemia-induced formation of advanced glycation end products, which are thought to cause tissue damage observed in diabetes-associated hyperglycemia (36Giardino I. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The identification of two novel VEGF target genes, Bcl-2 andA1, appears timely, given the emerging concepts that VEGF is a survival factor for endothelial cells2 and that VEGF withdrawal may result in regression of the vasculature in several cases (14Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 15Yuan F. Chen Y. Dellian M. Safabakhsh N. Ferrara N. Jain R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1997; 94: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The role of Bcl-2 in endothelial cells during pathologic and physiologic neoangiogenesis or during vessel regression remains to be analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2059831206,"An enzyme having the samel-cysteine desulfurization activity previously described for the NifS protein was purified from a strain ofAzotobacter vinelandii deleted for the nifSgene. This protein was designated IscS to indicate its proposed role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Like NifS, IscS is a pyridoxal-phosphate containing homodimer. Information gained from microsequencing of oligopeptides obtained by tryptic digestion of purified IscS was used to design a strategy for isolation and DNA sequence analysis of a 7,886-base pair A. vinelandii genomic segment that includes the iscS gene. The iscS gene is contained within a gene cluster that includes homologs to nifU and another gene contained within the major nif cluster ofA. vinelandii previously designated orf6. These genes have been designated iscU and iscA,respectively. Information available from complete genome sequences ofEscherichia coli and Hemophilus influenzaereveals that they also encode iscSUA gene clusters. A wide conservation of iscSUA genes in nature and evidence that NifU and NifS participate in the mobilization of iron and sulfur for nitrogenase-specific iron-sulfur cluster formation suggest that the products of the iscSUA genes could play a general role in the formation or repair of iron-sulfur clusters. The proposal that IscS is involved in mobilization of sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster formation in A. vinelandii is supported by the presence of acysE-like homolog in another gene cluster located immediately upstream from the one containing the iscSUAgenes. O-Acetylserine synthase is the product of thecysE gene, and it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cysteine biosynthesis. A similar cysE-like gene is also located within the nif gene cluster of A. vinelandii. The likely role of such cysE-like gene products is to increase the cysteine pool needed for iron-sulfur cluster formation. Another feature of the iscSUA gene cluster region from A. vinelandii is that E. coli genes previously designated as hscB,hscA, and fdx are located immediately downstream from, and are probably co-transcribed with, theiscSUA genes. The hscB, hscA, andfdx genes are also located adjacent to theiscSUA genes in both E. coli and H. influenzae. The E. coli hscA and hscBgene products have previously been shown to bear primary sequence identity when respectively compared with the dnaK anddnaJ gene products and have been proposed to be members of a heat-shock-cognate molecular chaperone system of unknown function. The close proximity and apparent co-expression of iscSUAand hscBA in A. vinelandii indicate that the proposed chaperone function of the hscBA gene products could be related to the maturation of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. Attempts to place non-polar insertion mutations within eitherA. vinelandii iscS or hscA revealed that such mutations could not be stably maintained in the absence of the corresponding wild-type allele. These results reveal a very strong selective pressure against the maintenance of A. vinelandii iscS or hscA knock-out mutations and suggest that such mutations are either lethal or highly deleterious. In contrast toiscS or hscA, a strain having a polar insertion mutation within the cysE-like gene was readily isolated and could be stably maintained. These results show that thecysE-like gene located upstream from iscS is not essential for cell growth and that the cysE-like gene and the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx genes are contained within separate transcription units. An enzyme having the samel-cysteine desulfurization activity previously described for the NifS protein was purified from a strain ofAzotobacter vinelandii deleted for the nifSgene. This protein was designated IscS to indicate its proposed role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Like NifS, IscS is a pyridoxal-phosphate containing homodimer. Information gained from microsequencing of oligopeptides obtained by tryptic digestion of purified IscS was used to design a strategy for isolation and DNA sequence analysis of a 7,886-base pair A. vinelandii genomic segment that includes the iscS gene. The iscS gene is contained within a gene cluster that includes homologs to nifU and another gene contained within the major nif cluster ofA. vinelandii previously designated orf6. These genes have been designated iscU and iscA,respectively. Information available from complete genome sequences ofEscherichia coli and Hemophilus influenzaereveals that they also encode iscSUA gene clusters. A wide conservation of iscSUA genes in nature and evidence that NifU and NifS participate in the mobilization of iron and sulfur for nitrogenase-specific iron-sulfur cluster formation suggest that the products of the iscSUA genes could play a general role in the formation or repair of iron-sulfur clusters. The proposal that IscS is involved in mobilization of sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster formation in A. vinelandii is supported by the presence of acysE-like homolog in another gene cluster located immediately upstream from the one containing the iscSUAgenes. O-Acetylserine synthase is the product of thecysE gene, and it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cysteine biosynthesis. A similar cysE-like gene is also located within the nif gene cluster of A. vinelandii. The likely role of such cysE-like gene products is to increase the cysteine pool needed for iron-sulfur cluster formation. Another feature of the iscSUA gene cluster region from A. vinelandii is that E. coli genes previously designated as hscB,hscA, and fdx are located immediately downstream from, and are probably co-transcribed with, theiscSUA genes. The hscB, hscA, andfdx genes are also located adjacent to theiscSUA genes in both E. coli and H. influenzae. The E. coli hscA and hscBgene products have previously been shown to bear primary sequence identity when respectively compared with the dnaK anddnaJ gene products and have been proposed to be members of a heat-shock-cognate molecular chaperone system of unknown function. The close proximity and apparent co-expression of iscSUAand hscBA in A. vinelandii indicate that the proposed chaperone function of the hscBA gene products could be related to the maturation of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. Attempts to place non-polar insertion mutations within eitherA. vinelandii iscS or hscA revealed that such mutations could not be stably maintained in the absence of the corresponding wild-type allele. These results reveal a very strong selective pressure against the maintenance of A. vinelandii iscS or hscA knock-out mutations and suggest that such mutations are either lethal or highly deleterious. In contrast toiscS or hscA, a strain having a polar insertion mutation within the cysE-like gene was readily isolated and could be stably maintained. These results show that thecysE-like gene located upstream from iscS is not essential for cell growth and that the cysE-like gene and the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx genes are contained within separate transcription units. Iron-sulfur clusters ([Fe-S] clusters) are found in numerous proteins that have important redox, catalytic, or regulatory properties, yet the mechanism(s) by which such clusters are formed or repaired in vivo is not known. We have previously characterized the nifU and nifS gene products (NifU and NifS) that are proposed to have specific roles in the formation or repair of the [Fe-S] cores of metalloclusters contained within the catalytic components of nitrogenase (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 2Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13445-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). NifS is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); IAEDANS,N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine.-dependentl-cysteine desulfurase (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), and it is able to catalyze thein vitro reconstitution of an apo-form of the nitrogenase Fe protein whose [4Fe-4S] cluster has been removed by chelation (3Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active species in this reaction is an enzyme-bound persulfide that is formed through nucleophilic attack by an active site cysteine on the PLP-substrate cysteine adduct (4Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although the specific role of NifU is not yet known, we have suggested that it might function either to deliver the iron necessary for [Fe-S] cluster formation or to provide an intermediate site for [Fe-S] cluster assembly (2Fu W. Jack R.F. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13445-13463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the turnover rate for nitrogenase is so slow (6Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), cells that depend on nitrogen fixation as their sole source of metabolic nitrogen must accumulate large amounts of the nitrogenase polypeptides. For example, the nitrogenase Fe protein and MoFe protein comprise approximately 5–10% of the total soluble protein fraction in nitrogen fixing Azotobacter vinelandii cells (6Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because each Fe protein contains four iron and four inorganic sulfur atoms, and each MoFe protein αβ-unit contains 15 iron and 16 inorganic sulfur atoms (7Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2965-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), this situation must place a great demand on the physiological mobilization of the iron and sulfur necessary for the maturation of the nitrogenase catalytic components. Thus, we have suggested the possibility that the reactions catalyzed by NifU and NifS might represent a specialized way to boost the mobilization of iron and sulfur necessary for nitrogenase maturation and that there might also be NifU- and NifS-like “housekeeping” counterparts involved in the formation or repair of [Fe-S] clusters present in other iron-sulfur proteins (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 5Dean D.R. Bolin J.T. Zheng L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6737-6744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support these ideas. First, a requirement for a boost in the mobilization of sulfur for [Fe-S] cluster assembly under nitrogen fixing conditions is indicated by the presence of a nif-specific cysE-like homolog inA. vinelandii (8Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 117: 1017-1027Crossref Google Scholar, 9Evans D.J. Jones R. Woodley P.R. Wilborn J.R. Robson R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5457-5469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) The cysE gene product encodes an O-acetylserine synthase that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cysteine biosynthesis (10Denk D. Bock A.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in cysteine formation when A. vinelandii is grown under nitrogen fixing conditions probably occurs in response to a demand for NifS activity which utilizes l-cysteine as substrate in the mobilization of sulfur for nitrogenase [Fe-S] cluster formation. Second, we have purified a NifS-like protein from the non-nitrogen fixing organism Escherichia coli and have shown that this protein is also able to activate sulfur for [Fe-S] cluster formationin vitro (11Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Third, genome sequencing projects have revealed the presence of NifU- and NifS-like homologs in a variety of other non-nitrogen fixing organisms, including E. coli (12Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G.

In the present work we have identified and sequenced a genomic region from A. vinelandii that encodes genes that are homologous tonifS, nifU, as well as other genes whose products could have roles in the maturation of [Fe-S] cluster-containing proteins. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Assays for cysteine desulfurase activity (IscS activity) were conducted by following the production of alanine, sulfur, and S2− from l-cysteine as described previously (16Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Miller T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16053-16067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For assay of IscS purified from A. vinelandii, PLP was added to a concentration of 10 μm. Protein was measured by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar).A. vinelandii cells were cultured in Burke media (18Strandberg G.W. Wilson P.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1968; 14: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and grown at 30 °C, and E. coli was cultured in LB media and also grown at 30 °C. For antibiotic resistance selection, kanamycin was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. For purification of IscS from A. vinelandii strain DJ116 (ΔnifS) (19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), approximately 1 kg of cell paste of strain DJ116 was mixed with 2 volumes of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and ruptured in a microfluidizer. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation. A solution of 10 mg/ml protamine sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant to give a final protamine sulfate concentration that was 5% by weight of the total protein in the sample. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was applied to a 5-liter Q-Sepharose column and eluted with the above buffer that contained a linear gradient of increasing KCl. Fractions were assayed for l-cysteine desulfurase (IscS) activity, and fractions from the large peak of activity were pooled. After bringing the pooled fraction to 10% w/v in (NH4)2SO4, it was applied to a 3.5-liter phenyl-Sepharose column and eluted with a decreasing (NH4)2SO4 gradient. Fractions exhibiting IscS activity were pooled, dialyzed, and loaded onto a 400-ml Sigma Green 19 column and subsequently eluted with an increasing KCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Superdex 25/600 column and eluted with buffer. Active fractions from the Superdex column were pooled and chromatographed on a 20-ml Mono-Q column using a linear increasing KCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled, and the protein was concentrated to about 10 mg/ml and pelleted in liquid N2 until used. Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose columns were run at room temperature using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech BioPilot system and the other columns were run at 4 °C using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC. In addition to normal activity assays, purification of IscS was monitored by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis using the lead stain method (20Kredich N.M. Keenan B.S. Foote L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7157-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to identify the band that exhibits IscS activity (i.e. release of S2− from l-cysteine) and by denaturing gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant IscS produced in E. coli was performed as described previously for NifS (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), except that the phenyl-Superose step was replaced by Sephacryl S-300 HR chromatography. The very high level of accumulation of IscS expressed in E. coli using a hybrid T7-7 plasmid construct (described below) was about the same as for NifS when it was recombinantly produced in the same way (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Because of the abundance of IscS produced in this way, its purification could be monitored by the yellow color of its PLP cofactor and by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of sample fractions. Tryptic peptides of IscS purified from A. vinelandii were generated by digestion of a reduced and alkylated (by iodoacetamide) sample with trypsin. The oligopeptides were separated on a Vydac C-18 column using a Waters high pressure liquid chromatograph. To identify the reactive cysteine residue, the protein was treated with 1.2 eq ofN-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine) (I-AEDANS) before alkylation by iodoacetamide. Oligopeptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography as above, and the fluorescent oligopeptide fraction was identified by illumination with a UV lamp. Microsequence analysis was performed on a Beckman LF3000 gas-phase sequencer equipped with a Beckman System Gold 125S pump module, Beckman PTH Microcolumn, and a 166 UV detector module. The molecular weight of several of the isolated oligopeptide fragments was determined by infusion electrospray into a Micromass Trio-2000 quadropole mass spectrometer. Oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a segment of the iscS gene from A. vinelandii DJ116 genomic DNA were designed based on the sequence of tryptic peptide fragments of IscS as described above and from the known codon usage bias for A. vinelandii genes (8Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 117: 1017-1027Crossref Google Scholar). The PCR primers used were 5′-GCNACCACCCC(g/c)GTNGA(t/c)CC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GAANGC(t/c)TCNCCCATNCCNACGAT-3′ (reverse primer). “N” refers to any nucleotide, and lowercase letters in parentheses indicate a degeneracy for the two nucleotides indicated at that position. A Stratagene Robocycler Gradient 40 thermocycler was used to amplify a 0.72-kb segment of DNA. The 100-μl PCR reaction mixture contained 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, and 0.8 μm of each primer. Cycling temperatures were 94 °C for 1.5 min, 65 °C for 2.5 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The 0.72-kb PCR product was treated with T4 polymerase before ligating it into the cloning vector pUC118 (22Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) that had been digested with the restriction enzymeHincII. This hybrid plasmid is designated pDB918. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was determined by the Sanger dideoxy method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). A genomic library of DJ116 DNA was prepared by partially digesting chromosomal DNA with XhoI, and the sticky ends of the fragments were partially filled by incubation with T4polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 1 mm dCTP and dTTP. The λ-DASH-II cloning vector DNA obtained from Stratagene was digested with BamHI, and its sticky ends were partially filled by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mm dATP and dGTP. A mixture of ligated vector and target DNA was packaged into λ phage using the Stratagene Gigapack II system using the conditions recommended by the supplier. The library had a titer of 1.5 × 105plaques/ml lysate, and the average insert size was about 20 kb. The phage were plated on LB medium using XL1-blue MRA cells (Stratagene) as recipient, and DNA was lifted from plaques using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hybond-N+ membranes. DNA was denatured by placing the membranes on top of a 0.5 n NaOH-saturated Whatman paper for 5 min and then washed in 75 mm sodium citrate, 750 mmNaCl, pH 7.0, for 1 min. The library was screened using the cloned 0.72-kb PCR-amplified DNA fragment as probe. Screening was done using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit following procedures recommended by the supplier. Prehybridization was done for 1 h at 42 °C, and hybridization was done for 4 h at the same temperature. Following the washing step and the color development step, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film overnight. Twelve positive plaques were identified in the initial screen. A second screening was performed using phage that were diluted from four positives detected in the original screening procedure. DNA was prepared from eight positive individual plaques identified in the second screen for further verification. Restriction enzyme mapping of DNA prepared from these samples revealed that three different overlapping genomic regions had been cloned. Southern analysis using the 0.72-kb fragment showed hybridization to a 4.0-kb EcoRI restriction enzyme fragment. This fragment could not be stably cloned into pUC119, but it was found that a 2.5-kb EcoRI-SstI fragment, which also contained iscS and flanking regions, could be stably cloned. This fragment was subsequently ligated intoEcoRI-SstI-digested pUC119 and the resultant plasmid designated pDB933. A variety of other genomic fragments that are also contained within this genomic region were also cloned into pUC119 and sequenced. Among the most significant of these fragments are the following: a 2.5-kb EcoRI fragment (pDB948); a 1.5-kbSstI-EcoRI fragment (pDB932); a 1.0-kbEcoRI fragment (pDB946); and a 5.0-kb EcoRI fragment (pDB944). The nucleotide sequence of various DNA fragments was determined by the Sanger dideoxy method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The strategy and methods for placing the iscS gene under the control of the T7 transcription and translation control elements using the pT7-7 vector (24Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) were done as described previously for the nifS gene (1Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR amplification of the iscS gene were 5′-CATGCATATGAAGTTGCCGATTTAT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTACGGATCCTTGTCACTGTAAGCC-3′ (reverse primer). For mutagenesis of iscS, pDB932 DNA was digested withPstI and ligated to remove an approximately 900-base pair fragment that extends from the PstI site in iscUto the rightward PstI site contained within the polylinker region of the original pUC119 cloning vector. The resultant plasmid was designated pDB941. Plasmid pDB941 contains three SalI restriction enzyme sites located within the iscS coding sequence. These fragments were excised from pDB941 by digestion withSalI and replaced by ligating the sample with a purified 1.4-kb SalI fragment that contains a kanamycin resistance (KmR) cartridge isolated from the vector pUC4-KAPA (purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This plasmid was designated pDB952, and it contains a KmR gene cartridge whose direction of transcription is the same as iscStranscription. We have previously found that, when in this orientation, the KmR insertion cartridge used in the present work is not polar upon expression of downstream A. vinelandii genes, but when present in the opposite direction, it is polar upon expression of downstream genes (8Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 117: 1017-1027Crossref Google Scholar, 19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A similar strategy to the one used for construction of pDB952 was also used for constructing plasmids that have the same KmR cartridge inserted into either thecysE-like gene or the hscA gene. The parental plasmid for cysE-like gene mutagenesis was pDB948. Mutagenized plasmids that carry the KmR cartridge inserted within the cysE-like coding sequence either in the same or the reverse orientation as cysE-like transcription were designated pDB1008 and pDB1007, respectively. The parental plasmid used for hscA mutagenesis was pDB932. Mutagenized plasmids that carry the KmR cartridge inserted into thehscA-coding sequence either in the same or the reverse orientation as hscA transcription were designated pDB1009 and pDB1005, respectively. The respective insertion mutations contained within the various plasmid constructs were transferred to the A. vinelandii chromosome through double-reciprocal recombination events that occurred during transformation (25Page W.J. von Tigerstrom M. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using either wild-type or strain DJ116 (ΔnifS) as host and plasmid DNA as the donor. To ensure that incorporation of the KmR cartridge into the A. vinelandii chromosome occurred only via double-reciprocal recombination events, plasmids DNAs were linearized by restriction enzyme digestion prior to transformation. For those transformants chosen for further study, confirmation that double-reciprocal recombination did occur was demonstrated by showing that the resultant strain was AmpS and KmR. Because ColEI-derived plasmids are incapable of autonomous replication in A. vinelandii, any transformant arising from a single Campbell-like recombination event must have both KmR and AmpR phenotypes (8Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 117: 1017-1027Crossref Google Scholar, 19Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A protein that catalyzes the same enzymatic activity as NifS was isolated from extracts prepared from an A. vinelandii strain (DJ116) deleted for the nifS gene. We have designated the NifS-like protein from A. vinelandii“IscS” to indicate its proposed role iniron-sulfur-cluster formation, and that nomenclature will be used hereafter. Crude extracts were sequentially processed by protamine sulfate treatment and column chromatography using Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Sigma Green-19, Superdex, and Mono-Q columns, respectively. Fractions having IscS activity were monitored by their ability to release sulfur or S2− and alanine from l-cysteine. Fractionation of the extract by Q-Sepharose chromatography yielded a minor peak and a large major peak of IcsS activity. The fractions containing the major peak were pooled and further purified, whereas the minor peak fraction was not processed further. When the material in the large activity peak was purified using the columns listed above, a single protein whose purity was judged to be greater than 90%, by native and denaturing gel electrophoresis, was obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2037283275,"Several recently identified intracellular proteins associate with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and activate nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB, c-Jun kinase, and apoptosis. However, the mechanism is not understood. In the present report, we investigated the role of reactive oxygen intermediates in TNF-induced signaling. Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells completely abolished TNF-mediated NF-kappaB activation, IkappaB alpha degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression. Besides TNF, phorbol ester-, okadaic acid-, ceramide-, and lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-kappaB was blocked by Mn-SOD, indicating a common pathway of activation. H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation, however, was potentiated. In addition, Mn-SOD blocked the TNF-mediated activation of activated protein-1, stress-activated c-Jun protein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. TNF-induced antiproliferative effects and caspase-3 activation, indicators of apoptosis, were also completely suppressed by transfection of cells with Mn-SOD. Suppression of apoptosis induced by okadaic acid, H2O2, and taxol was also inhibited by Mn-SOD but not that induced by vincristine, vinblastine, or daunomycin. Overall, these results demonstrate that, in addition to several recently identified signaling molecules, reactive oxygen intermediates play a critical role in activation of NF-kappaB, activated protein-1, c-Jun kinase, and apoptosis induced by TNF and other agents."
https://openalex.org/W2171830717,"Activation of phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) is implicated in mediating a variety of growth factor-induced responses, among which are the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and the activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB). GSK-3 inactivation occurs through phosphorylation of Ser-9, and several kinases, such as protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 (p90Rsk), p70S6kinase, and also PKB have been shown to phosphorylate this site in vitro. In the light of the many candidates to mediate insulin-induced GSK-3 inactivation we have investigated the role of PKB by constructing a PKB mutant that exhibits dominant-negative function (inhibition of growth factor-induced activation of PKB at expression levels similar to wild-type PKB), as currently no such mutant has been reported. We observed that the PKB mutant (PKB-CAAX) acts as an efficient inhibitor of PKB activation and also of insulin-induced GSK-3 regulation. Furthermore, it is shown that PKB and GSK-3 co-immunoprecipitate, indicating a direct interaction between GSK-3 and PKB. An additional functional consequence of this interaction is implicated by the observation that the oncogenic form of PKB, gagPKB induces a cellular relocalization of GSK-3 from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction. Our results demonstrate that PKB activation is both necessary and sufficient for insulin-induced GSK-3 inactivation and establish a linear pathway from insulin receptor to GSK-3. Regulation of GSK-3 by PKB is likely through direct interaction, as both proteins co-immunoprecipitate. This interaction also resulted in a translocation of GSK-3 to the membrane in cells expressing transforming gagPKB.

Activation of membrane-bound receptors of both the serpentine and tyrosine kinase classes often results in the activation of the lipid kinase PI 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; PKB, protein kinase B; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; PKC, protein kinase C; HA, hemagglutinin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKAPK-1, MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-1; PI-3P, 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol. 3-kinase, of which several different isoforms have been described (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase results in the formation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PI-3P) lipids (i.e. PI 3,4-P2 and PI 3,4,5-P3). These lipids were long suspected to perform a second messenger function. However, until recently the nature of the PI-3P binding proteins and their role in cellular signaling remained unsolved. It is now clear that one of the downstream effectors of PI-3P lipid signaling is the serine-threonine protein kinase PKB (2Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), also known as c-Akt (4Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N.

Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Adjacent to its catalytic domain, PKB contains a PH domain responsible for binding PI-3P lipids (6James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 7Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Although there is still debate about the precise role and nature of PI-3P lipids in the activation of PKB it is clear that in vivo for most growth factor-signaling pathways PI-3P lipid formation is both necessary and sufficient for PKB activation. Additionally, activation of PI 3-kinase has been implicated in a number of biological responses such as activation of p70S6kinase, insulin-induced glucose transport, apoptosis protection, activation of PKCζ, activation of the small GTPase Rac, formation of Rac-dependent lamellipodia, and inactivation of GSK-3 (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Initially GSK-3 was shown to phosphorylate sites in glycogen synthase, which are specifically dephosphorylated when insulin promotes synthase activation leading to glycogen synthesis. A more general role for GSK-3 both in regulating cellular metabolism as well as differentiation processes is suggested by the growing number of identified GSK-3 substrates such as c-Jun (8Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), neurofilaments (9Guan R.J. Khatra B.S. Cohlberg J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8262-8267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tau (10Hanger D.P. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and adenomatous polyposis coli protein (11Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In addition, Zeste-White 3, the Drosophila homolog of GSK-3, has been genetically positioned within the wingless signaling pathway involved in the regulation of various differentiation processes. Within this pathway, ZW-3/GSK-3 is thought to control the transcriptional function of armadillo (β-catenin) (12Nusse R. Cell. 1997; 89: 321-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two highly homologous GSK-3 isozymes, GSK-3α and GSK-3β have been identified. How GSK-3 activity is controlled and whether both isozymes are controlled identically is still unclear. Following treatment of cells with insulin, GSK-3 becomes partially inactivated. In vitro phosphorylation of Ser-9 (GSK-3β) results in partial inactivation of the kinase (13Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and in vivo, this site is phosphorylated after insulin treatment (14Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although this strongly suggests that GSK-3 activity is regulated through Ser-9 phosphorylation, other reports have shown that active GSK-3, isolated from resting cells is phosphorylated on tyrosine and that tyrosine dephosphorylation results in GSK-3 inactivation as well (15Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Several signaling pathways have been proposed to regulate Ser-9 phosphorylation, including growth factor-induced PKC activation (16Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MAPKAPK-1 (p90Rsk) activation, p70S6kinase(13Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and PKB (17Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). What signaling pathway leads to tyrosine dephosphorylation of GSK-3 is unknown. Because insulin-induced GSK-3 inactivation is sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin) and not an inhibitor of growth factor-induced p70S6kinase activation (rapamycin), PKB is a prime candidate for regulation of GSK-3 in vivo (17Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Indeed, wild-type PKB, and not kinase-dead PKB isolated from vanadate-treated cells causes inactivation of GSK-3 in vitro (17Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Although this indicates that PKB activation may be sufficient, these data do not support an essential role for PKB. To study a possible involvement of PKB in GSK-3 regulation we therefore first tested several PKB mutants for their inhibitory effect on PKB and describe here that PKB tagged at the C terminus with the CAAX motif of Ki-Ras acts as an efficient inhibitor of insulin-induced PKB activation. In contrast, we do not observe any clear effect of either kinase-dead or PH domain constructs on PKB activation. Furthermore, with the PKB-CAAX we show that for insulin-induced GSK-3 inactivation, PKB activation is both sufficient and essential. In addition, we show that in vivo PKB not only regulates GSK-3 activity, but also appears to directly interact with GSK-3, as both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated. This interaction may underlie the observation that in gagPKB-expressing cells, GSK-3 relocalizes from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction. Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma and used at a concentration of 50 nm. Baculovirus cloning and expression system (Baculo-gold, FASTBAC) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The plasmids HA-PKB, HA-PKBdead, gagPKB, and gag have been described previously (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). HA-GSK-3 and HA-GSK-3S9A were kindly provided by Paul Coffer (Academic Hospital (AZU), Utrecht, The Netherlands). CAAX-p110 and PLAP-CAAX have also been described previously (27Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer H.K. Thelen M. Curr Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and were generously provided by Marcus Thelen. PKB-CAAX was constructed as follows: In HA-PKB a NaeI site at amino acid position 478 was created by in vitro mutagenesis. This amino acid change had no effect on HA-PKB activity either basal or insulin-induced. Next the CAAX-box of Ki-Ras was isolated by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid RAF-CAAX. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withHpaI/EcoRI and ligated toNaeI/EcoRI-digested HA-PKB resulting in HA-PKB-CAAX. To create untagged PKB-CAAX theSmaI/BglII fragment of pSG5-PKB was replaced by the SmaI/BglII fragment of HA-PKB-CAAX. HA-ΔPH-PKB-CAAX was generated as follows: by in vitro mutagenesis a NruI site was created into HA-PKB at amino acid position 7. The PH domain was then partially deleted by digesting HA-PKB withNruI/SacII, blunting the SacII site and religation. The CAAX domain was then added by the same domain swap as described above. ΔPKB-CAAX was created by digesting HA-PKB-CAAX withHindIII/BglII, blunting and ligating theHindIII/BglII fragment into pSG5 digested withBamHI, and blunted. All clones were checked by partial sequencing. A14 cells (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and 0.05% glutamine. For growth factor treatment cells were seeded at approximately 50% density at day 0; on day 1 the medium of the cells was replaced with medium containing 0% fetal calf serum, and on day 2 cells were treated with insulin (1 μg/ml). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 0.5 mm benzamidine). After clearing the lysate by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), an aliquot of 300 μg of total protein was transferred to a new tube and HA-GSK-3 was immunoprecipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads coupled to the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 recognizing the HA-epitope. Precipitation was for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed once with lysis buffer, once with LiCl buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm Na3VO4), once with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a final wash with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2. Kinase assay was performed in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml heparin, 50 μmATP, 5 μCi γ-ATP, and 300 μg/ml P-GS1 as a substrate (38Van Lint J. Khandelwal R.L. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reaction was for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mmEDTA. After mixing and centrifugation a sample of 10 μl was spotted onto P81 paper. Samples were washed 4 times for 5 min in a large volume (500 ml), 75 mm phosphoric acid. After drying the samples were counted. The amount of immunocomplexed HA-GSK-3 was determined by removing the remainder of the kinase reaction and adding 25 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer to the beads. Expression was then analyzed by immunoblotting. The PKB kinase assay was essentially as described previously (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), except for including a wash with LiCl buffer as for the GSK-3 assay described above and using histone H2B instead of myelin basic protein as a substrate. MAP kinase assay was done as described previously (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). A14 cells transfected with gagPKB or HA-PKB-CAAX were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin; 0.1 μm aprotinin) by 30 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer on ice. Nuclear components and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Next the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min, and the supernatant was collected (cytoplasmic fraction). The pellet (particulate fraction) was washed once with lysis buffer, and the pellet was extracted for 30 min at 4 °C with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 μm aprotinin. Extracted particulate fraction was centrifuged (14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C) to remove any remaining insoluble material. 5× Laemmli sample buffer was added (final concentration of 1× sample buffer), and cytoplasmic and particulate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For use and generation baculovirus PKB the baculo-gold system was used (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's procedures. His-tagged-PKB was isolated by a procedure identical to the regular immunoprecipitation protocol modified to equip larger amounts and using Ni2+ agarose beads instead of protein A-Sepharose. We have previously shown that PKB fused to the Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag protein displays increased ligand-independent kinase activity (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). This Gag protein contains a myristoylation signal that can confer membrane localization to the fusion protein (18Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzalez P.M. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane targeting of PKB by myristylated sequences derived from src-like kinases (src, yes) also results in ligand-independent activation of PKB (19Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). With these types of mutants, it has been shown that activation of PKB is sufficient to activate p70S6kinase (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), stimulate glucose uptake (19Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), and to provide apoptosis protection (20Kauffmann Z.A. Rodriguez V.P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Fusion of the membrane-targeting signal of Ki-Ras, the so-called CAAX motif, has been shown to create active versions of a variety of different signaling molecules (e.g. Raf-1 (22Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), mSos (23Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), Rlf (24Wolthuis R.M. de Ruyter R.N. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) some of which are kinases. To analyze whether the CAAX motif fused to PKB also results in an active ligand-independent kinase we constructed HA-PKB-CAAX, PKB tagged at its N terminus by the HA-peptide recognized by the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, fused at the C-terminal end to the CAAX motif of Ki-Ras. First, we determined the subcellular localization of HA-PKB-CAAX by fractionation of A14 cells (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) transiently expressing HA-PKB-CAAX. As expected, most of the HA-PKB-CAAX was localized to the membrane fraction, and this was at least comparable to the relative amount of gagPKB found in the membrane fraction (Fig.1 A). Next, the kinase activity was determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay (Fig. 1 B). Activity of HA-PKB-CAAX in the absence of ligand was clearly not increased and comparable to the activity of unstimulated wild-type HA-PKB. More surprisingly, the activity of HA-PKB-CAAX did not increase following treatment with insulin and displayed activity similar to kinase-dead PKB. GagPKB in contrast displayed a clear increase in ligand-independent kinase activity, which could be induced further by insulin treatment, albeit to a smaller extent than wild-type PKB. In this respect gagPKB is similar to Raf1-CAAX (22Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Raf1-CAAX is constitutively active, but this activity can also be increased further by growth factor treatment. In HA-PKB-CAAX the kinase domain is positioned between two potential membrane localization signals, the PH domain and the CAAX motif, whereas in gagPKB the myristoylation signal is in tandem with the PH domain. Therefore, in HA-PKB-CAAX, conformational restrictions might prevent interaction with upstream kinase(s) required for PKB activation. We reasoned that if so, mutation of the PH domain in HA-PKB-CAAX either by deleting or changing arginine 28 to cysteine, a mutation similar to the Btk mutation implicated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia, could restore kinase activity. However, this appeared not to be the case (Fig. 2 B). The observation that HA-PKB-CAAX is a functionally inactive kinase prompted us to test whether HA-PKB-CAAX might act as a dominant-negative PKB mutant. To test this possibility we constructed PKB-CAAXlacking the HA-tag. PKB-CAAX was then transiently co-expressed with HA-PKB, and subsequently its effect on HA-PKB activity was measured (Fig. 2 A). At a DNA ratio of 10:1 (PKB-CAAX:HA-PKB) there was complete inhibition of insulin-induced HA-PKB activity. Half-maximal inhibition was already observed at a DNA ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 2 B) indicating that PKB-CAAX efficiently inhibited HA-PKB activation by insulin. Others have reported inhibition of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling upon expression of either kinase-dead PKB (e.g.phosphorylation of Bcl-2-associating death protein) (25Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar) or expression of the PH domain only (e.g. anoikis) (21Khwaja A. Rodriguez V.P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). To test whether these constructs were as efficient as PKB-CAAX in inhibiting PKB activation by insulin, untagged versions of these same constructs as well as mutant versions of the PH domain (not shown) were co-expressed with HA-PKB at a DNA ratio of 10:1 (inhibitor, HA-PKB). From this comparison (Fig. 2 A) it is clear that in A14 cells, using insulin as inducer, only PKB-CAAX clearly inhibits HA-PKB activation. To determine what region of PKB is critical in conferring the dominant-negative action of PKB-CAAX we constructed a PKB-CAAX lacking most of the PH domain. This construct, ΔPH-PKB-CAAX, did not display any inhibiting activity, indicating a critical role for the PH domain. To see whether PKB-CAAX inhibited signaling toward other kinases, we tested the effect of PKB-CAAX on insulin-induced HA-MAP kinase activity as well (Fig. 2 C). At the same DNA ratio as used for inhibiting HA-PKB activation we did not observe any clear effect on HA-MAP kinase activation indicating that at least in this respect PKB-CAAX acts as a specific inhibitor of PKB activation. Previously it has been shown that GSK-3 is phosphorylated and inactivated by PKB in vitro (17Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Although suggestive, at present no data support a role for PKB in the regulation of GSK-3 in vivo. Therefore, we decided to test the PKB-CAAX mutant for its effect on GSK-3 regulation. However, first we determined whether in A14 cells the kinetics of insulin-induced GSK-3 inactivation followed those of PI 3-kinase and PKB activation and whether in this system GSK-3 is regulated by a PI 3-kinase dependent mechanism. Following treatment of A14 cells with insulin, PI 3-kinase activation, PKB activation, and GSK-3 inactivation all displayed similar kinetics (Fig. 3 A). Activation was rapid with a peak at approximately 2 min for PI 3-kinase and PKB and maximal inactivation of GSK-3 at approximately 5 min. This was followed by a return to near basal levels at approximately 30–40 min. Second, we tested whether in A14 cells insulin regulates GSK-3 through phosphorylation of Ser-9. This appeared indeed to be the case asin vitro kinase activity of HA-GSK-3S9Atransiently expressed in A14 cells was unaffected by insulin treatment. (Fig. 3 B, 3rd and 4th bar). Third, we tested the effect of PI 3-kinase (in)activation on GSK-3 regulation (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of HA-GSK-3-expressing A14 cells with wortmannin prior to insulin treatment resulted in near complete inhibition of insulin-induced decrease in GSK-3 activity, indicating that PI 3-kinase is indeed essential for this process. This was further corroborated by co-expression of Δp85, a dominant-negative PI-3 kinase (26Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), which also resulted in a loss of insulin-induced GSK-3 inhibition. In A14 cells PI 3-kinase activity appeared not only necessary but also sufficient for inhibition of GSK-3 activity. Co-expression of a constitutively active PI 3-kinase (p110CAAX) resulted in a ligand-independent inhibition of HA-GSK-3 activity as compared with co-transfection of a control (PLAP-CAAX) (27Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer H.K. Thelen M. Curr Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, in this type of assay (co-transfection) inhibition of HA-GSK-3 activity by active PI 3-kinase was always less than inhibition by insulin. As GSK-3 regulation was completely dependent on PI 3-kinase we next tested the involvement of PKB. The same set of experiments was performed using PKB-CAAX to inhibit endogenous PKB activation and gagPKB as constitutively active PKB (Fig.3 C). Co-expression of PKB-CAAX, but not of ΔPH-PKB-CAAX, resulted in a loss of insulin-induced inhibition of HA-GSK-3, and the effect of PKB-CAAX on HA-GSK-3 was similar to the effect of PI 3-kinase inhibition. Co-expression of gagPKB, but not gag alone, resulted in ligand-independent inhibition of HA-GSK-3. However, as observed for p110CAAX, inhibition of HA-GSK-3 activity by gagPKB was always less than observed following insulin treatment. These results clearly indicate that PI 3-kinase and PKB are both necessary and sufficient for insulin-induced GSK-3 regulation. However, as all results were derived from one time point we also tested whether the inhibition by PKB-CAAX did not shift insulin-dependent regulation to later time points. This appeared not to be the case as within the normal time-course of GSK-3 regulation by insulin no inhibition of GSK-3 was observed in the presence of PKB-CAAX (Fig. 3 D). Although we did not observe any clear effect of either kinase-dead PKB or the PH domain itself on PKB activation, we also tested the effect of the kinase-dead PKB on HA-GSK-3 regulation by insulin. As indicated by the effects on PKB regulation no clear effect of this mutant on GSK-3 regulation was observed. The results with PKB-CAAX indicate that PKB is indeed essential for regulation of GSK-3 by insulin. However, other regulatory mechanism have been proposed for GSK-3 regulation. For example PKC may act in between PKB and GSK-3 as GSK-3 is a substrate for PKC (16Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKB has been shown to interact with PKC (28Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To analyze whether PKB regulation of GSK-3 might be direct, we tested whether PKB and GSK-3 co-immunoprecipitated. To this end HA-GSK-3 and HA-PKB were transiently expressed and precipitated with antisera specific to PKB and GSK-3, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation of PKB and GSK-3 was detected by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 antibody (Fig.4 A) both in the PKB and the GSK-3 precipitations. We also analyzed whether GSK-3 immunoprecipitated from A14 cells was a substrate for active PKB. Incubation of GSK-3 immunoprecipitates with active PKB isolated from baculovirus-infected cells clearly showed enhanced PKB-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3. Combined, these results suggest that indeed PKB directly interacts with GSK-3. In resting or cycling cells PKB and GSK-3 mainly localized in the cytosol (see Figs. 1 A and 4 C), whereas gagPKB is almost exclusively localized to the membrane fraction (Fig.1 A). To see whether besides Ser-9 phosphorylation the PKB/GSK-3 interaction would result in regulation at other levels as well we analyzed GSK-3 localization in gagPKB-expressing cells by cellular fractionation. Interestingly, expression of gagPKB resulted in a clear shift of GSK-3 from cytosol to membrane fraction (Fig.4 C). This translocation of GSK-3 was only observed when cells expressed constitutively active PKB and not when PKB was transiently activated by insulin treatment (data not shown). However, following insulin treatment we also do not observe a shift of PKB to the particulate fraction either (data not shown). Activation of PI 3-kinase regulates a number of cellular responses including the activation of PKB and the inactivation of GSK-3. To enable analysis of PKB involvement in PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling in general and GSK-3 in particular, we have constructed a PKB mutant, PKB-CAAX, and demonstrated that this mutant acted as an efficient inhibitor (i.e. at levels of only moderate overexpression) of insulin-induced PKB activation. This mutant was used to explore the role of PKB in GSK-3 inactivation. From the results it is apparent that GSK-3 is regulated by a signaling pathway consisting of insulin receptor/PI 3-kinase/PKB/GSK-3. Previously we described activation of p70S6kinase by active gagPKB, but we were unable to demonstrate clear inhibition of p70S6kinase activation by co-expression of kinase-dead PKB. Here we show that kinase-dead PKB co-expression does not affect insulin-induced PKB activation. PKB-CAAX encodes a catalytically inactive PKB as well. The reason for this is not completely understood. PKB activation requires both PI-3P lipid binding (6James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J. Holmes A.B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 7Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (3Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation occurs at threonine 308 and serine 473 (29Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). In PKB-CAAX, the CAAX motif is located almost directly next to serine 473. It is therefore conceivable that C-terminal membrane targeting structurally interferes with serine 473 phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting PKB activation. Yet, this cannot be the only reason since mutating serine 473 to alanine only partially inhibits the activation of PKB (29Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). 2B. M. Th. Burgering, unpublished observation. The residual activation of the S473A mutant is likely to result from threonine 308 phosphorylation as this mutant still shows a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE following insulin treatment (data not shown). We never observed a similar mobility shift for PKB-CAAX after insulin treatment, suggesting that in addition to the loss of serine 473 phosphorylation, threonine 308 phosphorylation is inhibited as well. The PH domain is critical for PKB-CAAX to act as dominant-negative. The PH domain has been shown to bind PI-3P lipids, this suggests that PKB-CAAX inhibits activation by sequestering the PI-3P lipid(s) involved in PKB activation. Apparently the efficiency of inhibition is greatly improved by localizing the PH domain directly to the membrane. Expression of the PH domain by itself should also result in inhibition of PKB activation, in contrast to a previous report showing that in vitro addition of the PH domain to full-length PKB resulted in activation of PKB (30Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, at the levels of overexpression employed here we do not observe a significant effect of the isolated PH domain on PKB activation. Both the PH domain and kinase-dead PKB have been used in other studies to suggest the involvement of PKB in mediating PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling. In our model system, we observe no effect with these mutants either on PKB activation or GSK-3 regulation. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is not clear to us. The results presented here clearly indicate in A14 cells a signaling pathway consisting of insulin receptor/PI 3-kinase/PKB/GSK-3. However, further studies will be needed to see whether in other cell types and with other stimuli this same pathway is operational. Previously, other regulatory signals for GSK-3 regulation have been put forward such as PKC (16Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ras through MAPKAPK-1 (p90Rsk) (31Eldar F.H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation (15Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In A14 cells we have never obtained any evidence that insulin treatment activates PKC (32Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21186-21189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is clear that for other stimuli that can activate both PI 3-kinase and PKC, PKC activation may represent a redundant pathway in GSK-3 regulation (33Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).In vitro phosphorylation of GSK-3 by MAPKAPK-1 (p90Rsk) results in partial inactivation of GSK-3 (13Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 31Eldar F.H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) suggesting that activation of the Ras/MAP kinase cascade and subsequent MAPKAPK-1 activation could regulate GSK-3 inactivation. Expression of dominant-negative and constitutively active MAP kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase indeed result in attenuation of EGF-induced GSK-3 regulation (31Eldar F.H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast however, insulin-induced GSK-3 regulation in myoblasts is not affected by inhibition of MAP kinase activation by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (34Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition it has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary cells, that inhibition of insulin-induced Ras/MAP kinase activation by expression of SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 also does not interfere with insulin-induced GSK-3 inactivation (35Sakaue H. Hara K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Kotani K. Ogawa W. Yonezawa K. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11304-11309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although this apparently excludes a role for the MAP kinase pathway in mediating insulin-induced GSK-3 regulation, a role for Ras is still feasible, especially since Ras has been implicated to activate PI 3-kinase directly (36Rodriguez V.P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activation by Ras and PI 3-kinase activation by p85 binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins converge at the level of PKB. The interplay between these two regulatory mechanisms of PI 3-kinase activation is still not completely clear, but depending on the relative importance of Ras in the activation of PI 3-kinase by a ligand (37van Weering D.H.J. de Rooij J. Marte B. Downward J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), an effect of Ras inhibition on GSK-3 regulation may be anticipated. The interaction of PKB and GSK-3 is probably direct as both proteins co-immunoprecipitate. A consequence of this interaction is then Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3. However, our results show that yet another mode of regulation is possible. In gagPKB expressing cells, constitutively active membrane bound PKB induces a translocation of GSK-3 from cytosol to membrane. Since gagPKB represents the transforming gene of v-Akt, inducing T-cell lymphomas, and we do not observe a similar translocation following insulin treatment, it will be of interest to see whether this translocation of GSK-3 to the membrane fraction is functional in the induction of transformation by gagPKB and its ability to confer protection against apoptosis.

The predicted FGF-10 protein is most related to keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, or FGF-7). The latter is unique among FGFs in that it binds and signals only through the FGF receptor (FGFR2b) isoform KGF receptor (KGFR) expressed specifically by epithelial cells. In order to examine the biological and biochemical properties of human FGF-10, we isolated the cDNA and expressed its encoded protein in bacteria. The recombinant protein (rFGF-10) was a potent mitogen for Balb/MK mouse epidermal keratinocytes with activity detectable at 0.1 nm and maximal at around 5 nm. Within this concentration range, FGF-10 did not stimulate DNA synthesis in NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. rFGF-10 bound the KGFR with high affinity comparable to that of KGF, and did not bind detectably to either the FGFR1c (Flg) or FGFR2c (Bek) receptor isoforms. The mitogenic activity of FGF-10 could be distinguished from that of KGF by its different sensitivity to heparin and lack of neutralization by a KGF monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that FGF-10 and KGF have similar receptor binding properties and target cell specificities, but are differentially regulated by components of the extracellular matrix.

These molecules have activities at early and late stages of development and are widely expressed in adult tissues, indicating that they likely play important roles as growth and differentiation factors throughout the life span of the organism. FGFs stimulate cells by interacting with cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (22Jeye M. Schlessinger F. Dionne C. Biochim. Biophys.

Four closely related receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4) have been identified. FGFR1–FGFR3 genes have been shown to encode multiple isoforms generated by alternative splicing (24Hou J.Z. Kan M.K. McKeehan K.

However, KGF is unique among FGFs in that it interacts only with a specific isoform of FGFR2, designated FGFR2b or KGFR (27Miki T. Bottaro D. Fleming T. Smith C. Burgess W. Chan A.-L. Aaronson S.A.

Rat FGF-10 was recently cloned by homology based polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers to common amino acid sequences in the FGF-3 and FGF-7 coding regions (10Yamasaki M. Miyake A. Tagashira S. Itoh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15918-15921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Its mRNA was shown to be preferentially expressed in adult lung and in several discrete regions of the embryo (10Yamasaki M. Miyake A. Tagashira S. Itoh N. J. Biol.

Thus, we reasoned that it might have similar biological properties. In order to test this hypothesis, we cloned the human FGF-10 cDNA and produced functional recombinant FGF-10 (rFGF-10) in bacteria for characterization of its physical and biochemical properties. RNA prepared from different human cell lines and tissues was used as a template for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The polymerase chain reaction was performed for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min in a reaction mixture containing an aliquot of the above cDNA solution, 0.05 unit/μl Taq DNA polymerase, and 3 pmol/μl each of the primers sequences 5′-ATC ATA TGG CTC TTG GTC AGG ACA TG-3′ and 5′-ATG GAT CCA CTA TGA GTG GAC CAC CAT-3′. These corresponded to nucleotides 112–648 of the rat FGF-10 cDNA sequence with additional NdeI and BamHI sites located at their 5′ ends, respectively. An in-frame methionine codon within theNdeI site served as a translation initiation site for recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. Amplified DNA was cloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and a number of clones were sequenced to confirm their identity as human FGF-10 cDNA. TheNdeI/BamHI fragment of human FGF-10 cDNA was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pET 9c, to allow production of recombinant protein from the T7 φ10 promoter (35Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) pLysS cells bearing the recombinant plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The culture was diluted 100-fold with Luria-Bertani medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated for 3 h prior to addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h to induce rFGF-10 expression. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in TENG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed by three successive cycles of freezing and thawing, disrupted by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C until required. Purification of recombinant FGF-10 was performed by applying the bacterial supernatant (5 ml) to a heparin-Sepharose column (1-ml bed volume), (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with 20 bed volumes of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.2m NaCl and then subjected to a stepwise gradient of increasing NaCl concentration. Aliquots from fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and selected fractions were concentrated 10–20-fold with a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) for use in biological and biochemical analyses. Thymidine incorporation into Balb/MK mouse epidermal keratinocytes (36Weissman B.E. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1983; 32: 599-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and NIH/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts (37Jainchill J.L. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Virol. 1969; 4: 549-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed as described previously (38Rubin J.S. Osada H. Finch P.W. Taylor W.G. Rudikoff S. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 96-well microtiter plates precoated with fibronectin. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, treated with various concentrations of growth factors for 17 h, and incubated with 4 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 6 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Neutralization experiments utilized monoclonal antibody 1G4, directed against KGF (39Bottaro D.P. Fortney E. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9180-9183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, the growth factor and monoclonal antibody were also added simultaneously. For experiments performed in the presence of heparin, the growth factor and heparin were added at the same time. KGF and FGF-10 were labeled with Na125I using the chloramine-T method (40Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar) as described previously (41Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C Cohen O.E. Chan A. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity for each iodinated growth factor was about 5 × 104cpm/ng. 125I-Labeled growth factor binding and competition assays were performed using NIH/3T3 cells transfected with either FGFR2b (KGFR), FGFR1c (Flg), or FGFR2c (Bek) as described previously (33Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Jeffrey S.R. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 252: 72-75Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 42LaRochelle W.J. Dirsch O.R. Finch P.W. Cheon H-G. May M. Marchese C. Pierce F.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify rat FGF-10 residues Ala38 to Ser215 were also used to amplify the human FGF-10 (Fig.1 A). The amino acid sequence of the isolated human FGF-10 cDNA was identical to that of rat FGF-10 with the exception of an eight-serine residue deletion (96% identity, SIM program) (43Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The predicted human FGF-10 product had highest similarity to that of KGF, and the homology of the conserved region (amino acids 60–205 of human FGF-10) between FGF-10 and KGF or FGF-3 was 54 and 47%, respectively (SIM program) (43Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular mass of this molecule was 19 kDa. The human FGF-10 sequence was subcloned into the pET9c plasmid to allow recombinant expression in E. coli from the promoter of the highly expressed φ10 gene of bacteriophage T7 (35Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). The amplified region corresponded to that encoding the putative mature growth factor following secretion and cleavage of the signal sequence. rFGF-10 was induced and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of successive fractions of increasing NaCl concentration eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column determined that the majority of rFGF-10 eluted with the 1.0 m NaCl fraction, as determined by silver staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B), although some protein also eluted in the 0.8 and 1.2m NaCl fractions. The apparent molecular mass of the polypeptide was approximately 20 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular weight. Amino acid analysis of a sample of protein eluted at 1 m NaCl confirmed that the preparation consisted of substantially pure FGF-10, whose amino terminus was in agreement with that predicted from the sequence. 2D. Bottaro, personal communication. Because the primary structure of FGF-10 was most similar to that of KGF among the known FGF family members, we sought to compare its biological and biochemical properties with those of KGF. To do so, we first examined their mitogenic activities as a function of concentration on Balb/MK keratinocytes, which naturally express the KGFR, and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which do not. As shown in Fig. 2, while KGF stimulated DNA synthesis in Balb/MK cells at less than 0.005 nm, stimulation by rFGF-10 required growth factor concentrations of greater than 0.01 nm. Increased DNA synthesis was observed over a concentration range of 0.05–5 nm. Neither growth factor stimulated NIH/3T3 cells at these concentrations. However, rFGF-10 was able to stimulate significant DNA synthesis in these cells at concentrations greater than 5 nm (Fig. 2). FGF-10 appeared to have a target cell specificity similar to that of KGF, which raised the possibility that it might also bind to the KGFR. To explore this further, we examined its ability to compete with KGF for binding to the KGFR. Binding experiments were performed with NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing the KGFR (33Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Jeffrey S.R. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 252: 72-75Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, rFGF-10 was able to displace 125I-KGF from the KGFR with only slightly less efficiency than unlabeled KGF. Reciprocal experiments showed that KGF also efficiently competed 125I-FGF-10 binding (Fig.3 B). bFGF, which has a low affinity for the KGFR, did not displace either 125I-KGF or 125I-FGF-10 under the same conditions. To confirm the specific binding of FGF-10 to the KGFR, we examined the binding of FGF-10 to NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing either KGFR, FGFR1c, or FGFR2c (42LaRochelle W.J. Dirsch O.R. Finch P.W. Cheon H-G. May M. Marchese C. Pierce F.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because NIH/3T3 cells have heparan sulfate-type proteoglycans, which are known to exhibit low affinity binding to FGFs, we performed the assay with increasing heparin concentration such that only specific binding of FGF-10 to its high affinity receptor(s) might be detected. As shown in Fig. 3 C, only NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing KGFR bound FGF-10 in the presence of heparin. Even though NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing FGFR2c exhibited slightly greater binding of FGF-10 than did control NIH/3T3 cells, we were unable to detect specific competition by unlabeled FGF-10 or bFGF (data not shown). These results confirm that FGF-10 binds the KGFR but does not bind either FGFR1c or FGFR2c with high affinity. The activities of FGFs are modulated by heparin (44Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32279-32285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Gospodrowicz D. Plouet J. Malerstein B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For example, the biological activities of aFGF are highly dependent on heparin, whereas those of KGF are strongly inhibited (45Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Gospodrowicz D. Plouet J. Malerstein B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47Klagsbrun M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 222: 857-863Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To characterize heparin effects on FGF-10 mitogenic stimulation of Balb/MK cells, we performed thymidine incorporation assays at different concentrations of heparin (Fig.4 A). Stimulation by heparin of FGF-10 activity was readily observed at low FGF-10 concentrations, whereas heparin was inhibitory to KGF under the same conditions. The stimulatory effects of heparin were most pronounced with aFGF on both BalbMK and NIH/3T3 cells. Heparin did not increase the sensitivity of NIH/3T3 cells to FGF-10 (Fig. 4 A). We performed a more detailed heparin dose response analysis to further define the effects of heparin on FGF-10 mitogenic activity. As shown in Fig.4 B, the addition of heparin at 0.3 μg/ml was optimal for stimulating FGF-10 activity. At this heparin concentration, its activity was comparable to that of KGF in that it stimulated DNA synthesis in Balb/MK cells at picomolar concentrations (Fig.4 C). Recombinant KGF is 5–10-fold more potent than the glycosylated naturally occurring form (41Ron D. Reich R. Chedid M. Lengel C Cohen O.E. Chan A. Neufeld G. Miki T. Tronick S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these findings strongly imply that recombinant FGF-10 was produced and purified in a fully active form. To further distinguish FGF-10 biological activity from that of KGF, we performed an antibody inhibition assay on Balb/MK cells using a neutralizing KGF monoclonal antibody (clone 1G4) (39Bottaro D.P. Fortney E. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9180-9183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, this antibody was able to neutralize the mitogenic activity of KGF in a dose-dependent fashion (90% inhibition at 100 μg/ml of antibody), while FGF-10 and bFGF were not significantly affected even at the highest antibody concentration tested. In the present study, we isolated the cDNA encoding human FGF-10 and characterized the recombinant protein produced in bacteria. Among known FGF family members, FGF-10 is most similar in its predicted sequence and functional properties to KGF. Like KGF, FGF-10 showed preferential mitogenic activity for Balb/MK keratinocytes as compared with NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. By means of binding/competition analysis, we further established that these two growth factors interact with the same high affinity receptor, the KGFR isoform of FGFR2, which differs from FGFR2 in the second half of the third immunoglobulin loop and is encoded by an alternative exon (33Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Jeffrey S.R. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 252: 72-75Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The ability of KGF and FGF-10 to bind the KGFR with high affinity distinguishes them from other members of the FGF-10 family (23Johnson D. Lee P. Lu J. Williams L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4728-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 25Dell K.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21225-21229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chellaiah A.T.

Unlike KGF, FGF-10 exhibited significant mitogenic activity on NIH/3T3 cells at high concentration. NIH/3T3 cells do not express the KGFR, and we did not detect specific high affinity binding of FGF-10 to either FGFR1c or FGFR2c, when they were overexpressed by these cells. Thus, FGF-10 mitogenic effects for NIH/3T3 cells at high concentration likely reflect functional interactions with some other FGFR isoform(s). We observed that heparin exerted differential effects on FGF-10 and KGF. Whereas KGF mitogenic activity was inhibited by heparin, it was stimulatory to FGF-10. At an optimal concentration of 0.3 μg/ml heparin, the mitogenic effects of FGF-10 were stimulated as much as 5–10-fold, such that it was comparable to that of recombinant KGF. Because both the concentration and composition of heparan sulfate containing proteoglycans on the cell surface or extracellular matrix vary among cell types and tissues, these molecules likely contribute to regulation of the sensitivity and, thus, spectrum of responses to individual FGF ligands. However, the relationship between their affinities for heparin and the effects of heparin on biologic activity is not clear. For example, FGF-10 eluted at 1.0 m NaCl from heparin Sepharose while KGF has a lower affinity (0.5 mNaCl) (45Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the mitogenic activity of the former was enhanced, while that of the latter was inhibited by heparin (45Ron D. Bottaro D.P. Finch P.W. Morris D. Rubin J.S. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2984-2988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differential regulation of their mitogenic activities by heparin provides one possible mechanism through which different responses to FGF-10 and KGF, which signal through the same receptor, may be mediatedin vivo. While the manuscript of this work was in preparation, Emoto et al. (48Emoto H. Tagashira S. Mattei M-G. Yamasaki M. Hashimoto G. Katsumata T. Negoro T. Nakatsuka M. Birnbaum D. Coulier F. Itoh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23191-23194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of human FGF-10, whose sequence is identical to that reported here. In their study, recombinant human FGF-10 was found to exhibit mitogenic activity for rat epidermal keratinocytes but not NIH/3T3 cells at concentrations (48Emoto H. Tagashira S. Mattei M-G. Yamasaki M. Hashimoto G. Katsumata T. Negoro T. Nakatsuka M. Birnbaum D. Coulier F. Itoh N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23191-23194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) where we also observed no detectable activity. The cloning of mouse FGF-10 and characterization of its processing has also been recently reported (49Beer H.D. Florence C. Dammeier J. McGuire L. Werner S. Duan D.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was shown that FGF-10 is glycosylated and remains predominately cell- or extracellular matrix-associated, but can be released into medium by heparin (49Beer H.D. Florence C. Dammeier J. McGuire L. Werner S. Duan D.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, KGF, which is also glycosylated, is readily secreted into the medium of producing cells (50Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The different secretory properties of these functionally related FGFs may reflect the differences in their respective affinities for proteoglycans. KGF is expressed by stromal cells and acts as a paracrine mediator of epithelial cell proliferation/differentiation (50Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 245: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 51Finch P.W. Cunha G.R. Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev.

Analysis of FGF-10 expression in mouse skin revealed its transcript in dermis but not epidermis, consistent with FGF-10 also acting in a paracrine manner on epithelial cells (49Beer H.D. Florence C. Dammeier J. McGuire L. Werner S. Duan D.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to being necessary for organogenesis during development, paracrine acting signals originating from the stroma play a crucial role in tissue remodeling and epidermal regeneration following wounding (53Werner S. Peters K.G. Longaker M.T. Fuller-Pace F. Banda M.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 54Marchese C. Chedid M. Dirsch O.R.

In vivo, KGF expression is dramatically induced during cutaneous wound repair (53Werner S. Peters K.G. Longaker M.T. Fuller-Pace F. Banda M.J. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6896-6900Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar,54Marchese C. Chedid M. Dirsch O.R. Csaky K.G. Santanelli F. Latini C. LaRochelle W.J. Torrisi M.R. Aaronson S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the KGF transcript can be induced by treatment of fibroblasts with proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (55Brauchle M. Angermeyer K. Hübner G. Werner S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3199-3204PubMed Google Scholar,56Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These agents have been shown to up-regulate transcription of the KGF gene, thus providing a mechanistic basis for its induction following wounding. In addition, the demonstration of high levels of KGF expression in chronic inflammatory diseases of the skin (57Finch P.W. Murphy F. Lardinale I. Krieger J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1619-1628PubMed Google Scholar) and bowel (58Finch P.W. Pricolo V. Wu A. Finkelstein S.D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 441-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) provide further evidence of its up-regulation in an inflammatory environment. Tagashira et al. (59Tagashira S. Harada H. Katsumata T. Itoh N. Nakatsuka M. Gene ( Amst .). 1997; 197: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported a marked increase in mouse FGF-10 transcript levels following cutaneous wounding. In contrast, Beer et al. (49Beer H.D. Florence C. Dammeier J. McGuire L. Werner S. Duan D.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) reported no induction under similar conditions, nor did these workers observe FGF-10 induction in fibroblasts following stimulation by proinflammatory mediators or serum growth factors. Thus, whether FGF-10 is up-regulated, like KGF, in response to superficial wounding will require further investigation. KGF knockout mice show no obvious abnormalities in epidermal growth or wound healing (60Guo L. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and even transforming growth factor-α/KGF double knockout mice have been reported to exhibit unimpaired wound healing (60Guo L. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Yet, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative KGF receptor show epidermal atrophy and delayed wound healing (61Werner S. Smola H. Liao X. Longaker M.T. Krieg T. Hofschneider P.H. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest the existence of other KGFR ligands with redundant or overlapping functions to KGF. Our findings that FGF-10 possesses similar biological and biochemical properties to KGF suggest it as a candidate. Studies of FGF-10 knockout and KGF/FGF-10 double knockout mice will be necessary in order to fully determine the respective roles of these two functionally related FGFs in mediating epithelial proliferation, morphogenesis, and differentiation during normal development, and tissue repair.

The maturation of the three major classes of eukaryotic RNA (mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA) requires extensive processing events, including endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages, intron removal, and exon splicing, as well as nucleotide additions and removals exemplified by polyadenylation and editing. Three of the four eukaryotic rRNAs are synthesized as a single precursor RNA and must undergo a complex series of processing events to produce mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs. Central to this process is the removal of the two internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1The abbreviations used are: ITS, internal transcribed spacer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. that separate 18 S from 5.8 S (ITS1) and 5.8 S from 25 S (ITS2) (Fig.1). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the removal of ITS1, which is coupled to the removal of the 5′ external transcribed spacer, features a series of cleavage events requiring proteins, small nucleolar RNAs and the ribonucleoprotein RNase MRP (reviewed in Refs. 1Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 2Venema J. Tollervey D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1629-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cleavage within ITS1 separates 20 S RNA from 27 S RNA. 20 S RNA is processed in the cytoplasm to form mature 18 S rRNA, while 27 S RNA is processed by two alternative pathways. Some 15% of 27 S undergoes cleavage at a site that appears to correspond to the 5′ end of the long form of 5.8 S rRNA, while RNase MRP, in conjunction with Rrp5p cleaves the remaining 27 S molecules, which then undergo 5′–3′ exonucleolytic processing to generate the 5′ end of the short form of 5.8 S (3Chu S.

Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5701-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The events required for processing of ITS2 remain less well characterized than those for ITS1. After processing by alternative pathways during the latter stages of ITS1 removal, both types of 27 S rRNAs undergo cleavages within ITS2 that separate 25 S molecules, with either mature or extended 5′ ends, from 5.8 S precursors (7 SL and 7 SS) with 3′ extensions. These 3′ extensions must be removed to produce mature 5.8 SL and 5.8 SS rRNAs. Recessive mutations in the S. cerevisiae RRP4 gene result in the accumulation of 3′ extended forms of 5.8 S rRNA suggesting a role for Rrp4p in 5.8 S rRNA 3′ end processing. Indeed, immunoprecipitates of Rrp4p demonstrated 3′–5′ riboexonuclease activity in vitro (7Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). More extensive analysis of Rrp4p immunoprecipitates revealed the existence of Rrp4p in a multisubunit complex, called the exosome (8Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). In addition to Rrp4p, the exosome contains three 3′–5′ riboexonucleases required for efficient maturation of 5.8 S rRNA 3′ ends. Each of these enzymes show strong homology to 3′–5′ riboexonucleases found in Escherichia coli. In this report, we present the identification and characterization ofRRP6, the product of which plays a role in the proper 3′ end processing of 5.8 S rRNA. Mutations in RRP6 result in the accumulation of 3′ extended 5.8 S rRNAs. RRP6 encodes a protein highly homologous to the human PM-Scl 100-kDa autoantigen, as well as proteins of unknown function from Caenorhabditis elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Each of these eukaryotic proteins share homology in their central domains with theE. coli 3′–5′ exoribonuclease RNase D, suggesting the conservation of some RNase D function from bacteria to humans. The experiments reported here were performed using the yeast strains described in TableI. The suppressor isolation has been described by Briggs and Butler (9Briggs M. Butler J.S.

The plasmids and deoxyoligonucleotides utilized in this study are described in TableII. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Promega, or New England Biolabs, and digestions were performed as per manufacturers' instructions. Double-stranded DNA probe templates were prepared by diethylaminoethyl paper purification from 1% agarose gels and radiolabeled by random hexamer priming with 5′-[α-32P]deoxyCTP (NEN Life Science Products, 3000 Ci/mmol) and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deoxyoligonucleotide probes (25 pmol; Oligos Etc., Inc.) were radiolabeled by incubation for 60 min at 37 °C in 15-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol with 1 unit of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μCi of 5′-[γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, 6000 Ci/mmol).

Butler J.S. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transformed into strain 1BC1 (Table I), and transformants were selected on URA− plates at 25 °C for 36 h, after which the plates were incubated at 14 °C until putativeRRP6-containing complementing plasmid-bearing strains grew above background levels. One colony out of approximately 100,000 transformants displayed reproducible complementation of the cold-sensitive phenotype after rescue of the plasmid from yeast cells and retransformation into 1BC1. The apparent low number ofRRP6 transformants is likely due to its tight centromere linkage, since E. coli colony blot hybridization experiments indicate that its representation in the library is similar to other genes (9Briggs M. Butler J.S. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 3.5-kilobase RRP6-specificXbaI/EcoRI fragment was cloned into the same sites in YIplac211 (13Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) to produce pUNC9. CEN15 was removed from pUNC9 by digestion with XbaI and BglII, filling in the 5′ overhangs with the Klenow fragment DNA polymerase and ligation of the plasmid with T4 DNA ligase to produce p10dXB. Analysis of the linkage between rrp6–1 and UNC733 was carried out by transformation of ABC1–2D with p10dXB linearized withBamHI. Total RNA was prepared and Northern analysis carried out as described previously (14Patel D. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Levels of specific RNAs were quantitated by storage PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to 5 S rRNA levels, which were quantitated by FluorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) of ethidium bromide-stained gels or by storage PhosphorImager analysis after hybridization of 5′-32P-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide probes to 5.8 S rRNA or to the RNA polymerase III-transcribed ScR1 (Table II). For analyses of small rRNA transcripts, 3 μg of total RNA were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel, and RNAs were transferred to GeneScreen membranes (DuPont) by electroblotting at 10 V for 16 h at 4 °C. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C as described previously (14Patel D. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that formamide was omitted when oligonucleotide probes were used. Length determinations of 5.8 S* rRNA were made by linear regression from a semilog plot of the mobilities of 7 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S rRNA as a function of their known lengths. Primer extension analysis of 5.8 S rRNA was performed as described (15Pikielny C.W. Rosbash M. Cell. 1985; 41: 119-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Polyribosomes were prepared and analyzed as described (16Proweller A. Butler J.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The accession numbers of the nucleotide and protein sequences analyzed in this study are as follows: Rrp6p, Z74909; Homo sapiens, Q01780; S. pombe,Q10146; C. elegans, P34607; E. coli, P09155;Haemophilus influenza, P44442. Sequence data derived from complementing plasmid pC114 were compared with the yeast genome sequence data base using the BLAST program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information 2The BLAST program is available via the World Wide Web (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Recipon/bs_seq.html).and the Stanford Genome Resource Data Base. 3The Stanford Genome Resource Data Base is available via the World Wide Web (http://genome-www.stanford.edu). Pairwise comparisons of Rrp6p and proteins from other species were made using BESTFIT, and the protein sequences were aligned using Pileup and MSAShade. Putative nuclear localization signals were determined using the Psort program. TheURA3 portion of pUNC9 was deleted by digestion withAatII and NarI, followed by filling the overhanging ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and subsequent ligation to produce pUN9d4. URA3 was removed from pJJ244 (17Jones J.J. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) with BamHI and PvuII and inserted into BamHI/EcoRV-digested pBR322 to produce pBRU2. The internal BglII fragment of RRP6 in pUN9d4 was replaced with the BamHI fragment containingURA3 from pBRU2 to produce pdRRP6F. Disruption of chromosomal RRP6 was carried out by digestion of pdRRP6F with BamHI and PvuII to liberaterrp6::URA3 followed by transformation of the digestion mixture into a diploid made by crossing T481 and T581 (TableI). Disruptants were selected on synthetic complete URA−plates at 30 °C. Disruption of RRP6 was verified by PCR using primers flanking the RRP6 BglII sites (Table II, Fig.6). Cultures of BPO2 and BPO2–12F (Table I) were grown at 30 °C in synthetic complete glucose medium supplemented with uracil (20 mg/ml) to anA 600 of 1.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of fresh medium lacking uracil and labeled for 3 min by the addition of 50 μCi of [5,6-3H] uracil/ml (NEN Life Science Products, 39 Ci/mmol). Following the initial pulse labeling, the radioactive precursor was chased for up to 1 h by the addition of unlabeled uracil at a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. At various times, samples were taken, the cells collected by centrifugation and frozen in dry ice. Total RNA was isolated from yeast cells as described (14Patel D. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Small RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7.5 m urea in 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3). Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 1 h, incubated in EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 h and washed with water for 20 min. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation of the amount of [5,6-3H]uracil incorporated into specific RNAs was determined by cutting the appropriate bands from the dried gels and determining the amount of radioactivity present by scintillation counting. Pseudoreversion analysis of the pap1–1temperature sensitive mutation in S. cerevisiae was carried out to identify gene products that play roles in the mechanism or function of polyadenylation (9Briggs M. Butler J.S. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated five independent suppressors that exhibited a cold-sensitive growth phenotype at 14 °C from an initial population of about 5,000 spontaneously arising pseudorevertants that allowed growth of a pap1–1strain at the restrictive temperature of 30 °C (TableIII). Two of the five cold-sensitive suppressor strains isolated represented alleles of the RRP6complementation group (previously named PDS1) (9Briggs M. Butler J.S. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrad analysis after sporulation of a diploid homozygous forpap1–1 and rrp6–1 demonstrated independent, 2:2 segregation of both the cold-sensitive and suppressor phenotypes indicating that the rrp6–1 mutation occurred in a single-copy nuclear gene, extragenic to pap1–1. Normal growth at low temperature of a diploid heterozygous forrrp6–1 or rrp6–2 indicated that these mutations are recessive, suggesting loss of function mutations. Delineation of the mechanism of suppression of pap1–1 by alleles ofrrp6 will be presented elsewhere.Table IIIGrowth phenotypes of isogenic sets of RRP6 and rrp6 strainsGenotype14 °C25 °C30 °CRRP6,PAP1+++++++RRP6, pap1–1++++−rrp6–1, pap1–1+/−+++rrp6–2, pap1–1+/−+++RRP6+++++++rrp6–1+/−++++rrp6–1, YCplac33+/−++++rrp6–1, YCpRRP6++++++Growth phenotypes were determined by incubation on YEPD or synthetic complete, URA− plates at the indicated temperatures. Open table in a new tab Growth phenotypes were determined by incubation on YEPD or synthetic complete, URA− plates at the indicated temperatures. The recessivity of the rrp6–1 cold-sensitive phenotype allowed us to clone the wild-type gene by complementation. We transformed anrrp6–1 strain with a yeast centromere-based genomic library (9Briggs M. Butler J.S. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and isolated one plasmid that conferred wild-type growth at 14 °C (pC114, Fig. 2). Plasmid rescue and retransformation confirmed plasmid linkage to complementation. Sequence determination of the ends of the pC114 insert and comparison with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) data base mapped the insert to chromosome XV. We performed a number of deletions to isolate the complementing open reading frame and found that complementation required the presence of a previously uncharacterized open reading frame, UNC733 (SCYOR001W, GenBank™ accession no. Z74909). For linkage analysis of rrp6–1 andUNC733, we targeted integration of an UNC733,URA3plasmid (p10dXB; Fig. 2) into the chromosomal UNC733 locus in an rrp6–1,ura3–52 strain. This strain was crossed to anRRP6,ura3–52 strain, the resultant diploid was sporulated, and the progeny were analyzed. All cold-sensitive progeny were URA+ (36/36) and all URA− spores were cold-resistant (25/25), thus demonstrating tight linkage ofrrp6–1 to the UNC733,URA3 plasmid. Furthermore, we constructed a strain with YIpRRP6 integrated at RRP6, which lost the integrated plasmid spontaneously in the absence of selection, probably due to the presence of CEN15 on the plasmid. Half of the resultant URA− isolates demonstrated normal growth at 14 °C, suggesting that homologous recombination between the chromosomal rrp6–1 and the plasmid-borneUNC733 had removed the chromosomal lesion. Taken together, these data indicate that the previously cloned, but hitherto uncharacterized gene UNC733 is allelic to rrp6–1and will hereafter be referred to as RRP6. The RRP6 open reading frame encodes a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 84,038 Da and an isoelectric point of 7.14. The sequence is relatively rich in leucine (11%), serine (9%), and lysine (8%), but a search for patterns found in the PROSITE Dictionary of Protein Sites and Patterns revealed no motifs in common with other characterized proteins. Comparison of the sequence with the Swissprot data base revealed significant homology to the human nucleolar PM-Scl 100-kDa autoantigen (18Ge Q. Frank M.B. O'Brien C. Targoff I.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Bluthner M. Bautz F.A. J. Exp.

Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fulton L. Gardener A. Green P. Hawkins T. Hillier L. Jier M. Nature. 1994; 348: 32-38Crossref Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Figure 3illustrates the alignment of the Rrp6p sequence with these sequences and shows a consensus sequence which serves to illustrate the regions of greatest homology among these polypeptides. BESTFIT analysis using a gap weight of 3.0 and a length weight of 0.1 revealed Rrp6p to be most closely related to the proteins from S. pombe (32% identity, 57% similarity), H. sapiens (32% identity, 52% similarity), and C. elegans (19% identity, 42% similarity). Rrp6p is also homologous, over a smaller region, to RNase D from E. coli(24% identity, 45% similarity) and H. influenza (22% identity, 48% similarity). The greatest region of homology among these proteins lies between amino acids 280 and 640 of Rrp6p within which lie six stretches of amino acids conserved in both sequence and relative position among all these species. These primary sequence homologies suggest the possibility that this core region represents the conservation of protein function among these organisms. Indeed, Hidden Markov computer modeling of E. coli endo- and exoribonucleases recently suggested that RRP6 and PM-Scl 100-kDa are members of a family of structurally related proteins including RNase D and the 3′–5′ deoxyriboexonuclease domains of DNA polymerases I (23Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Domains I, III, and V indicated in Fig. 3 contain, respectively, motifs homologous to the ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII domains shown to be essential for the two metal ligand mechanism of catalysis required for the 3′–5′ deoxyriboexonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I (24Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Putative nuclear localization signals are found in the C-terminal portions of the eukaryotic proteins (Fig. 3). Immunofluorescence experiments have shown that human PM-Scl 100 kDa exists in the nucleus and the nucleolus (25Targoff I.N. Reichlin M. Arthritis Rheum. 1985; 28: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but no characterization of the function of the protein has been reported. In light of the striking homology between Rrp6p and a known nucleolar protein, we reasoned thatrrp6–1 might cause a defect in some aspect of rRNA processing or ribosome biogenesis. Northern analysis of total cellular RNA from normal, rrp6–1, and rrp6–1 cells harboring the complementing plasmid YCpRRP6 revealed no obvious defects in the processing of the large rRNA precursors (data not shown). However, Northern blot analysis of total RNA separated on a polyacrylamide gel, using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to an internal portion of 5.8 S rRNA (o5.8S in Table II), revealed the accumulation of a novel 5.8 S rRNA intermediate in rrp6–1strains (Fig. 4 A). This intermediate (labeled 5.8S* in Fig. 4) is a doublet ~30 nucleotides longer than mature 5.8 S rRNA, and accounts for half of the 5.8 S rRNA in rrp6–1 strains. As expected, the presence of the complementing plasmid, YCpRRP6, reduces the accumulation of 5.8 S* by 95%, suggesting semidominance of rrp6–1 overRRP6. To determine if 5.8 S* represents a 5′ or 3′ extension of mature 5.8 S rRNA, we probed the same Northern blot with random-primed probes complementary to portions of ITS1 or ITS2 (Fig. 4,B and C, respectively). The ITS2 probe, but not the ITS1 probe, hybridized to 5.8 S*, suggesting that this molecule carries an extension at its 3′ end. If 5.8 S* rRNA accumulates solely due to a defect in 3′ end processing, then analysis of steady-state 5.8 S rRNA 5′ ends should reveal no differences between RRP6 and rrp6–1 strains. Indeed, primer extension analysis of the 5′ ends of 5.8 S rRNAs from the normal and rrp6–1 strains revealed no significant differences in the pattern or amounts of the short (5.8S S) and long (5.8S L) forms of 5.8 S rRNAs found in normal cells (Fig. 5; Refs. 26Rubin G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 27Lindahl L. Archer R.H. Zengel J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The detection of primer extension products ending at the A2 cleavage site in ITS1 (corresponding to the 27 S A2 precursor; see schematic in Fig. 1) with RNAs from normal and rrp6–1 strains indicates that reverse transcriptase was able to transcribe past the mature 5′ ends of 5.8 S rRNA to the 5′ end found in pre-5.8 S rRNAs. Since we detected norrp6–1-specific 5′-extended intermediates, we conclude that the rrp6–1 mutation causes a defect in 5.8 S rRNA 3′ end processing. We assessed the impact of a chromosomal deletion of RRP6 by replacing a 1.2-kilobase BglII fragment of RRP6with URA3 on a plasmid, followed by allelic exchange of chromosomal RRP6 with rrp6::URA3 in a diploid homozygous for ura3–52. PCR analysis of DNA from this diploid using primers adjacent to the insertion junctions ofRRP6 and URA3 verified disruption of one copy ofRRP6 (Fig. 6, A andB). Tetrad analysis after sporulation of this diploid revealed that disruption of RRP6 leads to a slow growth at 30 °C and an inability to grow at 37 °C, indicating that theRRP6 plays an important role in cell viability. Since the disruption did not lead to inviability we verified that the URA+ progeny indeed carried the disruptedrrp6::URA3 allele (Fig. 6, A andB). Analysis of 5.8 S rRNA from the disruptants showed a similar ratio of 5.8 S to 5.8 S* seen in a rrp6–1 strain, suggesting that rrp6–1 confers a null phenotype with respect to 5.8 S rRNA processing (Fig. 6 C). The results presented above cannot distinguish between a role for Rrp6p in normal 5.8 S 3′ end formation, or a role in destroying 5.8 S rRNA molecules with improperly processed 3′ ends. The former model predicts that 5.8 S* rRNA should appear before 5.8 S rRNA, thereby slowing its rate of formation compared with that in normal cells. To test this, we analyzed 5.8 S rRNA processing by pulse-chase labeling with [3H]uracil in normal andrrp6::URA3 cells. The results, shown in Fig.7, illustrate two interesting aspects of 5.8 S rRNA processing in mutant cells. First, the rate and extent of formation of total 5.8 S (5.8 S + 5.8 S*) is similar in normal andrrp6::URA3 cells. Second, the rates of formation of 5.8 S and 5.8 S* are vastly different in the two strains. Inrrp6::URA3 cells, 5.8 S rRNA appears at one-twentieth the rate in normal cells. Importantly, 5.8 S* formation precedes that of 5.8 S rRNA in rrp6::URA3 cells and 5.8 S* levels fall as 5.8 S levels begin to rise. These findings suggest that 5.8 S* rRNA is an intermediate in the major pathway leading to the production of mature 5.8 S rRNA. The viability and incomplete loss of 5.8 S rRNA 3′ end formation displayed by the rrp6::URA3 disruptant could result from partial Rrp6p function or from activity produced from a duplicate copy of Rrp6p. However, a search of the open reading frames in the S. cerevisiae genome data base revealed no significant matches to the Rrp6p ami"

The signal via CD27 plays pivotal roles in T-T and T-B cell interactions. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of CD27 activates NF-κB and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Deletion analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of CD27 revealed that the C-terminal PIQEDYR motif was indispensable for both NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation and was also required for the interaction with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 and TRAF5, both of which have been implicated in NF-κB activation by members of the TNF-R superfamily. Co-transfection of a dominant negative TRAF2 or TRAF5 blocked NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation induced by CD27. Recently, a TRAF2-interacting kinase has been identified, termed NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). A kinase-inactive mutant NIK blocked CD27-, TRAF2-, and TRAF5-mediated NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation.

The mechanism by which TRAFs activate NF-κB remains to be solved. Recently, a serine/threonine kinase was identified that interacts with TRAF2 and activates NF-κB, named NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (24Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of NIK in TRAF5- or TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation is uncertain.CD27 is functionally similar to other co-stimulatory receptors OX40, 4-1BB, and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) (25Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). HVEM was recently shown to interact with TRAF2 and TRAF5 (26Marsters S.A.

Elliott R. Kelley M. Boyle W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13471-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that CD27 activates both NF-κB and SAPK/JNK, which are mediated by TRAF2 and TRAF5. We also demonstrate that a kinase-inactive mutant of NIK inhibited TRAF2-, TRAF5-, and CD27-mediated NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation. These results indicated a crucial role of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in CD27 signaling and that NIK is a common downstream kinase of TRAF2 and TRAF5 for NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation.DISCUSSIONAccumulating data have indicated important roles of TRAFs in signaling through certain members of the TNF-R superfamily. Here, we demonstrated that CD27 associates with TRAF2 and TRAF5, and these TRAFs are implicated in NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation by CD27. Our results suggest that other members of the TNF-R superfamily, such as 4-1BB and OX40, may also interact with TRAFs and activate NF-κB and SAPK/JNK pathways. We also demonstrated that a kinase-inactive mutant NIK blocked TRAF5- and TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation, indicating that NIK is a common downstream kinase of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 for NF-κB activation. Previous studies (20Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 34Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) implied that mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 may be responsible for TNF- and TRAF-mediated SAPK/JNK activation. Here we demonstrated that NIK also activates SAPK/JNK pathway and a kinase-inactive mutant NIK partially inhibited SAPK/JNK activation by TRAF2, TRAF5, and CD27. The dominant negative effect of NIK-KM on SAPK/JNK activation by CD27 and TRAFs appeared to be weaker than that on NF-κB activation. These results suggest that other mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1, could compensate the dominant negative effect of NIK-KM on SAPK/JNK activation. The mechanism by which NIK activates SAPK/JNK pathway is currently under investigation. A previous study showed that CD27 cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several signal transducing molecules including ZAP70, and the treatment with a Src family kinase inhibitor, herbimycin, completely blocked co-stimulatory signal through CD27 (2Kobata T. Agematsu K. Kameoka J. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5422-5432PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that CD27 activates two distinct signaling pathways, one is protein tyrosine kinase-dependent and another is TRAF-dependent pathway, the latter of which activates NF-κB and SAPK/JNK.To date, it has been shown that CD27, CD30, CD40, LT-βR, and HVEM interact with both TRAF2 and TRAF5 (9Nakano H.

A common consequence of signaling through these receptors is the activation of NF-κB that can now be explained by their use of a similar set of TRAF proteins. However, these receptors display unique functions in vivo at several levels. For example, CD40 is involved in class switching and proliferation in B cells (35Kooten C.-V. Banchereau J. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CD27 enhances IgG production in B cells (3Kobata T. Jacquot S. Kozlowski S. Agematsu K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11249-11253Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CD30 is involved in some types of negative selection in the thymus (36Amakawa R. Hakem A. Kundig T.M. Matsuyama T. Simard J.J.L. Timms E. Wakeham A. Mittruecker H.-W. Griesser H. Takimoto H. Schmits R. Shahinian A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W.

Med. 1996; 184: 1999-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The unique functions in vivo may result in part from the different tissue expression patterns, in combination with the distinct expression patterns of their cognate ligands, as well as for each TRAF. Indeed, follicular dendritic cells, which play an important role in germinal center formation, exhibit high expression of LT-βR and TRAF5 (39Nakano H. Shindo M. Yamada K. Yoshida M.C. Santee S.M. Ware C.F. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Yagita H. Copeland N.G. Okumura K. Genomics. 1997; 42: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but little or no detectable TRAF2. The absence of LT-βR on lymphocytes distinguishes this receptor from lymphocyte-specific CD27. Clearly, TRAF2 and TRAF5 have some redundant functions in these tissue culture models; however, other interacting molecules may distinguish the roles of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in vivo. For example, TRAF5 does not interact with the TRAF2-binding proteins, TRADD 2H. Akiba and H. Nakano, unpublished data. or IAPs (40Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 23: 6914-6925Crossref Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TRAF5 interacts with TRAF3, but TRAF2 does not.2 These results suggested that TRAF2 and TRAF5 could exert unique functions through interaction with distinct sets of downstream signaling molecules. The recent generation of TRAF2-deficient mice revealed that SAPK/JNK activation, but not NF-κB activation, by TNF is abrogated in these mice (41Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Our preliminary results showed that a truncated TRAF5 partially inhibited NF-κB activation by TNF, suggesting that TRAF2 and TRAF5 may act redundantly in NF-κB activation by TNF. In contrast, SAPK/JNK activation may be more efficiently mediated by TRAF2 than TRAF5. Consistent with this notion, a higher potential of TRAF2 to activate SAPK/JNK (Fig.5 B) and truncated TRAF2 to inhibit CD27-mediated SAPK/JNK activation were noted (Fig. 5 C). At this moment, it remains to be determined whether TRAF2 and TRAF5 are functionally redundant in signals via CD27 and other members of the TNF-R family in TRAF2- and TRAF5-deficient mice.

The mechanism by which TRAFs activate NF-κB remains to be solved. Recently, a serine/threonine kinase was identified that interacts with TRAF2 and activates NF-κB, named NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (24Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of NIK in TRAF5- or TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation is uncertain. CD27 is functionally similar to other co-stimulatory receptors OX40, 4-1BB, and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) (25Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). HVEM was recently shown to interact with TRAF2 and TRAF5 (26Marsters S.A. Ayres T.M. Skubatch M. Gray C.L. Rothe M. Askenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14029-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Hsu H. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Elliott R. Kelley M. Boyle W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13471-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that CD27 activates both NF-κB and SAPK/JNK, which are mediated by TRAF2 and TRAF5. We also demonstrate that a kinase-inactive mutant of NIK inhibited TRAF2-, TRAF5-, and CD27-mediated NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation. These results indicated a crucial role of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in CD27 signaling and that NIK is a common downstream kinase of TRAF2 and TRAF5 for NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation. DISCUSSIONAccumulating data have indicated important roles of TRAFs in signaling through certain members of the TNF-R superfamily. Here, we demonstrated that CD27 associates with TRAF2 and TRAF5, and these TRAFs are implicated in NF-κB and SAPK/JNK activation by CD27. Our results suggest that other members of the TNF-R superfamily, such as 4-1BB and OX40, may also interact with TRAFs and activate NF-κB and SAPK/JNK pathways. We also demonstrated that a kinase-inactive mutant NIK blocked TRAF5- and TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation, indicating that NIK is a common downstream kinase of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 for NF-κB activation. Previous studies (20Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 34Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J.

Here we demonstrated that NIK also activates SAPK/JNK pathway and a kinase-inactive mutant NIK partially inhibited SAPK/JNK activation by TRAF2, TRAF5, and CD27. The dominant negative effect of NIK-KM on SAPK/JNK activation by CD27 and TRAFs appeared to be weaker than that on NF-κB activation. These results suggest that other mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1, could compensate the dominant negative effect of NIK-KM on SAPK/JNK activation. The mechanism by which NIK activates SAPK/JNK pathway is currently under investigation. A previous study showed that CD27 cross-linking induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several signal transducing molecules including ZAP70, and the treatment with a Src family kinase inhibitor, herbimycin, completely blocked co-stimulatory signal through CD27 (2Kobata T. Agematsu K. Kameoka J. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5422-5432PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that CD27 activates two distinct signaling pathways, one is protein tyrosine kinase-dependent and another is TRAF-dependent pathway, the latter of which activates NF-κB and SAPK/JNK.To date, it has been shown that CD27, CD30, CD40, LT-βR, and HVEM interact with both TRAF2 and TRAF5 (9Nakano H.

A common consequence of signaling through these receptors is the activation of NF-κB that can now be explained by their use of a similar set of TRAF proteins. However, these receptors display unique functions in vivo at several levels. For example, CD40 is involved in class switching and proliferation in B cells (35Kooten C.-V. Banchereau J. Adv.

The unique functions in vivo may result in part from the different tissue expression patterns, in combination with the distinct expression patterns of their cognate ligands, as well as for each TRAF. Indeed, follicular dendritic cells, which play an important role in germinal center formation, exhibit high expression of LT-βR and TRAF5 (39Nakano H. Shindo M. Yamada K. Yoshida M.C. Santee S.M.

The absence of LT-βR on lymphocytes distinguishes this receptor from lymphocyte-specific CD27. Clearly, TRAF2 and TRAF5 have some redundant functions in these tissue culture models; however, other interacting molecules may distinguish the roles of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in vivo. For example, TRAF5 does not interact with the TRAF2-binding proteins, TRADD 2H. Akiba and H. Nakano, unpublished data. or IAPs (40Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 23: 6914-6925Crossref Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TRAF5 interacts with TRAF3, but TRAF2 does not.2 These results suggested that TRAF2 and TRAF5 could exert unique functions through interaction with distinct sets of downstream signaling molecules. The recent generation of TRAF2-deficient mice revealed that SAPK/JNK activation, but not NF-κB activation, by TNF is abrogated in these mice (41Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

Our preliminary results showed that a truncated TRAF5 partially inhibited NF-κB activation by TNF, suggesting that TRAF2 and TRAF5 may act redundantly in NF-κB activation by TNF. In contrast, SAPK/JNK activation may be more efficiently mediated by TRAF2 than TRAF5. Consistent with this notion, a higher potential of TRAF2 to activate SAPK/JNK (Fig.5 B) and truncated TRAF2 to inhibit CD27-mediated SAPK/JNK activation were noted (Fig. 5 C). At this moment, it remains to be determined whether TRAF2 and TRAF5 are functionally redundant in signals via CD27 and other members of the TNF-R family in TRAF2- and TRAF5-deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W2090054404,"Phosphorylation of Ser118 of human estrogen receptor α (ER) enhances ER-mediated transcription and is induced by hormone binding and by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We discovered that phosphorylation of Ser118 reduces the electrophoretic mobility of the ER. Using this mobility shift as an assay, we determined the in vivo stoichiometry and kinetics of Ser118 phosphorylation in response to estradiol, ICI 182,780, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, estradiol induced a steady state phosphorylation of Ser118 within 20 min with a stoichiometry of 0.67 mol of phosphate/mol of ER. Estradiol did not activate p42/p44 MAPK, and basal p42/p44 MAPK activity was not sufficient to account for phosphorylation of Ser118 in response to estradiol. In contrast, both EGF and PMA induced a rapid, transient phosphorylation of Ser118 with a stoichiometry of ~0.25, and the onset of Ser118 phosphorylation correlated with the onset of p42/p44 MAPK activation by these agents. Either the EGF- or PMA-induced Ser118 phosphorylation could be inhibited without influencing estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation. The data suggest that a kinase other than p42/p44 MAPK is involved in the estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation. We propose that the hormone-induced change in ER conformation exposes Ser118 for phosphorylation by a constitutively active kinase. Phosphorylation of Ser118 of human estrogen receptor α (ER) enhances ER-mediated transcription and is induced by hormone binding and by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We discovered that phosphorylation of Ser118 reduces the electrophoretic mobility of the ER. Using this mobility shift as an assay, we determined the in vivo stoichiometry and kinetics of Ser118 phosphorylation in response to estradiol, ICI 182,780, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, estradiol induced a steady state phosphorylation of Ser118 within 20 min with a stoichiometry of 0.67 mol of phosphate/mol of ER. Estradiol did not activate p42/p44 MAPK, and basal p42/p44 MAPK activity was not sufficient to account for phosphorylation of Ser118 in response to estradiol. In contrast, both EGF and PMA induced a rapid, transient phosphorylation of Ser118 with a stoichiometry of ~0.25, and the onset of Ser118 phosphorylation correlated with the onset of p42/p44 MAPK activation by these agents. Either the EGF- or PMA-induced Ser118 phosphorylation could be inhibited without influencing estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation. The data suggest that a kinase other than p42/p44 MAPK is involved in the estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation. We propose that the hormone-induced change in ER conformation exposes Ser118 for phosphorylation by a constitutively active kinase.

In common with other steroid hormone receptors, the ER has an N-terminal domain with a hormone-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1), a central DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain with a hormone-dependent transcriptional activation function (AF-2) (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar, 2Weigel N. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition to being activated by binding to its ligand, estradiol, the ER can also be activated as a transcription factor by several nonsteroidal agents (2Weigel N. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the ER increases in response to estradiol (2Weigel N. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A major site of estradiol-induced phosphorylation is serine 118 (Ser118), which is located in AF-1 (3Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P.

In a number of cell types, mutation of Ser118 to Ala causes a reduction in estradiol-dependent transcriptional activation (4Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ser118 is located within the sequence PPQLSPFLQ which has a high degree of homology with the optimum peptide substrate identified for p44 MAPK (9Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Ser118 is also phosphorylated in response to EGF and PMA, possibly via p42/p44 MAPK (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 7Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the ER by EGF is diminished when Ser118 is mutated to Ala (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus both estradiol binding and activation of the MAPK pathway lead to phosphorylation of Ser118, and this phosphorylation is involved in regulating ER-mediated transcription. The evidence that p42/p44 MAPK directly phosphorylates Ser118 is based on in vitro observations that activated p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylated the N-terminal domain of the ER but not a mutant of this construct in which Ser118 was replaced with Ala (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). Additional supporting evidence is provided by the observation that in vivo a constitutively activated MAPK kinase (MAPKK) stimulated phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of the ER but did not stimulate phosphorylation of a mutant of this construct in which Ser118 was replaced with Ala (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). However, it has still not been established whether p42/p44 MAPK directly phosphorylates Ser118 in the context of the full-length ER in vivo. We demonstrate that the onset of Ser118 phosphorylation correlates with the onset of p42/p44 MAPK activation in response to EGF and PMA. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylates Ser118. However, our data demonstrate that p42/p44 MAPK is not responsible for the observed Ser118 phosphorylation in response to estradiol binding by the ER. Our results raise the possibility that Ser118 may be the site of phosphorylation by either two or more kinases in response to various stimuli. ICI 182,780 was a gift from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, United Kingdom. Pierre Chambon (Unité 184 de Biologie Moléculaire et de Génétique de I'INSERM, Strasbourg Cédex, France) kindly provided pSG5-ER (the human estrogen receptor cDNA (10Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar)). The mutants S118A-ER, S104/106/118A-ER, S154A-ER, and S167A-ER were created by site-directed mutagenesis of pSG5-ER using the megaprimer method (11Barik S. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). pSI-β-galactosidase contains the β-galactosidase gene in the pSI vector from Promega. COS-1, MCF-7, T-47D, and NMuMG cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. All media used in this study were phenol-red free, and all fetal bovine serum used was charcoal-dextran-treated (CFBS). COS-1, T-47D, and NMuMG cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's Nutrient Mix F-12 supplemented with 10% CFBS. COS-1 media contained 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. T-47D and NMuMG cell media contained antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% CFBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated 24 h in media without serum prior to treatment with steroids or other agents unless indicated otherwise. COS-1 cells were transfected by the diethylaminoethyl-dextran method as modified by Reese and Katzenellenbogen (12Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6595-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each 6-cm plate was transfected with 0.5 μg of pSG5-ER or pSG5-ER mutant plus 2 μg of pGL2-Basic Vector (Promega) as carrier DNA. Following dimethyl sulfoxide treatment, the cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium before treatment with estradiol or PMA and harvesting. Following treatment with steroids or agents as indicated in the figure legends, the cells (on 6-cm plates) were washed with warm PBS and 0.5 ml of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.12 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2 m DTT, 0.008% bromphenol blue) near 100 °C was then added to the plate. The cells were scraped into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube in a heat block at 100 °C. The tubes were heated for 10 min, cooled on ice, and stored at −20 °C until samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. At the time of electrophoresis, samples were reheated for 5 min at 100 °C, and 30-μl aliquots were layered on 7% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresed until the 43-kDa marker reached the bottom of the gel. Proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. For detection of the ER, immunoblotting was performed with monoclonal antibody α78–1-C6 (mAb 78) (13Traish A.M. Al-Fadhli S.M. Klinge C.M. Quick T.C. 76th Annual Meeting of The Endocrine Society. 1994; (, Anaheim, CA): 319Google Scholar) for COS-1 extracts or monoclonal antibody EVG F9 (mAb F9) (14Traish A.M. Pavao M. Steroids. 1996; 61: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for MCF-7, T-47D, or NMuMG extracts. For detection of activated p42/p44 MAPK, immunoblotting was performed with anti-ACTIVE MAPK (Promega). For detection of total p42/p44 MAPK, immunoblotting was performed with ANTI-pan ERK (Transduction Laboratories). All immunoblots used either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody interactions were detected with NEN Life Science Products Western chemiluminescence reagent. Varying exposures of the film were taken. A Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer with ImageQuant software was used to determine the relative amount of ER in the immunoblot bands. To ensure that a linear response over the range of ER concentrations obtained from the experiments was achieved, a standard curve relating the amount of ER to the densitometric reading was performed. The relative intensities of the ER bands were quantitated from various exposures of the film. MCF-7 cells were treated for 38 min with 1 nm estradiol and then rinsed with cold PBS. The cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 0.15 mNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 20 mmNa2MoO4, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, 200 nmokadaic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 units/ml DNase 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.)). The ER was immunoprecipitated with mAb α78 as described (5Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) buffer (New England Biolabs), and two aliquots were suspended in a final volume of 30 μl of PP1 buffer with 1 mm MnCl2. One tube received 1 unit of PP1, and both tubes were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 100 °C. Sample proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and immunoblotted as described above. For transcriptional analysis, MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 6-cm dish in DMEM containing 5% CFBS and antibiotic-antimycotic the day before transfection. Cells were transfected by 15 μl of lipofectAMINE in 2 ml of DMEM according to the instructions provided by Life Technologies, Inc. with 0.5 μg of 2ERE-MpGL2 (luciferase reporter plasmid), 1.0 μg of pSI-β-galactosidase (for normalizing luciferase data), and 1.5 μg of pGL2-Basic Vector (carrier DNA). The cells were left overnight in the incubator and washed once with PBS before the addition of DMEM with the appropriate concentration of estradiol, modulators, or vehicle. After treatment for 5.5 h, the cells were lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described previously (5Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the in-gel kinase assay, MCF-7 cells were washed with PBS and lysed with ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 6 mm DTT, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation, and SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added. The extracts (10 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE with 0.05 mg/ml myelin basic protein polymerized in the gel. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were denatured and renatured as described (15Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The gels were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C in 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 25 μm ATP (40 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP). The gels were washed as described (15Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), dried, and autoradiographed. Many proteins migrate more slowly on SDS-PAGE due to phosphorylation of particular sites. Estradiol addition to cells causes the ER to migrate as a doublet on SDS-PAGE (5Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Joel P. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16Washburn T. Hocutt A. Brautigan D.L. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We showed that in human ER expressed in COS-1 cells the major difference in the phosphorylation of the upper and lower bands was phosphorylation of Ser118 in the upper band. Furthermore, a mutant ER in which Ser118 was replaced with Ala was phosphorylated at a level only 20% that of the wild type (5Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and did not upshift when cells were treated with estradiol (5Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser118appeared to be required for the electrophoretic upshift. This electrophoretic upshift could be used to monitor the phosphorylation of Ser118, greatly facilitating the characterization of kinases that phosphorylate Ser118. Therefore, we wanted to confirm that only the phosphorylation of Ser118 was required for the electrophoretic upshift. Phosphorylation of the ER occurs only on Ser residues (3Le Goff P. Montano M.M.

Endocrinol. 1990; 74: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with the exception of a low level of phosphorylation on Tyr537in the human ER (19Arnold S.F. Obourn J.D. Jaffe H. Notides A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Le Goff et al. (3Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a mutant of the ER lacking the A/B region (amino acids 1–175) showed no estradiol-induced phosphorylation, indicating that the hormone-induced phosphorylation sites are predominantly in the A/B region. To determine whether phosphorylation of another Ser in the A/B region in addition to Ser118 is required for the electrophoretic upshift, we prepared mutants in which other Ser residues in the A/B region known or suspected to be phosphorylated were replaced by Ala residues (2Weigel N. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Ser-104 and Ser-106 were replaced with Ala residues to create the mutant S104/106A-ER. Ser-118, Ser-154, and Ser-167 were individually mutated to Ala to create the mutants S118A-ER, S154A-ER, and S167A-ER. The wild type and mutant ERs were transfected into COS-1 cells. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-ER antibody. Data displayed in Fig. 1, lanes 1–4 show that after subtraction of the control, estradiol converted 30% of the wild type ER to the upshifted form, PMA converted about 65% of the receptor, and estradiol plus PMA converted 83% of the receptor. In contrast, Fig. 1, lanes 5–8 show that neither estradiol nor PMA caused a change in mobility with the mutant S118A-ER. All of the other mutants, S167A-ER (lanes 9–12), S154A-ER (lanes 13–16), and S104/106A-ER (lanes 17–20) responded to estradiol and PMA similarly to the wild type. Thus, the change in mobility of the ER did not require phosphorylation of Ser residues 104, 106, 154, or 167. To determine whether estradiol causes phosphorylation of Ser118 in endogenous ER in mammary cell lines, MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma), NMuMG (mouse mammary gland normal epithelium), and T-47D (human breast duct carcinoma, pleural effusion), cells were incubated for 30 min with estradiol or vehicle. Estradiol induced an electrophoretic upshift of the ER in all three mammary cell lines (Fig.2 A,immunoblot). To confirm that the upshift was due to phosphorylation, MCF-7 cells were treated with estradiol, and the ER was immunoprecipitated. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitate were incubated with and without PP1. ER incubated without PP1 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) had 35% of the ER upshifted, whereas only 3% of the ER was upshifted (lane 2) in ER incubated with PP1. The amount of ER in thelower band in lane 2 is equivalent to the amount of ER in the two bands in lane 1 combined, indicating that dephosphorylation of the ER in the upper band converted it into the lower band. The fraction of ER recovered in the upper band following immunoprecipitation was less than when the cells were treated directly with hot SDS sample buffer (Fig. 2 A), presumably due to the action of phosphatases during immunoprecipitation. These results together with the data with mutants confirm that Ser118 was phosphorylated in endogenous ER in human breast cells and most likely on the analogous Ser122 in mouse mammary cells. To determine the dose response of Ser118 phosphorylation to estradiol in vivo, MCF-7 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of estradiol. Estradiol-induced phosphorylation of Ser118 was maximal at approximately 1 nm estradiol, with an average of 67% of the receptor phosphorylated on Ser118 (Fig.3). Thus the stoichiometry of Ser118 phosphorylation is higher in cells that normally express ER as compared with heterologously expressed ER in COS-1 cells. To determine whether ICI 182,780 induces Ser118phosphorylation, MCF-7 cells were treated with various concentrations of ICI 182,780. Interestingly, although ICI 182,780 is a pure ER antagonist (20Gibson M.K. Nemmers L.A. Beckman Jr., W.C. Davis V.L. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. Endocrinol. 1991; 129: 2000-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), 30 nm of this compound induced phosphorylation of Ser118 to the same extent as estradiol (Fig. 3). We found that ICI 182,780 caused a rapid decrease in total ER protein, an observation in agreement with reports for ICI 164,384 (20Gibson M.K. Nemmers L.A. Beckman Jr., W.C. Davis V.L. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. Endocrinol. 1991; 129: 2000-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. White R. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10 nm estradiol for 1 h did not significantly alter the total amount of ER protein, whereas treatment with 10 nm ICI 182,780 for 1 h reduced the total amount of ER protein by 70% compared with the control level (data not shown). Ser118 is also phosphorylated in response to EGF and PMA, possibly via p42/p44 MAPK (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 7Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 8Joel P. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to compare the time course and stoichiometry of Ser118 phosphorylation in response to both EGF and PMA as compared with estradiol. Within 5 min of estradiol treatment, phosphorylation of Ser118 was already noticeable (Fig.4 A) and was maximal within 20 min, remaining at that maximal level at 60 min. In response to EGF, approximately 24% of the receptor was phosphorylated on Ser118, and this maximal level was reached within 5 min after addition of ligand (Fig. 4 B). In response to PMA, approximately 26% of the receptor was phosphorylated on Ser118, and phosphorylation reached a maximum level within 10 min (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the extent and time course of induction of Ser118 phosphorylation differed considerably between estradiol, EGF, and PMA. Estradiol causes a rapid but prolonged phosphorylation, whereas EGF and PMA cause rapid and transient phosphorylation of Ser118. Next, to ensure that we were studying Ser118phosphorylation under conditions in which EGF and PMA influence ER-mediated transcription, we determined the effect of both EGF and PMA on ER-dependent transcription in MCF-7 cells. These cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct that contained a luciferase gene regulated by two palindromic estrogen response elements (ERE) and a plasmid that constitutively expresses β-galactosidase. This latter construct allows the luciferase data to be normalized for transfection efficiency. In parallel experiments, the cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct that did not contain the EREs. These experiments were necessary to eliminate transcriptional responses that were independent of the ERE. Following transfection, the cells were treated for 5.5 h with PMA, EGF, or vehicle with or without estradiol. PMA and EGF caused a small steroid-independent activation of transcription from the ERE-containing reporter plasmid of 1.9- and 1.8 times, respectively (Fig. 5). Estradiol alone stimulated transcription by 5.5 times. Adding PMA and estradiol together resulted in 11.7 times activation, indicating that their effects are synergistic. A combination of EGF and estradiol modestly increased transcription by 1.2 times compared with estradiol alone. Thus ligand-dependent and -independent activation of ER-dependent transcription occurs in MCF-7 cells. It has been reported that estradiol can stimulate signal transduction pathways that lead to p42/p44 MAPK activation in MCF-7 cells (22Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Aurricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that p42/p44 MAPK was responsible for Ser118 phosphorylation in response to estradiol, serum-starved MCF-7 cells were treated with either estradiol, EGF, or PMA, and Ser118 phosphorylation and p42/p44 MAPK activation were determined. As Fig.6 A shows, the onset of Ser118 phosphorylation paralleled the onset of activation of p42/p44 MAPK by EGF. The activated form of p42/p44 MAPK was detected by using an antibody that specifically recognizes the dually phosphorylated form of p42/p44 MAPK (23Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The rapid onset of phosphorylation of Ser118 also paralleled the onset of p42/p44 MAPK activation by PMA. However, activation of p42/p44 MAPK was not observed in response to estradiol. The immunoblot with an antibody that recognizes both activated and unactivated forms of p42/p44 MAPK demonstrated that approximately equal levels of p42/p44 MAPK were present in each lane. In other experiments, extended exposure of the anti-active MAPK immunoblot demonstrated the presence of basal p42/p44 MAPK activity. However, this low level of activity was not enhanced by estradiol (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7The inhibitors PD98059, staurosporine, and GF109203X prevent Ser118 phosphorylation induced by either PMA or EGF but not that induced by estradiol. Serum-starved MCF-7 cells were used in all experiments. In panel A,cells were pretreated with 100 μm PD98059 or vehicle for 30 min. Then either 1 nm estradiol or vehicle was added for 20 min, or 100 ng/ml EGF or vehicle was added for 5 min. Inpanel B, cells were pretreated 30 min with 5 μm staurosporine or vehicle. Then 1 nmestradiol, 100 nm PMA, or vehicle was added for 15 min. Inpanel C, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm GF109203X or vehicle. Then 1 nm estradiol, 100 nm PMA, or vehicle was added for 15 min. Lysates were analyzed as described in Fig. 6. The percent upshift of the ER was determined from immunoblots by densitometry. The means ± S.D. are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As an alternative approach to determine whether estradiol activates p42/p44 MAPK, an in-gel kinase assay was performed using extracts from MCF-7 cells that had been treated with estradiol, PMA, EGF, or vehicle. The substrate embedded in the gel was myelin basic protein. Both PMA and EGF stimulated a protein kinase of ~42 kDa (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1, 3, and 5 versus 4 and6), which indicates that p42/p44 MAPK was active in the in-gel kinase assay. However, estradiol did not stimulate p42/p44 MAPK or any other protein kinases to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1, 3, and 5 versus 2). Thus two different approaches both indicated that estradiol did not activate p42/p44 MAPK. The above results suggest that activation of p42/p44 MAPK may be involved in the phosphorylation of Ser118 in response to EGF and PMA but not in response to estradiol. To further test this hypothesis we compared the effects of various inhibitors on either the EGF- or PMA-induced Ser118phosphorylation versus the estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. Fig. 7 A shows that PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK-activating enzyme (MEK1/2) (24Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar), diminished the EGF-induced Ser118 phosphorylation but did not affect the estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. Extended exposure of the anti-active MAPK immunoblot showed faint bands corresponding to active p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK. This basal activity of p42/p44 MAPK diminishes in extracts taken from cells pretreated with PD98059 before addition of estradiol or EGF. Estradiol did not increase p42/p44 MAPK activity above the basal level. Importantly, even though PD98059 was able to diminish basal p42/p44 MAPK activity, PD98059 did not effect estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. It has been suggested that there are two MEK1/2-independent pathways for activating p42/p44 MAPK; one pathway involves PKC, and the other pathway involves phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (25Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both staurosporine and GF109203X, inhibitors of PKC (26Meijer L. Trends Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely prevented phosphorylation of Ser118 in response to PMA but had no effect on Ser118 phosphorylation induced by estradiol (Fig. 7, B and C). Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells for 30 min with 100 nm wortmannin, conditions shown to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (28Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), did not reduce estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation (data not shown). An inhibitor combination of GF109203X, PD98059, and wortmannin also did not affect estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation (data not shown). Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells for 30 min with 20 μm SB203580, conditions shown to inhibit the activation of p38 MAPK (29Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), had no effect on the estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation (data not shown). These results provide additional evidence that estradiol does not activate a signal transduction pathway that leads to p42/p44 MAPK or p38 MAPK activation. Of interest to note is that Trowbridge et al. (30Trowbridge J.M. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10132-10137Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have suggested that the cyclin A·cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) complex phosphorylates the ER. However, staurosporine, which inhibits a number of kinases including PKC and cdk2 at similar concentrations (26Meijer L. Trends Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 393-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), had no affect on estradiol-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 7 C). Moreover, pretreatment of MCF-7 cells for 30 min with 100 μm olomoucine, a condition that inhibits cdk1 and cdk2 (31VeselyÖ J. Havliček L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.-Y. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), also did not affect estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation (data not shown). These data do not support a model in which cdk2 is the kinase responsible for Ser118phosphorylation in response to estradiol binding by the ER. Our results demonstrate that p42/p44 MAPK is not activated in response to estradiol. It could be argued, however, that the estradiol-bound receptor is an extremely good substrate for p42/p44 MAPK and that even the activity of p42/p44 MAPK in the presence of PD98059 is sufficient for 67% of the ER molecules to be phosphorylated in response to estradiol. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether increasing p42/p44 MAPK activity would enhance estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. Increasing amounts of EGF were added to MCF-7 cells that had been pretreated with a high concentration of estradiol for an extended period of time. This pretreatment was performed to ensure that ER binding to estradiol was not rate-limiting for Ser118 phosphorylation. The lowest dose of EGF did not effect estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation even though p42/p44 MAPK activity was significantly increased over the basal level (Fig. 8). Higher levels of EGF which dramatically enhanced p42/p44 MAPK activity only increased Ser118 phosphorylation to the same extent as EGF alone and did not induce 100% of the estradiol-bound ER molecules to be phosphorylated (Fig. 8). Phosphorylation of Ser118 is involved in regulating the transcriptional activity of AF-1 in response to either estradiol or EGF (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although Ser118 had been identified as a putative substrate for p42/p44 MAPK, no information concerning the stoichiometry and kinetics of Ser118 phosphorylation in response to estrogen agonists or antagonists, EGF, or PMA was known. We developed a convenient and quantitative electrophoretic mobility assay to monitor specifically the in vivo phosphorylation of Ser118. Using this assay, we provide the first evidence that phosphorylation of Ser118 occurs in human breast cancer cells, a physiologically relevant target tissue. The rapidity of Ser118 phosphorylation in response to estradiol suggests that the phosphorylation is a direct response to hormone binding. Le Goff et al. (3Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that ICI 164,384 increases phosphorylation of the ER but they did not determine the sites of phosphorylation. Interestingly, we have found that both estradiol and ICI 182,780 induce Ser118 phosphorylation to a similar extent. The receptor is known to have a different conformation after it binds agonist as opposed to antagonist (32Beekman J.M. Allan G.F. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1266-1274PubMed Google Scholar). However, the conformational difference induced by estradiol and ICI 182,780 does not seem to affect the N-terminal region of the receptor. Although EGF and PMA only transiently induce Ser118phosphorylation, these agents are able to stimulate ER-mediated transcription. In agreement with published reports, we observed that EGF and PMA with or without estradiol enhanced ER-mediated transcription (7Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 33Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Teng C.T. Ross K.A. Parker M.G. Korach K.S. McLachlan J.A. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 137: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser118appears to be important for ER-mediated transcription since a mutant ER in which Ser118 is replaced with Ala has a diminished transcriptional ability compared with the wild type ER (4Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). One possible model to explain the mechanism by which EGF and PMA can enhance ER-mediated transcription is that transient Ser118phosphorylation is sufficient to induce a cascade of events that eventually lead to transcriptional activation. Of interest to note is that a combination of EGF and estradiol additively enhance ER-mediated transcription, whereas a combination of PMA and estradiol synergistically effect transcription. It is possible that EGF only enhances Ser118 phosphorylation, whereas PMA can also influence another step in ER-mediated transcription. Thus the effects of EGF and estradiol are additive because both agents are influencing the same event, whereas the effects of PMA and estradiol are synergistic because these agents are influencing multiple steps that are involved in ER-mediated transcription. Our results with EGF and PMA are consistent with Ser118being a substrate for activated p42/p44 MAPK (6Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Susaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 7Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In contrast to our results with EGF and PMA, we obtained three different lines of evidence that p42/p44 MAPK is not the kinase responsible for the estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. First, activation of p42/p44 MAPK activity was not detectable in serum-starved MCF-7 cells treated with estradiol. These results are in disagreement with the work of Miagliaccio et al. (22Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Aurricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Second, basal level of p42/p44 MAPK is not sufficient to account for the estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. This reasoning is based on the observation that decreasing the basal p42/p44 MAPK activity with PD98059 had no effect on estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation. Furthermore, if basal p42/p44 MAPK activity was responsible for the estradiol-induced Ser118phosphorylation, then elevation of p42/p44 MAPK activity should result in 100% of the estradiol-bound ER molecules being phosphorylated. This result was not observed. Third, inhibitors that diminished either the EGF or PMA enhancement of p42/p44 MAPK activity and induction of Ser118 phosphorylation did not affect the estradiol-induced phosphorylation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest thatin vivo Ser118 of the human ER is a target for two or more kinases that are regulated differentially by second messengers. Trowbridge et al. (30Trowbridge J.M. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10132-10137Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that cdk2 enhances both ligand-dependent and -independent transcription by ER. Anin vitro kinase assay demonstrated that Ser104and Ser106 of the human ER were the likely targets of cdk2 activity. However, we did not observe any effect of the inhibitors staurosporine and olomoucine which inhibit cdk2 on estradiol-induced Ser118 phosphorylation. Like Ser118, Ser104 and Ser106 are adjacent to proline residues. In our 32P-labeling experiments, Ser104 and Ser106 were minor sites of phosphorylation compared with Ser118 (5Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Joel P. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This paper provides the first evidence that more than one kinase regulates Ser118 phosphorylation of the human ER. One simple model to explain the estradiol-induced phosphorylation of Ser118 is that, upon hormone binding, the ER undergoes a conformational change that makes the ER a better substrate for a constitutively active kinase. Phosphorylation of Ser118 may allow the ER to integrate signals from hormone binding and activation of the MAPK pathway. We thank Danielle Desrosiers for excellent technical assistance.

Recent evidence suggests that viral protein R (Vpr) plays a key regulatory role in this process by binding to karyopherin α, a cellular receptor for nuclear localization signals, and increasing its affinity for the nuclear localization signals. An in vitro binding assay was used to investigate the role of Vpr in docking of the HIV-1 preintegration complex (PIC) to the nuclear pore complex. Mutant HIV-1 PICs that lack Vpr were impaired in the ability to dock to isolated nuclei and recombinant nucleoporins. Although Vpr by itself associated with nucleoporins, the docking of Vpr+ PICs was dependent on karyopherin β and was blocked by antibodies to β. Vpr stabilized docking by preventing nucleoporin-stimulated dissociation of the import complex. These results suggest a biochemical mechanism for Vpr function in transport of the HIV-1 genome across the nuclear pore complex.

Without Vpr, viral NLS-proteins and the HIV-1 PIC are weak or nonfunctional karyophiles, which is illustrated in two reports that failed to detect karyophilic features of MA (16Freed E.O. Englund G.

The studies reported here were undertaken to investigate how this Vpr-mediated effect is converted into a more efficient nuclear import of the HIV-1 PIC. Molecular exchanges between the nucleus and cytoplasm are mediated by the nuclear pore complex, a multimolecular structure spanning the nuclear membrane and containing >100 different proteins (nucleoporins). Although only a few of these proteins have been molecularly characterized (18Rout M.P. Wente S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 357-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), a group of nucleoporins modified withO-linked N-acetylglucosamine has been implicated in nuclear protein import (reviewed in Ref. 19Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TheseO-linked glycoproteins contain characteristic multiple repeats with cores that are rich in phenylalanine (such as the FXFG repeat, where X can be any amino acid) which appear to interact with cytosolic transport factors (20Paschal B.M.

Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function as a docking site in an import process. Surprisingly, the FXFG repeat region of the yeast nucleoporin Nup1p stimulated dissociation of the import complex (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), indicating that different FXFG-containing proteins may have distinct, specific functions. In this report, we investigated the role of Vpr in docking of the HIV-1 PIC to nucleoporins. We demonstrate that PICs lacking Vpr are impaired in the ability to dock to the FXFG repeat region of the yeast Nup1p and to mammalian p54, but not p58, nucleoporin. Vpr stabilized association between karyopherin α/β heterodimer and NLS-containing proteins, including HIV-1 MA, thus preventing dissociation of the import complex upon addition of the FXFG repeat-containing region of Nup1p. Taken together, our results suggest a model whereby Vpr regulates docking of the HIV-1 preintegration complex to the nuclear pore complex.

In ΔVpr virus, the initiating ATG of the vpr gene was changed to GTG, and in dVpr a frameshift mutation was introduced at codon 63 of Vpr (27Westervelt P. Henkel T. Trowbridge D.B. Orenstein J. Heuser J. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); both mutations abolished expression of Vpr. All viruses were obtained from supernatants of Jurkat (a CD4+ T cell line) cells transfected with molecular clones. Infections of H9 cells (another CD4+ T cell line) were performed at viral titers equalized according to CAp24 content. Cells were incubated with virus (100 ng of CAp24 per 106 cells, corresponding to approximately 103 virions/cell) for 2 h at 37 °C, then washed 3 times, and incubated for an additional 4–5 h at 37 °C to allow reverse transcription to proceed. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by lysis of cells in cold, hypotonic buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by 20–30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysis was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. After removal of nuclei, cytoplasmic extracts containing the HIV-1 PICs were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and aliquots were frozen at −70 °C. Expression and purification of Vpr (carrying an N-terminal His-tag) and GST-MA has been described previously (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared from CEM174 T cells. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclei were precipitated at 500 × g, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with cytoplasmic extracts of HIV-infected cells. The intactness of the nuclei was determined by immunofluorescence using antibody to histone deacetylase, a predominantly intranuclear enzyme. Following incubation, nuclei were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bound HIV-1 DNA was extracted using the Hirt procedure. DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers specific for the pol gene, as described previously (2Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. Dempsey M.P. Stanwick T.L. Bukrinskaya A.G. Haggerty S. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl.

GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins (GST-p54, GST-p58, GST-Nup1, or GST) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. After washing, the beads were mixed with cytoplasmic extracts containing HIV-1 PICs in 0.14 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 30 min. Approximately 50 μg of immobilized protein was used per extract of 108 infected cells. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation and were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. HIV-1 DNA was extracted from the beads and analyzed by PCR. The solution binding assay was performed as described previously (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) using recombinant MA and Vpr (see above), NLS-GST, yeast karyopherins, and the FXFG repeat region of Nup1p. Because a recent report (17Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E. Simon J.H. Fischer U. Malim M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4531-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) suggested that mutations in the MA NLS may alter the processing of viral core proteins and thus affect the conformation of the HIV-1 PIC, we first compared the compositions of wild type PICs and mutant PICs used in this study. The PICs were immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasmic lysates of infected H9 cells using antibodies to MA, IN, or reverse transcriptase, which are the major components of the HIV-1 PIC (28Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. McDonald T.L. Pushkarskaya T. Tarpley W.G. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6125-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 29Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The viral DNA was revealed by PCR using primers specific for the pol gene. These primers amplify a late-stage product of reverse transcription which is practically undetectable in HIV-1 virions. The PCR-based quantification system is linear in relation to HIV-1 DNA (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The PICs of all four viruses contained approximately similar amounts of HIV-1 DNA (Fig. 1 A), indicating that mutations in the MA NLS or Vpr did not cause major alterations in the structure of the PIC. Docking of the import substrate to the nuclear envelope is the first step in the process of nuclear translocation (30Pante N. Aebi U. Science. 1996; 273: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 31Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This step is not energy-dependent and can be completed at 4 °C (31Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of Vpr and the MA NLS in docking of the HIV-1 PIC to the nuclear membrane by incubating PICs with isolated nuclei of CEM 174 T cells for 1 h at 4 °C. As a source of HIV-1 PICs we used cytoplasmic extracts of H9 cells that were infected with wild-type or HIV-1 carrying inactivating mutations in the MA NLS or Vpr. All cytoplasmic extracts used contained similar amounts of HIV-1 PICs (Fig. 1 A) and HIV-1 DNA (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). The relative amount of nuclei-bound PICs was estimated by PCR. The results revealed that mutation in the Vpr (MA NLS+Vpr− virus) reduced the amount of nuclei-bound PICs approximately 3-fold (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of Vpr, mutation in the MA NLS (MA NLS−Vpr+ virus) reduced the amount of bound PICs less than 2-fold. As expected, the greatest effect (almost a 4-fold reduction in the amount of bound PICs) was exerted by the combination of the MA NLS and Vpr mutations (MA NLS−Vpr− virus). The differences in binding activities between viruses used in this experiment provided an internal control for specificity of binding, since all lysates contained similar amounts of PICs (Fig. 1 A). The intactness of nuclei was monitored by microscopy (95% of nuclei looked morphologically intact) and by immunofluorescence using antibody to histone deacetylase (only ≈10% of nuclei were stained). To discard the possibility that these 10% of compromised nuclei accounted for the observed differences in binding, we treated nuclei with 1% Triton X-100. Under these conditions, all the nuclei became IF-positive; however, the amount of bound HIV-1 DNA was reduced to background levels (not shown). These results suggest that Vpr regulates docking of the HIV-1 PIC to the nuclear envelope. Nucleoporins that contain the FXFG peptide repeats have been suggested to act as docking sites during protein nuclear import (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 22Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1699-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To assess the role of MA and Vpr in docking of HIV-1 PICs to nucleoporins, we used a solution binding assay and recombinant forms of the mammalian nucleoporins p54 and p58 which contain the FXFG peptide repeats. GlutathioneS-transferase fusions of these nucleoporins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, and cell extracts containing HIV-1 PICs were mixed with the beads for 1 h. The cell extracts used are expected to contain any karyopherins needed to dock the substrate to nucleoporins. After washing the beads, the amount of viral DNA bound was detected using the PCR based assay (Fig.2 A), and the signals obtained were quantified on a Packard Direct Imaging system (Fig.2 B). In control experiments, viral DNA stripped of its proteins did not bind to the GST-nucleoporins (not shown), and HIV-1 PICs did not bind significantly to GST (Fig. 2, A andB). Wild-type PICs were docked efficiently to GST-nucleoporins (lane 1). A mutation in the MA NLS had only a modest effect on docking (lane 2). In contrast, mutation of Vpr abolished docking of HIV-1 PICs to p54, but had a minor effect on docking to p58 (lane 3). Double mutant PICs were most defective in docking to p54 or p58 (lane 4). Nuclear import machinery has been extremely well conserved through evolution, and the yeast system has been very well characterized and proven valuable for defining interactions between the major nuclear import factors (10Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 14Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether the FXFG repeat regions of nucleoporins serve as the docking site, we performed a solution binding experiment with an immobilized fragment of the yeast nucleoporin Nup1p containing the FXFG peptide repeats (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Although docking of wild-type PICs to this fragment of Nup1p was efficient (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), docking of two different Vpr-defective PICs was reduced more than 3-fold (lanes 2 and 3, and the bar graph). Altogether, these results support the notion that Vpr controls import at the level of docking between HIV-1 and nucleoporin FXFG peptide repeat regions. A recently published report (34Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Vpr binds to nuclear envelope and suggested that Vpr may functionally resemble karyopherin β in targeting the PIC to nucleoporins. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed binding of Vpr in vitro to human nucleoporins p54 and p58, and to the FXFG repeat of yeast nucleoporin Nup1p (Fig.3 A). However, antibodies to karyopherin β, previously shown to inhibit HIV-1 nuclear import (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), blocked binding of the HIV-1 PICs to both human nucleoporins and to the FXFG repeat of Nup1p (Fig. 3 B). We thus conclude that Vpr regulates karyopherin β-mediated docking of the HIV-1 PIC. In order to examine the molecular interactions between Vpr and the cellular nuclear import machinery in greater detail, we used yeast factors. In previous experiments, addition of the FXFG repeat region of Nup1p to a karyopherin α/β-NLS protein complex caused the release of the NLS protein from karyopherin α/β (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6–8 (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar)). This result suggests that karyopherin α/β lowers its affinity for the ligand upon binding to a nucleoporin FXFG repeat region (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Strikingly, addition of Vpr reversed this effect and promoted the formation of a stable docking complex between karyopherin α/β, GST-NLS (carrying the SV-40 large T NLS (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar)), and the nucleoporin (lanes 2–4). The same effect was reproduced using immobilized GST-MA as an NLS-containing protein. Again, addition of the FXFG repeat region of Nup1p to a karyopherin α/β-MA complex stimulated the release of karyopherin α/β from MA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–4); this effect was reversed by adding Vpr (lanes 6–8). Thus, Vpr can stabilize the interaction between karyopherin-NLS protein complexes, including complexes with HIV-1 MA, and nucleoporins. Our data suggest that Vpr facilitates the docking of HIV-1 PICs by stabilizing association between the FXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins and the import complex of karyopherins α/β and cargo. Without Vpr, the ability of PICs to dock to whole nuclei (Fig.1 B) and to recombinant nucleoporins (Fig. 2) is diminished. Also, the nuclear import of such complexes is greatly impaired (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the MA NLS had a modest effect on docking of the HIV-1 PIC (Figs. 1 B and 2), probably because other NLSs in the PIC (6Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 35Nadler S.G. Tritschler D. Haffar O.K. Blake J. Bruce A.G. Cleaveland J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4310-4315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) can substitute for the mutant MA NLS. Our results reveal differences between the FXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. Whereas binding of the import complex containing the HIV-1 PIC to nucleoporin p54 required the presence of Vpr (Fig. 2 A), similar to the situation with the yeast FXFG repeat region of Nup1p (Fig. 2 C), nucleoporin p58 could bind the import complex lacking Vpr, consistent with its proposed function as a docking site (25Hu T. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 589-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our finding that binding of the HIV-1 PIC to the whole nuclei requires Vpr (Fig. 1 B) suggests that Vpr-sensitive p54-like docking sites play a dominant role in HIV-1 nuclear import. Because a small percentage of nuclei (≈10%) appears to be compromised, and we use a sensitive PCR assay as a detection method, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that the observed differences reflect binding of the PICs to sites which are not normally exposed on intact nuclear envelopes. Nevertheless, the observed interaction does not appear to be an artifact, because nuclei damaged by treatment with 1% Triton X-100 do not bind HIV-1 PICs (not shown). Recently, a hypothesis was proposed (34Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) suggesting that Vpr functionally resembles karyopherin β and may direct HIV-1 nuclear import via karyopherin β-independent mechanism. Although Vpr can bind to karyopherin α (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 34Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and to the FXFG repeats of nucleoporins (Fig. 3 A) and thus resembles karyopherin β, it does not appear to function as a replacement for karyopherin β during docking of the HIV-1 PICs, which is still dependent on karyopherin β (Fig. 3 B). This conclusion is consistent with our previous observation that antibodies to karyopherin β inhibit HIV-1 nuclear import (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and does not support the proposed hypothesis of Vodicka et al. (34Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It appears that PIC-bound Vpr complexed with karyopherin α cannot bind nucleoporins. This conclusion is not surprising given a small size of Vpr, and suggests that binding sites for nucleoporins and karyopherin α (or nucleoporins and p7Gag) overlap. A possible mechanism by which Vpr regulates docking was revealed in our experiments using the FXFG repeat region of the yeast nucleoporin Nup1p. Vpr prevented dissociation of the NLS-protein complex with karyopherin α/β upon addition of the FXFG repeat region (Fig. 4). Importantly, this effect was reproduced with two proteins carrying basic-type NLSs (similar to the SV-40 large T antigen NLS), HIV-1 MA protein and an artificial karyophile NLS-GST, indicating that Vpr targets the components of the import machinery, rather than the import cargo. One of the import factors affected by Vpr is karyopherin α. Although one report (36Gallay P. Stitt V. Mundy C. Oettinger M. Trono D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Vpr interacts with a karyopherin α-independent import pathway, our recent results demonstrated that Vpr binds specifically to karyopherin α and increases its affinity for the NLS (15Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.-A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Such an activity may well explain the stabilizing effect of Vpr on the complex between karyopherins α and β, NLS protein, and nucleoporins. Consistent with this hypothesis is the stimulatory effect of soluble Vpr on docking and nuclear import of an artificial karyophile, NLS-BSA, in digitonin-permeabilized cells. 2M. Moore and C. Lane, personal communication. Why does HIV-1 need Vpr, while other karyophiles are imported without it? As PICs are very large structures (about the size of a ribosomal subunit (28Bukrinsky M.I.

Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and may be targeted to the nucleus by the cooperative action of several dozen NLSs located on various HIV-1 PIC proteins (6Gallay P. Hope T. Chin D. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9825-9830Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar,37Gallay P. Swingler S. Song J. Bushman F. Trono D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it is likely that at any particular time during movement across the nuclear pore complex only a portion of these NLSs is docked to nucleoporins, while others are mobile. In that way, movement of the PIC through the nuclear pore may resemble the movement of a caterpillar. Vpr may ultimately function to maintain docking of the PIC, while the mobile parts are searching for “downstream” nucleoporins (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In summary, our experiments suggest that Vpr functions to stabilize karyopherin α/β-dependent docking of HIV-1 PICs to nucleoporins, thus promoting nuclear import of the viral genome.

Recently, PrPres has been shown to be capable of directly inducing the conversion of PrPsen to PrPres in a cell-free in vitro system. In the present experiments, various PrP peptides were studied for their ability to enhance or inhibit this cell-free conversion reaction. None of the synthetic peptides was able to confer protease-resistance to the labeled PrPsen molecules on their own. On the contrary, peptides from the central part of the hamster PrP sequence from 106 to 141 could completely inhibit the conversion induced by preformed PrPres. The presence of residues 119 and 120 from the highly hydrophobic sequence AGAAAAGA (position 113 to 120) was crucial for an efficient inhibitory effect. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that inhibitory peptides formed high β-sheet aggregates under the conditions of the conversion reaction, but this was also true of certain peptides that were not inhibitory. Thus, the potential to form β-sheeted aggregates may be necessary, but not sufficient, for peptides to act as inhibitors of PrPres formation. Clearly, the amino acid sequence of the peptide is also important for inhibition. The sequence specificity of the inhibition is consistent with the idea that residues in the vicinity of positions 106–141 of PrPres and/or PrPsen are critically involved in the intermolecular interactions that lead to PrPres formation.

TSE are characterized by the formation and accumulation of an abnormal proteinase K-resistant isoform (PrPres) of normal protease-sensitive host-encoded prion protein (PrPsen). PrPres is formed from PrPsen by a post-translational process involving conformational changes, a higher β-sheet content, and the formation of macromolecular aggregates (3Pan K.-M. Baldwin M.

PrPres is closely associated with TSE-mediated brain pathology, suggesting a crucial role of PrPres in the pathogenic process. However, in the absence of PrPsen expression in the brain tissue of recipients of scrapie-infected neurografts, no pathology outside the graft itself was observed, demonstrating that PrPres and PrPsen are both required for the pathology (6Brandner S.

Both cross-species transmission in vivo and efficient PrPres accumulation in vitro require a high degree of sequence homology between PrPres and PrPsen molecules. For example, in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells, point mutations at three positions, 108, 111, and 138, in the mouse PrP sequence are sufficient to completely block the formation of PrPres (7Priola S.A. Caughey B. Race R.E. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4873-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a cell-free in vitro system, PrPres induces the conversion of PrPsen to PrPres (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This interaction between PrPres and PrPsen occurs with species and strain specificities that mimic TSE species barrier effects and strain differences in vivo (10Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J.

Collectively, these in vivo and in vitroobservations strongly suggest that precise direct interactions between PrPres and PrPsen are critical in PrPres formation and TSE pathogenesis. In previous experiments, small synthetic peptides containing certain PrP sequences spontaneously aggregated to form fibrils with a high degree of β-sheet secondary structure (14Gasset M.

Moreover, other synthetic PrP peptides were shown to interact with PrPsen molecules, forming an aggregated complex with increased protease resistance (18Kaneko K. Peretz D. Pan K.-M. Blochberger T.C. Wille H. Gabizon R. Griffith O.H. Cohen F.E. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11160-11164Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,19Kaneko K. Wille H.

In the current study, peptides from a variety of locations in the hamster PrP sequence were studied for their ability to influence the generation of PrPres under cell-free conditions. A group of peptides from the central portion of the PrP molecule having high β-sheet content displayed a strong inhibitory effect on the cell-free conversion assay. Based on these results, we propose the existence of sites on the central part of the PrP molecule that allow a specific binding between PrPsen and PrPres as a first step in the conversion of PrPsen to PrPres. The following peptides were synthesized by the laboratory of molecular structure of NIAID, NIH, Rockville MD: hamster P106–128 (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGY), P109–141 (MKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPMMHF), P113–141 (AGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPMMHF), and P121–141 (VVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPMMHF). Peptides were >95% pure, and analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography revealed only a single peak. Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β protein fragment 1–40 (Aβ-(1–40)) was purchased from Sigma. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 2 mm, distributed into 20-μl aliquots, and stored at −20 °C. The radiolabeling and the purification of the 35S-PrPsen were performed as described previously by Raymond et al. (13Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, 90% confluent cells were cultured for 30 min at 37 °C in 1.5 ml of methionine/cysteine-deficient medium followed by a 90–120-min incubation with 1.4 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine/25-cm2 flask. Then the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl) and lysed in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The proteins were precipitated by the addition of 5 volumes of methanol, resuspended in detergent-lipid complexes, and immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-PrP 3F4 monoclonal antibody (20Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna deMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein A-Sepharose beads. Radiolabeled PrPsen was eluted from Sepharose beads using 0.1 m acetic acid and stored at 4 °C until use. The 35S-labeled hamster PrPsen used in this study was the glycophosphatidylinositol-negative form (35S-HaPrPsen) described previously (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). PrPres was purified from brains of scrapie-infected Syrian golden hamsters by detergent lysis and differential centrifugation (21Hope J. Morton L.J.D. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Hamsters were infected 70 days before with the hamster scrapie strain 263K. The yield of PrPres was determined by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal PrP antiserum (R27) raised against a synthetic hamster PrP peptide (residues 89–103) (22Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the preparations was estimated at 50–60% by silver-staining of SDS-PAGE gels. The hamster PrPres preparation (HaPrPres) was then diluted to 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% sulfobetaine 3–14 and stored at −20 °C. The cell-free conversion reaction was performed as described previously (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 13Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified PrPres was partially denatured with 2.5 mguanidine hydrochloride for 30–60 min at 37 °C. An aliquot of 200 ng of HaPrPres, typically 8 μl, was then incubated for 40 h at 37 °C with ~1 ng of immunopurified 35S-PrPsen (~12,000 cpm/reaction) in a final volume of 20 μl of conversion buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6, 5 mmcetylpyridinium chloride, 0.625% N-lauryl sarcosinate) in the presence or absence of peptides. At the end of the incubation time, each reaction was split 1:10, the major fraction was digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K (PK) in Tris-saline buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8, 130 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the minor part (−PK) was reserved as an undigested control. The PK reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of a mixture of 4 mg/ml thyroglobulin, 20 mm Pefabloc (Boehringer-Mannheim) to each fraction (+ and −PK). Samples were then precipitated in 5 volumes of methanol and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in sample buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 5% SDS, 4 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% bromphenol blue), boiled 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on NOVEX pre-cast gels. The percent of the conversion was calculated by the ratio between the PK-resistant35S-labeled bands of approximate molecular masses 28–30 kDa and the nondigested 35S-PrPsen as quantified by phosphor autoradiographic imager analysis. At the concentration used, none of the peptides affected the PK digestion of PrPres (data not shown). Immunopurified35S-HaPrPsen (12,000 cpm/reaction) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 200 ng of 2.5 m guanidine hydrochloride-pretreated HaPrPres in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of peptides P-(109–141), P-(113–141), P-(121–141), and Aβ-(1–40). At the end of the incubation time, the samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min at 14,000 ×g. The supernatants and the pellets were separately collected and methanol-precipitated before SDS-PAGE analysis and phosphor autoradiographic imager quantification. The dried peptides were rehydrated by mixing with conversion buffer and incubated for 4–60 h at room temperature before Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Samples (6 μl) were loaded into variable path-length cells with CaF2 plates adjusted to a path length of 6 μm. After purging the sample chamber to reduce the water vapor contribution, spectra were collected with a Perkin-Elmer system 2000 spectrometer. Spectral parameters were as follows: 254 scans; 4-cm−1 resolution; 1 cm/sec optical path difference velocity; Kaiser-Bessel apodization. Buffer spectra were subtracted from peptide spectra to give a flat base line in the 1800–2200-cm−1 region. A water vapor spectrum was then subtracted to minimize the water vapor bands in the 1750–1850-cm−1 region. Various PrP synthetic peptides, whose localization on the primary hamster PrP sequence is shown in Fig. 1 A, were tested for effects on the in vitro conversion of metabolically labeled PrPsen molecules into PrPres. The peptides were used in the cell-free conversion assay at a final concentration of 0.8 mm. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the non-PK-treated35S-HaPrPsen appeared as a double band with molecular masses of 30 and 28.5 kDa, corresponding to mono- or unglycosylated forms of the molecule, respectively. In the absence of HaPrPres, no PK-resistant bands were seen in the control experiment. In those conditions, none of the peptides was able by itself to promote the conversion of 35S-HaPrPsen to a PK-resistant form (Fig.1 B, lanesmarked −). In the presence of 200 ng of HaPrPres, two PK-resistant 35S-labeled bands were obtained with molecular masses of 24 and 20 kDa (Fig. 1 B,lanes marked +). However, two synthetic hamster peptides, P-(106–128) and P-(109–141), were able to inhibit the formation of35S-labeled PK-resistant PrP bands. A third peptide, P-(89–103), partially inhibited the conversion, and six other peptides, P-(23–37), P-(57–64), P-(57–72), P-(57–80), P-(139–170), and P-(218–232) failed to inhibit the conversion. The quantitative effect of peptide concentration on the cell-free conversion was examined further using the two most inhibitory hamster peptides (Fig. 2 A). The peptide concentrations required to inhibit 50% of the hamster PrP conversion reaction (IC50) were calculated to be 230 and 30 μm for the peptides P-(106–128) and P-(109–141), respectively (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, an unrelated amyloidogenic peptide, Alzheimer's Aβ-(1–40), was unable to inhibit the PrPsen to PrPres conversion at all concentrations tested (Figs. 2,A and B). These results clearly demonstrated that the conversion was specifically inhibited by peptides from the central portion of PrP molecule. The PrP synthetic peptide AGAAAAGA from position 113 to 120 has been described as the most highly amyloidogenic peptide in the protein (14Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Llyod D.H. Gabriel J-M. Holtzman D.M. Cohen F.E. Fletterick R. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10940-10944Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To assess the influence of the AGAAAAGA sequence contained in both P-(106–128) and P-(109–141), we synthesized two peptides differing only in this hydrophobic sequence, P-(113–141) and P-(121–141). The P-(113–141) peptide sequence efficiently inhibited the in vitroconversion with an IC50 value of 40 μm (Figs.3, A and B). In contrast, the P-(121–141) peptide failed to inhibit the conversion at all of the concentrations used (Figs. 3, A andB). When incubated with the labeled PrPsen in the absence of PrPres, none of these peptides conferred PK resistance to PrPsen molecules (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the hydrophobic sequence from 113 to 120 appeared to be essential to the inhibitory effect of peptides from this region of PrP. To find the minimal number of hydrophobic amino acid residues from the AGAAAAGA sequence required for inhibiting the conversion reaction, three partially deleted peptides were synthesized (P-(119–141), P-(117–141), and P-(115–141), Fig. 3 B). The presence of two of these hydrophobic residues was sufficient to allow the inhibition of the conversion because P-(119–141) was nearly as inhibitory as P-(113–141). However, the IC50 was decreased up to 3-fold as additional hydrophobic amino acid residues were added (Fig. 3 B). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to compare the conformations of the PrP and Aβ-(1–40) peptides to see if there was a correlation between inhibitory efficacy and conformation. For this purpose, peptides were incubated for 4–60 h in conversion buffer without any PrPsen or PrPres. Fourier transform infrared spectra of peptides incubated for 24 h at a concentration of 2 mm are shown in Fig. 4. Five of the peptides (P-(106–128), P-(109–141), P-(113–141), P-(121–141), and Aβ-(1–40)) showed prominent absorbance maxima at ~1630 cm−1 that were indicative of a high β-sheet content. For P-(109–141), this predominant absorbance at 1630 cm−1 was maintained down to concentrations of 0.2 mm. These same five peptides were at least partially insoluble as each formed a visible particulate suspension. Two other PrP peptides (P-(89–103) and P-(218–232)) maintained clear solutions and had absorbance maxima near 1667 cm−1, with no evidence of the β-sheet absorbance at ~1630 cm−1. Although all the inhibitory peptides showed evidence of a high β-sheet content, other peptides, such as P-(121–141) and Aβ-(1–40), showed a similar β-sheet content but gave no inhibition of conversion. Thus, the potential to form a high amount of β-sheet structure might be necessary, but not sufficient, for the specific inhibitory activity of any given peptide. Considering the propensity of hydrophobic PrP peptides to aggregate in vitro, we investigated whether the inhibition of the conversion could be explained by peptide-induced aggregation of 35S-HaPrPsen, which might prevent conversion of this precursor protein. For this purpose, conversion reaction mixtures were centrifuged in the presence or absence of various peptides, and pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed for 35S-HaPrPsen (Fig.5). Whereas 35S-HaPrPsen remained soluble in the absence of peptides, incubation with either inhibitory peptides (P-(109–141), P-(113–141)) or noninhibitory peptides (P-(121–141), Aβ-(1–40)) caused aggregation and pelleting of 35S-HaPrPsen. Thus, although peptide-induced aggregation of PrPsen occurred, this sedimentation was not sufficient for the inhibition of the conversion reaction. In the present report, we used PrP synthetic peptides to map portions of the molecule that may be involved in PrPres-PrPsen interactions. Peptides from the central part of PrP sequence, P-(106–128), P-(109–141), and P-(113–141), were very efficient in inhibiting the in vitro cell-free conversion (30 μm < IC50 < 230 μm). The inhibition of the cell-free conversion assay induced by such peptides suggests that specific interactions between PrPsen and PrPres may involve the central region of the molecule. Recently, Ho¨lscheret al. (23Ho¨lscher C. Delius H. Bürckle A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a mutant mouse PrP lacking the sequence from 114 to 121 (AGAAAAGA) is not converted into a proteinase K-resistant isoform after expression in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. In our current studies, the presence of the corresponding hamster sequence from 113 to 120 correlated with the inhibition of the conversion reaction. Indeed, all the peptides having this sequence such as P-(106–128), P-(109–1410, and P-(113–141) had an inhibitory effect, whereas P-(121–141) did not exhibit this property (Figs. 3, A and B). Interestingly, residues 119 and 120 appeared to be most critical to the inhibition as P-(119–141) was nearly as effective as P-(113–141) (Fig.3 B). Peptides from the amino-terminal region such as P-(23–37), P-(57–64), P-(57–72), and P-(57–80) and from the carboxyl-terminal region such as P-(139–170) and P-(218–232) did not inhibit the conversion reaction. Only P-(89–103) was able to slightly decrease the conversion when incubated at the high concentration of 0.8 mm (Fig. 1 B). P-(89–103) is contained in the PK-resistant core of PrPres, and its location is adjacent to the most inhibitory peptide sequences. These data suggested that, unlike the central portion of PrPres, the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal regions of the molecule are less involved in the intermolecular interactions resulting in PrPres formation. This explanation is consistent with the fact that the carboxyl- and amino-terminal portions of PrPres are more sensitive to the PK digestion than the central part (21Hope J. Morton L.J.D. Farquhar C.F. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Kimberlin R.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 24Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P. Kent S.B. Aebersold R.

In our experiments, the presence of PrP amino acid residues from 113 to 120 were required for maximal inhibition, but other amino acid residues are likely also to be involved in the specific intermolecular interaction. The adjacent sequence from residues 129 to 141 seemed to play an important modulatory role in the inhibition of conversion, since P-(106–128) was significantly less inhibitory compared with P-(109–141) (Figs. 2, A and B). This interpretation is consistent with a previous report showing that a point mutation at position 138 could block the accumulation of PrPres in the mouse neuroblastoma cell system (8Priola S.A. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that the region of residue 138 in the PrP polypeptide is important in the intermolecular interactions leading to PrPres formation. The mechanism of action of the inhibitory peptides is still unclear. Possibly the inhibitory peptides mimic the structure of PrPres and competitively bind to PrPsen molecules to block the conversion process. Alternatively, peptides could bind to PrPres itself, blocking further interaction with PrPsen. In the conversion reaction buffer, the peptides P-(106–128), P-(109–141), and P-(113–141) possessed a high β-sheet content reminiscent to brain-derived PrPres (3Pan K.-M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar, 4Safar J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Whether the active state of the inhibitory peptides is the soluble or aggregated form is not known. However, their mechanism of action cannot be explained merely by their tendency to form β-sheet structure and sedimentable aggregates with PrPsen, since noninhibitory peptides such as P-(121–141) and Aβ-(1–40) displayed the same biochemical properties. In our hands, none of the tested peptides were capable of conferring PK resistance to 35S-PrPsen (Fig. 1 B). Using slightly different conditions, other authors have shown that incubation of hamster PrPsen with hamster peptide P-(90–145) resulted in the formation of a PK-resistant, sedimentable PrPsen·peptide complex (18Kaneko K. Peretz D. Pan K.-M. Blochberger T.C. Wille H. Gabizon R. Griffith O.H. Cohen F.E. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 270: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon PK digestion, no shift of the molecular mass of this PrPsen·peptide complex was reported. Thus, this complex may be a large aggregate unaccessible to PK, in contrast to brain-derived PrPres and PrPres formed in our cell-free conversion experiments, which loses ~67 amino-terminal amino acid residues (6–7 kDa) with PK treatment. Studies using PrP may suggest new approaches for possible therapeutic intervention. The ability of PrP peptides to inhibit the accumulation of PrPres in vivo remains to be established. Nevertheless, PrP peptides dispensed by direct injection or delivered by gene therapy might provide specific therapeutic treatment for TSE diseases. Furthermore, structural analysis of the minimal peptide sequence required for inhibition of conversion might lead to development of nonpeptide compounds with therapeutic potential.

https://openalex.org/W1989052616,"Bax suppresses tumorigenesis in a mouse model system and Bax-deficient mice exhibit lymphoid hyperplasia suggesting that BAX functions as a tumour suppressor in human haemopoietic cells. We examined BAX expression in 20 cell lines derived from human haemopoietic malignancies and consistent with a potential tumour suppressor function, identified two cell lines, DG75 (a Burkitt lymphoma cell line) and Jurkat (a T-cell leukaemia line), which lacked detectable BAX expression. Apoptosis of DG75 cells induced by low serum or ionomycin was significantly delayed relative to similar Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with normal BAX levels. Although DG75 and Jurkat cells expressed several BAX RNA species including the prototypical BAX α RNA, the absence of BAX protein was due to single base deletions and additions in a polyguanine tract within the BAX open reading frame. These frameshift mutations result in premature termination of translation and have recently also been identified in some colon cancers with microsatellite instability. Although mismatch repair defects are not considered a common feature of haemopoietic malignancies, DG75 and Jurkat cells had widespread microsatellite instability and did not express detectable levels of MSH2. In Jurkat cells, lack of MSH2 expression was due to a point mutation in exon 13 of MSH2 resulting in premature termination of translation. Our results suggest that a pathway linking mismatch repair defects, BAX tumour suppressor frameshift mutations and resistance to apoptosis may be a key feature of some lymphomas and leukaemias."
https://openalex.org/W2090884982,"A linoleic acid (13R)-lipoxygenase was purified to homogeneity from the culture medium of Gäumannomyces graminis, the take-all fungus, by hydrophobic interaction, cation exchange, lectin affinity, and size-exclusion chromatography. The purified dioxygenase lacked light absorption between 300 and 700 nm. Gel filtration indicated an apparent molecular mass of ~135 kDa in 6 murea and ~160 kDa in buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) showed that the enzyme was heterogeneous in size and consisted of diffuse protein bands of 100–140 kDa. Treatment with glycosidases for N- and O-linked oligosaccharides yielded a distinct protein of ~73 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Atomic emission spectroscopy indicated 0.5–1.0 manganese atom/enzyme molecule. The isoelectric point was ~9.7, and the enzyme was active between pH 5 and 11 with optimum activity at pH 7.0. For molecular oxygen,K m was 30 μm andV max 10 μmol mg−1min−1; for linoleic acid,K m was 4.4 μmol, V max 8.2 μmol mg−1min−1, and the turnover number 1100 min−1. The enzyme oxidized linolenic acid twice as fast as linoleic acid. The main products were identified by mass spectrometry as 13-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acids, respectively. After reduction of the hydroperoxide, steric analysis of methyl 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoate by chiral high performance liquid chromatography yielded one enantiomer (>95%), which co-eluted with the R-stereoisomer of methyl (13R,13S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoate. Arachidonic and dihomogammalinolenic acids were not substrates, while oxygen consumption, UV analysis, and mass spectrometric analysis indicated that γ-linolenic acid was oxygenated both at C-11 and C-13. The enzyme was active at 60 °C and after treatment with 6 murea. It was strongly inhibited by 10–50 μmconcentrations of eicosatetraynoic acid and a lipoxygenase inhibitor (N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl)acetohydroxamic acid), but many other lipoxygenase inhibitors (100 μm) were without effect. We conclude that, after deglycosylation, the enzyme has the same size on SDS-PAGE as mammalian and marine lipoxygenases, but it differs from all previously described lipoxygenases in three ways. It is secreted, it forms (13R)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid, and it contains manganese. A linoleic acid (13R)-lipoxygenase was purified to homogeneity from the culture medium of Gäumannomyces graminis, the take-all fungus, by hydrophobic interaction, cation exchange, lectin affinity, and size-exclusion chromatography. The purified dioxygenase lacked light absorption between 300 and 700 nm. Gel filtration indicated an apparent molecular mass of ~135 kDa in 6 murea and ~160 kDa in buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) showed that the enzyme was heterogeneous in size and consisted of diffuse protein bands of 100–140 kDa. Treatment with glycosidases for N- and O-linked oligosaccharides yielded a distinct protein of ~73 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Atomic emission spectroscopy indicated 0.5–1.0 manganese atom/enzyme molecule. The isoelectric point was ~9.7, and the enzyme was active between pH 5 and 11 with optimum activity at pH 7.0. For molecular oxygen,K m was 30 μm andV max 10 μmol mg−1min−1; for linoleic acid,K m was 4.4 μmol, V max 8.2 μmol mg−1min−1, and the turnover number 1100 min−1. The enzyme oxidized linolenic acid twice as fast as linoleic acid. The main products were identified by mass spectrometry as 13-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic and 13-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acids, respectively. After reduction of the hydroperoxide, steric analysis of methyl 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoate by chiral high performance liquid chromatography yielded one enantiomer (>95%), which co-eluted with the R-stereoisomer of methyl (13R,13S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoate. Arachidonic and dihomogammalinolenic acids were not substrates, while oxygen consumption, UV analysis, and mass spectrometric analysis indicated that γ-linolenic acid was oxygenated both at C-11 and C-13. The enzyme was active at 60 °C and after treatment with 6 murea. It was strongly inhibited by 10–50 μmconcentrations of eicosatetraynoic acid and a lipoxygenase inhibitor (N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl)acetohydroxamic acid), but many other lipoxygenase inhibitors (100 μm) were without effect. We conclude that, after deglycosylation, the enzyme has the same size on SDS-PAGE as mammalian and marine lipoxygenases, but it differs from all previously described lipoxygenases in three ways. It is secreted, it forms (13R)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid, and it contains manganese. Lipoxygenases are non-heme dioxygenases of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Their substrates contain a (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene system, which is oxidized to a (1S)-hydroperoxy-(2E,4Z)-pentadiene by lipoxygenases of plants and mammals and to a (1R)-hydroperoxy-(2E,4Z)-pentadiene by lipoxygenases of marine invertebrate (1Yamamoto S.

About 40 lipoxygenases have been cloned and sequenced from plants and mammals (2Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 67-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Funk C.D.

Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Lipoxygenases have also been described in a few fungi, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Schecter G. Grossman S. Int. J. Biochem. 1983; 15: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) andSaprolegnia parasitica (7Hamberg M. Herman C.A. Herman R.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Herman R.P. Hamberg M. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but none of them has been cloned and sequenced. The catalytic center of lipoxygenases contains iron, which according to analysis of crystal structures and sequence information is bound to three conserved histidine residues, a C-terminal isoleucine, water, and a variable sixth ligand (9Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 10Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B.

Proteins. 1997; 29: 15-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The sixth ligand of plant enzymes is an asparagine residue, while mammalian enzymes have a histidine, asparagine, or serine at this position (12Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Nanney L.B. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24410-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The arachidonate (8R)-lipoxygenase of P. homomalla has conserved these histidine and asparagine residues but differs fromS-lipoxygenases in its C-terminal amino acid, which is a threonine residue (3Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The difference between S- andR-lipoxygenases might therefore be due to substrate binding and control of oxygenation rather than fundamental differences in metal ligands at the active site. A recent comparison of the crystal structures of soybean lipoxygenase-1 and a reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase shows that the three-dimensional structure has been remarkably well conserved between these S-lipoxygenases (13Browner M. Gillmor S. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Keystone Conference on Lipid Mediators, January 26–31, 1997, Keystone, CO. 1997; (abstr.): 9Google Scholar). Mammalian lipoxygenases metabolize arachidonic acid as their most important physiological substrate, while plant lipoxygenases oxygenate linoleic and linolenic acids (1Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 2Funk C.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 67-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Rosahl S. Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These fatty acid hydroperoxy metabolites can be further converted to a number of products with a diverse range of biological actions, e.g. to leukotrienes in animals and the growth regulatory hormone jasmonic acid in plants (4Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,5Shibata D. Axelrod B. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Many investigators believe that plant lipoxygenases may contribute to the chemical defense of plants against pathogens (14Rosahl S. Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Melan M.A. Dong X. Endara M.E. Davis K.R. Ausubel F.M. Peterman T.K. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For example, lipoxygenases might be involved in the resistance of rice to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, oats toPuccinia coronata avena, and tomato to Cladosporium fulvum (16Peng Y.-L. Shirano Y. Ohta H. Hibino T. Tanaka K. Shibata D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3755-3761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yamamoto H. Tani T. J.

The possibility that fungal pathogens can secret a lipoxygenase has not been explored. The fungus Gäumannomyces graminis can cause a severe root disease (“take-all”) in wheat, barley, and rye (19Abelson P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mycelia of G. graminis contain only negligible lipoxygenase activity but can metabolize oleic and linoleic acids by a hemoprotein with dioxygenase and with hydroperoxide isomerase activities (20Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14112-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This enzyme (diol synthase) metabolizes linoleate sequentially to 8-HPODE 1The abbreviations used are: 8-HPODE, (8R)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ConA, concanavalin A; ETYA, eicosatetraynoic acid; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; (13S)-H(P)ODE, (13S)-hydro(pero)xy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid; (11S)-H(P)ODE, (11S)-hydro(pero)xy-(9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid; (13R)-H(P)ODE, (13R)-hydro(pero)xy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid; 11-H(P)OTrE(n-6), 11-hydro(pero)xy-(6Z,9Z,12Z)-octadecatrienoic acid; 13-H(P)OTrE(n-3), 13-hydro(pero)xy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid; 13-H(P)OTrE(n-6), 13-hydro(pero)xy-(6Z,9Z,11E)-octadecatrienoic acid; KPB, potassium phosphate buffer; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TLC, thin layer chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; SP-HPLC, straight phase high performance liquid chromatography; BW 4AC,N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl)acetohydroxamic acid; Mn-LO, manganese lipoxygenase. and (7S,8S)-dihydroxyoctadeca-(9Z,12Z)-dienoic acid (21Brodowsky I.D.

Biophys. 1994; 309: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mycelia of G. graminis also contain NADPH-dependent monooxygenases, which oxygenate polyunsaturated fatty acids at the ω2 and ω3 carbons toR-hydroxy fatty acids (23Sih C.J. Ambrus G. Foss P. Lai C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 3685-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17845-17853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brodowsky I.D. Oliw E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We now report that filtrate of the culture medium of G. graminis contains a linoleate dioxygenase, which appears to be secreted by the fungus in large quantities. The secretion of a dioxygenase by an important pathogen has not been reported previously. The goal of the present report was to purify and to characterize this enzyme. The dioxygenase was found to have several unprecedented features. First, it showed R stereospecificity in a typical lipoxygenase reaction with polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids as substrates. The main metabolites of linoleic and linolenic acids were cis-trans-conjugated (13R)-hydroperoxy fatty acid derivatives (13-HPODE and 13-HPOTrE(n-3), respectively). Second, the dioxygenase was found to contain manganese. Third, the enzyme catalyzed hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and biosynthesis of an intermediate hydroperoxide in a different way than all previously described lipoxygenases with either S or Rstereospecificity. Based on these observations, the new enzyme is designated manganese lipoxygenase (Mn-LO). The unique oxygenation mechanism is described in detail in the accompanying paper (26Hamberg M. Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13080-13088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Different strains of G. graminis(var.graminis, var.tritici, var.avenae) were obtained from Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (Baarn, The Netherlands). Two isolates of G. graminisvar.tritici, one from Sweden and one from the United Kingdom (UK), were generous gifts of Dr. Hans-Erik Nilsson (Agricultural University, Ultuna, Sweden). [1-14C]18:1n-9 (55 Ci/mol), [1-14C]18:2n-6 (55 Ci/mol), and [1-14C]20:4n-6 (55 Ci/mol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, and 22:6n-3 were from Sigma, 18:3n-3 was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and 18:3n-6 and 20:3n-6 were from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). Precoated TLC plates (0.25-mm Silica Gel 60A, 5 × 10 cm) were from Merck. SepPak/C18 cartridges were from Waters (Milford, MA). Media and columns for chromatography were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) or Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Equipment for HPLC was as described (20Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14112-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Oliw E.H. Ho¨rnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Equipment and reagents for SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing were from Bio-Rad. Buffers were prepared with water from Milli-Q plus 185 (Waters). High molecular mass protein standards for SDS-PAGE were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; standards for gel filtration were from Bio-Rad. Endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (50 milliunits/μl) andO-glycosidase (bovine serum albumin-free, 1 milliunit/μl) were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Chelex 100, CHAPS, GSH, esculetin, and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside were from Sigma. Tween 20 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. BW 4AC (N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl)acetohydroxamic acid) was from Wellcome Research Laboratories (Beckenham, UK), ICI 230487 from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (Macclesfield, UK), zileuton from Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL), and ETYA from Hoffman-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). Racemic 13-HODE was prepared by autoxidation, and (13S)-HPODE, (13S)-HPOTrE(n-6), and (13S)-HPOTrE(n-3) were prepared enzymatically (lipoxidase type IV, Sigma) as described (27Oliw E.H. Ho¨rnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was monitored by UV analysis, oxygen consumption or TLC analys. For UV analysis, the enzyme was added to microcuvette containing 0.24 mm linoleic acid (in 0.15 ml of buffer A: 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 0.04% Tween 20) at room temperature. The absorbance at 235 nm was followed, and the rate was estimated from a linear part of the curve. Other fatty acids were incubated in the same way. Kinetic constants were determined at 25 °C in triplicate from five concentrations of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. Soybean lipoxygenase (Sigma) was used as a reference enzyme. Oxygen consumption was monitored at 25 °C in buffer A with 0.13 mm substrates added in ethanol. Kinetic constants were estimated from triplicate analysis of five different concentrations of oxygen. For analysis by TLC, enzyme was mixed with 85 μl of buffer A and incubated, in a total volume of 100 μl, with 1 nmol of [14C]18:2n-6 (10 μm). After termination with ethanol and extractive isolation on SepPak/C18, the products were separated by TLC (toluene/dioxane/formic acid/acetic acid, 81/14/1/1) and the plates were scanned for radioactivity (Berthold Dünnschicht scanner model II, Kebo, Stockholm). The effect of lipoxygenase inhibitors on the enzyme was studied with TLC or with UV analysis. The fungus was cultivated in 2 liters of culture medium (containing (per liter): 20 g ofd-glucose and 5 g each of yeast extract (Merck), peptone from soy meal (Merck), K2HPO4, and NaCl (pH ~ 7.7)) in a 5-liter Erlenmayer flask under normal atmosphere with gentle shaking (125 rpm) for 7 days at 22 °C. The broth was then filtered through a nylon net to remove the mycelia (typically 50 g of mycelia (wet weight)/liter). The following steps were performed at 4 °C. The medium was adjusted to 0.55m ammonium sulfate, 2 mm NaN3 (pH 7.2) (NaOH), carefully mixed, and then filtered (0.45 μm, type HA, Millipore). The filtrate was loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (2.6 × 20 cm) in 0.05 m KPB (pH 7.2) with 0.6m ammonium sulfate at 5 ml/min. The column was then washed with two to three column volumes of the same buffer. The column was then eluted with 0.01 m KPB (pH 6.8), 0.5 mmGSH, 2 mm NaN3, 0.04% Tween 20, which yielded enzyme fraction I. Additional enzyme (fraction II) could be eluted with 5 mm KPB (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm GSH. Fractions I and II were initially purified separately, but they were found to contain the same enzyme as judged from the isoelectric points, chromatography on Superdex 200 HR 10/30, and SDS-PAGE before and after deglycosylation. Fractions I and II were therefore combined. After dialysis, the material was further purified by cation exchange chromatography (CM Sepharose CL-4B, 1.8 × 3 cm) in 0.01 mm KPB (pH 6.8) with 2 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm GSH, and 0.04% Tween 20. The column was then eluted in one step with 0.2 mNaCl in the same buffer. The material was then purified either by affinity chromatography on ConA-Sepharose (2.8 ml) or, after change of buffer (PD10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), by Mono S HR 5/5. The Mono S column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.1 mNaCl in 0.01 m KPB (pH 6.9), 2 mmNaN3, 0.5 mm GSH, 0.04% Tween 20 in 20 min, then washed with 0.2 m NaCl in this buffer. The ConA-Sepharose column was equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.3), 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm GSH, 0.04% Tween 20, the sample was loaded and the column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was strongly bound to ConA-Sepharose, but it could be eluted with 0.5 mmethyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in 10 mm KFB (pH 6.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm GSH, 0.04% Tween 20. The final step of purification was gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR 10/30) in 0.1 m KPB (pH 7.3), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm GSH, 1 mmEDTA, 3 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm CHAPS or in 6 m urea, 0.05 m KFB (pH 7.3), 1 mmGSH. Small fractions (0.2 ml) were collected over the peak on gel filtration and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Material from the final gel filtration was referred to as purified enzyme, and it was used throughout this and the accompanying paper (26Hamberg M. Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13080-13088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Aliquots (0.6 μg) of purified enzyme were heated to 90 °C for 4 min and then treated with either 5 milliunits of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (50 milliunits/μl) or 1 milliunit of O-glycosidase (1 milliunit/μl), or both enzymes overnight at 37 °C (in 0.05 m KPB (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 4 mm NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS). The protein was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme was not retained on Mono P HR 5/5 in 0.025 m diethylamine-HCl (pH 9.5). Isoelectric focusing was performed in a preparative cell (Rotofor, Bio-Rad) with 1% Bio-Lyte 3/10 (Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 12 watts (4 °C, 3 h) with purified enzyme from fraction I (20 μg) and fraction II (12 μg). The fractions from the Rotofor were assayed for enzyme activity and protein content and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Metabolites were extracted with SepPak/C18 (Waters) or with ethyl acetate without acidification. RP-HPLC and SP-HPLC were performed as described (28Ho¨rnsten L. Bylund J. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Chiral HPLC was performed with Chiralcel OB-H (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan), which was eluted with 1.5% isopropanol in hexane at 0.5 ml/min. The pump for HPLC was from Thermo Separation Products (SpectraSYSTEM P2000) equipped with a degasser (Uniflow Dagasys DG-1310, Tokyo, Japan). The column contained octadecasilane silica (5 μm, 250 × 2 mm or 150 × 2 mm; Kromasil 5 C18 100A, Phenomenex) and a guard column (Opti-Gard, 1 mm C18; Optimize Technologies). The RP-HPLC column was eluted with methanol/water/acetic acid, 80/20/0.01, at 0.2 ml/min. The effluent first passed a UV detector (Kratos Spectroflow 757) equipped with an integrator (Merck Hitatchi D-2500) and then into an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA), where it was subject to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The vaporizer temperature was 450 °C, the capillary temperature was 150 °C, and the collision energy was set to 25–35%. Negative ions were monitored, and prostaglandin F1α was used for tuning. In a few experiments, electrospray ionization was used. Hydroperoxides were reduced with SnCl2 or with NaBH4. Methyl esters were prepared with diazomethane. Hydrogenation was performed with Pd/C in ethanol for 2 min with a gentle flow of hydrogen. Trimethylsilyl ethers were prepared by treatment with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and pyridine and methyl esters with diazomethane (27Oliw E.H. Ho¨rnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis with electron impact ionization was performed as described (27Oliw E.H. Ho¨rnsten L. Sprecher H. Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C-values were determined by the retention times of fatty acid methyl esters (18:0, 20:0, 22:0, and 24:0). Light absorption spectroscopy was performed with a dual beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2101PC), which was equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder. Microcuvettes (0.15 ml) were used routinely. The cis-trans-conjugated hydro(pero)xy fatty acids were assumed to have a molar extinction coefficient of 23,000 (29Ingram C.D. Brash A.R. Lipids. 1988; 23: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined as described by Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using bovine albumin as a standard. For atomic emission spectroscopy, plastic tubes, pipette tips, and tubings were washed overnight with 15% HNO3 and rinsed with metal-free water. Purified enzyme (1 mg) in 0.5 ml of buffer (0.05m KPB, 3 mm NaN3) was slowly passed through a column (16 × 10 mm, Chelex 100, 50–100 dry mesh) before analysis. The instrument, an inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectrometry (Spectroflame P), was used for quantitative and qualitative determination of the transition and other elements in the sample. The samples were diluted 1:5 with pure water and introduced at 1 ml/min, and the plasma power was 1200 watts. Iron was also determined with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. A Clark-type oxygen electrode (probe 5331 with a high sensitivity membrane and oxygen monitor 5300, YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) was used to measure oxygen consumption during enzyme catalysis in a thermostated oxygen cell (cell volume 1.5 ml, Gilson; 25 °C). The cell was first filled with air-saturated buffer of 25 °C and the substrate (in ethanol) was then added. After stabilization (1–2 min), the reaction was started by injection of a few microliters of the enzyme. Nitrogen was used to obtain different concentrations of oxygen in the cell. Enzyme activity was estimated from the initial rate of oxygen uptake, assuming an initial concentration of 0.24 mm oxygen. SDS-PAGE was performed with 7.5% resolving and 3.0% stacking gels (with MiniProtean II, Bio-Rad) using the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Runs were carried out at 100 V for 10 min, then at 200 V for 35 min. Proteins were detected by silver staining as described (20Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol.

Two protocols were used, which differed only in cation exchange chromatography (Mono S HR 5/5) or affinity chromatography (ConA-Sepharose). The latter method was more convenient. The enzyme was purified 188–286-fold to an apparent specific activity of 8.1–8.4 μmol−1 min−1mg−1 with linoleic acid as a substrate (Table I).Table IPurification of linoleate Mn-LO from culture medium of G. graminisPurification stepTotal proteinSpecific activityRecoverymgμmol mg−1min−1%-foldScheme A Filtrate of 2 liters of culture4880.0431001 Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B2700.075962 CM Sepharose CL-6B15.61.057824 Mono S HR 5/53.473.696186 Superdex 200 HR 10/300.868.0733188Scheme B Filtrate of 2 liters of culture6850.0291001 Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B3260.053872 CM Sepharose CL-6B21.10.717524 ConA-Sepharose11.91.166940 Superdex 200 HR 10/300.898.3937286 Open table in a new tab The enzyme was purified in four main steps. It was first “captured” by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Fig.1 A). It could only be partly eluted by a decrease in salt concentration, which yielded fraction I. A second fraction with enzyme activity eluted with 6 m urea (fraction II). Fractions I and II were initially purified separately by both protocols, but found to give the same protein after deglycosylation (see below). The two fractions were therefore combined and purified by open column cation exchange chromatography (CM Sepharose CL-6B). The enzyme eluted with 0.2 m NaCl and was then purified by affinity chromatography (ConA-Sepharose) or by cation exchange HPLC (Mono S HR 5/5). The enzyme eluted mainly in a broad peak from this HPLC cation exchange column (Fig. 1 B). The enzyme was finally purified by gel filtration. Gel filtration of native enzyme in buffer with 0.15 m NaCl and 0.5 mm CHAPS indicated a molecular mass of ~160 kDa (Fig.1 C). Eleven fractions (0.2 ml) were collected over this peak and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Each fraction contained a diffuse protein band, which appeared to decrease in mean size from about 140 to 100 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Gel filtration was also performed in 6 m urea in 0.05m KPB. This yielded a mass of 135 kDa (data not shown), which is within the 100–140-kDa range obtained by SDS-PAGE. Each fraction of the purified enzyme from gel filtration showed a single, broad band on SDS-PAGE with silver staining. The material from gel filtration was clearly heterogeneous in size, but appeared free from other contaminating proteins. These results suggested that the enzyme could be glycosylated. This was confirmed by enzymatic deglycosylations with endoglycosidases for bothN- and O-linked oligosaccharides. SDS-PAGE now showed a distinct protein of ~73 kDa (Fig. 2 B). As discussed above, the hydrophobic interaction chromatography yielded two enzyme fractions (Fig. 1 A). After purification and deglycosylations, fractions I and II yielded the same protein band of ~73 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C). The purified enzyme was colorless and lacked significant light absorption between 300 and 700 nm (Fig.3), which suggested that the enzyme lacked heme. However, concentrated solutions (1 mg/ml) had a pale yellow color. Atomic emission spectroscopy indicated that the enzyme sample contained, in quantities above 25 ng/ml, only Na, K, S, P, and Mn (see Fig. 3, inset). Mg, Ni, Fe (Fig. 3, inset) and Cu could not be detected. For K, Na, and P, the concentration was the same as in the buffer. The Mn concentration was 2 μm, the S concentration 0.15 mm, and the protein concentration 0.3 mg/ml. This corresponds to ~2.2 μm apoprotein at a mass of 135 kDa (native sugar protein) and to ~4.1 μm at a mass of 73 kDa (deglycosylated protein). In the former case, the data thus suggest ~1 Mn per apoprotein and in the latter case ~0.5 Mn per apoprotein. However, iron could be detected with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy in a concentration of, at most, 0.31 μm. We conclude that the enzyme likely contains ≥0.5 manganese atom/enzyme molecule and only small amounts of iron (<0.15 iron atom/enzyme molecule). Enzyme activity was first tested i"

Previous experiments have proposed that the extracellular domain is responsible for ligand binding. However, it is currently unknown whether the extracellular ligand binding site can bind ligands without other domains of the receptor. We began by obtaining a sufficient amount of receptor protein on a baculovirus expression system. In addition to the transfer vector that encodes the entire coding region, transfer vectors that encode portions of the extracellular domain were designed. Here, we report a soluble metabotropic glutamate receptor that encodes only the extracellular domain and retains a ligand binding characteristic similar to that of the full-length receptor. The soluble receptor secreted into culture medium showed a dimerized form. Furthermore, we have succeeded in purifying it to homogeneity. Dose-response curves of agonists for the purified soluble receptor were examined. The effective concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of quisqualate for the soluble receptor was 3.8 × 10−8m, which was comparable to that for the full-length receptor. The rank order of inhibition of the agonists was quisqualate ≫ ibotenate ≥l-glutamate ≈ (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid. These data demonstrate that a ligand binding event in metabotropic glutamate receptors can be dissociated from the membrane domain.

Glutamate receptors are divided into two distinct classes: ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) 1The abbreviations used are: iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ACPD, 1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MAb, monoclonal antibody; AcNPV,Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus; Sf9 cells, Spodoptera frugiperda cells; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ACPD, 1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MAb, monoclonal antibody; AcNPV,Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus; Sf9 cells, Spodoptera frugiperda cells; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (1Nakanishi S.

Non-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors are further subdivided into two groups: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and kainate receptors. iGluRs are ligand-gated ion channels that transduce glutamate binding into cation influx. mGluRs that have been discovered most recently comprise eight subtypes, which are divided into three groups according to agonist selectivity, coupling to different effector systems, and sequence homology (3Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 4Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S.

Group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8) are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase activity. Functional analyses of these mGluRs are now avidly being performed. The evidence is accumulating that mGluRs modulate excitatory synaptic transmission (7Hayashi Y. Momiyama A. Takahashi T. Ohishi H. Ogawa-Meguro R. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1993; 366: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) through various neural transduction pathways, such as regulation of neurotransmitter release (8Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sanchez-Prieto J. Nature. 1992; 360: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), influences on ion channel activity (9Ikeda S.R. Lovinger D.M. McCool B.A. Lewis D.L.

Nature. 1993; 363: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). mGluRs have a remarkably large extracellular domain that has no homology with the other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) except Ca2+-sensing receptors (11Brown E.M.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) have proposed that the ligand binding site resides mainly in the extracellular domain. Thus, the mode of ligand binding of mGluRs is different from that of other GPCRs for small molecule transmitters, such as adrenaline and acetylcholine. Thus, it is a subject of great interest how extracellular signals are transmitted into cells and what roles other parts of the receptor protein perform in mGluRs. Recently, various data of mGluRs on the brain function have been obtained, and the more specific and stronger antagonists and agonists have been urgently requested both in neurobiology and clinical fields (6Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar, 14Watkins J.C. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Honoré T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). For designing the antagonists, the information on the three-dimensional structure of the receptor protein is very valuable. In order to determine a tertiary structure, a sufficient amount of pure receptor protein is needed. However, at present, it is extremely difficult to solubilize the receptor protein from membrane preparations. Therefore, we tried to produce a ligand binding region in a soluble form. If a ligand binding region can be produced independently of the membrane domain, it will be also a good tool for understanding activation mechanism of this intriguing receptor. In an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor, one of glutamate-gated ion channels, Kuusinen et al. (15Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have shown that an agonist binding site can be reconstituted by making a fusion protein of two discontinuous segments: one is proximal to the first transmembrane segment, and the other is located between the third and fourth transmembrane segments. In the current study, we have expressed a mGluR subtype 1α (described as mGluR1 from now on) in insect cells on a baculovirus system. We have isolated an extracellular ligand binding region that has a biochemical characteristic comparable to that of the full-length receptor. Purification and characterization of the soluble mGluR are presented. This is the first demonstration among GPCRs for small molecule transmitters that a ligand binding region is produced in a soluble form.

(St. Louis, MO).l-Glutamic acid was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Ibotenic acid was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9 cells) were propagated in a monolayer at 27 °C in TNM-FH (Grace's powder medium, 0.4% yeastolate, 0.4% lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 0.1% pluronic F-68 from Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Science, Santa Ana, CA) or in suspension at 27 °C in IPL-41 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.3% tryptose phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.). 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml amphotericin B were used. Trichoplusia ni BTI-TN-5B1–4 (High Five cells) were cultured in a monolayer at 27 °C in Express Five serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 18 mml-glutamine. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells permanently expressing mGluR1 (16Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) were cultured in a monolayer at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Nissui) lacking l-glutamine, ribonucleosides, and deoxyribonucleosides and supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1% l-proline, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were used. A SacII fragment that contains the full coding region of mGluR1 was excised from pmGR1 (3Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) and was ligated intoSacII-digested pBluscriptII SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A NotI-XbaI fragment of the intermediate construct was ligated into XbaI-NotI-digested pVL1392 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) to generate pmGluR102. pmGluR104 was made as follows. pmGR1 was used as a template of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a sequence (nucleotides 3276–3597) according to the numbering of the sequence by Masuet al. (3Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Primer TO3 (5′-CCAGGAGGAGTCCATC-3′) and primer TO4 (5′-CAGTGCTCTAGATCACTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCAGGGTGGAAGAGCTTTGC-3′) were used. TO4 contains six consecutive histidine codons and anXbaI site. A 310-base pair ClaI-XbaI fragment of the PCR product was ligated with a 3.3-kilobase pairNotI-ClaI fragment of pmGR1 and a 9.6-kilobase pair XbaI-NotI-digested pVL1392 vector. pmGluR103 was made as follows. PCR was done using pmGR1 as a template to amplify a sequence (nucleotides 1239–1506) with primers TO1 (5′-CATCAATGCCATCTATGCCATGGC-3′) and TO2 (5′-CAGTGCTCTAGATCACTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTCATGCCAGGTCCCCACG-3′). Six histidine codons and an XbaI site were included in TO2. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI and was cloned into the XbaI-NcoI-digested fragment of pmGluR102. pmGluR107 was made as follows. PCR was done with primers GN327361U (5′-AGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGGACCGCGTCTTCGCCACAAT-3′) and G394419FL (5′-TTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGGCAAAATGGACATCTCCAAAAA-3′) using pmGluR104 as a template. Another PCR was performed with primers GF421442U (5′GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAAGGATGCCTGACAGAAAAGTATTG-3′) and G700730EL (5′-TCTGATGAATTCGATGCTCTGTTCGAGAGCCAC-3′). The PCR products were mixed, and a second PCR was performed with primers GN327361U and G700730EL. The PCR product was cut byNotI and EcoRI and ligated intoNotI-EcoRI-digested pmGluR104. The resultant plasmid contains the sequence corresponding to DYKDDDDK after Pro20. pmGluR108 was constructed from pmGluR104. A fragment (nucleotides 1687–1776) was made with primers HJ104 (5′-AGAGCCTGTGACCTGGGGTGGTGG-3′) and MO101 (5′-TCTAGATTACTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCTAGCTTCTATGTCACTCCACTCAAGATA-3′). Another fragment (nucleotides 1783–1911) was made with primers MO102 (5′-GCTAGCCATCACCATCACCATCACTAGTAATCTAGAATAGCCATCGCCTTTTCTTGCCTG-3′) and HJ107 (5′-ACCAGCCAGAATGATATAGCAGAG-3′). A second PCR was done with primers HJ104 and HJ107, and its product was digested withSacI and ligated into SacI-linearized pmGluR104. The resultant plasmid contains Ala-Ser-His6 termination codons after Glu592. All of the above PCR products were entirely sequenced. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding full-length and truncated cDNAs were produced in Sf9 cells with the transfer vectors. Briefly, Sf9 cells (1 × 105) were transfected with 0.1 μg of BaculoGold linear DNA (PharMingen) and 1.0 μg of each plasmid using a liposome transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The viruses were harvested after 6 days. For the expression assay, 2.5 × 106 Sf9 or High Five cells were infected with each baculovirus. 72 h after infection, cells were harvested, and membranes were prepared as below. In the case of the cells infected with baculoviruses for mGluR103, mGluR107, and mGluR108, culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min and filtered. Membranes were solubilized on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1.0% Chaps) containing protease inhibitor mixtures (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, and trypsin inhibitor), and were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Aliquots of the supernatants and medium were analyzed by immunoblotting. The plaque-purified recombinant viruses containing the full-length cDNAs for mGluR were used to infect Sf9 cells (1 × 109) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. The purified recombinant viruses containing truncated cDNAs for mGluR, mGluR103, mGluR107, and mGluR108 were used to infect High Five cells (1 × 108-2 × 108). Cells were harvested at approximately 72 h post infection. Culture medium was prepared as described above for smaller cultures. Membranes were prepared as described below. Membranes were obtained by nitrogen cavitation. Briefly, CHO cells or Sf9 cells were suspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixtures), placed in a pressure chamber (Parr bomb) and pressurized to 800 p.s.i. with nitrogen gas for 30 min on ice. The mixture was collected by pressure release and centrifuged at 800 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet down the membranes. The membranes were divided into aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Cell membranes and culture medium were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was then blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated overnight at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mGluR1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) mG1Na-1 and a 1:5000 dilution of polyclonal antibody A52 in TBST. After being washed, the membrane was incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG or a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Color development was done by a commercial detection kit (Promega). A MAb mG1Na-1 was made by Dr. Akio Neki as follows. The spleen cells from Balb/c mice immunized with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused mGluR1 peptide (amino acid residues 104–154) were fused with X63-Ag8.653 cells as described (17Neki A. Ohishi H. Kaneko T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 202: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The character of MAb mG1Na-1 was verified using CHO cells, which produce mGluR1, in comparison with polyclonal antibodies G18 and A12 (18Shigemoto R. Abe T. Nomura S. Nakanishi S. Hirano T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1245-1255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody A52 was raised against an mGluR1α C-terminal peptide (amino acid residues 859–1199) (19Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). About 2 liters of supernatant of hybridoma mG1Na-1 cells was concentrated to 30 ml using XM50 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After addition of 150 ml of PBSSC (8 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.3, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 136.9 mm NaCl, and 3.6 mm KCl) and concentration again to 45 ml, the concentrate was applied onto a HiTrap protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound material was eluted with 0.1 mglycine-HCl, pH 2.7. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBSSC at 4 °C. MAb mG1Na-1 (11.2 mg) was coupled with 1 ml of HiTrap NHS-activated column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Buffer L (200 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3, and 500 mm NaCl) at 4 °C overnight. The column was washed several times alternately with Buffer W1 (0.5 m ethanolamine, pH 8.3, and 500 mm NaCl) and Buffer W2 (100 mm acetate, pH 4.0, and 500 mm NaCl). After neutralization with 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, the supernatant of High Five cells prepared below was loaded. Membrane fractions (20–100 μg) of baculoviruses-infected cells were incubated with [3H]quisqualate (20 nm) in a total volume of 200 μl of Buffer B (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was aspirated onto GF/C filter (Millipore Corp.). After being washed with Buffer B, the filters were briefly dried and counted by the scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mml-glutamate. For soluble mGluRs secreted into culture medium, a new binding assay was established using nickel conjugated beads as described below. The concentrated medium (100–200 μl) or purified soluble receptor mGluR108 (1 μg) was mixed with Ni2+-NTA conjugated beads (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) at 4 °C for 15 h. After several washings with Buffer B, [3H]quisqualate was added with and without ligands. After being shaken for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was washed with Buffer B several times and filtered through GF/C filters. The remaining radioactivity was counted. Because aspirates through GF/C filters did not show any significant signal by immunoblotting, the entrapment of His-tagged receptor protein by Ni2+-beads seemed to be complete. A conditioned medium of soluble mGluR1-producing High Five cells was concentrated to 10–50-fold by XM50. After being dialyzed against Buffer C (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl), the dialyzate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min and loaded onto an immunoaffinity column, which was conjugated with MAb mG1Na-1 as described above. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer C, and the bound material was eluted with 500 mm NaCl containing 500 mm sodium thiocyanate and 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the eluate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Positively stained fractions were pooled and analyzed by ligand binding assay. Then the pooled fraction was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol, and the dialyzate was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters 626 LC). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 2.5 ml each were collected. Fig. 1 shows a schematic drawing of the transfer vectors used in the baculovirus infection experiments. pmGluR102 and pmGluR104 encode the membrane-bound forms of mGluR1. pmGluR103, pmGluR107, and pmGluR108 are designed to produce the truncated forms of mGluR1, which are expected to be secreted into the culture medium. Recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of full-length mGluR1 were prepared and used to infect Sf9 insect cells in monolayer cultures. Immunoblotting analysis of expressed mGluR1 is shown in Fig.2 A. Both the polyclonal antibody A52, which was raised against a C-terminal peptide of mGluR1, and the MAb mG1Na-1 yielded a 155-kDa band in the membrane preparation from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant viruses but not in the control membrane preparation from Sf9 cells infected with wild-type virus, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV). mGluR1 expressed in CHO cells showed a more slowly migrating band. This size difference may reflect less extensive glycosylation in the insect cells. A ligand binding assay was performed using membrane fractions of Sf9 cells infected with their respective recombinant viruses. 3H-Labeled quisqualate specifically bound the membranes, and the binding was displaced by unlabeled glutamate (Fig. 2 B). The control membranes prepared in parallel from wild-type virus (AcNPV)-infected cells did not show any specific binding. Both levels of expression of the receptor protein and the ligand binding ability seemed not to show a significant difference between the cells infected with recombinant viruses for mGluR102 and for mGluR104. The inhibition of [3H]quisqualate binding with several agonists was examined as shown in Fig. 2 C. The effective concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of quisqualate was 3.0 × 10−8m, which is comparable to the effective concentration for half-maximal response (EC50) in inducing the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in CHO cells permanently expressing mGluR1 (16Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The rank order of inhibition was quisqualate ≫ l-glutamate ≈ ibotenate ≥ (1S,3R)-ACPD. Ohashi et al. (20Ohashi H. Higashi-Matsumoto H. Maruyama T. Takeuchi Y. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 2023Google Scholar) have obtained comparable data using the membrane fractions of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus for the human full-length mGluR1. They reported that 3H-labeled quisqualate binds the receptor in a saturable manner, with aK d value of 5.26 × 10−8m. Their IC50 value, 2 × 10−8m, of quisqualate for the human full-length mGluR1 agrees with ours. Next, we tried to dissect the ligand binding region of mGluR1. We infected High Five cells with recombinant viruses for mGluR103, mGluR107, and mGluR108, which were expected to produce the extracellular portions of mGluR1. Fig. 3shows the Western blotting analyses of culture medium of cells infected with the recombinant baculoviruses. mGluR103 and mGluR107 produced a 66-kDa band, and mGluR108 produced a 74-kDa band under the reducing conditions. The level of expression of mGluR108 was much higher than those of mGluR103 and mGluR107. Under the nonreducing conditions, both bands shifted to the bands of approximately twice the size of the bands observed under the reducing conditions, suggesting a dimer formation. A minor faster migrating band observed in mGluR108 under the nonreducing conditions seemed to be a monomer. The 74-kDa band under the reducing conditions looked broad and may reflect heterogeneities of the glycosylation pattern. mGluR107, which differs from mGluR103 only in the flag tag sequence added to the N-terminal end, did not show any obvious band under the nonreducing conditions. Although the cause of the anomalous electrophoresis of the mGluR107 protein was not clear, it suggested an aggregated or an unfolded protein formation, which may be brought about by the disruption of the tertiary structure due to the peptide tag. To study ligand binding properties of soluble receptors, we developed a new binding assay using Ni2+-conjugated beads, which can trap the histidine tag added to the soluble mGluRs. Concentrated culture medium (100–200 μl) was incubated with Ni2+-conjugated beads. Although mGluR103 and mGluR107 showed no appreciable binding, mGluR108 did reveal a significant binding ability. This binding was inhibited in the presence of 1 mml-glutamate. Neither concentrated control culture medium nor separately prepared His-tagged soluble receptor (soluble low density lipoprotein receptor; data not shown) showed any significant binding. We examined the agonist selectivity of mGluR108 as shown in Fig. 4. Inhibition of labeled quisqualate binding by several agonists was analyzed. The rank order of inhibition was quisqualate ≫ l-glutamate ≈ (1S,3R)-ACPD ≈ ibotenate. (2S,1′R,2′R,3′R)-2-(2,3-Dicarboxycyclopropyl)-glycine and (1S,3S)-ACPD inhibited the quisqualate binding by 37 and 56% at 1 × 10−4m, respectively; however, l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate, which is a group III-specific agonist, hardly inhibited it (data not shown). The iGluR agonists N-methyl-d-aspartate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, and kainate did not show any significant inhibition at 1 × 10−4m (data not shown). These binding characteristics clearly indicate that the expressed soluble receptor, mGluR108, is capable of binding ligands in the same manner as the native group I mGluR. Because newer ligands have recently been used in physiological and pharmacological experiments on mGluRs, we examined their reactivities with the soluble mGluR108. Fig.5 A shows the dose-response curves of the newer ligands. (S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine, which is a group I-specific agonist (21Ito I. Kohda A. Tanabe S. Hirose E. Hayashi M. Mitsunaga S.

A random yeast two-hybrid screen of a lymphocyte cDNA library (using caspase-3 as the bait) found an interaction between caspase-3 and the regulatory subunit Aα of protein phosphatase 2A. This protein was found to be a substrate for caspase-3, but not caspase-1, and could compete effectively against either a protein or synthetic peptide substrate.In Jurkat cells induced to undergo apoptosis with anti-Fas antibody, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity increased 4.5-fold after 6 h. By 12 h, the regulatory Aα subunit could no longer be detected in cell lysates. There was no change in the amount of the catalytic subunit. The effects on PP2A could be prevented by the caspase family inhibitors acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) aldehyde or Ac-DEVD fluoromethyl ketone. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway is regulated by PP2A. At 12 h after the addition of anti-Fas antibody, a decrease in the amount of the phosphorylated forms of MAP kinase was observed. Again, this loss of activated MAP kinase could be prevented by the addition of DEVD-cho or DEVD-fmk. These data are consistent with a pathway whereby induction of apoptosis activates caspase-3. This enzyme then cleaves the regulatory Aα subunit of PP2A, increasing its activity. These data show that the activated PP2A will then effect a change in the phosphorylation state of the cell.

A role for the caspase family in apoptosis was discovered when a gene of Caenorhabditis elegans was shown to be required for apoptosis during development in this organism. Additionally, this gene was found to have a protein sequence that was homologous to caspase-1. When either ced-3 or the cDNA for caspase-1 was injected into rat-1 fibroblasts, the cells underwent programmed cell death (1Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). This finding opened the field of caspase biology to more than just the processing of pre-interleukin-1β. Since then, many more members of the caspase family have been cloned, and their essential roles in apoptosis are beginning to be elucidated. Several mechanisms by which the caspases elicit their effect in apoptosis can be postulated. These mechanisms include proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of key substrates involved in maintenance of DNA, the cell cycle, or structural elements.After caspase-1, caspase-3 is the most extensively studied of all the caspase family members and may be one of the more downstream apoptotic effector molecules (2Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20977-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). One theory to summarize the role of caspase-3 in apoptosis revolves around the premise that this enzyme can cleave key enzymes involved in DNA repair. These enzymes include poly-(ADP)ribose polymerase and DNA-dependent protein kinase. This cleavage then renders these repair enzymes inactive (3Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The role of these substrates in apoptosis remains unclear. It may be necessary for each caspase family member, with their different substrate specificities, to cleave many essential substrates in a cooperative fashion for cell death to occur. However, it is apparent that caspase-3 plays an essential role in apoptosis since caspase-3 knock-out mice have a problem with apoptosis and development in the brain (15Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Like caspase-1, other family members may have nonapoptotic roles in the cell as well.Although the available evidence suggests that the caspase-1 homologs play a major role in apoptosis, they are not the sole stimulators of death. Fraser et al. (16Fraser A. McCarthy N. Evan G.I. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) concluded that almost everything, including oncoproteins, tumor suppressor proteins, cytokines, and signaling proteins, seems to both induce and suppress apoptosis. However, little is known about how all of these pathways are connected. Protein phosphorylation provides the cell with a basis for the control of growth, metabolism, differentiation, and possibly programmed cell death. The phosphorylation state of cells relies on a very complex but carefully orchestrated set of kinases and phosphatases. The phosphatases are broadly classified into two groups, those preferring phosphorylated tyrosine and those preferring phosphorylated serine or threonine. The serine/threonine phosphatases are grouped into classes based on their substrates and sensitivity to inhibitors. The functions of these protein phosphatases in the cell are extensive. It has been reported that the Ser/Thr phosphatases play roles in metabolism, meiosis, mitosis, and the cell cycle (17Mumby M.C. Walter G. Phys. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these phosphatases also play a role in apoptosis (18Gjertsen B.T. Doskeland S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Song and Lavin (19Song Q. Lavin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2, calyculin A and okadaic acid, could inhibit apoptosis in the irradiated Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BM13674. Recently, Morana et al. (20Morana S.J. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that regulation of protein phosphatase 1 activity is essential in regulating apoptosis via activation of a caspase-1/CED-3 protease, intracellular acidification, and DNA digestion. With regard to the caspase-phosphatase interaction, they demonstrated that incubation of ML-1 cells with 1 μm okadaic acid inhibited DNA fragmentation and caspase-induced cleavage of PARP in cells treated with etoposide. Thus, a plausible link between cell cycle stimulators of death and the caspases may be found in signaling pathways via the serine/threonine phosphatases.Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the most abundant serine/threonine-specific phosphatase in mammals, plays a role in many fundamental cellular processes, including cell division, signal transduction, gene expression, and development. PP2A consists of three subunits, the catalytic C subunit and the 65-kDa regulatory A subunit, which together form the core enzyme, and the regulatory B subunit, which binds to the core enzyme yielding the holoenzyme. The A and C subunits both exist as two isoforms (α and β) and the B subunit as multiple isoforms, which are subdivided into three families, B, B′, and B"", unrelated to each other by primary sequence. The A subunit polypeptide consists of 15 nonidentical repeats that form a rod-shaped molecule. The B subunit binds to repeats 1–10 and the C subunit to repeats 11–15 of the A subunit. Binding of the C subunit to the A subunit occurs in the absence of the B subunit, whereas binding of the B subunit requires the presence of both the A and C subunit for stability (17Mumby M.C. Walter G. Phys. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The purpose of the studies reported here was to demonstrate an interaction between caspase-3 and the Ser/Thr phosphatases.The yeast two-hybrid system (21Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) has been used to find unknown protein ligands that bind with known receptors. The data presented here will demonstrate that the yeast two-hybrid system can also be used to detect an interaction between an enzyme and a substrate and thus was used to find a new putative substrate for caspase-3. This interaction provides a link between the cell cycle, metabolic control, and the tumor necrosis factor/FAS-derived death pathways.DISCUSSIONThese studies were stimulated by the desire to know and understand more about the biology and the natural substrates for several of the members of the caspase family. There have been many reports of substrates for caspase-3, with the most common one being PARP. The evidence supporting this, however, is indirect. During programmed cell death, the cell undergoes changes in morphology as well as metabolism. What has not been elucidated to date is the link between the caspase family and the signal transduction process that could lead to the changes observed in the cell during apoptosis. Since there is a delicate balance in the cell between life and death, it seems possible that any protein with a role in cell proliferation might also, if stimulated or destroyed, play a role in apoptosis.A recent report by Martins et al. (47Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Frigon Jr., N. Tatar E. Tung J.S. Bryant K. Takahashi A. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. McCormich D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) indicates that caspase-3 may be found in the nucleus of the cell during apoptosis. This translocation to the nucleus may be the method by which PARP is cleaved. However, the cleavage of this DNA repair enzyme may not be sufficient to cause the morphological and metabolic changes that the cell undergoes during apoptosis. Indeed, mice that have had the PARP gene deleted appear to develop normally, unlike the mice where caspase-3 has been deleted (9Wang Z.-Q. Auer B. Sting L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Ghayur et al. (48Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y.Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) reported that caspase-3 cleaved protein kinase C-δ, which resulted in up-regulation of its activity. Overexpression of the active catalytic kinase fragment in cells is associated with chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, induction of sub-G1 phase DNA, and lethality. These pieces of information would indicate that caspase-3 may interact in a pathway that is more central to cellular metabolism. In order to answer the question of what additional cellular substrates caspase-3 might interact with directly, a random yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with caspase-3 acting as the bait.Until now, substrates of caspase-3 have been identified mostly by indirect evidence indicating that they are cleaved during apoptosis (49Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The best characterized interaction is that between PARP and caspase-3, detailed in recent publications by Margolin et al. (31Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and Nicholson et al. (6Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar). DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit has also been demonstrated to be cleaved by caspase-3 in the cell (8Song Q.Z. Leesmiller S.P. Kumar S. Zhang N. Chan D.W. Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 50Han Z. Malik N. Carter T. Reeves W.H. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25035-25040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Additional putative substrates are comprehensively reviewed in a recent article by Schwartz and Milligan (51Schwartz L.M. Milligan C.E. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system, however, is a random selection method that should be able to directly find proteins that interact with caspases.When caspase-3 was used as the bait in several random screens, an interaction between this protease and the regulatory subunit Aα of protein phosphatase 2A was found. Upon examination of the amino acid sequence for this protein, the recognition sequence for a caspase-3 cleavage site (DXXD) was found (DEQD specifically). This sequence is similar to the cleavage sequence found in PARP (DEVD) and many of the other putative caspase-3 substrates. This sequence is also comparable to the optimal cleavage sequence suggested by the work of Talanian et al. (36Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Upon analysis of all entries in the Entrez protein data base for the PP2A 65-kDa regulatory subunit Aα, the DXXD cleavage site is conserved in frog and pig as well as in rabbit and human.The data presented in this report demonstrate that PP2A is a substrate for caspase-3. PP2A will compete with either small synthetic substrates (like Ac-DEVD-pNA) or protein substrates (like PARP) for caspase-3. Additionally, caspase-3 was shown to cleave the PP2A regulatory A subunit (Fig. 1). This cleavage resulted in approximately a 40% increase in phosphatase activity in vitro after 20 min. The PP2A core and holoenzymes are similarly abundant in cells but differ in substrate specificity (27Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme is more active than the core enzyme toward substrates phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, and the core enzyme is more active against these substrates than the free C subunit. Thus, with the cyclin-dependent kinase substrates, the A and B subunits have a stimulatory effect on the C subunit. On the other hand, the core enzyme is equally or more active than the holoenzyme toward most other substrates, indicating that the B subunit (Bα being the most frequently studied) is inhibitory (52Agostinis P.R. Derua S.S. Goris J. Merlevede W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua J. Goris J. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 54Ferrigno P. Langan T.A. Cohen P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 55Kamibayashi C.

Acta. 1991; 1094: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). With respect to core enzyme and free catalytic subunit, the situation is also complex. Depending on the substrate size, type of substrate, and reaction conditions, the A subunit either inhibits or stimulates the catalytic subunit (57Turowski P. Favre B. Campbell K.S. Lamb N.J.C. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Since the various forms of PP2A differ so markedly in substrate specificity, it is important to discuss how accessible the core and holoenzymes are to cleavage by caspase-3. According to the previous model of PP2A (58Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Ruediger R. Roeckel D. Fait J. Bergqvist A. Magnusson G. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the B subunit binding region on the A subunit includes the caspase-3 recognition sequence DEQD in repeat 6 of the A subunit. This was suggested by the finding that mutation of this sequence destroyed binding of the B subunit to the A subunit, whereas binding of the C subunit was intact (58Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we would predict that in holoenzyme, the A subunit is protected by the B subunit from cleavage by caspase-3, whereas in core enzyme it can be cleaved. This explains the observation that cleavage of the holoenzyme, but not of free A subunit, by caspase-3 required preincubation, resulting in dissociation of the B subunit from the holoenzyme and generation of core enzyme. The finding that the A subunit completely disappeared from cells after induction of apoptosis, whereas C subunit was stable, suggests that holoenzyme was slowly converted to core enzyme and that all core enzyme was cleaved by caspase-3. It may not be surprising that the generation of a high amount of free C subunit, which normally does not exist in cells, has dramatic effects on cell growth, signal transduction, and apoptosis.In order to answer the question of relevancy in the cell, we examined the activity of phosphatases during anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. The ability of several caspase family inhibitors to block apoptosis was correlated with their ability to block the increase in PP2A activity. These data show that by 6 h of anti-Fas treatment, cells had reduced ability to metabolize AlamarBlue and PP2A activity had increased 4.5-fold when compared with untreated control cells. In fact, after 6 h, cells treated with only inhibitor demonstrated a significant increase in their ability to metabolize the dye. This suggests that these cells may have a basal amount of apoptosis which is inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitors. The fact that this increase in phosphatase activity is completely inhibited by both DEVD-fmk and DEVD-cho suggests the involvement of caspase family members in this up-regulation of PP2A activity. In this cell model, PP1 activity was not up-regulated by either anti-Fas or inhibitor.These data partially agree with the data of Morana et al.(20Morana S.J. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), demonstrating that several inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases, including okadaic acid, will also completely inhibit etoposide-induced apoptosis. However, they concluded that a decrease in phosphorylation of a PP1 substrate, Rb protein, during apoptosis was not due to up-regulation of PP1 activity. They did not observe an increase in PP2A activity either. In addition they did observe a decrease in the level of PP1 protein during apoptosis without subsequent loss of PP1 activity. It is possible that the one time point at which they examined phosphatase activity was insufficient, since this is likely a temporal response and relies on the model system being tested. In fact, in the studies reported here, by 24 h after anti-Fas administration, the PP2A activity was not significantly elevated compared with control. Song and Lavin (19Song Q. Lavin M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A (calyculin A and okadaic acid) will prevent apoptosis in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. The authors concluded that there was a role for up-regulation of phosphatase activity in apoptosis. Wolf et al. (60Wolf C.M. Reynolds J.E. Morana S.J. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported a correlation between Rb dephosphorylation as an index of phosphatase activity and apoptosis. In that report, PARP cleavage, intracellular acidification, and DNA digestion, all indicators of apoptosis, were inhibited by the caspase family inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fmk. However, Rb dephosphorylation was not prevented by this same inhibitor. This observation suggested that the phosphatases play a role upstream of the caspases. However, since VAD-fmk is not a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, this does not rule out the ability of caspase-3 to affect directly or indirectly Rb protein and thus lie upstream of the phosphatases. Although many reports have suggested the connection between phosphatases and caspase family members, no direct link has been identified. Therefore, the interaction between caspase-3 and PP2A is significant.Analysis of cell lysates by antibodies directed to the PP2A regulatory A subunit demonstrated the loss of this subunit after 12 h. In inhibitor-treated cells, there was no loss of this protein subunit. At the same time, there was no decrease in the amount of the catalytic subunit. These data strongly indicate that the up-regulation of PP2A activity is due to removal of the regulatory A subunit. Cleavage and subsequent proteolytic degradation is one explanation for these data. However, due to the lack of visualization of a cleavage fragment, other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. It also suggests that the catalytic subunit is stable in cells in the absence of the regulatory A subunit.If the effect on PP2A activity observed has biological relevance, a corresponding change should be seen in the phosphorylation state of a PP2A substrate. The caspase-3 inhibitable decrease in the phosphorylation state of only the activated MAP kinase satisfies this requirement. In a recent report by Cardone et al. (61Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Fritch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that caspases were required to activate apoptosis via the JNK pathway, by cleavage and activation of MEKK-1. These data, in combination with the data reported here, provide convincing support for the involvement of caspases in the regulation of cell signaling events. Caspases appear to work in concert to turn on the stress-activated and turn off the growth factor-activated cell signaling pathways.Involvement of PP2A in apoptosis would directly link two lines of evidence suggesting that both regulation of the cell cycle and the caspase family play a role in apoptosis. This would also suggest an upstream role in the induction of cell death. Recently, Dou et al. (62Dou Q.P. An B. Will P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9019-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have reported that induction of a protein serine/threonine phosphatase is responsible for the anti-cancer drug-induced Rb hypophosphorylation and consequent G1arrest and apoptosis in two p53-null human leukemic cell lines, HL60 and U937. Cells unable to hypophosphorylate Rb protein were resistant to drug-induced cell death. In a subsequent paper, An and Dou (63An B. Dou Q.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 438-442PubMed Google Scholar) reported that hypophosphorylated Rb protein is cleaved during DNA damage-induced apoptosis by a caspase-3-like protease. These data strongly suggest a relationship between the caspase-3-like subfamily members and protein phosphatases at both the level of dephosphorylation and cleavage of dephosphorylated substrates. It is intriguing to note that many of the caspase-3 substrates have cleavage sites containing a serine either in or near the P1′ position of the cleavage sequence. These substrates include the regulatory subunit of PP2A, (DEQDS), Rb protein (DSIDS and DEADGS), protein kinase Cδ (DMQDNS), and GDP dissociation inhibitor protein (DELDS).The interaction between PP2A and caspase-3 may provide a partial explanation for the phenotype of the caspase-3 knock-out mouse, since the proportion of PP2A in brain tissue is much higher in the developing brain than in the adult brain (64Begum N. Robinson L.J. Draznin B. Heidenreich K.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus the interaction between caspase-3 and PP2A may be more important in developing brains than in other tissues.In summary, this is one of the first reports of direct evidence for a caspase-3 substrate. These data support a model where caspase-3 may als"

Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and laminin also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2. These responses were markedly reduced in cells overexpressing the Csk kinase or in cells that lack focal adhesion kinase or the Src family kinases Src or Fyn. However, unlike Src, focal adhesion kinase did not catalyze phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 in vitro. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive SHP-2 markedly inhibited activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in response to fibronectin stimulation without affecting the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase or its interaction with the docking protein Grb2. Overexpression of wild-type SHPS-1 did not enhance fibronectin-induced activation of MAP kinase. These results indicate that the binding of integrins to the extracellular matrix induces tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2, and that such phosphorylation of SHPS-1 requires both focal adhesion kinase and an Src family kinase. In addition to its role in receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated MAP kinase activation, SHP-2 may play an important role, partly through its interaction with SHPS-1, in the activation of MAP kinase in response to the engagement of integrins by the extracellular matrix.

Activation of integrins induces cell cycle progression (4Bohmer R.M. Scharf E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), enhances growth factor-mediated cell proliferation and DNA synthesis (5Vuori K. Ruoslahti E.

These responses are thought to be mediated by integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar) that may couple the integrin signal to activation of Ras and MAP kinase. Fak has been suggested to mediate integrin-induced activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling cascade (7Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 8Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Fak is a non-receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase that colocalizes with integrins at focal contacts and is autophosphorylated in response to cell adhesion to the ECM (9Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 10Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 258-262Google Scholar). The integrin-induced autophosphorylation of Fak results in its interaction with the SH2 domain of Src kinase (7Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 11Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), after which Src may catalyze the tyrosine phosphorylation of both the kinase domain and the COOH-terminal Tyr925 residue of Fak (7Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 8Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr925 of Fak creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2, which constitutively binds to the guanine nucleotide exchange protein SOS (12Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar) and may link integrin engagement to the activation of the Ras-MAP kinase cascade (7Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 8Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, the existence of an additional pathway for integrin-induced activation of MAP kinase that is independent of Fak or Grb2 binding to Fak has recently been suggested (13Lin T.H. Aplin A.E.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In contrast to the apparent participation of protein tyrosine kinases in integrin activation of Ras and MAP kinase, it remains unknown whether a PTPase also is important in this process. SHP-2 is a non-transmembrane PTPase that contains two SH2 domains (15Adachi M. Fischer E.H. Ihle J. Imai K. Jirik F. Neel B. Pawson T. Shen S.H. Thomas M. Ullrich A. Zhao Z.

A dominant negative mutant of SHP-2 inhibited insulin- or EGF-stimulated activation of Ras and MAP kinase, DNA synthesis, or cell proliferation (18Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M.

Furthermore, microinjection of RNA encoding a dominant negative SHP-2 into Xenopus oocytes resulted in severe posterior truncation and inhibited FGF- and activin-mediated mesoderm induction (24Tang T.L.

Corkscrew, a putative Drosophilahomolog of SHP-2, is thought to be required for Ras1 activation or to function in conjunction with Ras1 during signaling by the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (25Allard J.D. Chang H.C. Herbst R. McNeill H. Simon M.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Perkins L.A. Larsen I. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 70: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Most recently, disruption of the mouse Shp-2 gene was shown to result in failure of normal gastrulation and subsequent death in the early stages of embryogenesis, as well as in a marked impairment in FGF-induced MAP kinase activation (27Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.-S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus, SHP-2 may play a crucial role in intracellular signaling elicited by various growth factors and hormones, probably by contributing to activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. SHP-2 binds directly to growth factor receptors, including the platelet-derived growth factor, EGF receptor, c-KIT, and the erythropoietin receptor, in response to receptor stimulation with the corresponding ligand and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation (28Feng G.S.

Furthermore, although SHP-2 does not interact directly with the insulin receptor, it binds through its SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins such as IRS1, IRS2, and GAB1 in response to insulin (34Holgado-Madruga M.D. Emlet R.

These docking proteins possess multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites that serve as binding sites for the SH2 domains of various signaling molecules, but they lack any catalytic activity. Thus, in response to ligand stimulation of various receptors, SHP-2 appears to be recruited either to the receptors themselves or to receptor docking proteins. We have recently identified a membrane glycoprotein, SHPS-1 (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Various mitogens, including serum, insulin, lysophosphatidic acid, and EGF, induce tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its subsequent association with SHP-2 in cultured cells (38Fujioka Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to IRS and GAB1 proteins, SHPS-1 also may recruit SHP-2 from the cytosol to a site near the plasma membrane in response to growth factor stimulation. We have also detected both tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2 in unstimulated, serum-deprived cells, possibly reflecting the effects of cell adhesion (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which cell adhesion induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and the physiological roles of the interaction of SHPS-1 with SHP-2 in cell adhesion-triggered signal transduction remain unclear. We have now shown that the binding of integrins to ECM components such as fibronectin and laminin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its subsequent association with SHP-2. This cell adhesion-induced phosphorylation of SHPS-1 appears to require both Fak and an Src family kinase. Furthermore, the formation of the SHPS-1·SHP-2 complex may contribute to MAP kinase activation in response to fibronectin stimulation. Rat-1 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. CHO cells that overexpress human insulin receptors (CHO-IR cells) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Before transfection experiments, COS-7 cells were also cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Rat-1 cells that overexpress a catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant were generated as described (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, a point mutation that changed Cys459 to Ser was introduced into human SHP-2 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant cDNA was cloned into theEcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pSRα. Rat-1 cells (~3 × 105 per 6-cm dish) were transfected with both 10 μg of pSRα containing mutant SHP-2 cDNA and 1 μg of pHyg, which contains the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene, with the use of 18 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured in DMEM containing hygromycin B (400 μg/ml) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 10% FBS, and colonies were isolated 14–21 days after transfection. Several cell lines expressing the mutant SHP-2 protein were identified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with polyclonal antibodies to SHP-2 as described below. Generation of Rat-1 cells that overexpress rat wild-type SHPS-1 was also performed by transfection with pSRα containing wild-type SHPS-1 cDNA (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of pHyg as described above. Cell lines expressing the recombinant SHPS-1 protein were identified by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1. CHO-IR cells that overexpress wild-type Csk (Csk-WT) or a kinase-negative Csk (Csk-K/R) were generated by transfection with pSRα containing rat wild-type Csk cDNA or a mutant Csk cDNA that contained a point mutation that changed Lys222 to Arg (kindly provided by M. Okada), as described above. Src family kinase-deficient (Src −,Fyn −) cells were isolated from the corresponding “knock-out” mouse embryos and immortalized with simian virus 40 large T antigen as described previously (43Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Fak-deficient mouse cells (Fak −) were established by introduction of a p53mutation into Fak-deficient mouse embryos as described (44Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). All knock-out mouse cells and the corresponding wild-type cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Semi-confluent wild-type andSrc −, Fyn −, orFak − cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pSRα containing the wild-type rat SHPS-1 cDNA with the use of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection and lysed as described below for immunoprecipitation with mAb 2F34 to rat SHPS-1. To generate a mAb specific to rat SHPS-1, we partially purified SHPS-1 from 100 10-cm plates of confluent SR-3Y1 cells as described previously (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The resulting SHPS-1 preparation was injected three times into the hind foot pads of two BALB/c mice at 1-week intervals, after which lymphocytes were isolated from the draining lymph nodes and fused with P3U1 myeloma cells as described (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Antibodies in culture supernatants of the resulting hybridomas were screened on the basis of their ability to immunoprecipitate SHPS-1 from the membrane fraction of SR-3Y1 cells, as detected by immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20). Positive hybridomas were rescreened by the same procedure. Among several positive clones, clone 2F34 was selected, and mAb 2F34 was subsequently purified from ascites fluid of mice with a MAPS II kit (Bio-Rad). The 2F34 mAb reacts well with rat SHPS-1 but poorly with the corresponding protein from hamster or mouse. The detailed properties of this mAb will be described elsewhere. In contrast to mAb 2F34, mAb 4C6, which we prepared previously (42Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), reacts well with CHO cell SHPS-1 but poorly with the corresponding protein of rat or mouse. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1 (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) or to SHP-2 (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) were generated with GST fusion proteins containing the COOH-terminal region of either rat SHPS-1 or human SHP-2 as antigen, as described previously. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (α91) to both p44 and p42 MAP kinase were prepared with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 307–327 of rat MAP kinase. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MAP kinase, α92, were prepared against synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 350–367 of rat MAP kinase. Antibodies that react specifically with the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of MAP kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs. HRP-conjugated mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine, polyclonal antibodies to Fak, and polyclonal antibodies to Csk were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The 12CA5 mAb to the HA epitope tag was purified from the ascites of mice injected with 12CA5 hybridoma cells. The mAb to paxillin and the mAb to Grb2 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories; the mAb to v-Src (Ab-1) was from Oncogene Science; and the mAb to Fak was from Upstate Biotechnology. Before all experiments, cells were incubated for 12 h with DMEM in the absence of serum. Cells were detached by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice with serum-free DMEM. They were then suspended in DMEM, replated on polystyrene dishes (~2.5 × 107 per 10-cm dish) coated with fibronectin or other ECM proteins (Falcon), and incubated at 37 °C for various times in serum-free DMEM. In some experiments, cytochalasin D (Sigma) was added 10 min before replating of the cells. The attached cells were then lysed on ice in 0.5 to 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 140 mmNaCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmsodium vanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Total cell protein in lysates was standardized with the use of a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) before immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of cell lysates for 4 h at 4 °C with various antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (2 μg of antibody per 20 μl of beads) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of WG buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis, with PY20 or other antibodies and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed as described previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 45Matozaki T. Uchida T. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein (GST-SHPS-1-cyto) containing the cytoplasmic portion of SHPS-1 (amino acids 373–481) was generated and purified as described previously (38Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Src kinase was immunoprecipitated from Rat-1 cell lysates with a mAb to v-Src as described above. The immune complex was washed twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP) and incubated with GST-SHPS-1-cyto (~1 μg) for 30 min at 24 °C in kinase assay buffer (50 μl) in the absence or presence of [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 mCi/ml, 6000 Ci/mmol) (ICN). For examination of the phosphorylation of SHPS-1 by Fak, COS-7 cells (in 10-cm dishes) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the pRC CMV expression vector containing cDNA that encoded HA epitope-tagged mouse Fak (kindly provided by S. K. Hanks) (46Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the use of 18 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 48 h, the transfected cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb 12CA5. The precipitates were then subjected to the phosphorylation reaction with GST-SHPS-1-cyto or poly(Glu, Tyr) (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) as described above. After each phosphorylation reaction, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were mixed with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The immunoprecipitated Src kinase and HA-tagged Fak were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the corresponding protein tyrosine kinase to determine the amount of each protein in the immune complex, or to autoradiography for determination of autophosphorylation. MAP kinase activation was monitored by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with antibodies to p44 and p42 MAP kinase (New England BioLabs) that recognize the enzymes only when they are activated by phosphorylation of Tyr204. MAP kinase activation was also monitored by using the direct in vitro kinase assay as described previously (21Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, after attached or suspension, cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 nm okadaic acid (Wako Chemicals), and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with α92 anti-MAP kinase antibodies that had been bound to protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and suspended in 35 μl of assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), and 0.5 mm EGTA and myelin basic protein (1 μlg/ml)(Sigma) as substrate). After incubation for 15 min at 20 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of stop solution, containing 0.6% HCl, 1 mm ATP, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Portions (30 μl) of reaction mixtures were spotted on P-81 paper (Whatman), which was then washed three times with 0.5% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counter. The effects of cell adhesion on tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its interaction with SHP-2 were investigated by detaching serum-deprived Rat-1 cells and then replating them on fibronectin-coated dishes. After incubation for 0–120 min, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb 2F34 to rat SHPS-1 followed by immunoblot analysis with either mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine or antibodies to SHP-2. Cell detachment resulted in the loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2 normally apparent in adherent cells (Fig.1). After replating of the cells onto fibronectin-coated dishes, both the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2 were evident within 15 min, as the cells started to spread, and were maximal at 60–120 min. Similar time courses of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2 were also observed when CHO-IR cells were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes (data not shown). Serum-deprived Rat-1 cells were also detached and either maintained in suspension or replated on dishes coated with various ECM components and kept for 60 min (Fig. 2 A). Replating of cells onto dishes coated with fibronectin or laminin markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2, compared with replating cells onto uncoated dishes. Furthermore, replating cells onto dishes coated with poly-l-lysine, a nonspecific substrate, or with collagen type I did not substantially increase tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 relative to that apparent in cells replated onto uncoated dishes. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 in cells replated onto dishes coated with collagen type IV was slightly greater than that apparent in cells replated onto uncoated dishes. Because fibronectin and laminin are specific ligands for integrins (47Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the engagement of integrins by components of the ECM may induce tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2. Pretreatment of Rat-1 cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin polymerization, inhibited fibronectin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and its association with SHP-2 (Fig.2 B), suggesting that these effects of fibronectin require normal cytoskeletal organization. The binding of integrins to ECM prot"

The levels of the major ubiquitinated histone forms, mono- and poly-ubiquitinated H2A, were highest in the pachytene spermatocyte stage, declined thereafter through the round spermatid stage, and reached their lowest levels in elongating spermatids. Three additional ubiquitinated histone species, besides H2A, were detected using anti-ubiquitin antibodies specifically in the fraction enriched in elongating spermatids. Based on their electrophoretic mobilities, they corresponded to uH3, uTH3, and uH2B. Polyubiquitinated forms of these proteins were also observed. The identity of these proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-H3 antisera and by differential extraction of the proteins from the nucleus with increasing salt concentrations. This is the first report of ubiquitination of H3in vivo. We speculate that its ubiquitination could loosen the nucleosome structure in preparation for histone removal, be a consequence of nucleosome relaxation or disruption caused by other means, or target H3 for degradation.

During spermiogenesis, which is the part of spermatogenesis involving the development of the spermatid, there are dramatic molecular and functional changes in chromatin structure. In the rat, spermiogenesis is divided into 19 steps (1Leblond C.P. Clermont Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1952; 55: 548-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The round spermatids (steps 1–8) contain a complement of somatic plus testis-specific histones, such as H1t, TH2B, TH2A, and TH3 (2Meistrich M.L. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1989: 165-182Google Scholar). The round spermatids are transcriptionally active, but transcription ceases at about steps 9 or 10 (3Soderstrom K.O. Parvinen M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1976; 5: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the elongating spermatids (steps 9 to 12), several significant events occur in the chromatin. Covalent modifications of the histones include hyperacetylation of H4 (4Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. Lin R. Bhatnagar Y.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 31: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of H1t. 1I. Zalenskaya and M. L. Meistrich, in preparation. Chromatin changes are indicated by the increased accessibility of the N terminus of TH2B to antibody binding (5Unni E. Mayerhofer A. Zhang Y. Bhatnagar Y.M. Russell L.D. Meistrich M.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the increased susceptibility of the DNA to thermal denaturation (6Grimes Jr., S.R. Smart P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 824: 128-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nearly all of the histones are subsequently displaced by the transition proteins TP1, TP2, and TP4, whose synthesis begins at steps 11 or 12 (7Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. van Beek M.E.A.B. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Kistler W.S. Henriksén K. Mali P. Parvinen M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The displacement of the histones by the transition proteins occurs during the first phase of chromatin condensation, which begins at step 11. The transition proteins accumulate in condensing spermatids (steps 13–15) and are subsequently replaced by protamine, which is the major nuclear protein in the condensed spermatids (steps 16–19) and spermatozoa. Although nothing is known regarding the levels of ubiquitinated histones during mammalian spermatogenesis, several studies in other vertebrate groups have established that they vary during development. In the rooster, the levels of uH2A 2The abbreviations used are: uH2A, uH2B, uH3, mono-ubiquitinated forms of histones H2A, H2B, and H3, respectively; u2H2A, u2H2B, u2H3, diubiquitinated forms of H2A, H2B, and H3, respectively; AUT, acid-urea-Triton X-100; TCA, trichloroacetic acid. increase markedly from an undetectable level in pachytene spermatocytes to the highest level in late spermatids, just before the histones are replaced by protamine (9Agell N. Chiva M. Mezquita C. FEBS Letters. 1983; 155: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast in trout testes, the level of uH2A remains unchanged from early to late stage germ cells, but there is a decline in uH2B and an increase in u2H2B (10Nickel B.E. Roth S.Y. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The major role identified thus far for ubiquitination in cells is the targeting of proteins for degradation by polyubiquitination (11Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). In contrast, some proteins, particularly the histones H2A and H2B are often mono-ubiquitinated, which appears to be involved in processes other than degradation (12Wu R.S. Kohn K.W. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5916-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of histone mono-ubiquitination is currently not known (13Bonner W.M. Hatch C.L. Wu R.S. anc.in: Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin. Plenum Press, New York1988Google Scholar), but it has been shown that uH2A (14Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1982; 28: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and uH2B (15Nickel B.E. Allis C.D. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin. Mono- and polyubiquitinated H2A and H2B were more readily dissociated from chromatin by salt, indicating that they destabilize the nucleosome (17Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An important role for ubiquitination of proteins in mammalian spermiogenesis has been inferred from genetic and enzymatic studies. Ubiquitination of proteins is achieved by two or three enzymes, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, and a ubiquitin-conjugating (or ubiquitin-carrier) protein, E2; in some cases a ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3 is also required (11Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Although both of the mouse homologues, designated mHR6A and mHR6B, of the yeast E2 enzyme RAD6 are expressed in all tissues, the elongating spermatids express predominantly mHR6B, which in spermatids is localized in the nucleus (18Koken M.H.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Jaspers-Dekker I. de Wit J. Willemsen R. Roest H.P. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for the knockout of mHR6B have abnormalities in the displacement of histones during spermiogenesis and the further development of the late spermatids (19Roest H.P. van Klaveren J. de Wit J. van Gurp C.G. Koken M.H.M. Vermey M. van Roijen J.H. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Vreeburg J.T.M. Baarends W.M. Bootsma D. Grootegoed J.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 799-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In addition, three E2 proteins with homology to yeast UBC4/UBC5 have been identified in the rat testis; one, the 8A isoform of a 17-kDa E2, is testis-specific, reaches maximal levels in spermatids, and has an acidic pI, indicating that basic proteins might be its target (20Wing S.S. Jain P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Wing S.S. Bedard N. Morales C. Hingamp P. Trasler J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4064-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). E1 enzymes, coded by theUbe1x and Ube1y genes, have also been demonstrated to be expressed at high levels in spermatids of mouse testes (22Hendriksen P.J.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Themmen A.P.N. Koken M.H.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Oostra B.A. van der Lende T. Grootegoed J.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the histone modifications that occur just prior to histone displacement and to identify possible targets for ubiquitination in elongating spermatids, we investigated the modifications of histones in three populations of cells from rat testes, including one enriched in elongating spermatids. We report that the histones showing elevated levels of ubiquitination in this cell type are variants of H3. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN), at least 10 weeks of age, were used in all experiments. Spermatogenic cells were separated into enriched subpopulations by centrifugal elutriation (23Meistrich M.L. Prescott D.M. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, New York1977: 15-54Google Scholar) under published conditions (24Meistrich M.L. Longtin J. Brock W.A. Grimes S.R. Mace M.L. Biol.

The cellular composition of the fractions is given in Table I. Nuclei were prepared from the separated cells by lysis in hypotonic sodium phosphate buffer (5 mm, pH 6.5) containing 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.025% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mmnaphthol disulfonic acid, and 1 mm p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid (26Platz R.D.

In one experiment, the nuclei were sequentially extracted with 0.3, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5mNaCl. Proteins were precipitated with either 4 or 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to increase the proportion of core histones, or with 25% TCA, which precipitates all histones (26Platz R.D. Meistrich M.L.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), anti-H3 antisera (a kind gift from Dr. C. D. Allis), and two antibodies that react with TH2B (5Unni E. Mayerhofer A.

Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction product was detected either with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibodies and a chromogenic substrate (30Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham ECL Western blotting system). Histones from different fractions of testicular cells were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). The patterns of spots corresponding to the core histones were similar in all three fractions at the level of resolution afforded by the minislab gels used in this analysis. In addition, a pair of spots, which were particularly prominent in pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. 1 B), were observed at the position corresponding to uH2A. One of the distinctive features of the ubiquitinated histones is that they usually migrate as doublets in the second-dimension SDS gel (16Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The levels of uH2A, relative to the total histone amounts, were highest in the pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. 1 B) and lowest in the elongating spermatids (Fig.1 D). When blots from similar gels were immunoreacted with anti-ubiquitin antibodies, uH2A was most prominent (Fig.2). We could not determine at the resolution level of these gels whether the spots corresponded to ubiquitinated forms of TH2A, H2A.1, or H2A.2 or all of these proteins. Spots corresponding to uH2A.X and uH2A.Z were observed, respectively, slightly slower than uH2A in the SDS dimension and faster than uH2A in the AUT dimension. In addition, polyubiquitinated forms of H2A (32Nickel B.E. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were observed prominently in the pachytene spermatocytes (Fig.2 B). The round spermatids had appreciable levels of u2H2A, but little polyubiquitinated forms (Fig.2 C). Elongating spermatids lacked the forms of histones with two or three ubiquitins attached but contained a diffuse distribution of highly ubiquitinated forms (Fig. 2 D). In addition to uH2A, uH2A.X, and uH2A.Z, three additional spots can be seen in the regions corresponding to mono-ubiquitinated forms. Based on the mobilities of these histones relative to the H2As (see Fig. 1), two of the spots were assigned as uH3 (either uH3.2 or uH3.3) and uTH3. These spots moved slower than the uH2A spots in the SDS dimension; uTH3 migrated between uH2A and uH2A.Z, while uH3 electrophoresed faster than H2A.Z in the AUT dimension. The third spot (more prominent in Fig. 3 B), which migrated just slightly faster than uH3 in the AUT dimension and slightly slower than the uH2As in the SDS dimension, was assigned to uH2B. This assignment has been confirmed by alignment with ubiquitinated forms of rat liver histones (not shown). None of the spots in the ubiquitinated region showed immunoreaction with antibodies to TH2B (not shown). The spot corresponding to uH3 was also observed in unseparated testicular cell suspensions (not shown) but never in the pachytene or round spermatid fractions. The ubiquitinated forms of the histones in the elongating spermatid fraction were better resolved and detected in Fig. 3, in part because the 4%-TCA precipitate was used, enriching the core histones. In the silver-stained gel (Fig. 3 A), uH2A and uH2A.Z were clearly observed; it was not possible to identify with certainty the ubiquitinated forms of H3 and H2B because of numerous spots in those regions. However, the corresponding immunoblot (Fig. 3 B) clearly shows the presence of uH3, uTH3, and uH2B. In addition, there were extensive polyubiquitinated forms. The polyubiquitinated forms of different histones can be resolved by their positions in the diagonals that extend from the upper left corner of the gel in an arc to the mono-ubiquitinated form (Fig. 3 B). It is apparent that both H3 and H2A were extensively polyubiquitinated. This is in contrast to the ubiquitinated histones of pachytene spermatocytes (Fig.2 B), where H2A was the major polyubiquitinated histone species. Two approaches were taken to support the identification of the spots labeled uH3 and uTH3. The first involved the use of anti-H3 antibodies (Fig. 4). The limitation of this approach was the low levels of the uH3 and some nonspecific reaction of the antibody. Nevertheless, the spot designated uH3 was detected by the antibody. This observation was repeated on additional blots of gels from this and another preparation (not shown); nonspecific reactions were always present. The second approach was to enrich for different histone fractions by differential salt extraction. H1 is the most readily salt-extractable form, followed by H2A and H2B; H3 and H4 require higher salt concentrations for extraction (17Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The one-dimensional gel (Fig.5 A, lane 1) shows that the most prominent histones in the 0.3–0.9 mNaCl fraction were H1 (some was carried down in the 5% precipitate), H2A, and H2B; H3 and H4 were at low levels. The immunoblot with anti-ubiquitin (Fig. 5 B) shows intense immunoreaction with the uH2A histones and some immunoreaction with uH2B, but no reaction in the region of the uH3 histones. The 0.9–1.2 mfraction contained the four core histones (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). The corresponding immunoblot (Fig. 5 C) showed immunoreactions with uH3, uTH3, and u2H3, in addition to the ubiquitinated forms of H2A and H2B. Finally, the 1.2–1.5 mfraction was most enriched in H3 and H4 (Fig. 5 A,lane 3). Although the left part of the gel for the immunoblot (Fig. 5 D) did not run properly, the right part of the gel showed that the intensity of uH3 relative to uH2B was higher in this fraction than the previous one. This manuscript represents the first report of ubiquitination of H3. Although the ubiquitination is apparently specific to the elongating spermatids of the testis, in reaching this conclusion it is necessary to take into consideration the purity of the fractions, the contaminating cell types, and the histones that are present in these cells. Methods of further purifying these cell types are available (7Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. van Beek M.E.A.B. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,24Meistrich M.L. Longtin J. Brock W.A. Grimes S.R. Mace M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but they would reduce yields and we did not feel greater purity was essential in this study. The pachytene spermatocytes were only 79% pure; the contamination was largely by earlier stage germ cells (12%) and by round spermatids (6%). Since the round spermatid fraction, which also contained some spermatogonia and early primary spermatocytes, had low levels of the polyubiquitinated forms, most polyubiquitinated H2A histones in the pachytene fraction must indeed be derived from the pachytene spermatocytes. The purity of the round spermatid fraction was 73%, with early primary spermatocytes and interstitial somatic cells being the major contaminants. Only 4% were elongating spermatids, explaining the absence of bands corresponding to the uH3 histones. The uH2A and u2H2A species observed were most likely present in the round spermatids. Purification of elongating spermatids is extremely difficult (7Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. van Beek M.E.A.B. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and here we have obtained a fraction that is only somewhat enriched. The elongating spermatid fraction contains many cytoplasmic fragments but these would not contribute to the nuclear protein complement of the cells. The nuclei in this fraction are derived from three main classes of cells, elongating spermatids, condensing spermatids, and somatic cells. The condensing spermatid (steps 13–15) nuclei cannot contribute ubiquitinated histones to this fraction because they contain largely transition proteins and not histones. It is possible that the somatic cells might contribute some of the uH2B and uH3 histones, but they cannot contribute the uTH3 since that protein is exclusively in germ cells (27Trostle-Weige P.K. Meistrich M.L. Brock W.A. Nishioka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8769-8776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, uH3 has never been detected in rat, chicken, or human somatic cells (16Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since one of the uH3 isoforms (uTH3) must be restricted to elongating spermatids and since ubiquitination of H3 is a rare event, we conclude that the other forms (uH3 and polyubiquitinated H3) are also in the elongating spermatids. In contrast to the increase in ubiquitination of H3 in elongating spermatids, the levels of ubiquitinated H2A declined in these cells. Thus the rat differs from the rooster, in which uH2A increases during spermiogenesis (9Agell N. Chiva M. Mezquita C. FEBS Letters. 1983; 155: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the trout, in which it remains constant (10Nickel B.E. Roth S.Y. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of H2A (35Goldknopf I.L. Busch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 864-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and H2B (36West M.H. Bonner W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4671-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) have been described previously and have been extensively characterized. In many cell types, about 10% of the nucleosomal H2A is in the form of uH2A and 1% of H2B exists as uH2B. There are no reports of ubiquitination of H3 in vivo. However, in vitro H3 is as good a substrate as H2A for a variety of mammalian ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (37Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15076-15082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is very effectively ubiquitinated by the yeast RAD6 E2 protein (38Haas A. Reback P.M. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the present study was not designed to quantify the amount of uH3 in the elongating spermatids, it is important to make a rough estimate. The ratio of uH2A to H2A estimated from Fig. 1 is about 1%. The ratio of uH3 + uTH3 to uH2A + uH2A.Z from the immunoblots is an average of 0.78 (range 0.25–2.7). If we assume that the uH3 histones are only in elongating spermatids, which constitute 42% of the histone-containing cells of this fraction, the percentage of the H3 histones that are ubiquitinated in the elongating spermatids is within an order of magnitude of 2%. The linkage of ubiquitin to H3 is not known. In the cases of H2A and H2B, the ubiquitin C-terminal glycine is linked via an isopeptide bond to ε-amino groups of lysine at the 11th and the 5th amino acid, respectively, from the C terminus. In H3, the only lysines in the C-terminal region are at the 14th and 21st amino acid from the terminus (39Wells, D., and Brown, D. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res.19,(suppl.) 2173–2188Google Scholar). However, both of these sites are located in the histone fold regions of H3 and would likely be inaccessible to ubiquitinating enzymes (40Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6926) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are several lysines in the N-terminal tail of H3 and in exposed internal regions of the nucleosome (41Stemmer C. Briand J.P. Muller S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since ubiquitination of H3 in these regions would be expected to occur in somatic cells too, which is not observed, the only explanation for the specificity of uH3 in elongating spermatids would be a specific ubiquitinating enzyme in spermatids (21Wing S.S. Bedard N. Morales C. Hingamp P. Trasler J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4064-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alternatively, lysines located within the histone fold regions of H3 might be the target of the ubiquitinating enzymes, and these would become accessible only after partial disruption of the nucleosome, which might precede the ubiquitination of H3 in the elongating spermatids. The possibility that the ubiquitination of H3 occurs in free H3 is unlikely because more than 0.9 mNaCl is required to extract uH3 from the nucleus. The role of histone ubiquitination in elongating spermatids is not clear but some hypotheses appear reasonable. The increased levels of polyubiquitination of H2A and H3 in elongating, as opposed to round spermatids, indicate that they may be targeted for degradation to permit the binding of transition proteins. Why only some of the histones are processed in this manner is not known; perhaps there are other mechanisms for the removal of the others from the chromatin. Another possibility is that H3 ubiquitination has a role in chromatin restructuring. The localization of mono-ubiquitinated histones in regions of actively transcribed chromatin (14Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1982; 28: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Nickel B.E. Allis C.D. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and their absence in metaphase chromosomes (42Matsui S.-I. Seon B.K. Sandberg A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6386-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), indicates that ubiquitination might aid in the relaxation of compact chromatin and nucleosomal structures to increase accessibility of the transcription machinery. Chromatin restructuring, possibly involving ubiquitination of H3, occurs in elongating spermatids; however, it cannot be related to transcriptional activity, because these cells are already transcriptionally inactive. One alternative possibility is that H3 ubiquitination is involved in the relaxation of the nucleosomal structure, facilitating either direct displacement of histones by the transition proteins or their accessibility to chaperones or other proteins involved in histone removal. In this model, H3 ubiquitination may act synergistically with the other histone modifications, H1 phosphorylation and H4 hyperacetylation, observed at this stage of spermiogenesis to prepare the nucleosome for removal. Another possibility is that H3 ubiquitination is a consequence of the relaxation or disruption of the nucleosome that had already occurred as a result of these other histone modifications or transition protein deposition. However, H3 ubiquitination may still serve to prevent nucleosome reformation and thereby promote histone displacement."

The product consisted of (13R)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoic acid ((13R)-HPOD) and a new hydroperoxide, (11S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid ((11S)-HPOD). Incubation of (11R)-[2H]- and (11S)-[2H]linoleic acids with Mn-LO led to the formation of hydroperoxides that largely retained and lost, respectively, the deuterium label. Conversion of the (11S)-deuteriolinoleic acid was accompanied by a primary isotope effect, which manifested itself in a strongly reduced rate of formation of hydroperoxides and in a time-dependent accumulation of deuterium in the unconverted substrate. These experiments indicated that the initial step catalyzed by Mn-LO consisted of abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen of linoleic acid to produce a linoleoyl radical. (11S)-HPOD was converted into (13R)-HPOD upon incubation with Mn-LO. The mechanism of this enzyme-catalyzed hydroperoxide rearrangement was studied in experiments carried out with18O2 gas or18O2-labeled hydroperoxides. Incubation of [11-18O2](11S)-HPOD with Mn-LO led to the formation of (13R)-HPOD, which retained 39–44% of the 18O label, whereas (11S)-HPOD incubated with Mn-LO under 18O2 produced (13R)-HPOD, which had incorporated 57% of 18O. Furthermore, analysis of the isotope content of (11S)-HPOD remaining unconverted in such incubations demonstrated that [11-18O2](11S)-HPOD suffered a time-dependent loss of 18O when exposed to Mn-LO, whereas (11S)-HPOD incorporated 18O when incubated with Mn-LO under 18O2. On the basis of these experiments, it was proposed that the conversion of (11S)-HPOD into (13R)-HPOD occurred in a non-concerted way by deoxygenation into a linoleoyl radical. Subsequent reoxygenation of this intermediate by dioxygen attack at C-13 produced (13R)-HPOD, whereas attack at C-11 regenerated (11S)-HPOD. The hydroperoxide rearrangement occurred by oxygen rebound, although, as demonstrated by the 18O experiments, the oxygen molecule released from (11S)-HPOD exchanged with surrounding molecular oxygen prior to its reincorporation.

Lipoxygenase-catalyzed dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to the formation of reactive fatty acid hydroperoxides. Mammalian lipoxygenases can catalyze oxygenation at carbons 5, 8, 12, and 15 of their predominant substrate,i.e. arachidonic acid (1Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Many plant lipoxygenases can also utilize arachidonic acid, although their most important substrates are the C-18 fatty acids linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid (2Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1084: 221-239Crossref Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Interest in lipoxygenases stems partly from the fact that fatty acid hydroperoxides can be further metabolized into biologically active oxylipins such as leukotrienes and jasmonates. Lipoxygenases contain ferrous iron, which is oxidized into the ferric state by, e.g., hydroperoxides. The ferric form of lipoxygenases is catalytically active (3de Groot J.J.M.C. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Wever R. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 377: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and catalyzes the stereospecific abstraction of one hydrogen from the bis-allylic methylene group of the (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene structure of the substrate as the initial step (4Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attack by dioxygen at one of the terminal positions of the resulting pentadienyl radical results in the formation of a hydroperoxide having one pair ofE/Z-conjugated double bonds. Studies of the regio- and stereochemistry of the steps occurring in the oxygenation of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid by soybean lipoxygenase-1 revealed that the pro-S hydrogen was stereospecifically removed from C-13 and that dioxygen was regio- and stereospecifically inserted at C-15 to produce a (15S)-hydroperoxide (4Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding, and results of similar studies carried out with linoleic acid (9S)-lipoxygenase from corn (5Egmond M.R. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid (12S)-lipoxygenases from human platelets (6Hamberg M. Hamberg G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1991; 1081: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) indicated the existence of an antarafacial relationship between hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion as a common feature of dioxygenations catalyzed by lipoxygenases. Interestingly, such a steric relationship has also been found for the dioxygenation catalyzed by an “R” lipoxygenase, i.e. (12R)-lipoxygenase from sea urchin (10Hawkins D.J. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7629-7634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as for dioxygenations catalyzed by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases I (11Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian and plant lipoxygenases so far studied catalyze production of hydroperoxides that have the “S” absolute configuration. In contrast, a number of marine invertebrates, such as starfish, sea urchin, and the coral Plexaura homomalla, express lipoxygenases, which catalyze formation of “R” hydroperoxides, as demonstrated by the configuration of hydroperoxides formed by oxygenation of arachidonic acid at the C-5, C-8, C-11, and C-12 positions. One of these enzymes, arachidonic acid (8R)-lipoxygenase, was recently cloned and sequenced (14Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol.

Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The protein was found to be heavily glycosylated and to contain 0.5–1 atom of manganese per molecule. The molecular mass of the native protein (~135 kDa) was comparable to that of arachidonic acid (15S)-lipoxygenase purified from the fungus Saprolegnia parasitica (145–150 kDa) (16Herman R.P. Hamberg M. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the molecular mass of the deglycosylated Mn-LO (~73 kDa) (15Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was similar to those of mammalian lipoxygenases. The present paper is concerned with the stereochemistry and mechanism of the Mn-LO-catalyzed dioxygenation. In the course of the work, it was unexpectedly found that the enzyme catalyzes bis-allylic oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, oxygenation of linoleic acid resulted in the formation of 11-hydroperoxylinoleic acid, a new member of the oxylipin family of compounds. [1-14C]Linoleic acid was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Dilution with unlabeled material (Nu-Chek-Prep, Elysian, MN) followed by purification by SiO2 chromatography afforded a specimen having a specific radioactivity of 5.0 kBq/μmol. (11R)-[2H]Linoleic acid (37.2% monodeuterated and 62.8% undeuterated molecules) and (11S)-[2H]linoleic acid (32.6% monodeuterated and 67.4% undeuterated molecules) were prepared by lithium aluminum deuteride reduction of the p-tolylsulfonyl derivatives of methyl (11S)- and (11R)-hydroxystearates, respectively, followed by biological desaturation of the resulting stereospecifically deuterated stearic acids as described in detail elsewhere (17Fahlstadius P. Hamberg M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 1: 2027-2030Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Hamberg M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1993; 1: 3065-3072Crossref Google Scholar). The optical purities of the chiral 11-hydroxystearates were: (11R)-hydroxystearate (precursor of (11S)-[2H]linoleic acid), 98.3%R; (11S)-hydroxystearate (precursor of (11R)-[2H]linoleic acid), 95.4% S. (9S)-HPOD and (13S)-HPOD were prepared by incubation of linoleic acid with tomato lipoxygenase (19Matthew J.A. Chan H.W.-S. Galliard T. Lipids. 1977; 12: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and soybean lipoxygenase (20Hamberg M. Gotthammar B. Lipids. 1973; 8: 737-744Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), respectively. The corresponding alcohols, (9S)-HOD and (13S)-HOD, were obtained from the hydroperoxides by reduction with sodium borohydride. (11R)-HOD and 11-ketolinoleic acid were prepared by incubation of linoleic acid with an enzyme preparation of the red algaLithothamnion corallioides (21Hamberg M. Gerwick W.H. Åsen P.A. Lipids. 1992; 27: 487-493Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar).18O2, 99.4 atom %, was obtained from Isotec, Miamisburg, OH. Glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, and soybean lipoxygenase were purchased from Sigma. Mn-LO was prepared as described in the accompanying paper (15Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Solutions of the enzyme (22 μg/ml) could be stored at 4 °C for several weeks without appreciable loss of activity. The methyl ester of (11R,11S)-HOD (i.e. the natural (9Z,12Z)-isomer) was prepared by treatment of linoleic acid (1 mm) with myoglobin (100 μm) and cumene hydroperoxide (3 mm) at 0 °C as recently described (22Hamberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The methyl ester of (9E,12E)-(11R,11S)-HOD was prepared in an analogous way starting with (9E,12E)-octadecadienoic acid, although the poor solubility of this acid in aqueous buffer made it necessary to carry out the hydroxylation at 23 °C. A mixture of (9E,12Z)- and (9Z,12E)-octadecadienoic acids was obtained from a commercially available mixture of the four geometrical isomers of 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Sigma) using RP-HPLC. Treatment of the acids with myoglobin/cumene hydroperoxide at 0 °C followed by esterification and isolation by RP-HPLC afforded a mixture of comparable amounts of the methyl esters of (9E,12Z)-(11R,11S)-HOD and (9Z,12E)-(11R,11S)-HOD; UV spectrum (methanol), featureless in the region 210–340 nm; FT-IR spectrum (film), absorption bands inter alia at 3200–3620 cm−1 (hydroxyl), 1742 cm−1 (ester carbonyl), and 968 cm−1 (E double bond). The four isomeric methyl 11-hydroxy-9,12-octadecadienoates were separable as their Me3Si derivatives by GLC, i.e. derivative of (11R,11S)-HOD, C-19.41; derivative of (9E,12E)-(11R,11S)-HOD, C-19.62; and derivatives of (9E,12Z)-(11R,11S)-HOD and (9Z,12E)-(11R,11S)-HOD, C-19.48 and C-19.56 (these two isomers have not yet been individually correlated with the two C-values). The mass spectra of the four isomers were similar and showed strong ions at m/z 382 (M), 311 (M − 71; loss of •(CH2)4-CH3), and 225 ([CH=CH-CH(OSiMe3)-CH=CH-(CH2)4-CH3]+). Most incubations were carried out by stirring [1-14C]linoleic acid (50–700 μm) or [1-14C](11S)-HPOD (40–60 μm) with 0.5–2.2 μg of Mn-LO at 23 °C in 0.5–2.1 ml of one of the following buffers: 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (buffer A); 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 10.0 (buffer B); or 10 mm triethanolamine acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium azide, 0.04% Tween 20, pH 7.0 (buffer C). An aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to a cuvette (path length, 1 or 10 mm; temperature, 23 °C) and the reaction progress was followed by monitoring the absorbance at 235 nm versustime. Incubations under 18O2 were conducted at 23 °C in a reaction vessel connected to a high vacuum line and a supply of argon. Buffer A (2 ml) and Mn-LO were added to the reaction vessel, and the solution was de-aerated at 0 °C by five cycles of vacuum and argon purging prior to introduction of18O2 gas and substrate. Isolation of reaction products was performed by extraction with diethyl ether at pH 5, followed by RP-HPLC. Preparation and purification of (−)-menthoxycarbonyl (MC) derivatives (23Hamberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and steric analysis of 9-HOD and 13-HOD (23Hamberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and of 11-HOD (21Hamberg M. Gerwick W.H. Åsen P.A. Lipids. 1992; 27: 487-493Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were performed as indicated. Catalytic hydrogenation was performed with platinum catalyst (3 mg) using methanol (1 ml) as the solvent. Partial hydrogenation of the methyl ester of 11-HOD (25 μg) was carried out by stirring with 5% palladium-on-calcium carbonate (5 mg) in ethyl acetate (3 ml) under hydrogen gas for 4 min (cf. Ref. 21Hamberg M. Gerwick W.H. Åsen P.A. Lipids. 1992; 27: 487-493Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Oxidative ozonolysis was carried out as described (23Hamberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) using an ozone generator (model T-12) purchased from TriO3 Industries, Fort Pierce, FL. RP-HPLC was performed with a column of Nucleosil 100–5 C18 (250 × 4.6 mm) purchased from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). The solvent system used consisted of acetonitrile/water/2 mhydrochloric acid (60:40:0.02, v/v/v). Straight phase high performance liquid chromatography was carried out with a column of Nucleosil 50–5 (200 × 4.6 mm) and a solvent system of 2-propanol/hexane (1:99, v/v). The absorbance (217 nm) and radioactivity of high performance liquid chromatography effluents were determined on-line using a Spectromonitor III ultraviolet detector (Laboratory Data Control, Riviera Beach, FL) and a liquid scintillation counter (IN/US Systems, Tampa, FL), respectively. GLC was performed with a Hewlett-Packard (Avondale, PA) model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a methyl silicone capillary column (length, 25 m; film thickness, 0.33 μm). Helium at a flow rate of 25 cm/s was used as the carrier gas. Retention times were converted into C-values using standards of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (24Hamberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GC-MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5970B mass selective detector connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph. LC-MS was performed as described in the accompanying paper (15Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Ultraviolet absorption as a function of wavelength or time was recorded with a Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) model U-2000 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Infrared spectrometry was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer model 1650 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Radioactivity was determined with a Packard Tri-Carb model 4450 liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instruments, Downer's Grove, IL). [1-14C]Linoleic acid (350 μm) was stirred for 30 min with Mn-LO (1.5 μg) in buffer A (2.1 ml) at 23 °C. Material isolated by extraction with diethyl ether was subjected to RP-HPLC radiochromatography. As seen in Fig.1, three peaks of radioactivity appeared. The least polar material (29%; 81.1 ml of effluent) was identical to [1-14C]linoleic acid remaining unconverted. Compound A (12%; 14.1 ml of effluent) was intermediate in polarity to references of authentic (11R,11S)-HOD (12.1 ml of effluent) and (13S)-HOD (15.4 ml of effluent). Compound B (59%; 17.0 ml of effluent) cochromatographed with authentic (13S)-HPOD. Analysis of compound B by LC-MS demonstrated a peak (10.4 min effluent) giving prominent ions atm/z 311 (M − 1; loss of H), 295 (M − 17; loss of OH), and 293 (M − (1 + 18); loss of H plus H2O). When compound B was dissolved in D2O/CD3OD (1:1, v/v), the M − 1 ion shifted to m/z 312. An aliquot of compound B was reduced by treatment with sodium borohydride. Analysis of the esterified product by straight phase high performance liquid chromatography produced the methyl esters of 13-HOD (97.1%; 11.6 ml of effluent) and 9-HOD (2.9%; 14.7 ml of effluent) as judged by their chromatographic behaviors, UV spectrometry, and mass spectrometry. The two hydroxyoctadecadienoates were converted into their MC derivatives and subjected to oxidative ozonolysis. Analysis of the esterified product by GLC demonstrated the formation of dimethyl azelate as well as the MC derivative of methyl 2-hydroxyheptanoate (R/S, 97.5:2.5) from the derivative of 13-HOD. The derivative of 9-HOD afforded the MC derivative of dimethyl 2-hydroxysebacate (R/S, 37.0:63.0). These experiments confirmed the results of the accompanying paper (15Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which identified the major hydroperoxide produced from linoleic acid as (13R)-HPOD. In addition, the analyses showed that the Mn-LO-catalyzed oxygenation of linoleic acid resulted in small amounts of the following hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate isomers: (13S)-HPOD (2.4%), (9R)-HPOD (1.1%), and (9S)-HPOD (1.8%). The retention time of compound A upon LC-MS analysis was 8.3 min, and the mass spectrum showed prominent ions at 311 (M − 1; loss of H), 295 (M − 17; loss of OH), and 293 (M − (1 + 18); loss of H plus H2O). This result indicated that compound A was a hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (molecular weight, 312). The UV spectrum of compound A was featureless (Fig. 2) demonstrating the absence of,e.g., conjugated double bonds. Treatment of compound A with a small amount of perchloric acid resulted in a rapid appearance of UV absorption bands at 259, 268, and 279 nm (Fig. 2). Analysis of the esterified reaction product by GLC and GC-MS demonstrated the presence of geometrical isomers of methyl 8,10,12- and 9,11,13-octadecatrienoates as judged by their molecular weight (292) and retention times (C-19.00 (21%), C-19.13 (21%), C-19.42 (28%), and C-19.46 (30%)). The fact that a virtually identical mixture of geometrical isomers of methyl 8,10,12- and 9,11,13-octadecatrienoates was formed upon acid treatment of the methyl ester of (11R)-HOD (21Hamberg M. Gerwick W.H. Åsen P.A. Lipids. 1992; 27: 487-493Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggested that compound A was a derivative of linoleic acid substituted at the bis-allylic position (C-11). Treatment of compound A with sodium borohydride followed by esterification afforded the methyl ester of 11-HOD as judged by GLC and GC-MS. The retention time corresponded to C-19.41, a value identical to that observed for the Me3Si derivative of the methyl ester of authentic 11-HOD but different from the values recorded for the Me3Si derivatives of the methyl esters of (9E,12Z)-11-HOD and (9Z,12E)-11-HOD (C-19.48/C-19.56) and (9E,12E)-11-HOD (C-19.62). The mass spectrum of the reduced product obtained from compound A was identical to that of the Me3Si derivative of the methyl ester of 11-HOD and showed prominent ions at m/z 382 (M, 38%), 311 (M − 71; loss of •(CH2)4-CH3, 32%), 253 (9%), and 225 ([CH=CH-CH(OSiMe3)-CH=CH-(CH2)4-CH3]+, 44%). Reduction of compound A with sodium borodeuteride afforded 11-HOD without significant incorporation of deuterium (less than 0.5%), thus excluding the possibility of a 11-keto group in compound A. Catalytic hydrogenation of compound A using platinum as catalyst resulted in the formation of a 1:1 mixture of 11-hydroxyoctadecanoate and 11-ketooctadecanoate as shown by GC-MS analysis using the authentic compounds as references. On the basis of these data, compound A was identified as a 11-hydroperoxy derivative of linoleic acid. Partial hydrogenation of compound A followed by oxidative ozonolysis performed on the MC derivative was used to determine the double bond positions and the configuration of C-11. Analysis of the esterified ozonolysis product by GLC and GC-MS demonstrated the presence of the MC derivatives of methyl (2S)-hydroxynonanoate (less than 2% of the (2R)-hydroxynonanoate; fragment originating in the MC derivative of methyl 11-hydroxy-9-octadecenoate) and of dimethyl (2R)-hydroxydodecane-1,12-dioate (less than 2% of the (2S)-hydroxydodecanedioate; fragment originating in the MC derivative of methyl 11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoate). This experiment thus established that the two double bonds of compound A were localized in the Δ9 and Δ12 positions, and that the absolute configuration of the alcohol group at C-11 was “S.” The data presented demonstrated that compound A was identical to (11S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid ((11S)-HPOD). Linoleic acid was incubated with Mn-LO and the product compositions at different times of incubation and varying substrate concentrations were determined by RP-HPLC (cf. Fig. 1). Because of the different extinction coefficients of (13R)-HPOD, (11S)-HPOD, and linoleic acid at the wavelength used for detection (217 nm), the peak areas had to be divided with relative response factors in order to obtain the molar composition of reactions products. These relative response factors, i.e. 0.0732 (linoleic acid), 0.578 ((11S)-HPOD), and 1 ((13R)-HPOD, were calculated by performing repeated injections of mixtures containing the three14C-labeled compounds onto the high performance liquid chromatography column and separately determining the peak areas of aborbance at 217 nm and the radioactivity present in the corresponding effluents. As seen in Fig. 3, when a relatively low concentration of linoleic acid (175 μm) was incubated with Mn-LO, (11S)-HPOD was transient in appearance. The maximum level was observed at 10–20 min of incubation, and at 30 min only a trace amount of the hydroperoxide was detectable. In contrast, when the linoleic acid concentration was increased to 526 μm, the amounts of (11S)-HPOD continued to increase during the entire incubation period of 30 min. Interestingly, analyses by RP-HPLC of products from experiments, where (11S)-HPOD had been generated from linoleic acid and then allowed to disappear, did not show any new peak(s) of UV absorption ascribable to the further conversion of (11S)-HPOD. It was conceivable that (11S)-HPOD had been converted into non-UV-absorbing compound(s); however, analysis by RP-HPLC radiochromatography of reaction products generated from [1-14C]linoleic acid showed the presence of (13R)-HPOD as the single labeled product. These results suggested that (11S)-HPOD was convertible to (13R)-HPOD in the presence of Mn-LO, and that this conversion was slowed down in the presence of high concentrations of linoleic acid. [1-14C](11S)-HPOD (60 μg) was obtained by incubations of a high concentration of [1-14C]linoleic acid (701 μm) with Mn-LO (2.2 μg) followed by isolation by RP-HPLC. That no degradation of the collected hydroperoxide had taken place was verified by analysis of an aliquot of the specimen by RP-HPLC radiochromatography. Treatment of (11S)-HPOD (52 μm) with Mn-LO resulted in the formation of (13R)-HPOD as judged by RP-HPLC radiochromatography (cf. Fig. 1). The identity of the hydroperoxide produced from (11S)-HPOD as (13R)-HPOD was based on its UV spectrum (solvent methanol; λmax = 234 nm), its conversion into 13-HOD upon reduction with sodium borohydride, its conversion into 13-hydroxystearate upon reduction followed by catalytic hydrogenation, and on results of its chemical degradation by oxidative ozonolysis. As was the case with (13R)-HPOD isolated following incubation of linoleic acid with Mn-LO, the (13R)-HPOD produced from (11S)-HPOD was accompanied by small amounts of 9-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoates, i.e. (9R)-HPOD (1.2%) and (9S)-HPOD (1.7%). Conversion of (11S)-HPOD into (13R)-HPOD was conveniently monitored by recording the UV absorbance at 235 nmversus time (Fig. 4). At the concentrations used, the maximum rate of formation of (13R)-HPOD from (11S)-HPOD, i.e. 18.3 nmol min−1 μg−1, was ~50% greater than that of formation of (13R)-HPOD from linoleic acid,i.e. 12.1 nmol min−1 μg−1. Interestingly, a slight lag phase was consistently observed when (11S)-HPOD was used as the substrate (Fig. 4). Glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione catalyze reduction of fatty acid hydroperoxides into hydroxy acids. Trapping of hydroperoxides by this enzyme has been used in previous studies to confirm the existence of fatty acid hydroperoxides as intermediates in the biosynthesis of epoxy-hydroxy acids (25Hamberg M. Herman C.A. Herman R.P. Biochim. Biopys. Acta. 1986; 877: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and dihydroxy acids (26Brodowsky I.D. Hamberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hamberg M. Gerwick W.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If the Mn-LO-catalyzed formation of (13R)-HPOD from linoleic acid took place by the sequence linoleic acid → (11S)-HPOD → (13R)-HPOD, inclusion of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione would be expected to result in high yields of 11-HOD, the reduction product of (11S)-HPOD, and in low yields of 13-HOD, the reduction product of (13R)-HPOD. In a typical experiment, a mixture of linoleic acid (224 μm), glutathione peroxidase (3 units) and reduced glutathione (3 mm) in 0.8 ml of buffer C was treated with Mn-LO (0.86 μg) at 23 °C. Spectrophotometric assay of the reaction mixture showed that the rate of formation of 13-H(P)OD was 2.1 nmol min−1 μg−1, a rate considerably lower than that observed in a control incubation carried out in the absence of glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione,i.e. 9.8 nmol min−1 μg−1. This reduced rate of formation of (13R)-HPOD in the presence of glutathione peroxidase was not due to a selective interference with formation of this hydroperoxide but to partial inhibition of linoleic acid oxygenation. Thus, analysis of the reaction product (20 min of incubation) by RP-HPLC showed that unconverted linoleic acid was the main component (75%). The remaining part"

Interestingly, the same complex has been implicated in the cap-dependent export of U small nuclear RNA and mRNA (15Izaurralde E. Lewis J. Gamberi C. Jarmolowski A. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W.

Here, we describe the isolation and biochemical properties of a novel eIF4E-like cap-binding protein and discuss its potential biological function. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. T7 RNA polymerase and RNasin were purchased from Promega. T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit, GpppG, and m7GpppG were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hybond-N nylon membrane and chemiluminescence system were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [α-32P]GTP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. The silver staining kit was from Sigma. An antibody to a peptide (YSRRTPGRPTSSQSYE, underlined in Fig. 1) of 4EHP was raised in rabbit and affinity-purified using the AminoLink Plus immobilization kit from Pierce. Oligonucleotides and peptide were prepared at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University. All other reagents were reagent grade or better. An expressed sequence tag (EST) 1The abbreviations used are: EST, expressed sequence tag; ORF, open reading frame; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin. from Human Genome Science Inc. (number 217861) was used to screen a human follicular cell λuni-ZAP-XR (Stratagene) cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Karl Heinz Scheit). One million plaques were screened in duplicate, and all procedures to screen, purify, and excise the cDNA inserts from positive clones were performed as described in the Stratagene ZAP Express™ instruction manual. The sequence of the largest cDNA (designated as p4EHP) was obtained by using the T7 DNA sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The sequence was deposited in GenBank™, accession number AF047695. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using Trizol (Life Technology, Inc.) and purified twice in batch mode with oligo(dT) beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Poly(A)+RNA was fractionated through a 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gel and blotted onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was probed with random-primed (38Sambrook J.

Exposure to Kodak X-Omat™ AR film was for 24 h. p4EHP (5 μg) was linearized withXhoI. The template was transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) under standard conditions. eIF4E RNA was prepared by transcribing the SalI-linearized pKS-eIF4E plasmid (29Pause A. Belsham G. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) with T7 RNA polymerase. p4EHP was used as a template in a polymerase chain reaction. The forward oligonucleotide ACGTGAATTCGCGAACAACAAGTT, the reverse oligonucleotide ACGTGAATTCTCATGGCACATTCAACCG, and thePfu polymerase (Stratagene) were used to amplify the 4EHP open reading frame (ORF). The resulting 730-base pair (bp) fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of BlueScript KS(+) (Stratagene) to generate the plasmid p4EHPORF, which was then sequenced and found to completely match the corresponding sequence in the original cDNA clone. This fragment was then subcloned in the EcoRI site of pARΔ[59/69] (39Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) to create a carboxyl-terminal fusion with the Flag-HMK sequence encoded by the vector; the resulting plasmid was designated pAR4EHP. BL21(DE3) bacterial cells (Novagen) were transformed with pAR4EHP, and selected colonies were grown in M9 + glucose to A 600 = 0.6 at which time 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Cells induced for 4 h were pelleted, resuspended in 5% culture volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated twice on ice for 20 s (1-min interval between sonications) at 60% output using a Vibra-cell sonicator (Sonics & Materials). Cleared lysate was processed on a Flag column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Eastman Kodak Co.). A recombinant histidine-tagged 4EHP protein (His-4EHP) was generated as follows: the 4EHP open reading frame cloned in BlueScript KS(+) was excised with BamHI andHindIII and inserted into pQE30 (Qiagen). M15(pREP4) bacterial cells were transformed with the resulting plasmid, grown, and induced as described above, except that the protein lysate was prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cleared lysate was processed on a nickel column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The human eIF4E cDNA was isolated from human placenta total RNA via polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pBluescript KS+). The coding sequence was inserted into pET8c. BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET8c-eIF4E, and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified by m7GDP-agarose resin as described (40Edery I. Altmann M. Sonenberg N. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 74: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A silver staining procedure (Sigma silver staining kit) was applied to purified His-4EHP and eIF4E to determine their concentrations, as compared with a bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking for 2 h (5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated with either anti-eIF4E antibody 5853 (26Frederickson R.M. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or affinity-purified anti-4EHP peptide antibody for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20.125I-Protein A or anti-rabbit Ig-peroxidase coupled (followed by ECL reaction) were used for detection. Oligonucleotide-directed point mutations were introduced into the 4EHP cDNA using the uracil incorporation method of site-directed mutagenesis (41Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Luciferase RNA supplied by Promega (catalog number L4561) was capped with [α-32P]GTP using vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase, as described (42Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For UV cross-linking, cap-labeled RNA (2 × 104 cpm) was incubated with purified Flag-HMK4EHP or His-4EHP proteins and processed for analysis by SDS-PAGE according to Ref. 42Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. pBlueScript KS(−), digested with BamHI, was used as a template by T7 RNA polymerase. RNA was synthesized in the presence of 0.5 mm m7GpppG (methylated probe) or GpppG (nonmethylated probe) and internally labeled with [α-32P]UTP (50 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol). Probes were spun through a G-25 Sephadex column, phenol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The dried pellets were dissolved in water at 2 × 104 cpm/μl. Recombinant eIF4E (0.5 μg) or His-4EHP (0.5 μg; wild-type or mutant) proteins were incubated with either a methylated or nonmethylated probe (2 × 104cpm) as described in Ref. 43Izaurralde E. Stepinski J. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar. The tetracycline-repressible expression plasmid pBPSTR1 (44Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakfield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to create cell lines stably overexpressing an HA epitope-tagged 4EHP (HA-4EHP). Three hours before transfection, 1 μg/ml tetracycline was added to logarithmically growing NIH 3T3 cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Cells were transfected with pBPSTR1 containing an HA-tagged 4EHP cDNA using LipofectAMINE™ reagent following manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) guidelines. Three hours post-transfection, the cells were washed and placed in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) and tetracycline (1 μg/ml) were added at 30 h post-transfection and for an additional 10 days. Resistant colonies were tested for HA-4EHP expression by Western analysis using the monoclonal anti-HA antibody HA.11 (Babco) at a dilution of 1:1000. A control cell line was derived from transfection with pBPSTR1 alone. Cells stably expressing HA-tagged 4EHP proteins, or mock-transfected cells, were processed for immunofluorescence as described (37Lejbkowicz F. Goyer C. Darveau A. Néron S. Lemieux R. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9612-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), using HA.11 antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. Several models of 4EHP were generated using the MODELER program (45Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), with the alignment shown in Fig. 2. Z scores were calculated for the overall structure and as a function of each amino acid by PROSAII (46Sippl M.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The models with the lowest Z scores were visually inspected for any serious errors. Structures were then displayed and analyzed using the InsightII program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). A human EST derived from a fetal brain library was found to encode an ORF with significant homology to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E. This cDNA is 816 bp long, of which 594 bp encode a potential 198 amino acid polypeptide with 34% identity to the human eIF4E. The rest of the clone is composed of 193 bp of 3′-untranslated region containing a polyadenylation signal followed by a stretch of 29 adenosine residues. As the cloned EST lacked a 5′-untranslated region and an initiator ATG, a human follicular cell cDNA library was screened utilizing the EST DNA as a probe. Screening of 1 × 106 plaques yielded three independent clones with overlapping sequences. The longest, designated as 4EHP (for eIF4E Homologous Protein), was 989 base pairs in length and contained a 245-amino acid ORF encoding a protein with a calculated mass of 28 kDa and pI of 8.9 (Figs.1, A and B). 4EHP is 30% identical and 60% similar to eIF4E at the amino acid level (Fig. 2). A BLAST search (47Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar) detected mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, and plant (several species) 4EHP homologues. The predicted 4EHP polypeptide contains no characterized protein motifs. As the isolated 5′-untranslated region lacks an upstream stop codon, we analyzed whether 4EHP represents a full-length clone. Thus, poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HeLa cells was probed with the 4EHP cDNA. The RNA prepared using the cDNA as template migrates at the same position as the cellular RNA, indicating that p4EHP harbors a cDNA corresponding to the entire 4EHP transcript (Fig. 1 C). The detected HeLa mRNA is not the eIF4E mRNA, as demonstrated by including eIF4E RNA as a control. Various rat tissues, probed with anti-4EHP antibodies, demonstrated the presence of a ubiquitously expressed polypeptide doublet that migrates at 30–32 kDa (data not shown). Translation of 4EHP in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate yielded the same polypeptide doublet (data not shown). To determine the concentration of 4EHP relative to eIF4E, a Western blot analysis, using purified recombinant eIF4E or 4EHP as standards (Fig.3, lanes 1–4), was performed in extracts from HeLa and 293 cells (lanes 5–8 and9–12, respectively). There is roughly 5–10 times more eIF4E than 4EHP in both cell types. For example, in HeLa cells (lanes 5–8), there is approximately 50 ng/mg 4EHP and 450 ng/mg eIF4E. 4EHP protein was detected in all rat tissues analyzed, indicating that it is ubiquitously expressed (not shown). To demonstrate the ability of 4EHP to specifically recognize and interact with capped RNA, we used a photochemical cross-linking assay (42Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3222-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Purified Flag-HMK-tagged 4EHP was UV-irradiated in the presence of 32P-cap-labeled luciferase RNA. Cross-linked products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. 4EHP cross-linking was not observed without UV irradiation and was inefficient when a nonmethylated capped RNA was used (Fig.4, compare lanes 1 and2 with lane 3). The cross-linking of 4EHP was only slightly affected by the presence of excess of GpppG (lane 4), but was abolished by excess of m7GpppG (lane 5). The extent of cross-linking was not affected by ATP or Mg2+ (data not shown). The requirements for 4EHP cross-linking are, thus, similar to those reported for eIF4E (48Sonenberg N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1643-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate the specific binding of 4EHP to the cap, two radioactively labeled 58 nucleotides RNAs capped with either m7GpppG or with GpppG were incubated with wild-type 4EHP, and the resulting complexes analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 5; yeast RNA was included in the reactions to minimize nonspecific interactions between the protein and the RNA probe). eIF4E and a mutant 4EHP, WED124–126FAA, in which tryptophan, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid at positions 124–126 were replaced by phenylalanine, alanine, and alanine, respectively (this mutant protein is unable to bind to the cap structure), were included as controls. eIF4E, as shown previously (49Edery I. Chu L.L. Sonenberg N. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), formed a complex with the methylated capped RNA (Fig. 5, lane 2) and to a much lesser extent with the nonmethylated capped RNA (lane 3). Likewise, wild-type 4EHP formed a complex only with the methylated probe (lanes 4 and 5). As expected, no complex was observed with the mutant 4EHP (lanes 6 and 7). In accordance with these results, 4EHP, but not the mutant protein, also bound to a m7GDP-coupled resin (data not shown). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of murine eIF4E, bound to m7GDP, was determined by x-ray crystallography (50Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). eIF4E resembles a cupped hand, consisting of a curved, eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet backed by three α-helices on its convex surface. The m7GDP structure is sandwiched betweenTrp 56 and Trp 102 on the concave surface of eIF4E (for clarity, all eIF4E residues are denoted with italics). In addition, Trp 166 andGlu 103 interact with m7GDP. Sequence alignments demonstrate that these residues are conserved in 4EHP (Fig.2), with the exception of Trp 56, which is replaced by a tyrosine. Homology modeling predicts that the three-dimensional structure of 4EHP is very similar to that of eIF4E. A comparison between the crystal structure of eIF4E m7GDP binding cleft and the predicted structure of the same region in 4EHP is shown in Fig.6. To obtain biochemical support for this three-dimensional model, we generated recombinant 4EHP variants, mutated at Trp124, Glu125, and Trp183, which correspond toTrp 102, Glu 103, andTrp 166 in murine eIF4E, respectively. The cap binding activity of the mutants was then assessed by cross-linking to32P-cap-labeled luciferase RNA. Replacing any of these amino acids with alanine reduced cross-linking to less than 10% of wild-type 4EHP (Fig. 7, comparelane 1 with lanes 2, 4, and 14). In the crystal structure of eIF4E, Asp 104, which is absolutely conserved in all species, does not contact the cap structure. A change at the corresponding position (Asp126to Ala) in 4EHP has only a modest effect on cross-linking (lane 5). eIF4E, from all species so far examined, contains eight tryptophans. Of these, six are conserved in 4EHP, whereas the two remaining are replaced by tyrosine residues in 4EHP (see Fig. 2). We individually replaced the tryptophans in 4EHP that are conserved between 4EHP and eIF4E (Trp63, Trp95, Trp135, and Trp148; see also Fig. 2) with alanine and analyzed the cap binding activity of these mutants by UV cross-linking. With the exception of Trp95 (which possessed 40% of wild-type activity; compare lane 1 with lane 8), mutation of any of the tryptophan residues (63, 135, and 148) abolished cap binding (compare lane 1 with lanes 6, 10, and 12). These findings substantiate the results of the homology modeling, which place Trp63, Trp135, and Trp148 in the hydrophobic core. Trp95, on the other hand, is predicted to lie on the convex dorsal surface of 4EHP. We also substituted the putative cap-binding tryptophans (Trp124 and Trp183) with phenylalanine, which also contains an aromatic ring to determine whether the benzyl ring of phenylalanine could stack with the m7G ring as well as the indol group of tryptophan. Substitution of Trp183 with phenylalanine eliminated cap binding (lane 15), while substitution of Trp124with phenylalanine reduced cross-linking to 13% of control (lane 3). A similar effect was observed when the corresponding amino acids were substituted in yeast eIF4E (51Altmann M. Edery I. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the nature of the aromatic ring of the carboxyl-distal aromatic amino acid is more important than the amino-proximal amino acid. Individual Trp to Phe changes of tryptophans located in the hydrophobic core (Trp63, Trp135, and Trp148;lanes 7, 11, and 13, respectively) had predictably less severe effects on cap binding. Antisera raised against 4EHP did not detect endogenous 4EHP by indirect immunofluorescence (data not shown). We, therefore, analyzed the subcellular localization of 4EHP in an NIH 3T3 cell line stably expressing an HA epitope-tagged version of the protein (HA-4EHP). As determined by a quantitative Western analysis, the level of HA-4EHP was twice that of the endogenous 4EHP (data not shown). A monoclonal anti-HA antibody stained HA-4EHP in the cytoplasm, while the fluorescent signal in the nucleus was comparable with that seen in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 8). As controls, we stained both cell lines with antibodies directed against eIF4A (a cytoplasmic translation initiation factor) or Sm (a component of small nuclear RNPs in the nucleus). eIF4A and Sm were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively (data not shown). To corroborate this result we analyzed the biochemical localization of endogenous 4EHP in HeLa cells. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-4EHP antibodies. In accord with the results of the immunofluorescence study, 4EHP was found exclusively in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Biochemical characterization, using cap-analog resin, UV cross-linking, and gel mobility shift assays, demonstrated that, like eIF4E, 4EHP specifically recognizes the cap structure. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of eIF4E, bound to m7GDP, was determined by x-ray crystallography (50Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Burley S. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The alkylated base is held in position by π-π stacking interactions between the indol group of two tryptophans (Trp 56 andTrp 102). Cap binding is enhanced by additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone amino group ofTrp 102 and the side chain ofGlu 103 and by a van der Waals contact between the methyl group of the guanine ring and the side chain of a third tryptophan (Trp 166). The ribose makes an additional van der Waals contact with Trp 56. The two m7GDP phosphate groups are hydrogen-bonded toArg 157 and Lys 162. Alignment of eIF4E and 4EHP shows that all but two of these residues are conserved (Fig. 2). The two residues that differ are Tyr78 and Ile179, which correspond to Trp 56 andLys 162 in murine eIF4E. Tyrosine 78 is a conservative change and is expected to fulfill the same role as that ofTrp 56 in cap binding. However, the Lys to Ile substitution is not conservative, suggesting that a positively charged residue at this position is not essential for cap binding. Not surprisingly, sequence alignments and computer modeling predict that the overall structure of 4EHP, including the cap binding cleft, is very similar to that of eIF4E (Fig. 6). Cap binding analysis of 4EHP mutants of Trp124, Glu125, and Trp183(residues predicted to form contacts with the cap) demonstrated that these amino acids are absolutely required for cap binding. Thus, we conclude that the mechanism of cap recognition is similar for eIF4E and 4EHP. The structure of eIF4E and that predicted for 4EHP differs markedly from that of the vaccinia protein VP39, which also binds specifically to the cap structure (52Hodel A.E. Gershon P.D. Shi X. Quicho F.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 53Hodel A.E. Gershon P.D. Shi X.N. Wang S.M. Quiocho F.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, VP39 also sandwiches the cap structure between two aromatic side chains (phenylalanine and tyrosine) (53Hodel A.E. Gershon P.D. Shi X.N. Wang S.M. Quiocho F.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It seems, therefore, that eIF4E, 4EHP, and VP39 bind the cap in a similar fashion. Given the putative structural similarity with eIF4E and its cytoplasmic localization, it is possible that 4EHP plays a role in translation. We investigated possible interactions of 4EHP with candidate translation factors or inhibitors of translation, such as eIF4G, the 4E-BPs, and the poly(A)-binding protein, by various methods, without success. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that 4EHP interacts weakly with one of these proteins. Cap recognition is also required for several enzymatic activities, such as those performed by 1) 2′-O-methyltransferases to form m7G(5′)pppNmpN (cap I) and m7G(5′)pppNmpNm (cap II) (54Reddy R.

(b) Recombinant 4EHP failed to exhibit methyltransferase or decapping activities. 2E. Rom, unpublished observations. It is possible, however, that 4EHP is involved in recognition of the trimethylguanosine of small nuclear RNAs for import into the nucleus. A 4EHP homologue does not exist in yeast. Although it is clear that in higher eukaryotes the small nuclear RNAs exit the nucleus and become hypermethylated in the cytoplasm (61Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1986; 46: 905-911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), it is not known whether this process occurs in yeast.

A genetic system for examining the steps between phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and its transport to and decarboxylation by PtdSer decarboxylase 2 in the Golgi/vacuole has been developed. We have isolated a mutant, denoted pstB1, that accumulates PtdSer and has diminished phosphatidylethanolamine formation despite normal PtdSer decarboxylase 2 activity. The lesion in PtdSer metabolism is consistent with a defect in interorganelle lipid transport. A genomic DNA clone that complements the mutation was isolated, and sequencing revealed that the clone contains the STT4 gene, encoding a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. The pstB1 mutant exhibits a defect in Stt4p-type phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity, and direct gene replacement indicates that STT4 is the defective gene in the mutant. Creation of an STT4 null allele (stt4Δ::HIS3) demonstrates the gene is essential.

Intracellular transport of membrane proteins and lipids, is vital for cell growth and organelle assembly. Knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of intracellular protein transport has increased considerably in recent years, with the identification of numerous proteins involved in protein secretion and sorting to various intracellular membranes (1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 2Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In contrast, our understanding of lipid transport processes in organelle assembly is largely incomplete with respect to the specific mechanisms, genes, and proteins that participate (3Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 391-423Google Scholar). A large body of biochemical studies has led to the proposal of several potential mechanisms that mediate intracellular lipid transport including passive diffusion, lipid transfer proteins, membrane apposition, and vesicle budding and fusion (4Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Several lipid transfer proteins have been identified, and their genes and cDNAs cloned, but their importance to general intracellular lipid transport remains unclear (3Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 391-423Google Scholar). Our approach to understanding the molecular nature of intracellular lipid transport has been to focus upon the specific transport events involved in de novo aminophospholipid biosynthesis using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). An outline of our approach and the relevant metabolic and topologic events are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of exogenous ethanolamine and choline, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; PI-4-K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; PtdIns-4-P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PSD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; PI-4-K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; PtdIns-4-P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PSD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.is synthesized by the action of phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) in membranes that are part of or closely related to the endoplasmic reticulum (6Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Following synthesis, PtdSer is transported to the location of PtdSer decarboxylase 1 (PSD1) at the inner mitochondrial membrane, or PtdSer decarboxylase 2 (PSD2) in membranes with characteristics of Golgi and vacuoles, where phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) is formed (7Kuchler K. Daum G. Paltauf F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 901-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The resultant PtdEtn is then transported back to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is methylated to produce phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), which is essential for yeast cell growth (9Atkinson K.D. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously cloned and created null alleles for thePSD1 and PSD2 genes (8Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24580-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for our development of a strategy for the isolation of aminophospholipid transport mutants in yeast (Fig. 1). We reason that when cells harboring a null allele for PSD1(psd1Δ::TRP1) are grown in the absence of ethanolamine or choline, they must transport nascent PtdSer to the locus of PSD2 (Golgi/vacuole) for PtdEtn synthesis. Conversely, cells with a null allele for PSD2(psd2Δ::HIS3) must transport nascent PtdSer to the locus of PSD1 (mitochondrion) for PtdEtn synthesis. In both of the above described genetic backgrounds the PtdEtn formed must be transported from either the Golgi/vacuole or mitochondria back to the endoplasmic reticulum for the synthesis of PtdCho (by PtdEtn methyltransferases), which is required for cell growth and division (9Atkinson K.D. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the above routes for synthesizing PtdEtn and PtdCho, yeast can synthesize these lipids from free ethanolamine or choline (5Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). Previous studies with mutants in PSS or bothPSD1 and PSD2 clearly demonstrate that choline and ethanolamine can rescue strains unable to synthesize (and thus transport) PtdSer and PtdEtn (8Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Atkinson K.D. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mutagenesis of yeast with apsd1Δ::TRP1 orpsd2Δ::HIS3 background followed by selection for Etn auxotrophs provides the means to isolate new strains with defects in PtdSer and PtdEtn transport. We propose to name mutant strains with defects in PtdSer transport to andPtdEtn export from the mitochondria as pstA and pexA. Likewise, mutant strains with defects in PtdSer transport to andPtdEtn export from the Golgi/vacuole are named pstB and pexB. The goals of the present study were as follows: 1) to develop and carry out a lipid transport mutant selection and initial complementation analysis; 2) to characterize one of the putative lipid transport mutants; and 3) to isolate a gene capable of complementing this phenotypic defect. The results indicate that this selection strategy will, indeed, lead to the identification of strains defective in new aspects of aminophospholipid metabolism. The first of these mutants, denoted pstB1, exhibits a defect in the transport-dependent metabolism of PtdSer at the location of PSD2 in the Golgi/vacuole compartment. A complementing clone containing the STT4 gene, which encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (12Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was isolated, and the pstB1 mutant demonstrated a defect in Stt4p-type PI-4-K activity. These results provide clear evidence for involvement of phosphoinositides in the regulation of intracellular aminophospholipid metabolism that is coupled to interorganelle transport. All simple salts, buffers, amino acids, nutritional supplements, and solvents were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher.

The radiochemicals [3-3H]serine, [1-14C]serine, and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or ICN. The Ptd [1′-14C]serine was synthesized from dl-[1-14C]serine and CDP-diacylglycerol by the action of PtdSer synthase (13Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

For the protein assays, BCA reagents were purchased from Pierce. Yeast were cultured in synthetic or YPD media prepared by standard methods (14Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Adenine (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter), and ethanolamine (2–5 mm) were routinely added to the YPD to give YPDAUE, and ethanolamine and choline supplemented synthetic media were prepared as described previously (15Trotter P.J.

The original pstB1 mutant (PTY13-E5;MATa lys2 his leu2 trp1 psd1-Δ1::TRP1 pstB1) was obtained from the same mutagenesis of the parental strain PTY13 and isolation of ethanolamine auxotrophs as described previously forpsd2 mutants (15Trotter P.J.

The pGEM4Z vector was from Promega, and the pUC18 containing the HIS3 was generously provided by Dr. Rodney Rothstein (Columbia University, NY). All primers were synthesized by the Molecular Resources Center at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center (Denver, CO). PSD activity was assayed with Ptd[1′-14C]Ser as the substrate using a14CO2 trapping on 2M KOH-impregnated filter paper (8Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Kanfer J.N. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1720-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to log phase, harvested, and washed. Cell pellets were resuspended at 0.1 g wet weight/ml in PSD homogenate buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm KPO4 at pH 6.8, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Homogenates were prepared by agitating the cell suspension at 4 °C with 0.5-mm glass beads in a Biospec Mini-Beadbeater (Bartlesville, OK). Separation of the beads from the homogenate was achieved by centrifuging the homogenate through a hole punctured with a 27-gauge needle at the bottom of a microcentrifuge tube. The 400-μl reactions contained 50–150 μg of homogenate protein, 1 mg/ml Triton X-100, 25 mmKH2PO4 at pH 6.8, 0.125 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Ptd[1′-14C]Ser (~0.1–0.2 μCi/μmol). After 45 min at 36 °C the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.5 nH2SO4. The filter containing14CO2 was then placed in 0.5 ml of H2O plus 4.5 ml of ScintiSafe Plus (Fisher) liquid scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was quantified using a Beckman LS-6500 liquid scintillation spectrometer. When only PSD2 activity was measured, the assay differed by containing 4–10 μg of homogenate protein, no Triton X-100, and 1-acyl, 2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-aminocaproyl-Ptd [1′14C]serine (3 × 104 cpm assay, 50 μCi/μmol) as the substrate (15Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PSD activity is reported as nanomoles of PtdSer decarboxylated per mg of protein/45 min. PSS activity was determined by monitoring the incorporation of [3H]serine into lipid-soluble products (17Carman G. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cell homogenates were prepared as described above. Reactions (100 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 0.6 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm CDP-diacylglycerol, 4 mm Triton X-100, 0.5 mml-[3-3H]serine at a specific activity of 10,000 cpm/nmol, and 50–200 μg of homogenate protein. Samples were incubated 20 min at 30 or 36 °C, after which the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol. The lipid-soluble products were then extracted by adding 1 ml of chloroform and 1.5 ml of 1 m MgCl2, mixing, and separating the phases by centrifugation. The lower chloroform phase was then washed once with acidic synthetic upper (1 nHCl:methanol, 9:10 v/v saturated with chloroform). A sample of the resulting chloroform phase was then removed to a scintillation vial, dried under nitrogen, and radioactivity determined as described above. Data are expressed as nanomoles of [3H]serine incorporated into lipid-soluble products/mg of protein/20 min. Radiolabeled [3H]serine incorporation into phospholipids was determined in strains grown in synthetic medium containing 2 mm each of ethanolamine and choline. Initially, cultures were grown to late log phase at 30 °C in minimal medium containing auxotrophic requirements plus ethanolamine and choline. Then, the cells were diluted to approximately 2 × 106 ml in the same media with the addition of 20 μCi/mll-[3-3H]serine. Cells (1 ml) were harvested after 6 h of log phase growth at 30 °C and combined with 10 mg of carrier cells on ice. Pellets were washed twice with 0 °C water, and the lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described previously (10Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity associated with the different lipid classes was determined by thin layer chromatography (8Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and liquid scintillation spectrometry as described above. The PSTB1 gene was isolated by complementation of the ethanolamine auxotrophy of the PTY47 strain described above. DNA from a yeast genomic library, in the vector YCp50-URA3, was transformed into cells using the YEASTMAKER transformation system available from CLONTECH. Cells harboring plasmids were first selected by growth on synthetic medium lacking uracil. The >10,000 transformants were then screened for ethanolamine prototrophic colonies. The complementing plasmid was recovered from the yeast and amplified in Escherichia colias described previously (18Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The plasmid isolated from the E. coli was then re-transformed into the PTY47 mutant to confirm its complementing activity. Plasmid loss experiments were carried out by growing the plasmid-containing strain under non-selective conditions for greater than 30 generations and monitoring the coincidence of loss of uracil and ethanolamine prototrophy. Sequencing was performed utilizing the ABI Prism Ready Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit. Cycle sequencing products were purified from unincorporated dyes using Centricep Spin Columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). These products were then analyzed at the National Jewish Center Molecular Resource Center on an ABI 377 automated sequencer. The complementing plasmid originally isolated (YCp50-pstB20) contained an insert of 10 kb. Deletion of a 4-kb HindIII fragment at one end of the insert abolished complementing activity, indicating that the HindIII site in the insert was within the gene of interest. The YCp50-pstB20from which the HindIII fragment had been deleted (YCp50-pstB20-ΔHindIII) was sequenced from the insertHindIII site into the gene using the M13 forward primer. Alternatively, the HindIII fragment was cloned into the pCRII vector and sequence obtained with the T7 primer. Sequence analysis of PSTB1 across the missing XbaI restriction site was carried out utilizing the YCp50-pstB20-ΔHindIII plasmid and an 18-base pair primer corresponding to base pairs 4668 to 4651 of the publishedSTT4 sequence (5′-TACGGTCAATGAAGCAGC-3′). Sequence data obtained were analyzed using the MacVector sequence analysis program and BLAST comparison (19Attschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70539) Google Scholar) to internet sequence data bases. ThepstB20 insert was subcloned into the multiple copy yeast vector YEp352 between the PvuI and SphI sites. PI-4-K activity was determined using a protocol based on that reported by Yoshida et al. (12Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight in rich medium to a density of 1–2 × 106/ml, washed, and resuspended at 100 mg wet weight per ml in a homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin. Homogenates were prepared as described above, and cell-free supernatants were obtained by centrifuging at 1500 × g for 5 min and retaining the supernatant. The 50-μl reactions were performed with between 1 and 7 μg of cell-free supernatants protein in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.4 mmphosphatidylinositol, and 0.16 mm phosphatidylserine. Reactions were started by adding [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/reaction) to a final concentration of 10 μm, incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and terminated by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl. After mixing and centrifuging, the upper phase was removed. The lower phase was washed twice with acidic synthetic upper phase (1n HCl:methanol, 9:10 v/v saturated with chloroform). The resultant lower phase was then removed and split in two. One-half was transferred into a scintillation vial, dried under nitrogen, redissolved in scintillation mixture, and total radioactivity quantified as above. The other half of the sample was analyzed by thin layer chromatography.32P-Labeled lipids (primarily PtdIns-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), and PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2)) were then separated on Silica gel 60 plates treated withtrans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and developed in a solvent system containing 100 ml of methanol, 80 ml of chloroform, 60 ml of pyridine, 60 ml of H2O, 4 ml of 90% formic acid, 16 g of boric acid, 0.5 g of 2,6-di-tert-4-methylphenol, and 100 μl of ethoxyquin as described by Walsh et al. (20Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternatively, despite the inability to separate PtdIns4P from PtdIns3P, comparable PI-4-K activities were obtained using untreated plates and a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (45:35:10) as described by McKenzie and Carman (21McKenzie M.A. Carman G.M. J. Food Biochem. 1982; 6: 77-86Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled lipids were then detected and quantitatively analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis. The identity of the lipids was determined by comparison with authentic lipid standards and published R f values (20Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Data obtained from the PhosphorImager analysis were used to calculate the percent 32P label incorporated into each of the labeled products, which was used along with the previously determined total 32P label incorporated and the specific activity of the label to determine the picomoles of PtdIns4P produced. Enzyme activities are reported as pmol of PtdIns4P formed per mg of cell protein/h. A 5.0-kb XhoI/SacII fragment was removed from STT4 and replaced with a HIS3 marker gene in three steps. The STT4 gene in YCp 50 was first cleaved by XhoI, BamHI digestion, and aHIS3 gene flanked by XhoI and BamHI was inserted over the deletion. Subsequently, this construct was cleaved with BamHI and SacII to create a larger deletion in the gene that was replaced with an 18-bpBamHI/SacII adaptor. The final deletion construct was excised using EcoRI and SphI cleavage, and this stt4Δ1::HIS3 DNA was ligated into the appropriate sites of pGEM4Z. The chromosomal copy ofSTT4 was disrupted by one-step gene replacement (22Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Thestt4Δ1::HIS3 sequence was linearized withEcoRI and SphI (3.3 kb) or EcoRI andHincII (2.5 kb) and transformed into a diploid strain (SEY diploid) auxotrophic for histidine (his3) using the YEASTMAKER system (CLONTECH). Recombinants were selected by acquisition of histidine prototrophy. The presence of a disrupted chromosomal STT4 gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (23Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar). Primers flanking the deletion/disruption were constructed such that one primer annealed to the 5′ end of the STT4 gene and the other to the complementary strand within the HIS3 marker gene, yielding a 1.0-kb fragment for the wild type allele and a 0.5-kb band for the disrupted/deleted allele. The transforming DNA did not contain the sequence corresponding to the 5′ PCR primer, ensuring that the appropriate PCR products could only be generated after integration into the STT4 locus. Genomic DNA was prepared from strains by standard methods (24Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and the PCR reaction was performed using the GeneAmp PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer in a Perkin-Elmer DNA Thermalcycler. Amplified fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.9-6.15Google Scholar). Direct allelic replacement was also carried out by one-step gene replacement (22Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). For replacement of the stt4 allele, theSTT4 gene was linearized from YCp50-pstB20 (STT4)using PvuI and NdeI, which also cuts the YCp50 vector twice. For the control allele replacement, the PSD1gene was excised from YCp50-PSD1 with HindIII. The linearized DNA was transformed into a pstB1 strain (forSTT4) or a PSD double mutant (for PSD1), and ethanolamine prototrophs were selected. Transformants were routinely screened for uracil prototrophy to check for the presence of any intact vector that may have contaminated the linear DNA preparations. None of the ethanolamine prototrophs were uracil prototrophs. Yeast express two phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) enzymes, PSD1 which resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane (7Kuchler K. Daum G. Paltauf F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 901-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PSD2 which localizes to cellular compartments with characteristics of vacuoles and Golgi (15Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Strains containing a psd1-Δ1::TRP1or the psd2-Δ1::HIS3 null allele are completely dependent upon the remaining PSD activity for growth in the absence of exogenous ethanolamine (or choline) (8Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that strains unable to transport PtdSer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the location of either PSD enzyme or unable to export PtdEtn back to the ER for PtdCho synthesis would also present as ethanolamine auxotrophs (Fig. 1). Strains containing either the psd1-Δ1::TRP1 or thepsd2-Δ1::HIS3 null alleles were subjected to mutagenesis, and ethanolamine auxotrophic strains were isolated. Since defects in the remaining PSD or PSS would also result in ethanolamine auxotrophy, all mutants were assayed for these activities. Those mutants exhibiting no enzyme defects in PSD or PSS are provisionally classified as having a defect in PtdSertransport (denoted pst) to orPtdEtn export (denotedpex) from the location of the PSD enzyme. Mutants with potential defects in transport to or export from PSD1 in the mitochondria (PSD1, psd2-Δ1::HIS3) are referred to as pstA and pexA, respectively. Likewise, those with potential defects in transport to or export from the Golgi/vacuole are referred to as pstB and pexB. Incorporation of [3H]serine into the aminophospholipids is utilized to classify mutants as pst or pex: the former exhibiting accumulation of label in PtdSer due to impaired transport to PSD, and the latter showing accumulation of label in PtdEtn due to a defect in export of PtdEtn to the ER for methylation to PtdCho (data not shown). Examination of the pstB/pexB group has yielded 19 complementation groups. Results with thepstA/pexA group are incomplete. This report will focus on a mutant designated pstB1. The first screening of approximately 10,000 colonies for ethanolamine auxotrophs in a strain carrying thepsd1-Δ1::TRP1 null allele (PTY13) yielded 12 ethanolamine auxotrophic strains, of which four werepsd2 − mutants (15Trotter P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2316483644,"Our previous studies demonstrated that the promyelocytic leukemia gene, PML which involved in the 15;17 translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a growth and transformation suppressor. In this study, recombinant PML adenovirus, Ad-PML was constructed and used to infect human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, the anti-oncogenic function of PML and its mechanism of growth suppressing effect in breast cancer cells were examined. We showed that Ad-PML effectively infected the MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells. A high level of PML protein was expressed within 24 h post-infection and a detectable level remained at day 16. Ad-PML significantly suppressed the growth rate, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. Intratumoral injections of MCF-7-induced tumors by high titer Ad-PML suppressed tumor growth in nude mice by about 80%. The injection sites expressed high level of PML and associated with a massive apoptotic cell death. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of PML's growth suppressing function, we examined the effect of Ad-PML on cell cycle distribution in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells. We found that Ad-PML infection caused a cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. We further showed that G1 arrest of MCF-7 cells is associated with a significant decrease in cyclin D1 and CDK2. An increased expression of p53, p21 and cyclin E was found. The Rb protein became predominantly hypophosphorylated 48 h post-infection. These findings indicate that PML exerts its growth suppressing effects by modulating several key G1 regulatory proteins. Our study provides important insight into the mechanism of tumor suppressing function of PML and suggests a potential application of Ad-PML in human cancer gene therapy."

Calpain activity was stimulated in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Calpain-mediated proteolysis of the membrane-permeable fluorescent substrateN-succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-valyl-l-tyrosine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, as well as the endogenous protein substrates microtubule-associated protein 2, tau and spectrin, was measured. Oxidative stress, induced by addition of either doxorubicin or 2-mercaptopyridineN-oxide, resulted in a significant decrease in the extent of ionophore-stimulated calpain activity of both the fluorescent compound and the endogenous substrates compared with control, normoxic conditions. Addition of glutathione ethyl ester, as well as other antioxidants, resulted in the retention/recovery of calpain activity, indicating that oxidation-induced calpain inactivation was preventable/reversible. The rate of autolytic conversion of the large subunit of calpain I from 80 to 78 to 76 kDa was decreased during oxidative stress; however, the extent of calpain autolysis was not altered. These data indicate that oxidative stress may reversibly inactivate calpain I in vivo.

Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19476-19482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although homologous, calpains I and II require different concentrations of calcium for activity in vitro. Calpain II requires 200–1000 μm calcium (15Cong J. Goll D.E. Peterson A.M. Kapprell H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10096-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calpain I requires 3–50 μm calcium (15Cong J. Goll D.E. Peterson A.M. Kapprell H.-P. J. Biol.

Although such high calcium concentrations have been demonstrated in the presynaptic terminals of neurons (16Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B.

The focus of this study was calpain I because it is present in neurons and has been postulated to play a role in neuronal death associated with ischemia (7Neumar R.W. Hagle S.M. DeGracia D.J.

Sci. 1994; 747: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Calpain I is a heterodimer composed of a unique 80-kDa catalytic subunit and a 30-kDa, regulatory subunit common to both calpain I and II. Calpain undergoes calcium-dependent autolysis, a multi-step, self-proteolytic event that removes a number of amino acids from the N terminus of each subunit resulting in increased proteolytic activity and increased sensitivity to calcium (23Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Taylor R.G. Zalewska T. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Autolysis results in the conversion of the 80-kDa subunit to a 76-kDa form through a 78-kDa intermediate (24Zimmerman U.-J.P. Schlaeper W.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) which occurs prior to the conversion of the 30-kDa subunit regulatory to 18 kDa (25Dayton W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although still controversial, there is substantial evidence to indicate that non-autolyzed form of calpain I is active under physiological conditions (10Bartus R.T. Elliott P.J. Hayward N.J. Dean R.L. Harbeson S. Straub J.A. Li Z. Powers J.C. Neurol. Res. 1995; 17: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The disparate findings concerning the proteolytic activity of the native 80-kDa form of calpain I may be due to the process of autolysis being modulated by more than calcium concentration alone (e.g. the presence of phospholipids, calpastatin, or other unknown factors) (23Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Taylor R.G. Zalewska T. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is also unclear as to the specific role of the 30-kDa non-catalytic subunit in modulating calpain autolysis (27Cottin P. Poussard S. Desmazes J.P. Georgescauld D. Ducastaing A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Ito H. Tsuchiya T. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Calpain activity can be modulated by redox state, characterized by decreased activity, in vitro, in the presence of oxidant (2Guttmann R.P. Elce J.S. Bell P.D. Isbell J.C. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2005-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The reason for this is likely due to the mechanism by which calpain I hydrolyzes a peptide bond. For proteolysis to proceed, a transfer of electrons between the specific cysteine, histidine, and arginine residues within the catalytic triad of the active site (29Mehdi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 150-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) must occur. This requires that these amino acid residues be maintained in a properly charged state that can be modulated by their local microenvironment. Of the amino acids in the catalytic triad, it is the cysteine residue that is the most susceptible to oxidative inactivation (30Neumann N.P. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and is therefore likely to play a significant role in decreased calpain I activity upon exposure to an oxidizing environment. The effects of an oxidizing environment on calpain I activity are important to understand because oxidative stress has been linked to pathological states in which calpain I has been suggested to play a role, including Alzheimer's disease (31Choi B.H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Benzi G. Moretti A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and ischemia (33Bartus R.T. Baker K.L. Heiser A.D. Sawyer S.D. Dean R.L. Elliott P.J. Straub J.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1994; 14: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar). In the present study, both calpain I autolysis and proteolytic activity were examined in situ, under control and oxidatively stressed conditions. These results indicate that calpain I activity stimulated by increasing intracellular calcium can be inhibited by oxidizing conditions. Additionally, oxidative inactivation was prevented by incubation with membrane-permeable antioxidants. Finally, oxidative stress decreased the rate of autolytic conversion of calpain I from 80 to 78 to 76 kDa, but the extent was unaffected.

Fura-2 was from Teflabs, and the fluorescent peptideN-succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-valyl-l-tyrosine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) was from Bachem. Trolox was from Merck. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and pepstatin were from Boehringer Mannheim. Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CMK (caspase inhibitor 2), CBZ-Phe-Gly-NHO-Bz, and CBZ-Phe-Gly-NHO-Bz-pOMe were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of the highest grade possible. All calpain assays were carried out at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were plated on 60-mm Corning/Costar dishes and differentiated with 20 μm retinoic acid for 6–8 days in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal clone II, 1 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were at approximately 70–80% confluence in a monolayer at the time of experimentation. Free calcium concentrations were determined using cells attached to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Corning) with the calcium indicator dye, fura-2. Prior to experimentation, cells were loaded with 5 μmacetoxymethyl ester form of fura-2. Coverslips were placed in an imaging chamber (Warner Instrument Co.) and mounted in a heater platform on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a Ringer solution for the duration of the experiments. Fura-2 was excited at alternating wavelengths of 340- and 380-nm using a 75-watt xenon light source and a filter wheel (Ionoptix system, Ionoptix Corp., Milton, MA). Emitted wavelengths passed through a 510-nm filter cube set before detection by an enhanced CCD camera. Data were stored and processed using IonWizard software. Calibration of fura-2 fluorescence was performed per standard protocols where the ratio (R) of emitted signals at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths provided an index of calcium concentration, which was estimated according to the equation: [Ca2+]free = K d ·S f/S b· (R/R min)/(R max/R), where K d is the effective dissociation constant of fura-2, R min and R max are the 340- to 380-nm ratios, and S f andS b are fluorescence values in the absence and presence of saturating calcium, respectively (35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TheK d value of fura-2 for calcium was estimated to be 240 nm (35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calpain activity was measured by immunoblot analysis of endogenous substrates or proteolytic cleavage of the fluorescent calpain substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC under control and oxidizing conditions. To oxidatively stress the cells, doxorubicin was added to a final concentration of 5 μm for 24 h before ionomycin treatment (36Sarvzyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271 (79–H2O85): H2OCrossref Google Scholar), while FF1 was used at 1 mm immediately prior to ionomycin addition. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic, has been shown to generate superoxide radicals through redox autoxidation of the quinone group that acts on the mitochondrion (37Goodman J. Hochstein P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Production of free radicals by FF1 occurs, in the presence of UV light, resulting from photodecomposition of the compound that generates hydroxyl radicals (38Epe B. Ballmaier D. Adam W. Grimm G.N. Saha-Moller C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The antioxidants GSH (5 mm), Trolox (100 μm), or propyl gallate (5 μm) were added at the same time as oxidant (either 24 h or immediately prior to ionomycin treatment). After 24 h, cells were rinsed once in serum-free RPMI 1640 media containing the appropriate treatment to maintain experimental conditions, and then 3 ml of serum-free media were added, also containing the treatment compounds. Cells were treated with 2 μm ionomycin for the times indicated, rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and collected in 2× Laemmli stop buffer without dye. Samples were immediately heated to 100 °C for 10 min, sonicated, and protein concentrations determined by the Lowry method, after acid precipitation of the protein. Bromphenol blue was added to the samples, and 10 or 20 μg of total protein were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–12.5% for MAP-2 and 6.5% for calpain I, 10% for tau, 8% for calpastatin, and 5% spectrin), transferred to nitrocellulose (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After incubation with the primary antibody, the blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per manufacturer's instructions. The resulting immunoblots were quantitated using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer (model GS-670). Data were evaluated using analysis of variance, and values were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. In the case of experiments utilizing the fluorescence compound, SH-SY5Y cells were similarly prepared and treated on 24-well Corning/Costar plates. Prior to addition of ionomycin, cells were loaded with 80 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC (42Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G744-G751PubMed Google Scholar) for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Proteolysis of the fluorescent probe was monitored using a fluorescent plate reading system (Bio-Tek FL500) with filter settings of 360 ± 20 nm for excitation and 470 ± 20 nm for emission. Fluorescent readings were made every 20 min for up to 1 h. Cells were replaced in the incubator between readings to maintain both temperature and pH for optimal cell viability. The hydrogen peroxide-sensitive fluorescent compound DCFH2-DA was used to indicate levels of oxidative stress induced by either doxorubicin or FF1. DCFH2-DA is a well established indicator of intracellular hydrogen peroxide formation which, after intracellular deacylation, remains non-fluorescent but is transformed into the fluorescent form (dichlorofluorescein, DCF) via oxidation (43Rosenkranz A.R. Schmaldienst S. Stuhlmeier K.M. Chen W. Knapp W. Zlabinger G.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 156: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with DCFH2-DA 10 min after the addition of ionomycin for all treatment conditions. Fluorescent readings were then taken every 20 min for up to 60 min. Fluorescence was detected with the FL500 (Bio-Tek) fluorescence plate reader with filter wheels set at 485 ± 20 nm and 530 ± 25 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The release of the intracellular enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, into the media was used as a quantitative measure of cell viability. Adherent SH-SY5Y cells on 24-well Corning/Costar dishes were differentiated, rinsed, treated, and stimulated with ionomycin as described above. The measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release was performed as described previously (44Davis P.K. Dudek S.M. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To estimate the relative amount of free radical production in response to doxorubicin or FF1, the formation of the fluorescent oxidized product, DCF from DCFH2-DA, was measured (Fig. 1). Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with FF1 resulted in a significant increase in peroxide production as indicated by an increase in DCF production. Although doxorubicin has been clearly demonstrated to be a potent inducer of oxidative stress (45MacIntosh L.J. Sapolosky R.M. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 141: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), treatment with doxorubicin did not significantly increase DCF production. This is probably due to the fact that DCFH2-DA is a selective indicator of hydrogen peroxide formation (46Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 47Zhu H. Bannenberg G.L. Moldeus P. Shertzer H.G. Arch. Toxicol. 1994; 68: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and does not react well with superoxide anions which are the predominant free radical generated in response to doxorubicin treatment (37Goodman J. Hochstein P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 46Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). When the antioxidants propyl gallate, Trolox, or GSH were included with either FF1 or doxorubicin, a significant decrease in DCF production was observed. Antioxidants alone also significantly reduced the hydrogen peroxide concentration to below the level observed in control cells. The fluorescent calpain-selective substrate peptide Suc-LLVY-AMC (42Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G744-G751PubMed Google Scholar) was used to measure calpain activity in SH-SY5Y cells. As in studies by other investigators (48Kavita U. Mizel S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27758-27765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49Norris F.A. Atkins R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Cells were treated with 2 μm ionomycin, and the increase in fluorescence measured at 20-min intervals for up to 60 min. Ionomycin increased the intracellular calcium concentration from the 50–80 nm basal concentration to 700–800 nm. Maximal calcium concentration was reached after 8–9 min of exposure and remained elevated for the duration of the experiments (data not shown). Cells remained adherent over the time course, with no loss of viability as indicated by lack of increase in lactate dehydrogenase release (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the increase in Suc-LLVY-AMC degradation, indicated by increased fluorescence, in response to the various treatments relative to conditions in the presence of ionophore alone (control) after 40 min. Proteolysis of the fluorescent substrate was significantly inhibited by the presence of either doxorubicin or FF1 to approximately 35% of ionomycin treatment alone. When cells were treated with FF1 in the presence of GSH, all oxidant-induced inhibition of calpain activity was prevented. GSH also significantly ameliorated the inhibition of calpain activity in response to doxorubicin. In addition, Trolox or propyl gallate significantly reduced the extent of calpain inactivation by the oxidants but to lesser extent than GSH. GSH treatment significantly increased ionomycin-stimulated calpain proteolysis of the fluorescent probe compared with ionomycin treatment under normoxic conditions. Because the fluorescent probe Suc-LLVY-AMC is selective but not totally specific for calpain-mediated proteolysis (2Guttmann R.P. Elce J.S. Bell P.D. Isbell J.C. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol.

Res. 1993; 18: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to determine the amount of Suc-LLVY-AMC proteolysis which is not calpain-dependent. Addition of either 25 μmZ-LLY-CHN2 (Fig. 2) or 20 μm calpain inhibitor I (data not shown) inhibited ionomycin-stimulated proteolysis of the fluorescent compound by greater than 90%, suggesting that the majority of the increase in fluorescence in response to ionomycin is due to calpain. Because these two inhibitors may also inhibit cathepsin L (55Crawford C. Mason R.W. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 56Anagli J. Hagmann J. Shaw E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), additional experiments were carried out to eliminate the possibility that cathepsin L was contributing to proteolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC. Inhibition of cathepsin L activity with either of the cathepsin L-specific inhibitors CBZ-Phe-Gly-NHO-Bz (20 μm) or CBZ-Phe-Gly-NHO-Bz-pOMe (20 μm) (57Demuth H.U. Schierhorn A. Bryan P. Hofke R. Kirschke H. Bromme D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1295: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) resulted in no decrease in ionophore-stimulated proteolysis of the fluorescent compound. In addition, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with other non-calpain inhibitors (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), or Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CMK (caspase inhibitor 2, 1 μg/ml)) also did not result in inhibition of ionomycin-stimulated proteolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC (data not shown), further suggesting that the observed proteolytic activity is due to calpain activation. The effects of oxidative stress on the proteolysis MAP-2 by calpain were examined. MAP-2 has been identified previously both in vitro (58Johnson G.V.W. Litersky J.M. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and in situ (8Blomgren K. Kawashima S. Saido T.C. Karlsson J.O. Elmered A. Hagberg H. Brain Res. 1995; 684: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as a highly sensitive calpain substrate. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 2 μm ionomycin for 10 min, and the extent of MAP-2 degradation was quantitated by immunoblot analysis. Fig.3 shows a representative immunoblot and quantitative analysis of ionophore-stimulated MAP-2 degradation. The presence of either doxorubicin or FF1 resulted in significant reduction in MAP-2 degradation, similar to the inhibition observed with the fluorescent compound (Fig. 2). Also, in good agreement with the fluorescent data was the finding that oxidation-induced inhibition of MAP-2 degradation was prevented by addition of the antioxidant GSH. GSH treatment alone of ionomycin-stimulated cells, however, had no significant effect on MAP-2 proteolysis compared with ionomycin treatment under normoxic conditions (Fig. 3). The second endogenous substrate that was studied was the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau has been demonstrated to be an excellent substrate of calpain both in vitro (59Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Binder L.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1505-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 60Mercken M. Grynspan F. Nixon R.A.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a representative immunoblot and quantitative analysis of tau degradation after the cells were treated for 15 min with ionomycin. Consistent with the previous findings, calpain degradation of tau was significantly inhibited by oxidative stress with both FF1 and doxorubicin. The inhibition of calpain, by either oxidative stress inducer, was similar to that observed with 25 μm Z-LLY-CHN2. The last endogenous substrate studied was spectrin, another well established calpain substrate in vitro (58Johnson G.V.W. Litersky J.M. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1630-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and in vivo (62Bednarski E. Vanderklish P. Gall C. Saido T.C. Bahr B.A. Lynch G.

CD18 is expressed exclusively by leukocytes, and it is transcriptionally regulated during the differentiation of myeloid cells. Theets factors, PU.1 and GABP, bind to three etssites in the CD18 promoter, which are essential for high level myeloid expression of CD18. We now identify two binding sites for the transcription factor, Sp1, that flank these ets sites. Sp1 is the only factor from myeloid cells that binds to these sites in a sequence-specific manner. Mutagenesis of these sites abrogates Sp1 binding and significantly reduces the activity of the transfected CD18 promoter in myeloid cells. Transfection of Sp1 intoDrosophila Schneider cells, which otherwise lack Sp1, activates the CD18 promoter dramatically. GABP also activates the CD18 promoter in Schneider cells. Co-transfection of Sp1 and GABP activates CD18 more than the sum of their individual effects, indicating that these factors cooperate to transcriptionally activate myeloid expression of CD18. These studies support a model of high level, lineage-restricted gene expression mediated by cooperative interactions between widely expressed transcription factors.

These studies support a model of high level, lineage-restricted gene expression mediated by cooperative interactions between widely expressed transcription factors. Monocytes and granulocytes, which are collectively known as myeloid cells, play crucial roles in immune and inflammatory responses. As myeloid cells differentiate from immature bone marrow precursor cells, they express characteristic genes that are required in their roles as immune effector cells. Most genes that are expressed during myeloid differentiation are regulated at the level of transcription (1Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the DNA sequences and transcription factors that control myeloid gene expression has provided important insights into the molecular basis of normal myeloid differentiation.CD18 (β2 leukocyte integrin) is a cell surface adhesion molecule that forms heterodimers with CD11a, CD11b, or CD11c to generate the antigens LFA-1, Mo-1 (Mac-1), and p150/95, respectively. These leukocyte-specific receptors mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and play important roles in immune and inflammatory responses (2Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clinical significance of CD18 is illustrated by leukocyte adhesion deficiency, in which insufficient CD18 causes recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and can lead to premature death (3Springer T.A. Thompson W.S. Miller L.J. Schmalsteig F.C. Anderson D.C. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1901-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).Expression of CD18 is restricted to myeloid cells and lymphocytes. CD18 expression increases significantly during myeloid differentiation due to increased transcription (4Rosmarin A.G. Levy R. Tenen D.G.

The transfected CD18 promoter exhibits the leukocyte-specific and myeloid-inducible activity of the endogenous CD18 gene (10Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D.G. Kirsch D.G. Handa H. Simkevich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23627-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that two ets-related transcription factors, PU.1 and GABP, bind to the CD18 promoter and cooperate to activate leukocyte-specific expression of CD18 (10Rosmarin A.G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Sp1 is a DNA-binding nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional activator (12Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 32: 669-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 13Letovsky J. Dynan W.S.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We now define two functionally important Sp1 binding sites which flank the three ets sites in the CD18 promoter. Although Sp1 is a member of a family of transcription factors that bind to related GC-rich sequences, Sp1 is the only protein from myeloid nuclear extracts that binds to these sites. Mutagenesis of these sites abrogates Sp1 binding and substantially reduces activity of the CD18 promoter in myeloid cells. Transfection of Sp1 into Drosophila Schneider cells, which otherwise lack Sp1, substantially activates the CD18 promoter. GABP also activates the CD18 promoter in Schneider cells. Finally, Sp1 functionally cooperates with GABP to activate the CD18 promoter. Thus, Sp1 is essential for high level myeloid expression of CD18 and it cooperates with the ets factor, GABP, to achieve high level myeloid expression of the CD18 promoter.RESULTSThe leukocyte-specific and myeloid-inducible gene expression of CD18 (β2 leukocyte integrin) requires three essential etssites in the CD18 promoter. The ets transcription factors, PU.1 and GABP, bind to these sites and cooperate to activate the CD18 promoter (10Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D.G. Kirsch D.G. Handa H. Simkevich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23627-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to identify other DNA elements and transcription factors that regulate myeloid expression of CD18, we used PCR-based mutagenesis (17Zaret K.S. Liu J.K. DiPersio C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to prepare a series of scanning mutants of the CD18 promoter (18Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D.G. Simkevich C.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Disruption of the region from −30 to −21 relative to the start site of CD18 transcription, which includes an element that resembles an Sp1 binding site, dramatically reduced CD18 promoter activity (data not shown). We identified a second potential binding site for Sp1 immediately upstream of the crucial etssites in the CD18 promoter. Based on their relative distance from the start site of transcription, we refer to them as the proximal (−26/−16) and distal (−83/−76) Sp1 sites. The locations of these two potential Sp1 sites which flank the three CD18 ets sites are illustrated in Fig. 1 A.Sp1 Binds to the Proximal CD18 PromoterA double-stranded DNA probe that corresponds to −32/+3 of the CD18 promoter, a region that includes the proximal Sp1 site, was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP. EMSA was performed with this probe and purified Sp1 transcription factor. Fig.2 A demonstrates that purified Sp1 bound to this probe as a single species (lane 2;arrow). Binding by Sp1 was abrogated by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous probe (lane 3), but not by the same probe with a 5-nt mutation of the Sp1 site (CGCGC → GAATT at −24/−20; lane 4), or by an irrelevant probe (lane 5, corresponding to a region of the CD18 promoter that lacks an Sp1 binding site). Binding by Sp1 was abrogated and supershifted by anti-Sp1 antiserum (lane 6), but preimmune serum did not disrupt Sp1 binding (lane 7). Sp1 did not bind to a radiolabeled −32/+3 probe with the same 5-nt mutation of the proximal Sp1 site (lane 9). Thus, Sp1 binds to the proximal CD18 promoter site in a sequence-specific manner.U937 myeloid cells express high levels of CD18. We performed EMSA with the radiolabeled −32/+3 probe and a nuclear extract prepared from U937 cells (Fig. 2 B). Several species from U937 cells bound to the proximal Sp1 probe and one prominent species co-migrated with purified Sp1 (compare lane 3 to lane 2;arrow).We examined the specificity of binding of the myeloid nuclear proteins that bound to the −32/+3 probe. Fig. 2 C indicates that binding by the protein species from U937 nuclear extract that co-migrated with Sp1 (lane 2; arrow) was abrogated by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous probe (lane 3), but not by the mutant probe (lane 4) or by irrelevant probe (lane 5). Although other binding species were seen, they represent nonspecific binding species for they were not abrogated by homologous, irrelevant, or mutant probes (lanes 3–5). Anti-Sp1 antiserum abrogated binding by this species and a faint supershifted species appeared (lane 6); preimmune serum also resulted in a low mobility species but did not disrupt binding by Sp1 (lane 7). There was no binding by Sp1 to a radiolabeled −32/+3 probe with a 5-nt mutation of the proximal Sp1 site, even though the other binding species were unaffected by disruption of the Sp1 site (lane 9; arrow). Thus, Sp1 is the only protein from U937 myeloid nuclear extract that binds in a sequence-specific manner to the Sp1 site in the −32/+3 region of the CD18 promoter, and its binding is sequence dependent.Sp1 Binds to a Second, Distal Site in the CD18 PromoterImmediately upstream of the CD18 ets binding sites we identified a second sequence that resembles an Sp1 site (Fig.1 A). We had previously noted that an unidentified species bound to EMSA probes which included this upstream region of the CD18 promoter (10Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D.G. Kirsch D.G. Handa H. Simkevich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23627-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).A double-stranded DNA probe that corresponds to −89/−76 of the CD18 promoter was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP; this probe includes the distal Sp1 site but excludes the adjacent etsbinding sites. Purified Sp1 bound to this probe in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 3, lane 2;arrow), for it is abrogated by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled homologous probe but not by irrelevant probe (comparelane 3 to lane 4). Binding by purified Sp1 was abrogated and supershifted by anti-Sp1 antiserum (lane 5). A species from U937 nuclear extract bound to this probe and co-migrated with purified Sp1 (lane 6). This binding was abrogated by unlabeled homologous probe (lane 7), but not by irrelevant probe (lane 8); two additional nonspecific binding species are also seen. Antiserum to Sp1 abrogated and supershifted this band (lane 9). Mutation of the distal Sp1 site (CA → AT at −81/−80) abrogated binding of both purified Sp1 and Sp1 from U937 (lanes 11 and 12, respectively). Thus, we conclude that purified Sp1 and Sp1 from U937 nuclear extract bind in a sequence-specific manner to both proximal and distal sites in the CD18 promoter.Figure 3Purified Sp1 and Sp1 from U937 nuclei bind to the distal Sp1 site. A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to −89/−76 of the CD18 promoter which contains the distal Sp1 site was radiolabeled with 32P (lanes 1–9). EMSA was performed with 1 footprinting unit of affinity purified Sp1 (lanes 2–5). Binding by Sp1 (lane 2; arrow) was competed by 100-fold molar excess of consensus Sp1 binding site probe (lane 3) but not by nonspecific probe (lane 4). This species was abrogated and supershifted by antiserum to Sp1 (lane 5). A binding species from U937 nuclear extract co-migrated with purified Sp1 (lane 6; arrow), and its binding was competed by 100-fold molar excess of consensus Sp1 binding site probe (lane 7), but not by nonspecific probe (lane 8); this species was abrogated and supershifted by anti-Sp1 antiserum (lane 9). Although two other binding species from U937 nuclear extract were also seen, neither represented specific binding for they were not competed by either probe. A radiolabeled double-stranded probe that incorporates the distal Sp1 site mutation (lanes 10–12) was not bound by either purified Sp1 or Sp1 from U937 nuclear extract (lanes 11 and 12, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutagenesis of Sp1 Sites Significantly Reduces Myeloid Activity of CD18 PromoterWe sought to characterize the functional effect of the Sp1 binding sites in the CD18 promoter. PCR was used to introduce the same mutations that abrogated Sp1 binding into the context of the CD18 promoter. The luciferase reporter gene was linked to the wild-type CD18 (−96) promoter, to promoter constructs that contain individual mutations of the distal Sp1 site and the proximal Sp1 site, and to the CD18 (−96) promoter with mutations in both Sp1 sites.The wild-type and mutant CD18 promoter constructs were transfected into U937 cells and the activity of the mutant constructs is presented relative to that of the wild-type promoter (Fig.4). Disruption of either the proximal or the distal Sp1 site individually significantly reduced promoter activity (20 and 35%, respectively). Disruption of both Sp1 sites reduced CD18 promoter myeloid activity to one-half of the activity of the wild type CD18 (−96) promoter. We conclude that each of the Sp1 sites is required for high level myeloid expression of CD18.Figure 4Mutation of the CD18 Sp1 sites reduces myeloid activity of the CD18 promoter. U937 myeloid cells were transfected with 20 μg of CD18 (−96)/luciferase (wild type promoter), or with CD18 (−96) promoter constructs that include mutations in proximal Sp1 site, distal Sp1 site, or both Sp1 sites, as indicated. Luciferase activity was measured 14 h after transfection and normalized to growth hormone expression directed by the CMV/hGH internal control. Activity is expressed relative to that of the wild type promoter. Data from three independent experiments in duplicate are shown as mean and S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sp1 Activates the CD18 PromoterIn order to characterize the role of Sp1 in activating the CD18 promoter under defined conditions, we transfected CD18 promoter constructs into DrosophilaSchneider cells, which lack endogenous Sp1-like activity. We co-transfected pPac-Sp1 (Sp1 in a Drosophila expression vector) along with wild type and mutant CD18 promoter constructs linked to the luciferase reporter gene.When CD18 (−96)/luciferase, which contains both Sp1 binding sites, was transfected into SL2 cells along with pPac-Sp1, luciferase activity increased more than 20-fold compared with the CD18 reporter in the absence of co-transfected pPac-Sp1 (Fig.5). Thus, Sp1 dramatically activated CD18 expression in the context of a cell which otherwise lacks Sp1 activity. However, mutation of the proximal Sp1 site reduced activation by pPac-Sp1 by approximately one-fourth. Mutation of the distal Sp1 site reduced Sp1 activation of the CD18 promoter by one-half. Disruption of both of the CD18 Sp1 sites reduced promoter activation to only one-third of that of the wild-type promoter. Thus, disruption of both Sp1 sites in the CD18 promoter significantly impaired the ability of co-transfected Sp1 to activate expression. However, activation by pPac-Sp1 was not completely abrogated by these mutations, presumably because the mutations did not completely eliminate all binding by Sp1in vivo. We conclude that each of the Sp1 sites contributes to activation of CD18 transcription by Sp1.Figure 5Sp1 activates the CD18 promoter inDrosophila Schneider cells. Schneider cells, which otherwise lack Sp1, were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of CD18/luciferase wild type or mutant constructs and 2.5 μg of pPac-Sp1 (full-length Sp1 in the pPac expression vector), and luciferase activity was measured 48 h later.

We sought to determine if Sp1 cooperates with GABP to activate the CD18 promoter. We transfected GABPα and GABPβ (in the pPac expression vector) and pPac-Sp1 along with the CD18 (−96) promoter construct into Schneider cells (Fig.6). Although neither GABPα nor GABPβ alone activated the CD18 (−96), transfection of GABPα and GABPβ together activated the promoter 11-fold. Transfection of Sp1 alone activated the CD18 reporter 10-fold. However, transfection of both components of GABP along with Sp1 activated the CD18 promoter 36-fold, an effect that is more than the sum of their individual effects. Thus, we conclude that Sp1 and GABP cooperate to activate the CD18 promoter.Figure 6Sp1 cooperates with GABP to activate the CD18 promoter in Schneider cells. Schneider cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of CD18/luciferase wild type constructs and 2.5 μg of effector molecules pPac-Sp1 and/or pPac-GABPα/pPac-GABPβ, as indicated.

Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously cloned the gene that encodes CD18 (4Rosmarin A.G. Levy R. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and characterized a minimal promoter that directs leukocyte-specific and myeloid-inducible expression (11Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ets transcription factors, PU.1 and GABP, bind to three sites in the CD18 promoter and cooperate to activate CD18 transcription (10Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D.G. Kirsch D.G. Handa H. Simkevich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23627-23633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Rosmarin A.G. Caprio D. Levy R. Simkevich C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We now describe two Sp1 binding sites that are required for high level myeloid expression of CD18. Sp1 is the only protein from myeloid nuclear extracts that binds to these sites in a sequence-specific manner. Sp1 activates the CD18 promoter via these binding sites and cooperates with GABP to achieve high level myeloid gene expression.Sp1 is the founding member of a growing family of proteins with highly homologous zinc finger domains that bind to GC or GT boxes (19Hagen G.

Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Sp1 is an abundant nuclear protein in most cell types, but its level of expression changes during development and varies in different cell types; hematopoietic cells are particularly rich in Sp1 (14Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Although other members of this transcription factor family bind to related DNA sequences, Sp1 is the only protein from myeloid nuclear extracts that binds to the CD18 promoter sites. It has been difficult to define the biological role of Sp1 because of potentially redundant or antagonistic actions of the related family members. However, Sp1 was recently shown to be required for normal embryogenesis because disruption of Sp1 by homologous recombination caused embryonic death. The observation that cell growth was perturbed only after lineage commitment and cellular differentiation suggests that other family members may substitute for Sp1 in early embryogenesis, but Sp1 may be indispensable in more differentiated cells (24Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Sp1 is a phosphorylated and highly glycosylated nuclear protein that contains three Cys-2–His-2 zinc finger motifs (25Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 26Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Sp1 contains glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich domains which are essential for its transcriptional activation (27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Sp1 is involved in synergistic activation and interaction with other transcription factors (28Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Sp1 functionally and physically interacts with other classes of transcription factors including Egr-1 (29Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T.

Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 cooperates with AP-1 to activate the myeloid promoter CD11c (37Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sp1 also directly interacts with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, including TBP (38Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and TAF 110, a TBP accessory factor (39Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when bound to distant sites incis, Sp1 interacts with itself and loops out the intervening DNA (28Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 40Su W. Jackson S. Tjian R. Echols H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The presence of two functionally important Sp1 sites in the CD18 proximal promoter suggests that such a looping interaction might alter the configuration of the CD18 promoter and thereby facilitate its interactions with the ets factors, PU.1 and GABP.Sp1 sites are found in proximity to ets binding sites in numerous promoters and enhancers. An Sp1 element in the immunoglobulin κ3′ enhancer requires PU.1 (41Costa M.W. Atchison M.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8662-8669Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and adjacent Sp1 and etssites contribute to the lymphoid-specific expression of the mouse perforin gene (42Youn B.S. Kim K.K. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3499-3509PubMed Google Scholar). Ets factors enhance Sp1 binding to the αIIb integrin promoter and enhance its transcriptional activation (43Block K.L. Shou Y.P. Poncz M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GABP may cooperate with Sp1 on the promoters of the widely expressed genes, COX IV (44Carter R.S. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FBP (45Sadasivan E. Cedeno M.M. Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4725-4735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there is evidence that Ets-1 and Sp1 physically interact and form a ternary complex on the PTHrP promoter (46Dittmer J. Gégonne A. Gitlin S.D. Ghysdael J. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21428-21434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HTLVI LTR (47Gegonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R.A. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated that Sp1 functionally interacts with GABP, we detected no direct, physical interaction between these proteins in EMSA studies (data not shown).Most myeloid promoters are relatively compact. Typically, 100 nucleotides or fewer are sufficient to direct myeloid expression in transient transfection assays. Sp1 has previously been shown to be functionally important for myeloid promoters such as CD11b (48Chen H.M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CD11c (37Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), CD14 (49Zhang D.E. Hetherington C.J. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3276-3284PubMed Google Scholar), myeloperoxidase (50Piedrafita F.J. Molander R.B. Vansant G. Orlova E.A. Pfahl M. Reynolds W.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Many myeloid promoters lack a classic TATA box and Sp1 sites are often found in the TATA-less promoters of both lineage-restricted and more widely expressed genes. Sp1 may contribute to the regulation of TATA-less genes by its direct interactions with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, such as TBP and TAF110.How might the widely expressed Sp1 transcription factor contribute to lineage specificity and inducibility? Although it is widely expressed, Sp1 contacts the CD11b promoter in myeloid cells but not in nonhematopoietic cells (48Chen H.M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo footprinting indicates that Sp1 does not contact the CD11c promoter in undifferentiated myeloid HL-60 cells which do not express CD11c. However, treatment of HL-60 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which strongly increases CD11c expression, results in direct contact of DNA by Sp1 (37Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although high levels of Sp1 are expressed in hematopoietic cells (14Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. B"
https://openalex.org/W2072417697,"Activation of intact human neutrophils by fMLP stimulates phospholipase D (PLD) by an unknown signaling pathway. The small GTPase, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), and Rho proteins regulate the activity of PLD1 directly. Cell permeabilization with streptolysin O leads to loss of cytosolic proteins including ARF but not Rho proteins from the human neutrophils. PLD activation by fMLP is refractory in these cytosol-depleted cells. Readdition of myr-ARF1 but not non-myr-ARF1 restores fMLP-stimulated PLD activity. C3 toxin, which inactivates Rho proteins, reduces the ARF-reconstituted PLD activity, illustrating that although Rho alone does not stimulate PLD activity, it synergizes with ARF. To identify the signaling pathway to ARF and Rho activation by fMLP, we used pertussis toxin and wortmannin to examine the requirement for heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi family and for phosphoinositide 3-kinase, respectively. PLD activity in both intact cells and the ARF-restored response in cytosol-depleted cells is inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating a requirement for Gi2/Gi3 protein. In contrast, wortmannin inhibited only fMLP-stimulated PLD activity in intact neutrophils, but it has no effect on myr-ARF1-reconstituted activity. fMLP-stimulated translocation of ARF and Rho proteins to membranes is not inhibited by wortmannin. It is concluded that activation of Gi proteins is obligatory for ARF/Rho activation by fMLP, but activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase is not required.

Studies in neutrophils and HL60 cells have identified a requirement for both cytosolic and membrane components for PLD activation when stimulated with the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GTPγS. Through the use of reconstitution studies utilizing HL60 membranes (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) or cytosol-depleted cells (6Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F.

The requirement for Rho in PLD activation was identified separately because RhoGDI, which extracts Rho from membranes, inhibited neutrophil PLD (7Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Although both ARF and Rho alone can stimulate PLD, other cytosolic factors have been shown to augment these responses in human neutrophils. A 50-kDa factor has been shown to act synergistically with both ARF (11Lambeth J.D. Kwak J.-Y. Bowman E.P. Perry D. Uhlinger D.J. Lopez I. J. Biol.

A single PLD that is synergistically responsive to ARF/Rho/protein kinase Cα has been cloned and is now referred to as hPLD1 (10Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S.

The roles of ARF and Rho are well documented with regard to PLD activation by GTPγS, but their roles in G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases are not well defined and may be different for distinct receptors. In the case of platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor, PLD activity is reported to be downstream of phospholipase C activation (18Yeo E.-J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27823-27826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 622-628PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C plays, if any, a minor role. Using Clostridium toxins, Rho proteins have been implicated in the activation of PLD in human embryonic kidney cells overexpressing the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (22Schmidt M. Rumenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and in Rat 1 fibroblasts stimulated with lyso-PA and endothelin (23Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Insulin-mediated PLD activation is dependent on ARF and Rho proteins, and an involvement of PI 3-kinase has been implicated (24Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined the recruitment of ARF and Rho proteins to membranes by fMLP and the ability of these proteins to regulate receptor-controlled PLD in human neutrophils. We had reported previously that fMLP-dependent activation was compromised in differentiated HL60 cells depleted of their cytosolic contents (26Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We report that both ARF and Rho proteins are regulated by the fMLP receptor via a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein. Although activation of PLD in intact neutrophils is inhibited by wortmannin, a relatively selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin treatment is not inhibitory to the fMLP-stimulated recruitment of ARF and Rho to membranes. We conclude that the activation of PLD by the fMLP receptor is dependent on receptor-activated ARF and Rho proteins in human neutrophils coupled via Gi proteins and is not obligatorily dependent on PI 3-kinase activation. Neutrophils were purified from blood from healthy volunteers or isolated from buffy coats that were obtained from the North London Blood Transfusion Center. Recombinant ARF1 and myr-ARF1 proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (6Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Troung O.

Acta. 1984; 795: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 50 ml of anti-coagulated blood or a buffy coat pack was mixed with an equal volume of 2% dextran solution in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, to aggregate erythrocytes. After 20 min at room temperature, the leukocyte-rich upper layer was removed and layered onto 10 ml of Lymphoprep and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min to separate neutrophils from other white cells. Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. Neutrophils were permeabilized for varying lengths of time with 0.4 IU/ml streptolysin O. At the required time points, 1-ml aliquots were removed and centrifuged. The proteins from the supernatants (after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid) and cell pellets were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed for ARF and RhoA proteins by Western blot analysis using appropriate antibodies. Neutrophils were washed twice in HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) and finally resuspended in 1.5 ml. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with [3H]alkyllyso-PC (10 μCi). The cells were harvested by centrifugation to remove unincorporated label, and the cells were washed with either HEPES buffer (for intact cell experiments) or PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 6.8) for permeabilized cell experiments. Neutrophils were suspended in HEPES buffer and pretreated with 5 μmcytochalasin B for 5 min. 50-μl aliquots were transferred to tubes containing 2% EtOH (1% final in the assay) in the presence or absence of fMLP (1 μm final). After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, assays were quenched with 700 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). After phase separation with 350 μl of water, the chloroform phase was recovered. The chloroform phase was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform. Samples were spotted onto Whatman LK6TLC silica plates. The plates were developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (75:45:3:1), dried at room temperature, and the lipid spots localized with iodine vapors. The spots corresponding to PEt and PC were excised after iodine sublimation and put into scintillation vials. The lipids were extracted with 250 μl of methanol and counted for radioactivity after the addition of scintillation fluid. Results are expressed as the percentage of dpm incorporated into PC. Lipid standard containing PA and PEt which was prepared as described previously (29Geny B. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was added for localization of lipids after separation by TLC. Permeabilization of cells to deplete the cytosol and reconstitution of PLD activity were essentially carried out as described previously (6Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Troung O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 30Geny B. Fensome A. Cockcroft S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled neutrophils were permeabilized with streptolysin O (0.4 IU/ml) for 10 min in the presence of 100 nm Ca2+ in 5 ml at 37 °C. The permeabilized cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and resuspended in cold PIPES buffer and aliquoted (50 μl) into tubes kept on ice containing appropriate reagents. The assays were carried out in the presence of 1 mm MgATP, 100 μm GTP (unless indicated otherwise), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μm Ca2+, and 1% EtOH. ARF proteins and fMLP were added as indicated in the individual figure legends. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were quenched as described above. Intact labeled neutrophils were pretreated with 500 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 2 h at 37 °C as described previously (31Cockcroft S. Stutchfield J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells were then processed as required. Cytosol-depleted neutrophils were incubated with 1 μg/ml C3 toxin in the presence of 0.5 mmNAD for 10 min at 37 °C. Intact cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 100 nmwortmannin. 1 ml of intact cells (107 cells/ml) was incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm fMLP for 1 or 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were pretreated with 5 μmcytochalasin B as indicated. At the end of the incubation, the cells were sedimented at 4 °C; resuspended in buffer; and treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a serine protease inhibitor, for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml, and a mixture of protease inhibitors was added (27Whatmore J. Morgan C.P. Cunningham E. Collison K.S. Willison K.R. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the membrane fraction. The membrane fractions were resuspended in sample buffer, boiled, and run on SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride, blots were probed with either anti-ARF or anti-Rho antibodies. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence. For translocation of ARF to membranes in permeabilized cells, 1 ml of cells (107 cells/ml) was incubated with streptolysin O in the presence of 1 mm MgATP, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 μm Ca2+. 100 μm GTP, 1 μm fMLP, or 10 μmGTPγS was present as indicated. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the samples were processed as described above for intact cells. To examine a requirement for ARF proteins in fMLP-stimulated PLD activity, human neutrophils were permeabilized with streptolysin O for 10 min to deplete the cells of their freely diffusable cytosolic proteins. Fig.1 A illustrates that this protocol depletes the majority of the ARF proteins from the permeabilized cells, and they are recovered in the external medium. This loss is coincident with the inability of fMLP to stimulate PLD activity in cytosol-depleted cells (Ref. 26Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B). fMLP regains the ability to stimulate PLD activity provided that myr-ARF1 is also added to the permeabilized cells (Fig. 1 B). It was noted that adding myr-ARF1 alone raised the basal activity of PLD, and this was dependent on the presence of GTP. In the reconstituted assay, the time course of PLD activation by fMLP reached a maximum at 30 min. Fig. 1, C and D, illustrates that reconstitution of PLD activity with myr-ARF1 and fMLP is concentration-dependent. For the remainder of the experiments, fMLP was used at 1 μm, and myr-ARF1 was used at 50 μg/ml. ARF proteins are myristoylated at their NH2 terminus, and this lipid modification is thought to be important for efficient guanine nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the ARF exchange factors (32Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Fales H.M. Ferrige A.G.

Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Both myristoylated (myr-ARF1) and nonmyristoylated (ARF1) ARF proteins were examined for their ability to restore fMLP-dependent PLD activity in cytosol-depleted neutrophils. Fig.2 illustrates that myristoylation is essential for the restoration of fMLP-dependent PLD activity and also for the response observed with GTP alone. Consistent with our own observation (6Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Troung O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and those of others (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 35Massenburg D. Han J. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), myristoylation is not required for GTPγS-dependent stimulation of PLD (Fig. 2). However, a 100-fold higher concentration of nonmyristoylated rARF1 is required for maximal stimulation compared with fully myristoylated ARF1 for GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity (6Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Troung O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Therefore, concentrations of recombinant ARF proteins used to examine the requirement for myristoylation take this into account; for nonmyristoylated ARF, a concentration of 750 μg/ml is used compared with 50 μg/ml for myr-ARF1. (Effective myr-ARF1 used is approximately 5 μg/ml (500 nm) because of the 10% efficiency of myristoylation in E. coli determined by mass spectroscopy analysis.) These concentrations of recombinant myr-ARF1 and non-myr-ARF1 reflect the equivalent loading of GTPγS when measuredin vitro. Fig. 2 also illustrates that the level of PLD stimulated by these proteins is similar in magnitude when GTPγS is the activator. The fMLP receptor is coupled to the pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins, Gi2 and Gi3 (36Gierschik P. Sidiropoulos D. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and βγ subunits are the direct regulators of phospholipase Cβ2 and PI 3-kinase (γ isoform) (37Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 38Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf S. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether activation of the PLD activity by the fMLP receptor in the reconstituted assay also requires a prior activation of Gi proteins, we examined the influence of pertussis toxin pretreatment. Initially we confirmed that, as reported previously (39Pai J.-K. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12472-12477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Xie M. Jacobs L.S. Dubyak G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), pertussis toxin pretreatment led to inhibition of the fMLP-stimulated PLD activity in intact cells (Fig. 3 A). Pertussis toxin pretreatment also inhibits fMLP-stimulated PLD activity when the agonist and the permeabilizing agent streptolysin O are added simultaneously, conditions in which the cytosolic proteins are still present (Fig. 3 B). To establish a requirement for Gi proteins in the regulation of PLD activity by myr-ARF1, we examined the effect of pertussis toxin pretreatment on the myr-ARF1-restored fMLP-dependent PLD activity in cytosol-depleted neutrophils (Fig. 3 C). Although the stimulation of PLD activity observed in the combined presence of GTP and myr-ARF1 was not inhibited significantly by pertussis toxin treatment, the fMLP-stimulated activity was inhibited (Fig.3 C). These results confirm that regulation of myr-ARF1 by the fMLP receptor is indirect and that one intervening component in the pathway leading to myr-ARF1 activation has to include the heterotrimeric Gi proteins. Previous studies in a variety of cells have indicated that not only ARF but also Rho can activate PLD activity (1Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 4Cockcroft S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 35: 345-370Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been reported that in HL60 cells, endogenous Rho is unlikely to play a physiological role in PLD activation (16Martin A. Brown F.D. Hodgkin M.N. Bradwell A.J. Cook S.J. Hart M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17397-17403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed using GTPγS as an activator. To examine the contribution of Rho proteins in the system analyzed here, we first established whether Rho proteins leaked out of permeabilized cells. Neutrophils were permeabilized with streptolysin O for various lengths of time, and the supernatants and the cell pellets were analyzed for Rho proteins. The majority of RhoA remains cell-associated in the permeabilized cells even after 30 min. The amount of Rho released in the supernatant was low compared with that retained in the cells (Fig.4). Under these conditions, the majority of the ARF proteins was found to leak out of the permeabilized cells (Fig. 1 A). Because Rho proteins are found mainly to be cytosolic when cells are disrupted by homogenization (27Whatmore J. Morgan C.P. Cunningham E. Collison K.S. Willison K.R. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), this would suggest that RhoA proteins do not behave as freely diffusable proteins under conditions in which the cellular architecture is maintained, as is the case in permeabilized cells. In addition to RhoA, Rac proteins were also retained in the permeabilized cells (data not shown). Despite the retention of Rho proteins, the stimulation of PLD activity by fMLP is impaired in the cytosol-depleted cells (Fig. 1 B), which would suggest that Rho proteins do not play a major role in fMLP-stimulated PLD activation. However, RhoA has been shown to be a poor activator of PLD activity by itself; but when it is present together with ARF, a synergistic activation is observed (10Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Thus, it was still possible that RhoA could be a contributory factor in the myr-ARF1-reconstituted response stimulated by fMLP in the permeabilized cells. C3 transferase ADP-ribosylates Rho proteins, thereby inactivating them. To investigate a role for Rho proteins, permeabilized cells were treated with C3 transferase. The myr-ARF1-restored fMLP-dependent PLD activity was partially reduced when Rho proteins were inactivated (Fig. 5). This experiment uncovers the Rho component to the PLD response observed in the presence of myr-ARF. Thus ARF and RhoA proteins act synergistically to regulate fMLP-stimulated PLD activity. ARF can stimulate PLD activity in the absence of Rho (C3-treated cells), whereas Rho requires the presence of ARF. ARF and RhoA are found predominantly in the postnuclear supernatant where they are present in a GDP-bound state. Nucleotide exchange and therefore activation results in the stable interaction of ARF and Rho with membranes (41Regazzi R. Ullrich S. Khan R.A. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Walker M.W. Bobak D.A. Tsai S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3230-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented indicate that ARF and Rho are required for fMLP stimulation of PLD in a reconstituted system. To verify that ARF and Rho proteins are activated in intact cells, the translocation of ARF and Rho proteins to the membranes was examined upon stimulation with fMLP. Intact neutrophils were pretreated with cytochalasin B and incubated in the presence or absence of fMLP for 1 and 10 min. At the end of the incubation, the cells were recovered and the membrane fractions prepared. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Both ARF and Rho translocated to the membrane fraction within a minute of stimulation. (Maximal activation of PLD activity by fMLP in intact cells occurs at 1 min (28Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 43Billah M.M. Eckel S. Mullmann T.J. Egan R.W. Siegel M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17069-17077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) ARF proteins remained membrane-associated even after 10 min, but the association of Rho was diminished at 10 min (see Fig.6 A). PLD activation by fMLP in intact neutrophils is enhanced greatly by pretreatment with cytochalasin B (43Billah M.M. Eckel S. Mullmann T.J. Egan R.W. Siegel M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17069-17077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several other neutrophil responses, including degranulation, respiratory burst, phospholipase A2 activation, and protein kinase C translocation, are also potentiated greatly by cytochalasin B (44Bennett J.P. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 601: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 45Horn W. Karnovsky M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Turner G.A. Bateman P.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The priming of human neutrophils by cytochalasin B can also be mimicked by other physiological agonists, e.g. low concentrations of C5a, fMLP, or tumor necrosis factor, and is therefore of physiological relevance. To examine whether translocation of ARF and Rho was dependent on priming, the cells were stimulated with fMLP for 1 min with or without cytochalasin B pretreatment. The translocation of ARF was entirely dependent on cytochalasin B pretreatment, whereas some RhoA translocation could be observed in its absence. Cytochalasin B enhanced RhoA translocation (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that similar to the activation of PLD by fMLP, the translocation of the two regulators, ARF and RhoA, is more efficient in primed cells. Fig. 6 C illustrates that in permeabilized cells, translocation of ARF can be observed without cytochalasin B treatment. Both fMLP a"

In this study chromosomal destabilization was monitored in relation to telomere structure, lifespan control and G2 checkpoint function. Replicative senescence was inactivated in secondary cultures of human skin fibroblasts by expressing the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 oncoprotein to inactivate p53. Chromosome aberrations were enumerated during in vitro aging of isogenic control (F5neo) and HPV-16E6-expressing (F5E6) fibroblasts. We found that structural and numerical aberrations in chromosomes were significantly increased in F5E6 cells during aging in vitro and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using chromosome-specific probes demonstrated the occurrence of rearrangements involving chromosome 4 and 6 in genetically unstable F5E6 cells. Flow cytometry and karyotypic analyses revealed increased polyploidy and aneuploidy in F5E6 cells only at passages >16, although these cells displayed defective mitotic spindle checkpoint function associated with inactivation of p53 at passages 5 and 16. G2 checkpoint function was confirmed to be gradually but progressively inactivated during in vitro aging of E6-expressing cells. Aging of F5neo fibroblasts was documented during in vitro passaging by induction of a senescence-associated marker, pH 6.0 lysosomal β-galactosidase. F5E6 cells displayed extension of in vitro lifespan and did not induce β-galactosidase at high passage. Erosion of telomeres during in vitro aging of telomerase-negative F5neo cells was demonstrated by Southern hybridization and by quantitative FISH analysis on an individual cell level. Telomeric signals diminished continuously as F5neo cells aged in vitro being reduced by 80% near the time of replicative senescence. Telomeric signals detected by FISH also decreased continuously during aging of telomerase-negative F5E6 cells, but telomeres appeared to be stabilized at passage 34 when telomerase was expressed. Chromosomal instability in E6-expressing cells was correlated (P<0.05) with both loss of telomeric signals and inactivation of G2 checkpoint function. The results suggest that chromosomal stability depends upon a complex interaction among the systems of telomere length maintenance and cell cycle checkpoints."

Although 4-OH-tamoxifen stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells expressing constitutively activated Mek-ER resulted in only a small increase in specific activity of the fusion protein, a 5–10 fold increase in total cellular Mek activity was observed over a period of 1–2 days due to an accumulation of fusion protein.

One limitation of the studies done thus far is that they involve constitutive expression of the activated forms of Mek1. Prolonged passage of cells in the presence of a growth- and transformation-promoting protein raises the issues of autocrine loops, accumulated growth-promoting mutations, and acclimation to the transformed milieu, complicating interpretation of results. In an attempt to circumvent some of these problems, we explored a system that permits the regulation of activated Mek1 expression. A modified estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain (ER HBD) containing a point mutation rendering the HBD unable to bind estrogen while retaining affinity for the synthetic ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-tamoxifen) has been used to conditionally regulate heterologous proteins (29Danielian P. White R. Hoare S. Fawell S. Parker M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I.

In this study, the mutated ER HBD was fused to the C terminus of constitutively activated forms of Mek1 to facilitate investigation of early events in cell proliferation initiated by Mek1 in isolation of parallel pathways that may be activated by extracellular mitogens. 200 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the cDNA encoding the hormone-binding domain (HBD) of the murine estrogen receptor (ER) containing the “tamoxifen mutant” (TM) point mutation (30Littlewood T.D.

The 140-base pair (bp) Mek1 fragment was digested with PstI and ClaI and inserted into Bluescript SK-(Stratagene). This construct was digested withNheI and SalI, into which theNheI-SalI-cut 200-bp fragment of the ER HBD was subcloned, resulting in the insertion of Gly-Ala-Ser between Ile392of Mek1 and Met284 of the ER HBD. This construct was confirmed by sequence analysis and digested withSmaI and PstI, into which the N-terminal 300-bp blunt/PstI fragment of MekI was inserted, followed by digestion with PstI and insertion of the DS (Asp218) or DD (Asp218, Asp222) Mek1 phosphorylation site mutant (23Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) 700-bp PstI fragments. Restriction sites between the polylinker SpeI andNotI were removed, and the resulting construct was cut withSalI and XbaI, into which site the 3′ 800-bp of the ER HBD (SalI-XbaI fragment) was inserted. Finally, the entire cDNAs encoding the Mek1-ER fusions were cut out of Bluescript with BamHI and SalI and inserted into BamHI-SalI-digested pBabe-puro. NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Calcium phosphate transfections were done using a buffer kit from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO. Transfected cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 12 days, and individual drug-resistant colonies were isolated. Fusion constructs were induced using 100 nm 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Research Biochemicals), typically for 24 h. Unless otherwise noted, cell count experiments were performed by seeding 6-cm plates with 6.5 × 104cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, incubating for 2 days, replacing medium with that containing 0.5% calf serum with or without 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen, then counting and/or photographing cells over the subsequent 3 days. Colony formation was assayed by suspending 5 × 105cells in DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 nm tamoxifen, and 0.25% agar, plated on a layer of DMEM containing 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5% agar in 6-cm tissue culture plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks, and then colonies were arbitrarily divided into small (<0.5 mm) or large (≥0.5 mm) categories, and colonies in 5 randomly chosen 1-cm2areas were counted. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mmNaPPi, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad reagent. Cells were placed in medium containing 0.5% calf serum simultaneously with addition of 100 nm4-OH-tamoxifen. 24 h later, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 100 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% dextrose, to which 3 ml of 70% ethanol was added, incubated on ice for 30 min, and spun down. Pellets were resuspended in 40 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.4, containing 70 μm propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the Cellquest program (Becton Dickinson). Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin, probed with the relevant antibody (all secondary antibody incubations were done in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mek-ER fusion proteins were detected with monoclonal anti-ER Ab-1 (Oncogene Research/Calbiochem) or monoclonal anti-Mek1 3D9 (Zymed); endogenous Mek1 was detected with monoclonal anti-Mek1 3D9 (Zymed). Activation-specific phosphorylated species of Erk1 and Erk2 were detected with polyclonal phospho-specific Erk (New England Biolabs), cyclin D1 with monoclonal anti-cyclin D1 72–13G (Santa Cruz), and Kip1 with monoclonal anti-p27 Kip1 (Transduction Laboratories). Mek-ER fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared as described above with anti-ER Ab-1 (Oncogene Research/Calbiochem) and protein G-agarose (Zymed or Santa Cruz). Mek-ER fusion protein kinase activity was measured as follows. Anti-ER immunoprecipitates (generally from 100 μg of cell lysate) were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and split into two tubes. Half of each immunoprecipitate was used for immunoblotting, and half of each immunoprecipitate was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, 25 μm cold ATP, and 1 μg GST-Erk1 K63M per sample. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm EDTA, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to film. Gel sections containing Coomassie-stained substrate and autophosphorylated fusion protein were quantitated by scintillation counting. The constitutively activated Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants Asp218 (DS) and Asp218,Asp222 (DD) exhibit elevated kinase activity toward kinase-inactive GST-Erk1 and transform fibroblasts in tissue culture (23Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Alessandrini A. Greulich H. Huang W. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31612-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The DD form is more active and more transforming than Mek1-DS, consistent with the introduction of a constitutive negative charge at the two sites required to be phosphorylated for full activation of wild-type Mek1. In order to conditionally regulate activity of these Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants, fusion constructs were engineered in which the coding sequence for the TM mutant (30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) of the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain (ER HBD) was placed in frame at the 3′ end of the Mek1 cDNAs (construction described under “Materials and Methods”). These fusion constructs were then inserted into the expression vector pBabe-puro, creating pBp Mek1-DSER and pBp Mek1-DDER. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with pBp Mek1-DSER, pBp Mek1-DDER, or empty pBp vector and selected in puromycin. Stable clonal lines were isolated and screened for basal levels of fusion protein expression by whole cell lysate immunoblot analysis using an anti-ER antibody (data not shown). Representative lines exhibiting high levels of expression were used in the following experiments. Cells expressing empty vector, Mek1-DSER or Mek1-DDER, were treated for 24 h with 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen and lysed. Fusion protein kinase activity was measured in the absence of endogenous Mek1 by anti-ER immune complex kinase assay, using kinase inactive GST-Erk1 K63M as a substrate (Fig. 1 A). A 5–10-fold increase in fusion protein kinase activity toward kinase-inactive GST-Erk1 was observed after tamoxifen treatment; in the experiment shown, Mek1-DSER activity was increased 7-fold, and Mek1-DDER activity was increased 6.5-fold. A concomitant increase in fusion protein autophosphorylation was also observed. Treatment with an equal volume of ethanol vehicle had no effect on fusion protein kinase activity (data not shown). Half of each immunoprecipitate used in the kinase assay in Fig. 1 A was immunoblotted with anti-ER to detect protein levels in each immunoprecipitate. Significantly, the 4-OH-tamoxifen-stimulated lysates exhibited higher levels of precipitable fusion protein contributing to the observed kinase activity (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the increase in observed kinase activity was not due to an increase in specific activity. The increase in fusion protein expression was confirmed by whole cell lysate immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Elevation of ER fusion protein levels in response to hormone induction, possibly due to protein stabilization, has been previously described (31Jackson P. Baltimore D. Picard D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2809-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Samuels M.L. Weber M. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because the expression levels of Mek1-DDER are slightly higher than those of Mek1-DSER, the experiment was repeated normalizing for the amount of fusion protein in each immunoprecipitate. The resulting basal Mek1-DDER activity was 4-fold higher than basal Mek1-DSER activity, whereas 4-OH-tamoxifen-stimulated Mek1-DDER activity was 2.5-fold higher than stimulated Mek1-DSER activity (data not shown). Basal and induced levels of fusion protein expression were also compared with that of endogenous Mek1 by whole cell lysate anti-Mek1 immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 D). Whereas the uninduced Mek1-DSER and Mek1-DDER proteins were expressed at only about 10% the level of endogenous Mek1 protein, 24–48 h of tamoxifen stimulation led to an increase in fusion protein expression to levels 3–5-fold greater than that of endogenous Mek1, comparable to levels in previously described fibroblasts constitutively expressing these activated Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants (26Alessandrini A. Greulich H. Huang W. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31612-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The kinetics of induction of fusion protein levels and activity upon addition of 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen were then examined. No large increases in kinase activity were observed until 6–12 h after hormone addition (Fig. 2 A), at which time the levels of fusion protein began to increase as well (Fig.2 B). However, a slight but reproducible increase in specific activity, about 1.5-fold, was detected as early as 15 min after 4-OH-tamoxifen stimulation (data not shown). Thus, unlike previous reports using ER HBD fusion proteins (12Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2576-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Samuels M.L. Weber M. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we observed only a barely detectable immediate increase in fusion protein-specific activity, followed by a more robust delayed response due to fusion protein accumulation. The levels of fusion protein induced by 4-OH-tamoxifen addition peaked 48 h after hormone addition and remained elevated for at least 12 weeks, the latest time point tested (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). Anti-ER-precipitable kinase activity remained elevated as well (Fig. 2 D and data not shown). 4-OH-tamoxifen titration indicated that maximal stimulation of fusion protein expression and kinase activity occurred between 50 and 100 nm (data not shown). Subsequent experiments therefore involved stimulation with 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen unless otherwise noted. Removal of 4-OH-tamoxifen from the medium resulted in complete elimination of the induced fusion protein over a 2-day period, and it should be noted that there was no further elevation of fusion protein levels or kinase activity by repeated addition of hormone once a day for 3 days as compared with a single addition for 3 days (data not shown). The cells were first examined for the ability to proliferate in low serum. 6 × 104 cells transfected with vector or Mek1-DDER were plated and grown for 2 days in complete medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells were then placed in medium containing low (0.5%) calf serum and treated with 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen or an equal volume of ethanol vehicle for 24 h and then counted each of the following 3 days. Whereas the number of vector-transfected and unstimulated Mek1-DDER cells peaked at day 3 and then decreased, the number of 4-OH-tamoxifen-stimulated Mek1-DDER cells continued to increase until day 5 (Fig. 3 A). At no time during this representative experiment did any of the plates reach confluence, indicating that the inhibition of growth was not due to contact inhibition (Fig. 3 B). Stimulation of Mek1-DSER cells with 4-OH-tamoxifen resulted in an intermediate growth phenotype (Fig. 3 C), while untreated Mek1-DDER cells grown continuously in 10% calf serum proliferated three times as fast as Mek1-DDER cells treated with 4-OH-tamoxifen but grown in low serum (data not shown). The effects of Mek1-DDER on the cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4). Cells were placed in 0.5% serum and treated with 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen or ethanol vehicle for 24 h prior to analysis. Although no significant effect of Mek1-DDER induction on G2/M was detected, a 3–4-fold increase in the percentage of cells in S phase was observed following 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment. The percentage of Mek1-DDER cells in S phase peaked after 18 h of 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment and slowly declined over a period of 48 h (data not shown). Constitutive expression of activated Mek1 phosphorylation site mutants has been previously shown to transform fibroblasts; however, the kinetics of cell transformation by these activated kinases were in some cases delayed, raising the issue of whether secondary effects were involved (21Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 22Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31612-31618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ability of activated Mek1-ER to transform cells upon 4-OH-tamoxifen stimulation was therefore examined. When grown in complete medium containing 10% calf serum, the cells expressing Mek1-DDER exhibited morphological alteration and were more refractile within 24 h of hormone addition (Fig. 5 A), a time at which significant levels of fusion protein and anti-ER-precipitable kinase activity have accumulated (Fig. 2, A andB). No morphological alterations were observed in the Mek1-DSER expressing cells after 24 h 4-OH-tamoxifen stimulation (Fig. 5 A), consistent with Mek1-DSER activity in these cells at this time point, 2-fold greater than that of unstimulated Mek1-DDER (data not shown). However, prolonged treatment of Mek1-DSER-expressing NIH-3T3 cells with 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen did result in detectable morphological changes, although not to the extent observed in Mek1-DDER-expressing NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 5 B). Mek1-DDER cells exhibited a similar change in morphology when placed in medium containing low serum simultaneously with 4-OH-tamoxifen addition, in stark contrast to the flattened, quiesced control cells (Fig.3 B). The ability of the Mek1-ER expressing cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner was then analyzed by colony formation in soft agar. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with vector alone, Mek1-DSER, or Mek1-DDER were stimulated for 24 h with 100 nm4-OH-tamoxifen or left unstimulated and were plated in soft agar medium with or without 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen. Plates were incubated 12 days, then the number of colonies were counted. No colonies were observed on vector or Mek1-DSER plates in the absence of hormone stimulation (Table I), although a low level of background colony formation was seen on the Mek1-DDER plate, probably due to the basal level of anti-ER-precipitable kinase activity in these cells (Fig. 1 A). The number of colonies on the 4-OH-tamoxifen-stimulated Mek1-DDER plate was several orders of magnitude greater than that on the unstimulated plate. Only a small number of colonies was observed on the 4-OH-tamoxifen-stimulated Mek1-DSER plate, comparable to the unstimulated Mek1-DDER plate.Table IGrowth in soft agar of tamoxifen-treated NIH-3T3 cells expressing Mek-ER fusion proteins<0.5 mm>0.5 mmVector01-aNumber of colonies counted in five randomly chosen 1-cm2 fields.0Vector + T1-bT, 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen.00DSER00DSER + T40DDER90DDER + T41604801-a Number of colonies counted in five randomly chosen 1-cm2 fields.1-b T, 100 nm 4-OH-tamoxifen.

As expected, time course analysis of activation-specific Erk phosphorylation indicated that the appearance of phosphorylated endogenous Erk2 coincided with accumulation of Mek1-DDER, approximately 6 h after stimulation with 4-OH-tamoxifen (Fig. 6 A). Erk2 activation-specific phosphorylation peaked 2 days after hormone stimulation of Mek1-DDER and remained elevated for at least 12 weeks, the last time point examined (Fig. 6 B and data not shown).

However, although the selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, completely prevented insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, it was without effect on GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In addition, insulin was an effective stimulant, whereas GTPγS was a very weak activator of the downstream Akt serine/threonine kinase. Consistent with an Akt-independent mechanism, guanosine 5′-O-2-(thio)diphosphate inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation without any effect on the Akt kinase. Surprisingly, two functionally distinct tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A, as well as microinjection of a monoclonal phosphotyrosine specific antibody, inhibited both GTPγS- and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Phosphotyrosine immunoblotting and specific immunoprecipitation demonstrated that GTPγS did not elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate-1. In contrast to insulin, proteins in the 120–130-kDa and 55–75-kDa range were tyrosine-phosphorylated following GTPγS stimulation. Several of these proteins were identified and include protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (also known as CAKβ, RAFTK, and CADTK), pp125 focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, pp130 Crk-associated substrate, paxillin, and Cbl.

It has been well established that the insulin stimulation of glucose uptake primarily results from the translocation of the GLUT4 1The abbreviations used are: GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate-1; SH2, Src homology 2; PYK2, protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (also known as CAKβ, RAFTK, and CADTK); pp125FAK, pp125 focal adhesion tyrosine kinase; pp130Cas, pp130 Crk-associated substrate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SL-O, streptolysin-O; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-2-(thio)diphosphate; IC, intracellular; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate-1; SH2, Src homology 2; PYK2, protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (also known as CAKβ, RAFTK, and CADTK); pp125FAK, pp125 focal adhesion tyrosine kinase; pp130Cas, pp130 Crk-associated substrate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SL-O, streptolysin-O; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-2-(thio)diphosphate; IC, intracellular; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. glucose transporter isoform from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface membrane in muscle and adipose tissues. Although the molecular mechanism and signaling cascade(s) regulating the intracellular trafficking of GLUT4-containing vesicles have not been completely elucidated, several important effector molecules have recently been identified. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor results in tyrosine autophosphorylation of the β-subunit and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates several intracellular proteins on tyrosine residues, most notably insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of these substrates creates recognition sites for additional effector proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, thereby generating multisubunit signaling complexes (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 induces the association and activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (3Myers M.G.J. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 21: 10350-10354Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The targeting and/or activation of PI 3-kinase is well documented to be necessary for GLUT4 translocation (4Czech M.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Shepherd P.R. Siddle K. Nave B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that insulin stimulates the Akt kinase, also known as protein kinase B or RAC-PK (6Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated Akt kinase activity is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, and expression of a membrane-targeted and constitutively active Akt kinase results in persistent GLUT4 translocation (7Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Obberghen E.V. Marchand-Brustel Y.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for GLUT4 trafficking, expression of a dominant interfering Akt mutant inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (9Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to insulin, various other stimuli display insulinomimetic properties and can induce the translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. For example, introduction of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, into adipocytes rapidly stimulates GLUT4 translocation to a similar extent as insulin (10Baldini G. Hohman R. Charron M.J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4037-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, GTPγS can stimulate GLUT4 translocation in the absence of ATP, suggesting that ATP is required at an early step(s) in the insulin-signaling pathway and that a GTP-binding protein(s) functions at a more distal step(s) (11Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of GTPγS can also be mimicked by treatment with AlF4−, which is characteristic of the involvement of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (12Obermaier-Kusser B. Muhlbacher C.

Consistent with this interpretation, adrenergic stimulation can induce GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in both cardiac myocytes (14Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. James D.E. Lienhard G.E.

Furthermore, in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and 3T3L1 adipocytes, activation of receptors coupled to Gq also stimulate GLUT4 translocation (18Kishi K. Hayashi H. Wang L. Kamohara S.

In this regard, skeletal muscle appears to have two distinct pathways mediating GLUT4 translocation. Similar to adipocytes, insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle is PI 3-kinase dependent (19Elmendorf J.S. Damrau-Abney A. Smith T.R. David T.S. Turinsky J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Berger J. Hayes N. Szalkowski D.M. Zhang B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, muscle contraction/exercise or hypoxia stimulates glucose transport through a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway, which may utilize a distinct and separate pool of GLUT4 intracellular vesicles (22Yeh J.-I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2107-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this alternative pathway leading to GLUT4 translocation may be mediated by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium levels (23Cartee G.D. Douen A.G. Ramlal T. Klip A.

In the present study, we have examined the mechanism by which GTPγS stimulates GLUT4 translocation by comparing its signaling properties with those of insulin. Our data demonstrate that GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is independent of the PI 3-kinase, the Akt kinase, and changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration. However, GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation occurred through the activation of a novel tyrosine kinase pathway, which does not involve the insulin receptor or IRS1 but may require the tyrosine phosphorylation of protein-tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2, also known as CAKβ, RAFTK, and CADTK), pp125 focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (pp125FAK), pp130 Crk-associated substrate (pp130Cas), paxillin, and Cbl. Murine 3T3L1 preadipocytes were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture repository and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum at 37 °C. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by incubation of the cells with DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 mm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mmisobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 4 days, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1 μg/ml insulin for an additional 4 days. The medium was then changed to DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. Under these conditions, more than 95% of the cell population morphologically differentiated into adipocytes. All studies were performed on adipocytes between 8 and 12 days after initiation of differentiation (day 0). Prior to all experimental treatments, the differentiated adipocytes were serum-starved in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. 3T3L1 adipocytes were permeabilized with streptolysin-O (SL-O) as described by Robinson et al. (11Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed three times with intracellular (IC) buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.15, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and incubated in IC buffer containing 0.8 IU/ml of SL-O (Murex Diagnostics Inc., Atlanta, GA) for 5 min at 37 °C. Under these conditions, more than 95% of the cells were permeabilized based upon incorporation of propidium iodide. Following SL-O permeabilization, the cells were washed two times with ICR buffer (IC buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol and enriched with either 10 mm MgATP or an ATP-regenerating system: 40 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 mm ATP). Unless otherwise indicated, all experimental treatments were performed by incubating the cells in ICR buffer containing various additions for 15 min at 37 °C. 3T3L1 adipocytes used for microinjection were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes. The cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), containing 2 mm pyruvate, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm glucose for 45 min prior to microinjection. Adipocytes were microinjected with antibodies over a 45-min period using an Eppendorf model 5171 micromanipulator and given injections of approximately 0.1 pl directly into the cell cytoplasm with an Eppendorf model 5246 transjector. Following microinjection of approximately 100–300 cells/dish, the buffer was changed to fresh DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the cells were allowed to recover for 90 min at 37 °C, prior to permeabilization and treatment. Preparation of plasma membrane sheets from the adipocytes was performed essentially by the method of Robinson et al. (11Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on 35- or 60-mm dishes, following the appropriate treatment as described in each figure legend, were rinsed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine in PBS for 30 s. The cells were then swollen in a hypotonic buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) by three successive rinses. The swollen cells were sonicated for 3 s at power setting 4.5 with a model 550 Fisher sonic dismembrator fitted with a 5-mm microtip set 1 cm above the surface of the cell monolayer in 10 ml of sonication buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The bound plasma membrane sheets were washed two times with sonication buffer and used for either indirect immunofluorescence or immunoblot analysis as described below. Total cell extracts were prepared from 60- or 150-mm plates of 3T3L1 adipocytes following the appropriate treatment as described in each figure legend. Cells from each plate were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3P2O7, 2.5 mm EDTA) containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm pepstatin A by rotation for 15 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was separated from the soluble extract by microcentrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined, and samples were either subjected directly to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (as described below) or immunoprecipitated for IRS1 or PYK2. Briefly, 3–5 mg of cellular protein were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of IRS1 polyclonal antibody (αIRS1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or PYK2 polyclonal antibody (31Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (as described below). GST and GST-CrkII were prepared as described previously (32Okada S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28179-28182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Soluble GST fusion proteins were covalently linked to agarose beads with Amino-Link (Pierce). 100 μg of fusion proteins bound to the beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 mg of cell extracts isolated from control, insulin-stimulated, or GTPγS-stimulated cells. The beads were subsequently pelleted, washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate), and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (as described below). Plasma membrane sheets were scraped into a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.40, 1 mm EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pelleted fraction was solubilized in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and 5 μg of the total solubilized fraction was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide). The resolved proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with polyclonal rabbit GLUT4 antibody (IRGT; Charles River). Whole cell lysates, GST precipitates, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% polyacrylamide). The resolved proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.) and immunoblotted with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20:HRPO; Transduction Laboratories), a monoclonal paxillin antibody (Transduction Laboratories), a monoclonal p130Cas antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and a polyclonal Cbl antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All immunoblots were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sonicated plasma membrane sheets were fixed for 20 min at 4 °C in a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm EGTA. The fixed plasma membrane sheets were quenched for 15 min at 25 °C in 100 mm glycine-PBS (pH 7.5). After three rinses in PBS, the sheets were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% donkey serum (Sigma). The blocked sheets were incubated at 4 °C overnight with a 1:100 dilution of polyclonal rabbit GLUT4 antibody (IRGT; Charles River). For the microinjection studies, this incubation was done in combination with a 1:5000 dilution of polyclonal sheep anti-maltose binding protein antiserum (generously provided by Dr. Morris Birnbaum, University of Pennsylvania). The plasma membrane sheets were then washed for 30 min with PBS (six changes of PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:50 dilution of lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Inc.). For the microinjection studies, this incubation was done in combination with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate donkey anti-sheep IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.). Following incubation with the secondary antibodies, the membrane sheets were washed for 30 min with PBS (six changes of PBS) and mounted for microscopic analysis with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Confocal images were obtained on a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser confocal microscope (University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility). Akt protein kinase activity was determined as described by Moule et al. (33Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). 3T3L1 adipocyte detergent cell extracts were prepared as described above, and 600 μg of cellular protein were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of Akt antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Kelly Moule, University of Bristol) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed and resuspended in 40 μl of assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij 35, 5% glycerol) containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide. The activity of Akt in the immunoprecipitate was measured using histone H2B (0.5 mg/ml) as anin vitro substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (25 μl), after which the samples were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C and electrophoresed on a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. As previously observed (10Baldini G. Hohman R. Charron M.J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4037-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), treatment of SL-O permeabilized 3T3L1 adipocytes with insulin resulted in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane as detected by GLUT4 immunoblotting of isolated plasma membrane sheets (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2). Similarly, the addition of GTPγS to the permeabilized cells also induced the translocation of GLUT4 (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4). Since it is well established that activation and/or appropriate intracellular targeting of the PI 3-kinase is necessary for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we next examined the role of PI 3-kinase in GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In the control, unstimulated cells, there was a low level of GLUT4 immunofluorescence detected from the isolated plasma membrane sheets (Fig. 1 B, panel 1). Pretreatment with the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) slightly reduced the amount of GLUT4 present in the isolated plasma membrane sheets from unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 B, panel 4). As expected, insulin stimulated a large increase in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, which was completely inhibited by pretreatment with wortmannin (Fig. 1 B, panels 2 and 5). In contrast, although GTPγS stimulated a similar extent of GLUT4 translocation compared with insulin, pretreatment with wortmannin was without effect (Fig. 1 B, panels 3 and6). In addition, pretreatment of the 3T3L1 adipocytes with higher concentrations of wortmannin (1 μm) also inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation but did not reduce the translocation induced by GTPγS (data not shown). Recently, it has been reported that insulin stimulation increases Akt protein kinase activity in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner, and stable overexpression of a constitutively active membrane-bound form of Akt kinase resulted in the persistent translocation of GLUT4 (7Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Obberghen E.V. Marchand-Brustel Y.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of GTPγS to stimulate Akt kinase as a potential common point of convergence between the insulin and GTPγS signaling pathways leading to GLUT4 translocation. Activation of Akt protein kinase activity was assessed by immunoprecipitation and analysis of in vitro protein kinase activity (Fig.2). Isolation of Akt from unstimulated cells demonstrated a basal level of Akt protein kinase activity that was reduced by pretreatment with wortmannin (Fig. 2, lanes 1and 2). Insulin stimulation resulted in a marked activation of Akt protein kinase activity, which was also attenuated by wortmannin (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Treatment with GTPγS resulted in an intermediate stimulation of Akt protein kinase activity (Fig. 2, lane 3). Nevertheless, pretreatment with wortmannin completely inhibited the GTPγS-stimulated activation of Akt protein kinase activity (Fig. 2, lane 4). Since Akt kinase activation is accompanied by dual phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues (34Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of insulin and GTPγS on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility of Akt. Consistent with Akt kinase activity, insulin stimulation resulted in a marked reduction of Akt electrophoretic mobility, whereas GTPγS stimulation had little effect (data not shown). Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin completely prevented the reduction in Akt electrophoretic mobility. Thus, together these data demonstrate that GTPγS stimulation of GLUT4 translocation occurs in a pathway that is independent of both PI 3-kinase and Akt kinase activation. The data presented above suggest that the GTPγS stimulation of GLUT4 translocation occurs in a pathway(s) downstream to and/or in parallel with the PI 3-kinase and Akt kinase. To further characterize the relationship between insulin and GTPγS stimulation, we next incubated the SL-O-permeabilized cells with 100 μm GDPβS prior to insulin treatment (Fig.3). In the absence of insulin, GDPβS had no significant effect on GLUT4 translocation as detected by GLUT4 immunofluorescence of isolated plasma membrane sheets (Fig.3 A, panels 1 and 5). Insulin stimulation resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the amount of plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 protein (Fig. 3 A,panels 1–4). Pretreatment with GDPβS resulted in the inhibition of GLUT4 translocation at low (1 and 10 nm) insulin concentrations but not at high (100 nm) insulin concentrations (Fig. 3 A, panels 5–8). Insulin stimulation also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in Akt SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility (Fig.3 B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and8). However, pretreatment with GDPβS had no effect on the insulin stimulation of the Akt gel shift and, hence, phosphorylation and presumably protein kinase activation (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3, 6, and 9). These data further support a model in which GTPγS stimulation of GLUT4 translocation is mediated by a mechanism downstream of the Akt kinase. Recently, several studies have suggested that G protein-coupled receptors can modulate tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Having ruled out any potential role for PI 3-kinase and Akt protein kinase, we next assessed whether GTPγS-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was mediated by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. This possibility was initially examined using the relatively specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A (Fig. 4). In unstimulated cells, there was little GLUT4 detectable in the isolated plasma membrane sheets, and pretreatment with either genistein or herbimycin A had no effect (Fig. 4, panels 1, 4, and 7). As expected, both genistein and herbimycin A were effective inhibitors of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 4,panels 2, 5, and 8), as both of these agents inhibit the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). However, to our surprise, pretreatment with these tyrosine kinase inhibitors also prevented the GTPγS-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 (Fig. 4, panels 3,6, and 9). Although genistein and herbimycin A are relatively specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it is possible that the prevention of GLUT4 translocation was due to some other nonspecific effect. To further confirm the requirement for tyrosine kinase activity, we next utilized single cell microinjection of a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5). To id"
https://openalex.org/W1967818518,"Previously, we reported that the inhibitory tyrosine protein kinase p50csk is physically associated with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PEP in hematopoietic cells. This interaction was shown to involve the Src homology 3 (SH3) region of Csk and a proline-rich sequence of PEP termed P1 (SRRTDDEIPPPLPERTPESFIVVEE). In this report, we have attempted to understand the structural basis for the highly specific association of these two molecules in vivo. Our studies revealed that the proline-rich core of the P1 region of PEP (PPPLPERT) was necessary but not sufficient for binding to p50csk. Additional sequences located carboxyl to this motif were also needed for binding to the Csk SH3 domain in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses revealed that two aliphatic residues (isoleucine 625 and valine 626; PESFIVVEE) were especially important for this effect. In addition to clarifying the molecular basis for the selective ability of PEP to associate with Csk, these results constitute further evidence that sequences outside proline-rich cores dictate the specificity of SH3 domain-mediated interactions in vivo. Previously, we reported that the inhibitory tyrosine protein kinase p50csk is physically associated with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PEP in hematopoietic cells. This interaction was shown to involve the Src homology 3 (SH3) region of Csk and a proline-rich sequence of PEP termed P1 (SRRTDDEIPPPLPERTPESFIVVEE). In this report, we have attempted to understand the structural basis for the highly specific association of these two molecules in vivo. Our studies revealed that the proline-rich core of the P1 region of PEP (PPPLPERT) was necessary but not sufficient for binding to p50csk. Additional sequences located carboxyl to this motif were also needed for binding to the Csk SH3 domain in vitro and in vivo.

There is accumulating data that these motifs mediate protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 2Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr.

Screening of synthetic peptide libraries and phage display libraries revealed that SH3 domains primarily recognize proline-rich stretches (5Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G. Baltimore D. Science. 1992; 257: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 6Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses further showed that these proline-rich sequences adopt a left-handed polyproline II (PPII) helical conformation, in which the core motif is XPpXP (whereXP represents SH3 domain-binding dipeptides and p is a scaffolding residue, usually a proline) (7Yu H.

The two core prolines (X PpX P) make direct contact with the SH3 domain, while the immediately surrounding residues control the conformation of the PPII helix, thereby affecting the stability of the interaction. A frequent basic residue located either amino-terminal (K/R XXPpXP; class I ligands) or carboxyl-terminal (XPpXPX K/R; class II ligands) to the core prolines also forms a salt bridge with the SH3 domain and further enhances the affinity of the association (10Weng Z. Rickles R.J. Feng S. Richard S. Shaw A.S. Schreiber S.L. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The position of this basic residue also determines the orientation of binding to the SH3 domain (8Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 9Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The mechanisms determining the specificity of SH3 domain-mediated interactions in vivo are beginning to be understood. Initial studies led to the proposal that variable residues within the proline-rich core were responsible for the specificity of these interactions (2Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 3Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 8-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). However, as short proline-rich peptides typically bound numerous SH3 domains in vitro, it was subsequently postulated that sequences outside the PPII helix dictated the selectivity of these associations in vivo (11Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.-M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). While definite proof of this notion is not yet available, it is supported byin vitro studies (13Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 14Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Most convincingly, crystallographic analyses demonstrated that amino acids positioned carboxyl to a PPII helix in the human immunodeficiency virus Nef protein provided additional contact with a mutant Fyn SH3 domain, thus dramatically augmenting the affinity of the association between these two molecules (13Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 15Lee C.-H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made by analyzing the interaction of the SH3 domains of Src and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase with synthetic peptides (13Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Csk is a 50-kDa cytoplasmic tyrosine protein kinase expressed in all cell types (16Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 17Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It contains amino-terminal SH3 and SH2 domains, in addition to a carboxyl-terminal catalytic region. Significant interest toward p50csk stems from its ability to repress the activity of Src family tyrosine protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 17Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). There is mounting evidence that the inhibitory effect of Csk requires the presence of an intact SH3 sequence (18Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 17Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Even though the exact function of this domain remains to be elucidated, we previously found that it mediates the association of Csk with PEP, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cells (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Matthews R.J. Bowne D.B. Flores E. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Approximately 25–50% of PEP molecules is bound to Csk in T cells, B cells, and macrophages (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Structure-function analyses demonstrated that the SH3 domain of p50csk binds a proline-rich sequence in the noncatalytic domain of PEP, termed P1 (see Fig. 1). This interaction is highly specific, as a closely related proline-rich motif in PEP, named P2 (Fig. 1), is unable to bind the Csk SH3 region. Furthermore, the Csk SH3 domain was found to associate with no other proline-rich proteins, with the exception of the recently uncovered PTP-PEST, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase structurally related to PEP (22Davidson D. Cloutier J.-F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Yang Q. Co D. Sommercorn J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6622-6628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary data indicate that PEP cooperates with Csk to inhibit antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction in T cells. 2J.-F. Cloutier and A. Veillette, unpublished data. In this report, we have attempted to understand better the structural basis for the exquisite ability of PEP to associate with p50cskin hematopoietic cells. The results of our studies revealed that the proline-rich core of the P1 region of PEP was necessary but not sufficient for binding to the Csk SH3 domain. We found that unique residues located carboxyl to the proline-rich region of PEP P1 were also required for the association between Csk and PEP. These findings provided further evidence that sequences outside proline-rich cores can govern the capacity of ligands to interact with SH3 domains in vivo. TrpE fusion proteins encompassing the proline-rich regions P1 (trpE-P1) and P2 (trpE-P2) of PEP were reported previously (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues corresponding to these domains are depicted in Fig. 1. Mutant versions in which individual residues were replaced by alanines, or in which either amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal truncations were created, were generated by PCR. A schematic representation of the truncations studied here is shown in Fig. 1. All constructs were verified by sequencing (data not shown). A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein bearing the SH3 domain of Csk was described elsewhere (19Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M.L. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). TrpE fusion proteins were produced in bacteria as outlined earlier (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates (5–50 μg, unless specified) were incubated with GST-Csk SH3 domains (~5 μg) immobilized on agarose-glutathione beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After several washes, bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, boiled, and resolved in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. TrpE fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against trpE (Oncogene Science) and125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN). Immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (BAS 2000; Fuji). Peptides corresponding to short (KDEIPPPLPERT) and long (KDEIPPPLPERTPESFIVVEE) versions of PEP P1 were commercially synthesized at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. For competition assays, immobilized GST-Csk SH3 domains (~1 μg) were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with increasing concentrations (0.15–150 μm) of peptide, prior to addition of bacterial lysates containing trpE-ΔN P1 (5 μg). Binding assays were subsequently performed as outlined above. A modified mouse pep cDNA coding for a PEP protein with a Myc epitope at the amino terminus (Myc-PEP) was described previously (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A mutant in which the sequence PPPLPERT of PEP P1 was deleted (ΔP1 PEP) was also reported (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Additional mutants in which individual residues in PEP P1 were replaced by alanines were created by PCR. All constructs were verified by sequencing to ensure that no unwanted mutations had been introduced in the process (data not shown). Themyc-pep cDNAs were cloned in the vector pXM139, which contains the SV40 origin of replication. The ability of the Myc-PEP polypeptides to associate with a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version of p50csk (Csk-HA) was examined in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells according to a previously detailed protocol (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, Cos-1 cells were harvested by scraping and lysed in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 1% Nonidet P-40; 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). HA-tagged Csk was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mouse mAb 12CA5 coupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgG-coated protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech AB). After three washes, bound proteins were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Myc-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc mouse mAb 9E10 (24Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) and 125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN). We previously reported that a trpE bacterial fusion protein encompassing amino acids 605–629 of mouse PEP (SRRTDDEIPPPLPERTPESFIVVEE; Fig.1), also termed PEP P1, was capable of associating with the Csk SH3 domain in vitro (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To identify which residues in the proline-rich core of P1 were needed for this interaction, the individual amino acids in PPPLPERT were replaced by alanines through PCR. The resulting P1 mutants were expressed as trpE fusion proteins in bacteria and tested for their ability to associate with a GST fusion protein containing the Csk SH3 region, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The association of the trpE fusion proteins with GST-Csk SH3 domains was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-trpE antibodies (Fig.2). In agreement with earlier results (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), wild-type trpE-P1 (Fig.2 A, top panel, lane 1) was efficient at binding the Csk SH3 domain in these assays. Replacement of either the second (lane 3) or the fourth (lane 6) proline in PPPLPERT by alanine completely abolished binding to the Csk SH3 domain. In contrast, however, mutation of the first (lane 2) or third (lane 4) proline had no appreciable impact on this association. We also observed that substitution of the leucine (lane 5), the arginine (lane 8), or the threonine (lane 9) in PPPLPERT eliminated the association with the SH3 region of Csk, whereas mutation of the glutamate (lane 7) had no effect. We wished to ensure that our inability to observe any change in binding after mutating the first or third proline was not due to a lack of linearity in the assays. Hence, experiments were also performed using serial dilutions of trpE-expressing bacterial lysates (Fig. 2 B). These analyses showed that mutation of the first (lanes 4–6) or third proline (lanes 7–9) of P1 had no influence on binding to the SH3 region of Csk. Importantly, we also established that the differences in binding of the various fusion proteins to GST-Csk SH3 domains were not caused by variations in their levels of expression, as demonstrated by a parallel immunoblot of total bacterial lysates with anti-trpE antibodies (Fig. 2 A,bottom panel). The basis for the slower electrophoretic mobility of some of the fusion proteins (lanes 5 and8) is not known. However, it is likely to relate to differences in the conformation of these products in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. While the proline-rich core of PEP P1 is clearly involved in the interaction with the Csk SH3 domain, our previous findings implied that this sequence may not be sufficient for a stable association between Csk and PEP (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This was suggested by the observation that another polyproline motif with an identical proline-rich core sequence, i.e. PEP P2 (Fig. 1), was inefficient at associating with the Csk SH3 domainin vitro and in vivo. To obtain a better estimate of the relative affinity of these two related proline-rich sequences for the Csk SH3 domain, binding assays were conducted with serial 10-fold dilutions of either trpE-P1 or trpE-P2 lysates (Fig.3 A). With this approach, it was determined that the affinity of trpE-P1 for the Csk SH3 domain was 500–1000-fold greater than that of trpE-P2. Hence, the proline-rich core PPPLPERT is not sufficient for optimal binding to the SH3 domain of p50csk. Presumably, other sequences in PEP P1 are also involved in binding to Csk. Alternatively, sequences in PEP P2 may inhibit the capacity of PPPLPERT to associate with the Csk SH3 domain. To distinguish between these two possibilities, truncations of either the amino-terminal or the carboxyl-terminal sequences flanking the proline-rich core of P1 and P2 were engineered by PCR (see Fig. 1 for details). The resulting polypeptides were expressed as trpE fusion proteins and tested for their ability to bind the Csk SH3 domain as above. This experiment revealed that, unlike wild-type P1 (Fig.3 C, lanes 1–3), a P1 variant devoid of carboxyl-terminal flanking sequences (ΔC P1; lanes 8–10) failed to associate detectably with the Csk SH3 domain. By contrast, a P1 mutant lacking the flanking amino-terminal residues (ΔN P1; lanes 5–7) was still capable of interacting with the Csk SH3 sequence. Removal of either the amino-terminal (ΔN P2; lanes 11–13) or the carboxyl-terminal (ΔC P2; lanes 14–16) sequences in PEP P2 did not correct its inability to react with the Csk SH3 region (lane 4). We wished to quantify the impact of the carboxyl-terminal sequences in PEP P1 on its affinity for the Csk SH3 domain. To this end, peptide competition experiments were conducted. Peptides encompassing the proline-rich core of PEP P1 (KDEIPPPLPERT), in the absence or presence of the sequence PESFIVVEE at the carboxyl terminus, were synthesized. Various concentrations of the two peptides were then tested for their capacity to inhibit binding of trpE-ΔN P1 to GST-Csk SH3 domains (Fig. 4). This experiment revealed that the peptide with the carboxyl-terminal extension (Fig. 4 A,lanes 9–15) could compete the interaction between trpE-ΔN P1 and GST-Csk SH3 domains. The association was reduced by ~50% with a concentration of peptide of 0.7 μm and was almost totally abolished when the peptide concentration was raised to 7 μm. By comparison, the shorter peptide (lanes 2–8) did not significantly affect the association of trpE-ΔN P1 with the Csk SH3 domain, even when a concentration of 150 μm was used (lane 8). On the basis of these results, we estimated that the presence of the carboxyl-terminal sequence enhanced the ability of PEP P1 to interact with the Csk SH3 domain by at least 200-fold (Fig. 4, A and B; data not shown). The data are presented graphically in Fig.4 B. To better understand the function provided by the carboxyl-terminal sequence of PEP P1, smaller truncations were created to delineate the residues affecting Csk binding (see Fig. 1 for a description of the mutants). Deletion of the last three amino acids of PEP P1 (VEE) caused no more than a 5-fold reduction of the ability of trpE-P1 to associate with the Csk SH3 domain (Fig.5 A, lanes 8–10). However, truncation of three additional residues (FIV; lanes 11–13) abolished the capacity of trpE-P1 to bind the SH3 domain. We also verified whether additional residues located carboxyl to PEP P1 and which were not included in the original trpE-P1 construct could further influence binding to the Csk SH3 domain. It was observed that the presence of 20 supplementary residues at the carboxyl terminus of trpE-P1 (residues 630–649) had no measurable consequence on the extent of binding to the Csk SH3 domain (lanes 5–7). For a more precise determination of the carboxyl-terminal residues involved in binding to the Csk SH3 domain, the amino acids in PESFIVVEE were individually replaced by alanines, and the impact of these mutations on the binding to the Csk SH3 domain was tested (Figs.6, A and B). This experiment showed that most of the mutations in this region had little or no impact on binding to the Csk SH3 domain. However, replacement of the isoleucine (Fig. 6, A, lane 6, andB, lanes 19–21) or first valine (Fig. 6,A,lane 7, and B, lanes 22–24) was consistently found to diminish the interaction. Mutation of these residues reduced binding to the SH3 domain by 10- and 5-fold, respectively (data not shown). Substitution of the phenylalanine (Fig. 6, A, lane 5, andB, lanes 16–18) also diminished the association with the SH3 region of Csk, although the effect of this mutation was more variable when comparing Fig. 6, A and B. We also evaluated the impact of combining the mutations of the isoleucine and first valine (Fig. 6 C). Whereas replacement of either residue caused a partial diminution in binding to the Csk SH3 domain (lanes 3 and 4), alteration of both amino acids (lane 5) completely abolished the association with the Csk SH3 region. Finally, we wanted to verify that the requirements outlined above also applied to the association of PEP with p50csk in vivo. To this end, alanine substitutions were introduced in the P1 region of the full-length PEP molecule by PCR. The PEP variants were also engineered to carry a Myc epitope at their amino terminus, to allow detection with anti-Myc antibodies. Themyc-pep cDNAs were transiently transfected in Cos-1 cells, in the absence or presence of cDNAs coding for an HA-tagged version of Csk (Csk-HA). After cell lysis, the ability of the Myc-PEP variants to associate with Csk-HA was ascertained by immunoblotting of anti-HA immunoprecipitates with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig.7). This study showed that, contrary to wild-type Myc-PEP (Fig.7 A, lanes 3 and 15), variants in which the second proline (PEP P614A; lane 6), the arginine (PEP R619A; lane 10) or the threonine (PEP T620A; lane 11) of PPPLPERT was mutated to alanine exhibited a greatly reduced interaction with Csk-HA (<10% of wild-type). A comparable effect was achieved by deleting the sequence PPPLPERT from PEP P1 (PEP ΔP1; lanes 4 and14), in keeping with our earlier report (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mutants in which the leucine (PEP L616A; lane 8) or the fourth proline (PEP P617A; lane 9) of the proline-rich core was altered also demonstrated a lowered binding to p50csk (~25–40% of wild-type). By contrast, mutation of the first (PEP P613A; lane 5) or third (PEPP615A; lane 7) proline in PPPLPERT, or of proline 621 (PEP P621A; lane 12), had no impact of the Csk-PEP association. The importance of the isoleucine (I625) and first valine (V626) located in the carboxyl-terminal region of PEP P1 was also ascertained (Figs. 7, A and B). Whereas replacement of isoleucine 625 by an alanine (PEP I625A; Fig.7, A, lane 13, and B, lane 5) caused a ~50–70% reduction in binding to Csk, mutation of both isoleucine 625 and valine 626 (PEP IV→AA; Fig. 7 B, lane 6) fully prevented the association with p50csk. These findings indicated that the two aliphatic residues flanking the proline-rich core of PEP P1 were also necessary for binding of full-length PEP to Csk in mammalian cells. We reported elsewhere that, via its SH3 domain, Csk interacts with PEP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase accumulating in hematopoietic cells (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This interaction was shown to be highly specific and to involve a single proline-rich sequence located in the noncatalytic domain of PEP, termed P1. In the present study, we wished to dissect in greater detail the molecular basis for this interaction. First, we examined which residues in the proline-rich core of PEP P1 (PPPLPERT) were needed for binding to the Csk SH3 domain. Through an alanine scan and in vitro binding studies, it was determined that the second and fourth prolines of the sequence PPPLPERT played crucial roles in this interaction. Moreover, the leucine, arginine and threonine were also important for binding to the Csk SH3 domain, whereas the first and third prolines, as well as the glutamic acid, appeared dispensable. In combination, these findings were consistent with those made for other ligands of SH3 domains (7Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 8Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L.

Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Assuming that the proline-rich core of PEP P1 adopts a PPII helical structure, the relative importance of the residues in PPPLPERT observed herein could be explained by their position in the PPII helix. Accordingly, the second and fourth proline would be essential for binding to the SH3 domain as they would correspond to the core prolines in the motifXPpXP. The adjacent leucine, arginine and threonine would also be part of the surface of the PPII helix that contacts the SH3 domain, thus explaining their requirement for stable interaction with the Csk SH3 domain. By contrast however, the first and third prolines, as well as the glutamate, would be scaffolding residues not directly interacting with the SH3 domain, thereby being dispensable for the association. It is of note that the critical arginine in PEP P1 was situated carboxyl to the XPpXP motif. On this basis, PEP P1 would be further classified as a class II SH3 domain ligand (8Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 9Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). While the proline-rich core of PEP P1 (PPPLPERT) was a crucial element for binding to the Csk SH3 domain, it did not suffice for stable complex formation either in vitro or in vivo. This notion was initially suggested by our earlier finding that PEP P2, which possesses the same proline-rich core as PEP P1, was unable to negotiate binding to the Csk SH3 domain in the absence of P1 (20Cloutier J.-F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Through the creation of truncated versions of PEP P1 and PEP P2, we uncovered that sequences located carboxyl to the polyproline motif of P1 were necessary for binding to the Csk SH3 domain. In peptide competition assays, these sequences increased by at least 200-fold the ability of PEP P1 to compete the interaction with the Csk SH3 domain. By performing an alanine scan, we further determined that two aliphatic residues, isoleucine 625 and valine 626, were especially important for stable binding of PEP P1 to the Csk SH3 domain. Mutation of either of these residues caused a noticeable (>80%) reduction in binding of PEP P1 to the Csk SH3 domain in vitro, while replacement of both amino acids completely abrogated this association. Importantly, mutation of these two residues also prevented binding of full-length PEP to p50csk in transfected cells, indicating that these requirements also applied to the Csk-PEP interaction in vivo. The exact roles of isoleucine 625 and valine 626 in the Csk-PEP association remain to be clarified by structural studies. Nonetheless, analyses of other SH3 domain-ligand interactions provide clues regarding their potential function (13Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 14Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Most notable is the study of Lee et al. (13Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar), in which the crystal structure of a mutant Fyn SH3 domain complexed with the human immunodeficiency virus Nef protein was solved. These authors observed that a sequence located 6–42 residues carboxyl to the proline-rich core of Nef made contact with the Fyn SH3 domain. Specifically, the carboxyl-terminal flanking sequence of Nef formed two α helices that bound the RT loop of the Fyn SH3 domain. This interaction augmented the affinity between the two molecules by approximately 300-fold (15Lee C.-H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), an effect quantitatively similar to what we have reported herein. Therefore, it is plausible that the carboxyl-terminal region of PEP P1 is also involved in an analogous interaction. Along these lines, computer-based predictions suggest that it may form a β strand, which would be disrupted by mutation of isoleucine 625 and/or valine 626 to alanine(s) (data not shown). Throughout our studies, the results obtained in in vitrobinding assays with bacterial fusion proteins generally correlated well with those observed in mammalian cells expressing full-length PEP and Csk proteins. However, it is noteworthy that the fourth proline and the leucine of the proline-rich core of PEP P1 were not absolutely required for the association in vivo, while they were necessary for the interaction in vitro. Therefore, it is plausible that additional features in the full-length PEP and/or Csk molecules, or in the cellular environment, can further stabilize their binding and partially compensate for the absence of these residues. Future studies will be needed to test this possibility. Taken together, these results yield an understanding of the molecular basis of a highly specific SH3 domain-mediated interaction in vivo. While the proline-rich core of PEP P1 is essential for the association with Csk, stable binding of these two molecules in vivo and in vitro is also dependent on the presence of a short stretch of amino acids located outside the polyproline motif. Based on these observations and previously published findings (13Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 14Feng S. Kasahara C. Rickles R.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), it is attractive to speculate that the specificity of other SH3 domain-mediated interactions in vivo may be defined by extended sequences positioned outside the proline-rich core of the ligand. This notion may explain the relative lack of binding specificity observed for proline-rich ligands identified from peptide libraries. Moreover, it raises the possibility that the true physiological ligands of several SH3 domains have yet to be uncovered. We thank the members of our laboratory for useful discussions."

Flock J.-I. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol.

Immun. 1995; 63: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying a high complexity in the interaction between Fg and S. aureus. The importance of the interaction between S. aureus and Fg has been clearly demonstrated in an experimental model of endocarditis in the rat (5Moreillon P. Entenza J.M. Francioli P. McDevitt D. Foster T. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4738-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three different FgBPs that are secreted into the media have been purified from strain Newman (1Bodén M. Flock J.-I. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); one of these is a coagulase of 87 kDa, and one is a 60-kDa protein also able to bind to prothrombin. The gene encoding the third secreted FgBP, a 15.6-kDa FgBP previously designated Efb, was cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was determined (2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This protein will from now on be designated Efb for extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein and the corresponding geneefb. The incidence of this gene was found to be 100% among isolates of S. aureus, although the level of extracellular Efb varied significantly in broth cultures between different isolates due to different levels of protease production (6Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efb appears to be constitutively produced, whereas the 87-kDa coagulase is produced early, and the 60-kDa protein is turned on at late log phase. The fourth FgBP has been shown to be the major cause of adhesion ofS. aureus to Fg and is termed the clumping factor (Clf) (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar,7McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is cell surface-associated as a result of an LPXTG motif anchoring Clf to the peptidoglycan (8Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The fifth FgBP is a cell surface-associated coagulase with unknown function (4Cheung A. Projan S. Edelstein R.E. Fischetti V.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of Efb revealed two highly homologous 22-amino acid repeats in the N-terminal region separated by a 9-amino acid spacer. These repeats are homologous to the five (9Phonimadaeng P. O'Reilly M. Nowlan P. Bramley A.J. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or eight (10Kaida S. Miyata T. Yoshizawa Y. Kawabata S. Morita T. Igarashi H. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 102: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) 27-amino acid repeats found at the C-terminal end of coagulase. In coagulase, these repeats have been suggested to be responsible for the Fg binding activity, whereas the N-terminal end of coagulase is responsible for the coagulase activity and also includes a prothrombin binding domain (9Phonimadaeng P. O'Reilly M. Nowlan P. Bramley A.J. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Kawabata S. Miyata T. Morita T. Miyata T. Inagawa S. Igarashi H. J. Biol.

An allele replacement mutant of Efb has been constructed where theefb gene was replaced with a gene encoding gentamycin resistance (14Palma M. Nozohoor S. Schennings T. Heimdahl A. Flock J.-I. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adherence of the efb negative mutant strain to immobilized Fg was unaltered compared with the parental strain, indicating that adherence is not directly dependent on Efb. The Efb negative mutant was used in an experimental wound infection model in the rat. Compared with the isogenic parental strain, the Efb negative mutant resulted in significantly reduced severity of signs of infection (14Palma M. Nozohoor S. Schennings T. Heimdahl A. Flock J.-I. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a vaccination study using a mouse mastitis experimental infection model, antibodies against Efb were shown to significantly reduce the number of bacteria recovered from the mammary glands, and the level of histopathological signs of infection was reduced (15Mamo W. Bodén M. Flock J.-I. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 10: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These two findings together and the high incidence of the Efb protein among S. aureus isolates suggest that Efb is an important virulence factor worth further investigation. The biological function of Efb is not known, but the observation that the severity of S. aureus-infected wounds is influenced by Efb implies that wound healing is delayed due to its binding to Fg, probably affecting the clotting process. We have here compared Efb and Clf and found that Efb binds to Fg in a different way than Clf and that Efb has two binding sites for Fg leading to precipitation of the Efb·Fg complex. S. aureus strain Newman was radiolabeled by growing in Luri-Bertani (LB) medium for 5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μCi of [3H]thymidin (specific activity 80 mCi/mmol). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) to A 600= 1.0. One liter ofS. aureus strain Newman was grown for 19 h at 37 °C in LB. The culture was centrifuged, and FgBPs from the supernatant were isolated by affinity chromatography on Fg-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described before (16Bodén M. Flock J.-I. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2358-2363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted with 0.7% acetic acid, dialyzed against 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (buffer A), and subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column using a gradient of 0 to 100% buffer B (1m NaCl in buffer A). Three peaks of protein were eluted, and the second one, which eluted at a salt concentration of 0.35–0.45m NaCl, contained Efb. Clf was purified from Escherichia coli XL-1-harboring plasmid pCF33, derived from pQE30 (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland), expressing a His6 fusion protein comprising residues 221–550 of the ClfA protein. This plasmid was kindly supplied to us by T. J. Foster (Dublin, Ireland) (7McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The His6-Clf fusion protein was purified using nickel chelator according to the instructions provided by Qiagen. The 5′ part of the efb gene encoding the two repeat regions (amino acids 8–69) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, efb R.U. with the sequence 5′-TGAGGGGATCCCACAATATCGTAGAG-3′ and efb R.L. 5′-AGTTCCCCGGGTTTTCGCTGCTGGTT-3′ (obtained from CyberGen AB, Huddinge, Sweden). The plasmid pBFibIII (2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used as a template, and the reaction contained 5 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.5 units of Taq polymerase, and the thermal step program included denaturation at 94 °C for 10 s, annealing at 50 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and SmaI (efb R.U. has the BamHI site and efb R.L. has the SmaI site incorporated) and ligated into theBamHI-SmaI sites of the vector pGEX (Amersham). For cloning, E. coli strain XL1-Blue was used, and colonies with a recombinant plasmid containing the two repeat regions were detected by PCR using the primers efb R.U. and efb R.L. For expression of the recombinant protein (GST-RR), the E. coli strain BL21 was used. GST-RR protein was affinity-purified by glutathione-Sepharose using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham). A recombinant protein containing the C-terminal part of Efb (Efb210; in Ref. 2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, called Fib210) (amino acids 70–136) was purified from E. coli using the previously described plasmid pQFibC210 derived from pQE12 (Qiagen) (2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The pQE12 vector contains an affinity tag of His6 fused to the C-terminal end of the recombinant protein. Efb210 has been purified both on the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin and on Fg-Sepharose. Both the Efb210 peptide and the GST-RR were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot probed with Fg (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-Fg antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). A 96-well mitrotiter plate (Falcon; Becton Dickinson and Co., New Jersey) was coated with 100 μl of 2 μg/ml Fg overnight at room temperature (RT). The wells were then blocked by incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBST, 50 μl of a3H-labeled S. aureus suspension (107cells in PBST) and 50 μl of a solution containing the protein used as an inhibitor (Efb or Clf) were added. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the wells were washed three times with PBST, and bound bacteria were released by the addition of 2 × 50 μl of 3% SDS for 2 × 30 min at RT. The amount of bound bacteria was measured by scintillation counting. Microtiter plates (96 wells, Falcon) were coated with Efb or Clf (10 μg/ml) in 100 μl of PBS at room temperature overnight, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. A series of different amounts of Clf in 50 μl of PBST (0.01–30 μg) and a constant amount of Fg (10 ng) in 50 μl of PBST were added to the wells followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature. Bound Fg was subsequently detected by HRP-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulins against Fg diluted 1:1000 in PBST. The plate was washed with PBST after every incubation. Efb-Fg precipitation in solution was measured in microplate wells. One hundred μl of PBS solutions with Fg (8.6, 4.3, 2.1, or 0 mg/ml) were added to columns 1, 2, 3, and 4. One hundred μl of PBS with Efb (600, 300, 150, 75, or 37 μg/ml) were added to wells in rows A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. The plate was incubated 30 min at room temperature, and the increase in absorbance caused by the precipitation was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader. The same experiment with the same concentrations was also done with Clf or coagulase mixed with Fg. Efb-Fg precipitation was also measured in 1.2% agarose in a Petri dish into which wells were cut. In the central well was added 20 μl of Fg in PBS, and in the peripheral wells were added 5 μl of different concentrations of Efb (from 600 μg/ml and 2-step dilutions). Different concentrations of Fg were tested from 1 to 10 mg/ml. The Petri dish was stored in a humid chamber overnight for 2 days at 4 °C. To microplate wells were added 100 μl of Fg (5 mg/ml) and 100 μl of Efb (300 μg/ml) in PBS. Different amounts of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, or Zn2+) were added immediately before the addition of Efb. Fg and Efb were each dialyzed before the experiment against 10 mm EDTA to remove divalent cations. The amount of precipitation was measured after 30 min at 405 nm using a microplate reader. Microplates with 96 wells were coated overnight at RT with 100 μl of different concentrations of Efb210 (2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or GST-RR in PBS. The wells were then blocked by incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBST, 100 μl of Fg (0.1 μg/ml) was added to each well, and the microtiter plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound Fg was detected using antibodies (1:1000) against Fg conjugated with HRP. The plate was developed with 1,2-phenylediamime (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and then read at 492 nm. SDS-PAGE was run using the Phast System (Amersham). The three different chains of Fg were separated by a 8 to 25% gradient or 7.5% homogenous Phast gels. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter that was then blocked by 1% Tween for 20 min at RT. The filter was incubated with 10 μg/ml purified Efb in PBST for 2 h at RT. The bound Efb was detected by rabbit anti-Efb antiserum diluted 1:1000 in PBST followed by HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies (DAKOpatts) diluted 1:1000 and incubated with the filter for 1 h at RT. The nitrocellulose filter was washed three times with PBST after every incubation, and the color reaction was developed using 4-chloro-1-naphthol tablets (Sigma). The Fg-binding protein clumping factor (Clf), which is present on the bacterial cell surface, has been shown to mediate adherence of S. aureus to Fg (3McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In contrast, a mutant strain lacking theefb gene has been shown to have unaltered adherence properties (14Palma M. Nozohoor S. Schennings T. Heimdahl A. Flock J.-I. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result was not surprising, since the Efb protein is secreted into the medium and is not present on the bacterial cell surface. However, it seemed possible that Efb might influence adherence by competition with Clf for a common binding site on Fg. The adherence of radiolabeled S. aureus to immobilized Fg was measured in the presence of Clf or Efb. The presence of Clf decreased bacterial adherence by up to 50%. In contrast, the presence of Efb did not reduce the adherence as shown in Fig. 1, implying different binding sites for Efb and Clf on Fg. Independent binding of Clf and Efb to Fg was verified by a capture inhibition ELISA. Purified Clf or Efb were immobilized on microtiter wells, and Fg was captured to these molecules in the presence of soluble Clf at various concentrations. The presence of Clf in the assay had no influence on the interaction between Fg and immobilized Efb. In contrast, soluble Clf inhibited up to 90% of the binding of Fg to immobilized Clf as shown in Fig. 2. In a similar experiment where various concentrations of Efb were added to assess its inhibitory activity on Efb to Fg binding, a precipitate was formed between Efb and Fg (see below). To further establish that Clf and Efb have different binding sites on Fg, the α-, β-, and γ-chains of Fg were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to a Western affinity blot using Efb or Clf as probes followed by the respective antibodies. Fig.3 shows that Clf bound to the γ-chains, as shown before (17Hawiger J.S. Timmons S. Strong D.D. Cottrell B.A. Riley M. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T. Ho¨o¨k M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), whereas Efb bound to the α-chain. Precipitation of antibody-antigen complexes is often visualized in a double diffusion test in agarose. A precipitation line is formed between the wells containing antibody or antigen at a position where the concentrations of each are optimal for precipitation. The same method was used here to demonstrate that the interaction between Fg and Efb leads to precipitation (Fig.4). Precipitation could also be visualized in solution. Efb was added at various concentrations to solutions of Fg in microtiter wells using three different concentrations of Fg. A precipitate was formed that could be determined by the increased light absorbance. In Fig.5 A it is seen that the higher the Fg concentration that was used, the higher the Efb concentration that was required to obtain maximal precipitation; increasing the Fg concentration twice or four times gave the most precipitation at twice or four times the concentration of Efb. An excess of either Efb or Fg resulted in less precipitation. It was calculated that maximal precipitation was obtained at a molar ratio close to 1:1. The precipitate formed was threadlike, and the solution never became solid as is the case in coagulation. Purified coagulase was used in parallel experiments for comparison using whole plasma. Mixtures of coagulase and purified Fg gave only weak coagulation after a long time, most likely due to trace amounts of contaminating prothrombin. No optimal ratio for clotting was found for coagulase and Fg. Instead, less coagulase just required more time to produce clotting. Furthermore, the Efb/Fg precipitate was washed extensively in PBS, boiled in loading buffer, run on SDS-PAGE, and Commassie-stained. The three α-, β-, and γ-chains were seen together with Efb in what appeared to be equimolar amounts (data not shown). Each molecule of Fg has been shown to bind three Ca2+ ions, which is important for the structure and functional role of Fg during coagulation (19Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C.F. Trong I.L. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between Fg and Efb was tested for its dependence on divalent cations. Fg and Efb were dialyzed separately against EDTA to remove metals associated with the proteins, and a determination of the effect of various concentrations of divalent cations on the precipitation of Fg/Efb mixtures was tested in microtiter wells. Enhancement of precipitation was obtained by the addition of Ca2+ and Zn2+ but not by Mg2+ (Fig. 5 B). To cause precipitation of Fg, multiple binding sites in Efb would be required. To test this, the N-terminal part of Efb containing the two repeat regions was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. This protein was designated GST-RR. Also the C-terminal part was expressed separately as a His6 fusion protein, Efb210, as described previously (2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that Fg was able to bind to each of these fusion proteins in a capture ELISA. As negative controls, GST alone and another His6 fusion protein were tested for capture of Fg. Fg could not bind to any of these proteins (data not shown). Both Clf, GST-RR (the Efb repeat regions) and the Efb210 protein (the C-terminal portion) were tested in both precipitation assays, but no precipitation was seen with these proteins (data not shown). Both the purified Efb210 protein and GST-RR could be further purified by fibrinogen-Sepharose, demonstrating affinity for both parts of Efb for fibrinogen. This confirms earlier findings (2Bodén M.K. Flock J.-I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (not shown here). We have shown here that the binding of Efb to Fg involves two separate binding sites on Efb. The two repeat regions at the N terminus of Efb (amino acids 8–69), which are homologous to the repeat regions at the C terminus of coagulase, constitute one binding region. This is in agreement with suggestions that the repeat regions in coagulase bind to Fg. Another binding domain is located at the C terminus of Efb (amino acids 70–136). The Fg binding to the C- and N-terminal ends of Efb was demonstrated by capture ELISA and by the ability to purify the protein on Fg-Sepharose. Binding of Efb to Fg clearly takes place to the α-chain of Fg as compared with the binding of Clf, which is to the γ-chain, shown here and previously (18McDevitt D. Nanavaty T. House-Pompeo K. Bell E. Turner N. McIntire L. Foster T. Ho¨o¨k M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear if the binding of Efb to the α-chain is due to the binding of the repeat regions or due to the C-terminal part or if both binding domains of Efb recognize the α-chain. The exact binding site(s) on Fg is presently under investigation. Efb was unable to compete with S. aureus for adherence to Fg. Combined with our previous finding that a mutant lacking theefb gene retained wild type adherence properties (14Palma M. Nozohoor S. Schennings T. Heimdahl A. Flock J.-I. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5284-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that Efb is not involved in adherence. No enzymatic function of Efb has been shown, and its binding to Fg seems, therefore, to be the only function of Efb. In the case of coagulase, the binding to Fg is logical, since coagulase forms a complex with prothrombin that binds and converts Fg to fibrin, resulting in clot formation. A biological function of Efb, with no other activity than the ability to bind to Fg, is not obvious and can only be speculative. We have demonstrated earlier that Efb plays an important role in a wound infection model in the rat. Fibrin is a major component of blood clots in wounds. A possible beneficial effect of Efb for the bacterium, by binding to Fg and affecting the conversion of Fg to fibrin, thereby delaying the wound healing process, is under investigation. Fg is a symmetric protein with two chains each of α, β, and γ, and each α-chain has a recognition site for Efb. Therefore, there are at least two recognition sites for Efb on each Fg molecule. Also, both the N- and C-terminal halves of Efb can bind Fg. This would permit the potential formation of three different combinations of two Efb with one Fg and also the formation of larger aggregates of these complexes. The resulting aggregate might be the precipitate that is observed during Efb-Fg interactions. Such a precipitate structure is supported by the finding that the optimal molar ratio between Efb and Fg to get precipitation is 1:1. In addition, the presence of Ca2+ or Zn2+enhances the precipitation of the proteins from equimolar mixtures of Efb and fibrinogen. Ca2+ is known to bind to Fg (19Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C.F.

Lämmle B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and is involved in blood clotting and wound healing. Fg and possibly also Efb contain Ca2+ binding sites, Fg at the C-terminal part of the γ-chain (DNDNDKFEGNC), and a putative Ca2+binding site is found in the second repeat region of Efb. Ca2+ may facilitate the interaction between Fg and Efb, possibly by causing some conformational change in one or both of the molecules."

Several LRP ligands, including apolipoprotein E/lipoproteins and amyloid precursor protein, have been shown to participate either in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis or pathology. However, factors that regulate LRP expression in neurons are unknown. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment on LRP expression, distribution, and function within neurons in two neuronal cell lines. Our results show that NGF induces a rapid increase of cell surface LRP expression in a central nervous system-derived neuronal cell line, GT1–1 Trk, which was seen within 10 min and reached a maximum at about 1 h of NGF treatment. This increase of cell surface LRP expression is concomitant with an increase in the endocytic activity of LRP as measured via ligand uptake and degradation assays. We also found that the cytoplasmic tail of LRP is phosphorylated and that NGF rapidly increases the amount of phosphorylation. Furthermore, we detected a significant increase of LRP expression at the messenger RNA level following 24 h of NGF treatment. Both rapid and long term induction of LRP expression were also detected in peripheral nervous system-derived PC12 cells following NGF treatment.

We and others have recently found that α2M complexes with Aβ and mediates the endocytosis of Aβ via cell surface LRP (27Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G.J. J.

Brain Res. 1996; 728: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, two recent studies suggest a genetic association between certain polymorphisms in LRP and the risk of developing AD (30Lendon C.L. Talbot C.J. Craddock N.J. Han S.W. Wragg M. Morris J.C. Goate A.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 222: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Kang D.E. Saitoh T. Chen X. Xia Y. Masliah E. Hansen L.A. Thomas R.G. Thal L.J. Katzman R. Neurology. 1997; 49: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that LRP could play a role in AD pathogenesis by 1) modifying Aβ uptake and clearance through Aβ interactions with LRP ligands such as α2M* and apoE/lipoprotein or 2) direct effects of ligands on cells.Despite increased understanding of the biology of LRP, its regulation within the nervous system is not well understood. Unlike the low density lipoprotein receptor, the promoter for LRP contains no sterol regulatory element and is not down-regulated by sterols (32Kutt H. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To analyze whether LRP expression is regulated in neuronal cells, we examined the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment on LRP expression in both a central nervous system-derived neuronal cell line, GT1–1 Trk, and a neuronal crest-derived neuronal cell line, PC12 cells. We found that 1) NGF induces a rapid increase (over minutes) of cell surface LRP; 2) the cytoplasmic tail of LRP is phosphorylated, and the phosphorylation is increased by NGF; and 3) NGF induces a long term increase in LRP mRNA. These studies thus provide new insights into the mechanism of regulation and function of both NGF and LRP in neuronal cells.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that upon NGF treatment cellular LRP is up-regulated both acutely on the cell surface and more slowly at the mRNA level in two neuronal cell lines. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which a neurotrophic factor has been shown to rapidly alter the cellular distribution of an endocytic receptor. Neurotrophins have been shown to play important roles in the development, maintenance, and function of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system (44Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). Although cellular responses to neurotrophins include long term changes in gene expression, several recent studies have shown that neurotrophins also have acute effects on neuronal function and physiology. Neurotrophins bind to specific Trk receptors, which results in Trk dimerization, autophosphorylation, and rapid activation within minutes of several downstream intracellular pathways (54Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). These include Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the phosphoprotein SNT. It is the activation of these pathways and resulting changes in the phosphorylation state of many proteins that probably accounts for several of the recently described rapid cellular changes induced by neurotrophins. For example, neurotrophins have been shown to rapidly enhance synaptic transmission in both peripheral and central nervous system through activation of presynaptic neuronal Trk receptors with a resulting increase in neurotransmitter release and synaptic strength (45Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 46Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In addition, neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have been reported to cause rapid changes in intracellular Ca2+ in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (44Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study by Dugan et al.(47Dugan L.L. Creedon D.J. Johnson E.M. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) demonstrated rapid NGF-mediated suppression of free radical formation in both GT1–1 Trk cells and in sympathetic neurons. Taken together, these studies suggest that neurotrophins induce both rapid and long term responses in a variety of cellular processes that lead to changes in cell physiology.NGF stimulation of cell surface LRP expression was relatively rapid, with peak stimulation occurring ~20–60 min following the NGF addition. Since de novo synthesis of LRP and its trafficking to the cell surface takes >2 h (48Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and the half-life of LRP is relatively long (>10 h), 2G. Bu, Y. Sun, A. L. Schwartz, and D. M. Holtzman, unpublished observation.the rapid increase in cell surface LRP is unlikely to be a result of increased LRP synthesis. In addition, the increase in cell surface LRP expression results from an actual increase in cell surface LRP molecules, not simply ligand binding capacity (see Figs. 2 Band 3). Furthermore, since we have also detected a corresponding increase in the uptake of LRP ligands, the internalization rate of LRP is not likely to be altered upon NGF treatment (49Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This increase in cell surface LRP can be best explained 1) by NGF increasing the endocytic recycling rate (exocytosis rate) and/or 2) by NGF triggering transfer of LRP from a pool that is relatively less active or “silent” to a more active endocytic pool. These two possibilities are illustrated in Fig. 8. In the first case (Fig. 8 A), NGF treatment of cells results in an increase in the rate constant for exocytosis without changing the rate constant for endocytosis (49Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thus, a net increase in cell surface LRP is observed. If this model is correct, any increase in cell surface LRP must correlate with a concomitant decrease in the amount of LRP within the endosomal pool. In the second case (Fig. 8 B), NGF treatment does not alter the exocytosis rate of LRP but instead triggers the movement of a pool of LRP that either does not participate or is less active in endocytosis into a more active endocytic pool. If such a model is correct, an increase in LRP should be observed both at the cell surface and within recycling endocytic vesicles. There is a well studied example in which a growth factor (insulin) rapidly stimulates the translocation of an endocytic receptor (the glucose transporter GLUT-4) to the cell surface. Evidence using techniques such as photoaffinity labeling suggests that this occurs predominantly via increasing the exocytosis rate to a much greater extent than the endocytosis rate (50Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.L. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another example of receptor regulation was described for asialoglycoprotein receptor. In this case, a “silent” intracellular pool of asialoglycoprotein receptor has been defined, which normally is not involved in endocytosis but can be recruited by phorbol ester stimulation (52Stoorvogel W. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. Fallon R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In future studies, we should be able to distinguish which of these possibilities (or both) exists for NGF stimulation of cell surface LRP expression.It is also not known at present whether a sequence recognition element within the LRP cytoplasmic tail responds to the signal for rapid redistribution or whether a specific endosomal compartment, which may include other endocytic receptors, is responding to NGF. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the tail of LRP can be phosphorylated and that the phosphorylation increases upon NGF treatment. It is certainly possible that the phosphorylation of LRP may serve as a signal for its redistribution to the cell surface. Recent studies by Breuer et al. (53Breuer P. Korner C. Boker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have shown that the serine phosphorylation site of the cytoplasmic tail of the 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor is required for receptor transport to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, phosphorylation of LRP may serve as a signal for triggering the redistribution of the receptor from a “silent” pool to the active endocytic pool. Furthermore, the redistribution of LRP upon neurotrophin treatment could be either specific for LRP or specific for an endocytic vesicle subpopulation in which LRP resides. Thus, it will be important to examine in future studies whether other endocytic receptors (e.g. transferrin, epidermal growth factor, and low density lipoprotein receptors) are similarly affected by neurotrophin treatment. Should they be, it would suggest that either specific endosomal vesicle(s) or a common cis-element within the tails of these receptors responds to neurotrophins. On the other hand, if most other endocytic receptors are not regulated by neurotrophin treatment, it would suggest that either an endosomal compartment specific for a subpopulation of endocytic receptors or acis-element unique to their cytoplasmic tails is responsible for neurotrophin regulation. Understanding these mechanism(s) responsible for the acute regulation and redistribution of cell surface LRP may be facilitated by studies of the effects of NGF on specific intracellular signaling pathways (54Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar).LRP is a multifunctional endocytic receptor with the ability to bind and endocytose several structurally and functionally distinct ligands including apoE/lipoproteins and APP (55Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 56Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 57Knauer M.F. Orlando R.A. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, neurotrophin regulation of LRP may directly influence the catabolism of LRP ligands and their cellular consequences. For example, a principal function of apoE is to mediate lipoprotein binding to cell surface receptors. Thereafter, lipoprotein particles are taken up by cells, and the lipid components are stored and/or reutilized in various cellular functions. Based on results following peripheral nerve injury in which there is a 250–350-fold induction of apoE, a model has been proposed for apoE in transporting lipid and cholesterol to regenerating neuronal growth cones as well as to remyelinating Schwann cells (58Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1015-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition, apoE has also been shown to be up-regulated in the central nervous system within the injured optic nerve (59Snipes G.J. McGuire C.B. Norden J.J. Freeman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1130-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and in the hippocampus following perforant pathway interruption (60Poirier J. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 525-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Further, if some of the effects of apoE/lipoproteins on neurite outgrowth in vitro also occurin vivo as suggested in some studies (61Masliah E. Mallory M. Alford M. Mucke L. Iqbal K. Mortimer J.A. Winblad B. Wisniewski H.M. Research Advances in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 405-414Google Scholar), this would suggest that apoE/lipoproteins may play a role in structural plasticity after injury or in aging. Since LRP is a principal apoE/lipoprotein receptor expressed on neurons, an increase in cell surface LRP should facilitate the cellular uptake of apoE/lipoprotein. In addition to apoE/lipoprotein, two of the three major isoforms of APP (APP751 and APP770), either in soluble form or transmembrane form, have been shown to be ligands for LRP (56Kounnas M.Z.

Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The receptor-binding domain in APP appears to reside in the 56-amino acid Kunitz domain, which is present in APP751 and APP770 but not in APP695. Since the processing of APP to generate Aβ appears to occur primarily within endocytic compartments (62Higaki J. Quon D. Zhong Z. Cordell B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 651-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it is possible that, upon interacting with APP along the endocytic pathway, LRP may influence the trafficking and processing of APP to generate Aβ. Thus, it will be of interest in future studies to determine the effects of neurotrophins on LRP and cellular Aβ production.While it is clear that LRP participates in the uptake and degradation of its ligands, it remains a formal possibility that it may directly participate in some manner in intracellular signaling. For example, our recent data suggest that negative feedback regulation of tissue plasminogen activator expression in colon fibroblasts is mediated via cell surface LRP (63Hardy M.M. Feder J. Wolfe R.A. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that at least one LRP ligand may modulate its own synthesis through communication between LRP and the transcriptional machinery of the cell. It will be important to determine whether similar phenomena occur in neuronal cells. If so, it will be of interest to determine whether neurotrophins and neurotrophin-stimulated LRP phosphorylation affect LRP “signaling.” The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 1The abbreviations used are: LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid peptide; apoE, apolipoprotein E; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; α2M*, methylamine-activated α2M; NGF, nerve growth factor; Trk, tropomycin receptor kinase; TrkA, Trk activated by NGF; RAP, receptor-associated protein; AD, Alzheimer's disease.1The abbreviations used are: LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid peptide; apoE, apolipoprotein E; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; α2M*, methylamine-activated α2M; NGF, nerve growth factor; Trk, tropomycin receptor kinase; TrkA, Trk activated by NGF; RAP, receptor-associated protein; AD, Alzheimer's disease. is a large multiligand endocytic receptor expressed abundantly in liver and brain (1Krieger M.

Alternative splicing and the use of alternative transcription initiation sites in humans produce cathepsin B mRNAs that differ in their 5′- and 3′-untranslated ends.

In this study we show that one such transcript, CB(−2,3), which is missing exons 2 and 3, is likely to be a functional message in tumors.

Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease whose expression and trafficking are frequently altered in transformed and malignant cells (1Sloane B.F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 137-152PubMed Google Scholar). Both its association with the plasma membrane and its secretion have been linked to the increased capacity of human and rodent tumors to invade and metastasize (2Sloane B.F. Rozhin J. Hatfield J.S. Crissman J.D. Honn K.V. Exp. Cell. Biol. 1987; 55: 209-224PubMed Google Scholar, 3Weiss R.E. Liu B.C. Ahlering T. Dubeau L. Droller M.J. J.

The association of cathepsin B with cell fractions containing plasma membrane-derived vesicles and endosomes was found to increase after transfection of a human breast epithelial cell line with the c-Ha-ras oncogene (6Sloane B.F. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L.R. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin B has been detected in nuclei from human ectocervical tumors and in basal and columnar cells of the normal and hyperplastic prostate (7Pietras R.J. Roberts J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8536-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sinha A.A. Gleason D.F. Limas C. Reddy P.K. Wick M.R. Hagen K.A. Wilson M.J. Anat. Rec. 1989; 223: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In human lung tumor cell lines cathepsin B activity was also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear membrane, and plasma membrane (9Spiess E. Bruning A. Gack S. Ulbricht B. Spring H. Trefz G. Ebert W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forms of cathepsin B greater in size and stability than the mature, lysosomal form have been observed in tumors from humans and animals or in media conditioned by them (10Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Baici A. Kno¨pfel M. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 38: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Keppler D.

Acta. 1992; 1116: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At present, many of these findings are unexplained.Normal human tissues and human tumors contain different cathepsin B mRNAs due to alternative post-transcriptional processing of their 5′- and 3′-untranslated ends and to the probable existence of more than one promoter in the cathepsin B gene (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Cao L. Taggart R.T. Berquin I.M. Moin K. Fong D. Sloane B.F.

Some human tumors also contain cathepsin B-related transcripts that differ in their 5′-coding region (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Berquin I.M. Cao L. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These appear to arise from the skipping of exons 2 and 3 during splicing of the pre-mRNA (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and from transcription initiation in exon 4 (17Berquin I.M. Cao L. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both events result in the loss of the sequences for the signal peptide and a part of the inhibitory propeptide. Reticulocyte lysates were able to translate a synthetic message missing exons 2 and 3 with high efficiency, producing a truncated form of cathepsin B that lacked the first 51 amino acid residues (Δ51CB) (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that the transcript missing exons 2 and 3 is likely to be a functional message and that its translation product retains the capacity to be folded into an active enzyme. When tagged with the C (connecting)-peptide of proinsulin and expressed in COS cells, the truncated protein, Δ51CB-CP, associates with the cytosolic surface of nuclei and other membranous organelles. Therefore, alternative splicing could explain some of the diversity of size and location reported for cathepsin B in some human tumors, and suggests that cathepsin B could enhance their malignant behaviors by novel and previously unsuspected mechanisms.DISCUSSIONCathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase which may not be exclusively localized to lysosomes. Plasma membrane and secreted forms, possibly resulting from missorting in the trans-Golgi network (26Achkar C. Gong Q. Frankfater A. Bajkowski A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar), are thought to promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Cathepsin B activity and immunoreactivity have also been found in the nucleus (7Pietras R.J. Roberts J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8536-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and endoplasmic reticulum (9Spiess E. Bruning A. Gack S. Ulbricht B. Spring H. Trefz G. Ebert W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in some cancer cells. This finding suggests that cathepsin B could have other important and as yet unsuspected functions in cancer. Molecular mechanisms that might explain the abnormal intracellular locations of cathepsin B are largely unknown. We and others have examined transcripts of the cathepsin B gene in human tumors for evidence of an altered protein which lacks the capacity to be targeted to lysosomes. Most of the messages detected differed in their 5′- and 3′-untranslated ends due to differences in mRNA splicing (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Cao L. Taggart R.T. Berquin I.M. Moin K. Fong D. Sloane B.F.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or the selection of alternative transcription start sites (17Berquin I.M. Cao L. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These might contribute to the regulated expression of cathepsin B. In addition, two transcripts were found which lacked sequences encoding the signal peptide and part of the inhibitory propeptide (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Berquin I.M. Cao L. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite their different presumptive origins, the coding regions in both begin with the same initiation codon in exon 4 and predict a product that lacks the signal peptide and 34 of the 62 amino acids which comprise the inhibitory propeptide. However, the methods employed to detect these putative messages, RNase protection, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, cannot distinguish between incomplete or nonfunctional transcripts and functional, full-length mRNAs. To better characterize the transcript missing exons 2 and 3, we have used oligo(dT) primers to reverse transcribe messages containing poly(A) tracts from two human melanoma cell lines, and PCR to amplify the specific messages that contain the exon 1-exon 4 junction. A single product was obtained which encompassed all the remainder of the coding region and the 3′-untranslated tail characteristic of normal cathepsin B mRNAs. In addition, the majority of this message was found to associate with polysomes in a manner sensitive to EDTA treatment. Collectively, these results support a claim that transcripts missing exons 2 and 3 are functional messages that can recruit ribosomes to initiate translation in the A375 melanoma cells.An amino-terminal propeptide is often required for correct folding of the corresponding proprotein (41Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 43Shinde U. Li Y. Chatterjee S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 44Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21738-21745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some exceptions have been described (54Wetmore D.R. Hardman K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6549-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 55Ramos C. Winther J.R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7006-7012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast carboxypeptidase Y, the entire propeptide is not absolutely required for folding in vivo, provided the vacuolar signal and C-terminal region of the propeptide are retained (55Ramos C. Winther J.R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7006-7012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the propeptide in cathepsin B folding is unknown. Our results show that the retention of 28 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the 62-amino acid propeptide is sufficient for recovery of a native-like conformation in an in vitrofolding assay, as deduced by activity measurements. Furthermore, the resulting truncated proprotein has about 1/3 the Z-Arg-Arg-AMC hydrolase activity of the mature enzyme generated by removal of the entire propeptide. These results suggest that the truncated cathepsin B, when expressed in tumor cells, could have biological activity in the absence of further proteolytic processing.The ability to detect the product of messages missing exons 2 and 3 in tumor cells required distinguishing the truncated enzyme from other forms of cathepsin B which can arise from the proteolytic processing, glycosylation, and glycolytic modification of the endogenous enzyme (42Mach L. Stuwe K. Hagen A. Ballaun C. Glossl J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have used two different epitope tags to follow the synthesis and localization of the full-length and truncated cathepsin B in COS cells. The crystal structure of cathepsin B shows its C terminus to be exposed to solvent and disordered (56Musil D. Zucic D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popovic T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), suggesting that a C-terminal peptide extension might not interfere with protein folding. This was confirmed by the finding that when overexpressed in COS cells, the secreted flag- and C-peptide-tagged procathepsin B acquired enzymatic activity after pepsin cleavage of the inhibitory propeptide. 2S. Mehtani and A. Frankfater, unpublished results. In addition, the flag peptide and C-peptide are not likely to directly affect protein targeting. The flag peptide is highly polar and resembles no known protein targeting signal. The C-peptide is poorly conserved among species, it does not cause retention of proinsulin when expressed in a non-insulin producing cell, and recombinant insulins that lack the C-peptide are efficiently delivered to secretory granules in insulin-producing cells (57Halban, A. (1994) Diabetologia37, Suppl. 2, S65–S72Google Scholar, 58Kuliawat R. Avram P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the isolated human C-peptide can produce biological effects in the diabetic rat in a manner which suggests that it could be membrane active (59Ido Y. Vindigni A. Chang K. Stramm L. Chance R. Heath W.F. DiMarchi R.D. Di Cera E. Williamson J.R. Science. 1997; 277: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, its polarity, and the kinetics with which it is metabilized, would seem to argue against an association with cell membranes (60Steiner D.F. Rubenstein A.H. Science. 1997; 277: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Flag- and C-peptide-tagged full-length and truncated cathepsin B accumulated to similar levels in COS cells, confirming that the message missing exons 2 and 3 is translationally active in vivo, and that its product is sufficiently stable in COS cells to be readily detected. The presence of the tagged, full-length proenzyme in the media results from partial missorting of overexpressed lysosomal enzymes to the secretory limb of the exocytic-lysosomal biosynthetic transport pathway (40Isidore C. Horst M. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 41Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The truncated cathepsin B was not secreted, as would be predicted of a protein that is missing the signal peptide.To begin to identify the potential function of the truncated cathepsin B in cancer, it was necessary to determine its cellular location. The truncated cathepsin B lacks the N-terminal signal peptide and was expected to be directed to the cytyosol of COS cells where it should have produced a diffuse cellular fluorescence. Unexpectedly, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed most of the label to be concentrated in regions of the cell proximal to the nucleus and to appear to be associated with tubules and interconnected vesicles. Staining of the nuclear envelope was also evident. This distribution of label resembled that of the ER resident protein, PDI. In agreement with the results of immunofluorescence microscopy, differential centrifugation of COS cell lysates demonstrated that the majority of the tagged, truncated cathepsin B co-sedimented with nuclei and other membranous organelles.An analysis of CB(−2,3) with PSORT 3Available on the World Wide Web atwww.expasy.ch. Last revision on Oct. 20, 1994 by K. Nakai, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. failed to detect any sequence that could function as a cryptic signal peptide for its transport into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In agreement, the truncated enzyme was not taken up by canine microsomes in anin vitro translation reaction. In addition, it is also unlikely that the truncated enzyme was targeted to the lumen of the ER by a putative signal recognition particle and signal peptide independent mechanism (50Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 51Koronakis V. Hughes C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). First, when the synthesis of CB-CP(−2,3) was examined in COS cells in the presence and absence of tunicamycin, no evidence could be obtained for glycosylation at Asn-113, as would have been expected if the truncated enzyme had been directed to the lumen of the ER. Second, treatment of membrane fractions from COS cells with proteinase K indicated that CB-CP(−2,3) was accessible to proteolytic digestion and unlikely to be in the interior of the isolated organelles. Therefore, it appears that the association of the truncated form of cathepsin B with membranous fractions from COS cells may involve interactions with the cytosolic surfaces of these organelles.Observations of a novel form of cathepsin B, which is associated with intracellular membranes in human tumors, suggests the possibility that this enzyme may have other important functions in cancer beyond its likely participation in cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, a number of important regulatory proteins are also associated with the cytosolic surface of the ER and other organelles. These include the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (61Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar, 62Lithgow T. van Driel R. Bertram J.F. Strasser A. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 411-417PubMed Google Scholar), the pro-apoptotic protein, Presenilin 2 (63Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. Lacana E. Sunderland T. Zhao B. Kusiak J.W. Wasco W.

The later are involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions which include the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (65Senda T. Horiguchi Y. Umemoto M. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and transformation (66Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 471-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It may be relevant that limited proteolysis of Presenilin 2 produces C-terminal fragments (69Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11006-11010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) which can act in a dominant negative manner to inhibit apoptosis (64Vito P. Wolozin B. Ganjei J.K. Iwasaki K. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31025-31028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that v-Ha-Ras and c-Ha-Ras bind with high affinity to cathepsin B (K I values of 48 and 165 nm, respectively) (48Hiwasa T. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Yokoyama S. Cancer Lett. 1993; 69: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 70Hiwasa T. Yokoyama S. Ha J.M. Noguchi S. Sakiyama S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that mRNAs missing exons 2 and 3, which encode a truncated form of cathepsin B, are likely to be functional messages. They contain the remainder of the propeptide and mature enzyme, and are found to associate with polysomes in the A375 human melanoma. The product of in vitro translation retains the capacity to fold into a native-like protein which is partially active in the absence of pepsin pretreatment to remove the remainder of the propeptide. Thus, alternative splicing may partly account for observations of forms of cathepsin B in human tumors that have unexplained locations, and may be greater in size and/or stability than the normal, mature enzyme. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a distribution for the truncated enzyme which appeared to overlap that of the ER resident protein, PDI. The absence of glycosylation and the sensitivity of CB-CP(−2,3) in isolated membrane fractions to proteinase K digestion suggested that it was located on the cytosolic surface of intracellular membranes. In these locations the truncated protein could be expected to interact with important regulatory proteins such as Bcl-2 and Ras-related proteins. Further work is required to determine it the truncated tumor form of cathepsin B could act to alter the apoptotic program in tumor cells or to modify other important regulatory pathways known to be dysfunctional in cancer. Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease whose expression and trafficking are frequently altered in transformed and malignant cells (1Sloane B.F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 137-152PubMed Google Scholar). Both its association with the plasma membrane and its secretion have been linked to the increased capacity of human and rodent tumors to invade and metastasize (2Sloane B.F. Rozhin J. Hatfield J.S. Crissman J.D. Honn K.V. Exp. Cell. Biol. 1987; 55: 209-224PubMed Google Scholar, 3Weiss R.E. Liu B.C. Ahlering T. Dubeau L. Droller M.J. J.

Steiner D.F. Chan S.J. Frankfater A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4870-4875PubMed Google Scholar). The association of cathepsin B with cell fractions containing plasma membrane-derived vesicles and endosomes was found to increase after transfection of a human breast epithelial cell line with the c-Ha-ras oncogene (6Sloane B.F. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L.R. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsin B has been detected in nuclei from human ectocervical tumors and in basal and columnar cells of the normal and hyperplastic prostate (7Pietras R.J. Roberts J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8536-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sinha A.A. Gleason D.F. Limas C. Reddy P.K. Wick M.R. Hagen K.A. Wilson M.J. Anat. Rec. 1989; 223: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In human lung tumor cell lines cathepsin B activity was also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear membrane, and plasma membrane (9Spiess E. Bruning A. Gack S. Ulbricht B. Spring H. Trefz G. Ebert W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Forms of cathepsin B greater in size and stability than the mature, lysosomal form have been observed in tumors from humans and animals or in media conditioned by them (10Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Baici A. Kno¨pfel M. Int. J. Cancer. 1986; 38: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Keppler D.

Acta. 1992; 1116: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At present, many of these findings are unexplained. Normal human tissues and human tumors contain different cathepsin B mRNAs due to alternative post-transcriptional processing of their 5′- and 3′-untranslated ends and to the probable existence of more than one promoter in the cathepsin B gene (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Cao L. Taggart R.T. Berquin I.M. Moin K. Fong D. Sloane B.F.

Some human tumors also contain cathepsin B-related transcripts that differ in their 5′-coding region (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Berquin I.M. Cao L. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These appear to arise from the skipping of exons 2 and 3 during splicing of the pre-mRNA (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and from transcription initiation in exon 4 (17Berquin I.M. Cao L. Fong D. Sloane B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both events result in the loss of the sequences for the signal peptide and a part of the inhibitory propeptide. Reticulocyte lysates were able to translate a synthetic message missing exons 2 and 3 with high efficiency, producing a truncated form of cathepsin B that lacked the first 51 amino acid residues (Δ51CB) (14Gong Q. Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that the transcript missing exons 2 and 3 is likely to be a functional message and that its translation product retains the capacity to be folded into an active enzyme. When tagged with the C (connecting)-peptide of proinsulin and expressed in COS cells, the truncated protein, Δ51CB-CP, associates with the cytosolic surface of nuclei and other membranous organelles. Therefore, alternative splicing could explain some of the diversity of size and location reported for cathepsin B in some human tumors, and suggests that cathepsin B could enhance their malignant behaviors by novel and previously unsuspected mechanisms.

Recently, the first sequence homolog of T4 endonuclease V was identified from chlorella virus Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1). Here we present the biochemical characterization of the chlorella virus pyrimidine dimer glycosylase, cv-PDG. Interestingly, cv-PDG is specific not only for the cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, but also for the trans-syn-II isomer. This is the first trans-syn-II-specific glycosylase identified to date. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that DNAs containing both types of pyrimidine dimers are cleaved by the enzyme with similar catalytic efficiencies. Cleavage analysis and covalent trapping experiments demonstrate that the enzyme mechanism is consistent with the model proposed for glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes in which the glycosylase action is mediated via an imino intermediate between the C1′ of the sugar and an amino group in the enzyme, followed by a β-elimination reaction resulting in cleavage of the phosphodiester bond. cv-PDG exhibits processive cleavage kinetics which are diminished at salt concentrations greater than those determined for T4 endonuclease V, indicating a possibly stronger electrostatic attraction between enzyme and DNA. The identification of this new enzyme with broader pyrimidine dimer specificity raises the intriguing possibility that there may be other T4 endonuclease V-like enzymes with specificity toward other DNA photoproducts.

DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is of great interest because it may lead to mutations, carcinogenesis, and cell death (reviewed in Refs. 1Ananthaswamy H.N. Pierceall W.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 52: 1119-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and 2Ziegler A. Jonason A. Simon J. Leffell D. Brash D.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). UV-induced DNA damage occurs frequently in DNA as the bases of nucleic acids absorb light in a range coincident with that of natural sunlight, thus making them very susceptible to photochemically induced alterations (3Patrick M.H. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-32Google Scholar, 4Cadet J. Vigny P. Morrison H. Bioorganic Photochemistry. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 1-272Google Scholar). Exposure of DNA to UV light produces several types of photoproducts including 6-4 photoproducts, Dewar photoproducts, photohydrates, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; AP, abasic site; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bp, base pair(s); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBCV, Paramecium bursaria chlorellavirus-1.1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; AP, abasic site; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bp, base pair(s); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBCV, Paramecium bursaria chlorellavirus-1.

Academic Press, New York1976: 169-295Google Scholar). At short wavelengths of UV light, the CPD photoproducts are the most common. Two different classes of CPDs are produced by UV light, the predominant form being the cis-syn isomer and a minor form, thetrans-syn isomer being formed at a rate of about 2% that of the cis-syn isomer (Fig. 1) (6Patrick M.H. Rahn R.O. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 35-95Crossref Google Scholar). The trans-syn isomer may exist as two stereoisomers, the trans-syn-I or the trans-syn-II (7Liu F.-T. Yang N.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4865-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has not been determined which of these trans-syn isomers are formed in DNA in vivo. The repair and mutagenicity of most of these photoproducts have been extensively investigated and reviewed (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar).A base excision repair pathway for removing pyrimidine dimers is found in the bacteriophage T4. The phage T4 genome contains thedenV gene which encodes T4 endonuclease V, a well characterized DNA base excision repair enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 9Lloyd R.S. Linn S. Linn S. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar). T4 endonuclease V is a 16-kDa protein with cis-syn pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase activity and a concomitant AP lyase activity.The DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity of T4 endonuclease V exhibits salt-dependent cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer site cleavage kinetics (10Lloyd R.S.

Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once associated with DNA, the enzyme is thought to “scan” the DNA molecule (via some, in general, unspecified mechanism) until binding to a target site, e.g. a pyrimidine dimer in the case of T4 endonuclease V. The kinetic consequence of such a method of substrate site binding is to reduce the dimensionality of the diffusive encounter between target and enzyme active site. At salt concentrations corresponding to sodium ion concentrations below 40 mm, T4 endonuclease V follows “processive” kinetics. At higher salt concentrations T4 endonuclease V follows “distributive” kinetics, where the normal three-dimensional diffusive binding to substrate is maintained (11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Dowd D.R. Lloyd R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal αNH2 group of Thr-2 (Met-1 is removed during cellular processing) mediates the glycosylase action by forming an imino intermediate with the C1′ of the 5′ sugar of the cis-syn CPD (15Schrock III, R.D.

Phosphodiester bond scission between the pyrimidines of a CPD occurs by a β-elimination reaction resulting in a 5′-phosphate and a 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde termini (18Kim J. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Manoharan M. Mazumder A. Ransom S.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Am. Chem.

J. 1989; 259: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Similar activities have been identified in only a few microorganisms to date. Interestingly, two different cis-syn CPD enzymes have been isolated from the bacterium Micrococcus luteus and the genes for both enzymes have recently been cloned. One encodes a 31-kDa protein with homology to the endonuclease III family of DNA repair enzymes (21Piersen C.E. Prince M.A. Augustine M.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23475-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the other, uveA, encodes an 18-kDa protein (22Shiota S. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Even though the uveA gene product has 27% amino acid identity with T4 endonuclease V, this represents at best, a marginal overall similarity and several key residues are not conserved. Thus, despite intense efforts to identify T4 endonuclease V homologs, it was only recently that the first true sequence homolog was found.The first homolog of T4 endonuclease V was identified from the virus, PBCV-1 (Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1) (23Lu Z. Li Y. Zhang Y. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1995; 206: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and has been shown to initiate pyrimidine dimer repair (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBCV-1 is the prototype virus of the family Phycodnaviridae; these polyhedral viruses contain large (>300 kilobase), linear, nonpermuted double-stranded DNA genomes with cross-linked hairpin ends (reviewed in Ref. 25Van Etten J.L. Lane L.C. Meints R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 586-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 26Van Etten J.L. Mol. Cells. 1995; 5: 99-105Google Scholar). These viruses, which have been isolated from freshwater around the world, infect certain strains of unicellular, eukaryotic, chlorella-like green algae which normally exist as endosymbionts in the protozoan Paramecium bursaria. Interestingly, these viruses encode numerous DNA methyltransferases and restriction endonucleases as well as the T4 endonuclease V homolog, a host-independent DNA UV repair enzyme. This is the first example of a virus infecting a eukaryotic cell that encodes a host-independent UV DNA repair enzyme. This is significant because most viruses rely on host enzymes to repair their DNA, a process termed host cell reactivation (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar).The pyrimidine dimer-specific cleavage activity was present in extracts from PBCV-1 infected Chlorella NC64A cells, but not in extracts from uninfected Chlorella or isolated virions (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pyrimidine dimer-specific activity is expressed shortly after virus infection of the host Chlorella (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene (cv-pdg) encoding the T4 endonuclease V homolog was cloned, and it enhanced UV radiation resistance in repair-deficientEscherichia coli cells.The predicted amino acid sequence of the cv-PDG protein is 41% identical to T4 endonuclease V, and potential key active site amino acid residues are conserved, as well as domains suspected to be critical for the recognition of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Homology modeling studies using the coordinates of the T4 endonuclease V x-ray crystallographic structure (27Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M. Katayanagi K. Ariyoshi M. Doi T. Ikehara M.

Here we present the biochemical characterization of cv-PDG, the first pyrimidine dimer specific-glycosylase from a virus infecting a eukaryotic cell.DISCUSSIONThis report describes the characterization of a novel pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase/AP lyase (cv-PDG) encoded by an eukaryotic algal virus. Using oligonucleotides containing thymidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-thymidine photoproducts, we demonstrate that cv-PDG has a high degree of specificity toward cis-syn andtrans-syn-II pyrimidine dimers and abasic sites within DNA. cv-PDG activity does not require divalent cations or any cofactors, has a broad pH range, and is relatively stable and soluble under most conditions. Surprisingly, despite its overall 41% amino acid identity with and apparent structural homology with T4 endonuclease V, cv-PDG has a broader substrate specificity. In addition to glycosylase activity on cis-syn CPDs, cv-PDG cleaves the 5′-glycosyl bond at trans-syn-II pyrimidine dimers with approximately the same catalytic efficiency as the cis-syn CPD. This finding suggests that the cv-PDG active site is more flexible than endonuclease V in order to accommodate the trans-syn-II isomer (see Fig. 1).The trans-syn-II isomer differs from the cis-synisomer in that the 3′-thymine is locked in the opposite orientation about the glycosyl bond (syn), whereas in thetrans-syn-I isomer it is the 5′-thymine that is locked in the opposite orientation (Fig. 1). These structural differences result in substantially different conformations of the dinucleotide (39Kemmink J. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1987; 14: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Koning T.M.G. van Soest J.J.G. Kaptein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Kao J.L. Nadji S. Taylor J.-S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fact that the trans-syn-II isomer is a substrate, and the trans-syn-I isomer is not, is consistent with the mechanism by which the T4 endonuclease V enzyme is thought to initiate repair at cis-syn dimers (9Lloyd R.S. Linn S. Linn S. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar). In the first step, the enzyme displaces the 5′-thymine of the dimer by activating the thymine as a leaving group, presumably by hydrogen bonding to the O-2 carbonyl group. Since the 5′-thymine of both the cis-syn andtrans-syn-II dimers have the same orientation, their O-2 carbonyl groups are in the same relative position and reside in what is formally the minor groove of the duplex. In the trans-syn-I dimer, however, the 5′-thymine is in the opposite orientation, and the O-2 carbonyl group formally resides in the major groove, and would not be accessible to hydrogen bonding by the enzyme.The biological significance of this broader substrate specificity is not known. However, it is known that trans-syn isomers are formed in greater amounts in single-stranded DNA (6Patrick M.H. Rahn R.O. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 35-95Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, despite the fact that cv-PDG does not cleave trans-syn dimers in single-stranded DNA in vitro, these photoproducts may be formed in transiently single-stranded regions of the viral genome such as during DNA replication or transcription and then removed from the resulting duplex regions of DNA. The frequency of trans-synpyrimidine dimers in the viral genome is not known. Studies with a T-T dinucleotide show that the trans-syn-II isomer is a relatively minor form as compared with the trans-syn-I (41Kao J.L. Nadji S. Taylor J.-S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in T-C dimers the occurrence of trans-syn-II isomers is increased to 50% of the trans-syn-I (7Liu F.-T. Yang N.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4865-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neithercis-syn nor trans-syn-I or IIpyrimidine dimers are very mutagenic in the systems studied to date (42Smith C.A. Wang M. Jiang N. Che L. Zhao X. Taylor J.-S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4146-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 3J.-S. Taylor, unpublished data. However, most organisms have at least one, if not several, mechanisms for removing both of these types of pyrimidine dimers, including other DNA repair systems such as photolyase (43Kim S.T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7065-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and nucleotide excision repair (44Svoboda D.L. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10694-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that the effects of these photoproducts are more severe in viruses which have a specific glycosylase for their removal.The mechanisms by which DNA repair enzymes locate the damage site within large DNA molecules can be examined by characterizing the processive nature of DNA strand cleavage as has been demonstrated for T4 endonuclease V (10Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.C. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5751-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At higher salt concentrations, the time required for macroscopic enzyme turnover on plasmid DNA substrates was much shorter than at lower concentrations. This was interpreted as a more distributive binding to pyrimidine dimer sites on the plasmid molecules. Despite the similarity between cv-PDG and T4 endonuclease V with regard to their processive kinetics, the two enzymes differ quantitatively in their salt sensitivity. Above 40 mmsodium ion, T4 endonuclease V displays predominantly distributive kinetics (11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ganesan A.K. Seawell P. Lewis R.J. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5751-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). cv-PDG, however, remains processive up to 100 mm Na+. These results suggest that cv-PDG has a higher nonspecific binding affinity for nontarget DNA than T4 endonuclease V. The biological significance of the processive DNA nicking activity in the repair enzymes has only been demonstrated for T4 endonuclease V. T4 endonuclease V mutants, catalytically similar to wild type enzyme but with reduced processive kinetics, have been characterized (reviewed in Ref. 45Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). DNA repair-deficient E. coli expressing these T4 endonuclease V mutants showed decreased ability to repair UV-damaged genomic DNA as measured by UV survival curves; thus, there was a direct correlation between the ability to survive UV irradiation and the ability to act processively in kinetic studies (45Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). cv-PDG is more processive than T4 endonuclease V because higher salt concentrations were required to shift cv-PDG to the distributive mode. Consequently, cv-PDG may be more efficient in initiating base excision repair than T4 endonuclease V.In addition to being the first trans-syn-II specific glycosylase/AP lyase, the cv-PDG enzyme can cleave AP sites in single-stranded DNA. These novel activities of this pyrimidine dimer glycosylase may prove useful in examining the effects of these DNA modifications within the cell such as mutagenesis and strand-specific repair. The specificity for two different photoproducts,cis-syn and trans-syn T-T dimers, will also allow for structural studies into the enzyme's active site as compared with the well characterized T4 endonuclease V.Finally, the identification and biochemical characterization of this new PDG enzyme suggests that T4 endonuclease V-like activities are not as unique as previously thought, and that this type of glycosylase activity, directed toward pyrimidine dimers in DNA, may be more widespread and perhaps contribute to virus survival in nature. In support of this hypothesis, Southern blot analysis of many independently isolated chlorella viruses indicate that T4 endonuclease V homologs (cv-PDG) are common in this group of viruses (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is of great interest because it may lead to mutations, carcinogenesis, and cell death (reviewed in Refs. 1Ananthaswamy H.N. Pierceall W.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 52: 1119-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and 2Ziegler A. Jonason A. Simon J. Leffell D. Brash D.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). UV-induced DNA damage occurs frequently in DNA as the bases of nucleic acids absorb light in a range coincident with that of natural sunlight, thus making them very susceptible to photochemically induced alterations (3Patrick M.H. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-32Google Scholar, 4Cadet J. Vigny P. Morrison H. Bioorganic Photochemistry. Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 1-272Google Scholar). Exposure of DNA to UV light produces several types of photoproducts including 6-4 photoproducts, Dewar photoproducts, photohydrates, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; AP, abasic site; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bp, base pair(s); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBCV, Paramecium bursaria chlorellavirus-1.1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; AP, abasic site; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bp, base pair(s); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBCV, Paramecium bursaria chlorellavirus-1.

Academic Press, New York1976: 169-295Google Scholar). At short wavelengths of UV light, the CPD photoproducts are the most common. Two different classes of CPDs are produced by UV light, the predominant form being the cis-syn isomer and a minor form, thetrans-syn isomer being formed at a rate of about 2% that of the cis-syn isomer (Fig. 1) (6Patrick M.H. Rahn R.O. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 35-95Crossref Google Scholar). The trans-syn isomer may exist as two stereoisomers, the trans-syn-I or the trans-syn-II (7Liu F.-T. Yang N.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4865-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has not been determined which of these trans-syn isomers are formed in DNA in vivo. The repair and mutagenicity of most of these photoproducts have been extensively investigated and reviewed (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). A base excision repair pathway for removing pyrimidine dimers is found in the bacteriophage T4. The phage T4 genome contains thedenV gene which encodes T4 endonuclease V, a well characterized DNA base excision repair enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 9Lloyd R.S. Linn S. Linn S. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar). T4 endonuclease V is a 16-kDa protein with cis-syn pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase activity and a concomitant AP lyase activity. The DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity of T4 endonuclease V exhibits salt-dependent cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer site cleavage kinetics (10Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.C. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ganesan A.K. Seawell P. Lewis R.J. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5751-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the processive kinetics of polymerases, regulatory proteins, and other DNA-reactive enzymes such as the restriction endonuclease EcoRI (13von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once associated with DNA, the enzyme is thought to “scan” the DNA molecule (via some, in general, unspecified mechanism) until binding to a target site, e.g. a pyrimidine dimer in the case of T4 endonuclease V. The kinetic consequence of such a method of substrate site binding is to reduce the dimensionality of the diffusive encounter between target and enzyme active site. At salt concentrations corresponding to sodium ion concentrations below 40 mm, T4 endonuclease V follows “processive” kinetics. At higher salt concentrations T4 endonuclease V follows “distributive” kinetics, where the normal three-dimensional diffusive binding to substrate is maintained (11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Dowd D.R. Lloyd R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal αNH2 group of Thr-2 (Met-1 is removed during cellular processing) mediates the glycosylase action by forming an imino intermediate with the C1′ of the 5′ sugar of the cis-syn CPD (15Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17631-17639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Phosphodiester bond scission between the pyrimidines of a CPD occurs by a β-elimination reaction resulting in a 5′-phosphate and a 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde termini (18Kim J. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Manoharan M. Mazumder A. Ransom S.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Similar activities have been identified in only a few microorganisms to date. Interestingly, two different cis-syn CPD enzymes have been isolated from the bacterium Micrococcus luteus and the genes for both enzymes have recently been cloned. One encodes a 31-kDa protein with homology to the endonuclease III family of DNA repair enzymes (21Piersen C.E. Prince M.A. Augustine M.L. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23475-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the other, uveA, encodes an 18-kDa protein (22Shiota S. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Even though the uveA gene product has 27% amino acid identity with T4 endonuclease V, this represents at best, a marginal overall similarity and several key residues are not conserved. Thus, despite intense efforts to identify T4 endonuclease V homologs, it was only recently that the first true sequence homolog was found. The first homolog of T4 endonuclease V was identified from the virus, PBCV-1 (Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1) (23Lu Z. Li Y. Zhang Y. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. Van Etten J.L. Virology. 1995; 206: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and has been shown to initiate pyrimidine dimer repair (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBCV-1 is the prototype virus of the family Phycodnaviridae; these polyhedral viruses contain large (>300 kilobase), linear, nonpermuted double-stranded DNA genomes with cross-linked hairpin ends (reviewed in Ref. 25Van Etten J.L. Lane L.C. Meints R.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 586-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 26Van Etten J.L. Mol. Cells. 1995; 5: 99-105Google Scholar). These viruses, which have been isolated from freshwater around the world, infect certain strains of unicellular, eukaryotic, chlorella-like green algae which normally exist as endosymbionts in the protozoan Paramecium bursaria. Interestingly, these viruses encode numerous DNA methyltransferases and restriction endonucleases as well as the T4 endonuclease V homolog, a host-independent DNA UV repair enzyme. This is the first example of a virus infecting a eukaryotic cell that encodes a host-independent UV DNA repair enzyme. This is significant because most viruses rely on host enzymes to repair their DNA, a process termed host cell reactivation (8Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The pyrimidine dimer-specific cleavage activity was present in extracts from PBCV-1 infected Chlorella NC64A cells, but not in extracts from uninfected Chlorella or isolated virions (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pyrimidine dimer-specific activity is expressed shortly after virus infection of the host Chlorella (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene (cv-pdg) encoding the T4 endonuclease V homolog was cloned, and it enhanced UV radiation resistance in repair-deficientEscherichia coli cells. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cv-PDG protein is 41% identical to T4 endonuclease V, and potential key active site amino acid residues are conserved, as well as domains suspected to be critical for the recognition of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Homology modeling studies using the coordinates of the T4 endonuclease V x-ray crystallographic structure (27Morikawa K. Matsumoto O. Tsujimoto M. Katayanagi K. Ariyoshi M. Doi T. Ikehara M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) suggest a high degree of structural homology. Here we present the biochemical characterization of cv-PDG, the first pyrimidine dimer specific-glycosylase from a virus infecting a eukaryotic cell. DISCUSSIONThis report describes the characterization of a novel pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase/AP lyase (cv-PDG) encoded by an eukaryotic algal virus. Using oligonucleotides containing thymidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-thymidine photoproducts, we demonstrate that cv-PDG has a high degree of specificity toward cis-syn andtrans-syn-II pyrimidine dimers and abasic sites within DNA. cv-PDG activity does not require divalent cations or any cofactors, has a broad pH range, and is relatively stable and soluble under most conditions. Surprisingly, despite its overall 41% amino acid identity with and apparent structural homology with T4 endonuclease V, cv-PDG has a broader substrate specificity. In addition to glycosylase activity on cis-syn CPDs, cv-PDG cleaves the 5′-glycosyl bond at trans-syn-II pyrimidine dimers with approximately the same catalytic efficiency as the cis-syn CPD. This finding suggests that the cv-PDG active site is more flexible than endonuclease V in order to accommodate the trans-syn-II isomer (see Fig. 1).The trans-syn-II isomer differs from the cis-synisomer in that the 3′-thymine is locked in the opposite orientation about the glycosyl bond (syn), whereas in thetrans-syn-I isomer it is the 5′-thymine that is locked in the opposite orientation (Fig. 1). These structural differences result in substantially different conformations of the dinucleotide (39Kemmink J. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1987; 14: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Koning T.M.G. van Soest J.J.G. Kaptein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Kao J.L. Nadji S. Taylor J.-S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fact that the trans-syn-II isomer is a substrate, and the trans-syn-I isomer is not, is consistent with the mechanism by which the T4 endonuclease V enzyme is thought to initiate repair at cis-syn dimers (9Lloyd R.S. Linn S. Linn S. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 263-316Google Scholar).

In the trans-syn-I dimer, however, the 5′-thymine is in the opposite orientation, and the O-2 carbonyl group formally resides in the major groove, and would not be accessible to hydrogen bonding by the enzyme.The biological significance of this broader substrate specificity is not known. However, it is known that trans-syn isomers are formed in greater amounts in single-stranded DNA (6Patrick M.H. Rahn R.O. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids.

In the first step, the enzyme displaces the 5′-thymine of the dimer by activating the thymine as a leaving group, presumably by hydrogen bonding to the O-2 carbonyl group. Since the 5′-thymine of both the cis-syn andtrans-syn-II dimers have the same orientation, their O-2 carbonyl groups are in the same relative position and reside in what is formally the minor groove of the duplex. In the trans-syn-I dimer, however, the 5′-thymine is in the opposite orientation, and the O-2 carbonyl group formally resides in the major groove, and would not be accessible to hydrogen bonding by the enzyme. The biological significance of this broader substrate specificity is not known. However, it is known that trans-syn isomers are formed in greater amounts in single-stranded DNA (6Patrick M.H. Rahn R.O. Wang S.Y. Photochemistry and Photobiology of Nucleic Acids. Academic Press, New York1976: 35-95Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, despite the fact that cv-PDG does not cleave trans-syn dimers in single-stranded DNA in vitro, these photoproducts may be formed in transiently single-stranded regions of the viral genome such as during DNA replication or transcription and then removed from the resulting duplex regions of DNA. The frequency of trans-synpyrimidine dimers in the viral genome is not known. Studies with a T-T dinucleotide show that the trans-syn-II isomer is a relatively minor form as compared with the trans-syn-I (41Kao J.L. Nadji S. Taylor J.-S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in T-C dimers the occurrence of trans-syn-II isomers is increased to 50% of the trans-syn-I (7Liu F.-T. Yang N.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4865-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neithercis-syn nor trans-syn-I or IIpyrimidine dimers are very mutagenic in the systems studied to date (42Smith C.A. Wang M. Jiang N. Che L. Zhao X. Taylor J.-S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4146-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 3J.-S. Taylor, unpublished data. However, most organisms have at least one, if not several, mechanisms for removing both of these types of pyrimidine dimers, including other DNA repair systems such as photolyase (43Kim S.T. Malhotra K. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7065-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and nucleotide excision repair (44Svoboda D.L. Smith C.A. Taylor J.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10694-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that the effects of these photoproducts are more severe in viruses which have a specific glycosylase for their removal. The mechanisms by which DNA repair enzymes locate the damage site within large DNA molecules can be examined by characterizing the processive nature of DNA strand cleavage as has been demonstrated for T4 endonuclease V (10Lloyd R.S. Hanawalt P.C. Dodson M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5113-5127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5751-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At higher salt concentrations, the time required for macroscopic enzyme turnover on plasmid DNA substrates was much shorter than at lower concentrations. This was interpreted as a more distributive binding to pyrimidine dimer sites on the plasmid molecules. Despite the similarity between cv-PDG and T4 endonuclease V with regard to their processive kinetics, the two enzymes differ quantitatively in their salt sensitivity. Above 40 mmsodium ion, T4 endonuclease V displays predominantly distributive kinetics (11Gruskin E.A. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9607-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ganesan A.K. Seawell P. Lewis R.J. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5751-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). cv-PDG, however, remains processive up to 100 mm Na+. These results suggest that cv-PDG has a higher nonspecific binding affinity for nontarget DNA than T4 endonuclease V. The biological significance of the processive DNA nicking activity in the repair enzymes has only been demonstrated for T4 endonuclease V. T4 endonuclease V mutants, catalytically similar to wild type enzyme but with reduced processive kinetics, have been characterized (reviewed in Ref. 45Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). DNA repair-deficient E. coli expressing these T4 endonuclease V mutants showed decreased ability to repair UV-damaged genomic DNA as measured by UV survival curves; thus, there was a direct correlation between the ability to survive UV irradiation and the ability to act processively in kinetic studies (45Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M. DNA Repair Mechanisms: Impact on Human Diseases and Cancer. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). cv-PDG is more processive than T4 endonuclease V because higher salt concentrations were required to shift cv-PDG to the distributive mode. Consequently, cv-PDG may be more efficient in initiating base excision repair than T4 endonuclease V. In addition to being the first trans-syn-II specific glycosylase/AP lyase, the cv-PDG enzyme can cleave AP sites in single-stranded DNA. These novel activities of this pyrimidine dimer glycosylase may prove useful in examining the effects of these DNA modifications within the cell such as mutagenesis and strand-specific repair. The specificity for two different photoproducts,cis-syn and trans-syn T-T dimers, will also allow for structural studies into the enzyme's active site as compared with the well characterized T4 endonuclease V. Finally, the identification and biochemical characterization of this new PDG enzyme suggests that T4 endonuclease V-like activities are not as unique as previously thought, and that this type of glycosylase activity, directed toward pyrimidine dimers in DNA, may be more widespread and perhaps contribute to virus survival in nature. In support of this hypothesis, Southern blot analysis of many independently isolated chlorella viruses indicate that T4 endonuclease V homologs (cv-PDG) are common in this group of viruses (24Furuta M. Schrader J.O. Schrader H.S. Kokjohn T.A. Nyaga S. McCullough A.K. Lloyd R.S. Burbank D.E. Landstein D. Lane L. Van Etten J.L. Appl. Environ.

The present work was performed with the aim of elucidating the nature of these two subfractions.

In addition, we found that the relative proportions of the four forms of H10 histones differ from tissue to tissue. DNA in eukaryotes is organized and compacted in chromatin. The fundamental subunit of chromatin is the nucleosomal core, which consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.75 times around an octamer of core histones (reviewed in Ref. 1Van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E. Elgin S.C.R. Elements of Chromatin Structure: Histones, Nucleosomes, and Fibres. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1-26Google Scholar). The linker histones H1, H5, and H10 are associated with the core histone-DNA complex and with the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes and are thought to modulate the condensation/decondensation of the chromatin fiber, thus influencing many nuclear activities such as transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair (2Wolffe A.P. Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, London1992Google Scholar). H10 was first described in 1969 by Panyim and Chalkley (3Panyim S. Chalkley R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 4Panyim S. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3972-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) as an H1-like protein present in mammalian tissues with little or no cellular proliferation and was later shown to increase at a terminal stage of differentiation (5Pieler C.

Some cells, however, accumulate significant amounts of the protein while still actively proliferating (11Gjerset R. Gorka C. Hasthorpe S. Lawrence J.J. Eisen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Keppel F. Allet B. Eisen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 1977; 74: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, H10 seems to be the only histone undergoing changes during malignant transformation (13Lea M. Cancer Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 9: 199-209PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by c-Ha-ras Val12 oncogene causes chromatin decondensation accompanied by alterations in the content of histone H10 (14Laitinen J. Sistonen L. Alitalo K. Ho¨lttä E.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All these findings suggest a role for H10 in the regulation of either cell proliferation or cellular differentiation. In every tissue in which H10 has been detected, two subfractions were present (15Harris M.R. Smith B.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Smith B.J.

Sarg B. Meraner C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It appears that these two H10 proteins, up to now named H10a and H10b, have specific individual functions in chromatin (15Harris M.R. Smith B.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The relative proportions of the two H10 forms seem to differ from tissue to tissue (15Harris M.R. Smith B.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and exhibit age-dependent changes in rat brain cortical neurons (17Pina B. Suau P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two H10s are resolvable by ion-exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 (16Smith B.J. Johns E.W. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19D'Anna J.A. Gurley L.R. Becker R.R.

Most recently, Lindneret al. (20Lindner H. Wurm M. Dirschlmayer A. Sarg B. Helliger W. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) developed a high performance capillary electrophoresis method allowing separation of H10 and its subfractions from other histone H1 subtypes. The two H10proteins run coincidentally on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that the difference between them is one of charge and not of size (15Harris M.R. Smith B.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since neither treatment with alkaline phosphatase nor exposure to alkaline conditions changed the separation of the H10 peak into two subfractions, phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation have been ruled out as possible post-translational modifications responsible for the different forms (16Smith B.J. Johns E.W. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Lindner H. Wurm M. Dirschlmayer A. Sarg B. Helliger W.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although some investigators speculated that the two forms of H10 might be coded by different genes (15Harris M.R. Smith B.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Pina B. Suau P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Doeneckeet al. (22Doenecke D. Albig W. Bouterfa H. Drabent B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) found that the mammalian genomes contain only one H10 gene. To gain insight into the nature of the two H10subfractions, we took advantage of a combined reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; HILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; AU-PAGE, acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CE, capillary electrophoresis; TEA, triethylamine; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization coupled with time-of-flight mass-spectrometry./hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) technique recently developed in our laboratory for separating acetylated core and phosphorylated H1 histones (23Lindner H. Sarg B. Meraner C. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 743: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Lindner H. Sarg B. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 782: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By applying this two-step HPLC method human placenta histone H10 was resolved into four components, which were treated with cyanogen bromide and chymotrypsin. HILIC analysis of the peptide fragments obtained indicated that the four H10protein subfractions differ in their N-terminal end consisting of 30 residues. The subsequent Edman degradation of the N-terminal peptides and mass spectra analysis of the four untreated H10subfractions demonstrated that human placenta histone H10consists of a mixture of intact (H10 Asn-3) and deamidated forms (H10 Asp-3) both blocked (H10a Asn-3, H10a Asp-3) and unblocked (H10b Asn-3, H10b Asp-3) on their N terminus. Deamidation occurs at Asn-3 in the sequence Thr-Glu-Asn-Ser… . Applying the procedure described for human placenta histone H10, we also analyzed histone H10 from rat and mouse liver and brain. We also found four H10 subfractions consisting of all the possible combinations involving either acetylated or unacetylated N-terminal residues and/or Asn or Asp at position 3. We thus show for the first time the occurrence of N-terminally unblocked H10 histones and of in vivo deamidated forms of linker histones. Furthermore, we found an accumulation of both the N-terminally acetylated and the deamidated forms of H10 with aging and that the relative proportions of all four forms of H10histones differ from tissue to tissue. Sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (4000 centipoises) and trifluoroacetic acid were obtained from Sigma (Munich, Germany). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). H1 histones were extracted from human placenta and from rat liver and brain with perchloric acid (5%, w/v) according to the procedure of Lindner et al. (25Lindner H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The organs were homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmNaHSO3, 45 mm sodium butyrate, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) in a Potter homogenizer. After centrifugation for 10 min at 3,500 rpm in the SS-34 rotor of a Sorvall centrifuge, the pellet was washed twice with buffer A and then homogenized in buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei thus obtained were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 3,500 rpm), and the nuclear pellet was washed once with buffer A without Triton X-100. The pellet was centrifuged and then extracted with 1 volume of 10% (w/v) HClO4 and 2 volumes of 5% (w/v) HClO4 for 1 h with occasional vortex mixing. HClO4-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and soluble proteins were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a 20% (w/v) final concentration in the presence of protamine sulfate (20 μg/ml). The precipitated H1 histones were left on ice for 60 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, washed twice with cold acidified acetone, and three times with pure acetone, dissolved in 1 ml of water containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until used for HPLC. For comparative purposes, human placenta H1 histones were also isolated by extraction with 0.5 m NaCl as described previously (26Banchev T. Srebreva L. Zlatanova J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 230-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To remove the low mobility group proteins, NaCl extract was treated with trichloroacetic acid (2%, w/v). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, the linker histones were precipitated with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and isolated as described above. The equipment used consisted of two 114M pumps, a 421A system controller, and a model 165 variable-wavelength UV-visible detector (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The effluent was monitored at 210 nm, and the peaks were recorded using Beckman System Gold software. Triethylammonium phosphate buffers were prepared by adding appropriate amounts of a 1m stock solution prepared by adding TEA to phosphoric acid until a pH of 3.0 was reached. Buffer compositions are expressed as (v/v) throughout this text. The separation of whole linker histones was performed on a Nucleosil 300-5 C4 column (250 × 8 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; 30-nm pore size; end-capped; Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The lyophilized proteins were dissolved in water containing 200 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and samples of ~700 μg were injected onto the column. The histone H1 sample was chromatographed within 40 min at a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (63:37) (solvent A, water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 37 to 45% solvent B within 10 min and from 45 to 54% solvent B within 30 min. The histone H10 fraction was collected, and, after adding protamine sulfate (20 μg/ml) and 50 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The peptides obtained by digestion of human placenta H10histones by chymotrypsin were separated using a Nucleosil 300-5 C18 column (250 × 3 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Samples of ~100 μg were injected onto the column. Chromatography was performed within 70 min at a constant flow of 0.35 ml/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (90:10) (solvent A, water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 85% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 10 to 45% within 60 min and from 45 to 100% within 10 min. Fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2m), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. To separate the peptide fractions obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage of human placenta H10 histones, samples of 50 μg were injected onto the column. Samples were chromatographed within 85 min at a constant flow of 0.35 ml/min with a multi-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (80:20) (solvent A, water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 85% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 20 to 38% within 15 min, from 38 to 52% within 60 min, and from 52 to 100% within 10 min. Fractions were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m), lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. The histone fraction H10 (150 μg) isolated by RP-HPLC was analyzed on a PolyCAT A column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle size; 100-nm pore size; ICT, Vienna, Austria) at 23 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a multi-step gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (100:0) (solvent A, 70% acetonitrile, 0.015m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B, 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 mTEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0, and 0.68 mNaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 65% B within 5 min, from 65 to 100% within 45 min, and then maintained at 100% within 30 min. The isolated protein fractions were desalted using RP-HPLC. Histone fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2m), lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The peptide fraction I (~120 μg) obtained by RP-HPLC of chymotrypsin-digested human H10 histones (Fig. 3) was analyzed using a two-step gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (100:0) (solvent A, 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 mTEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B, 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0, and 0.68 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 65% B within 5 min and from 65 to 100% B within 45 min. The individual HILIC fractions were desalted using RP-HPLC. The peptide fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2m), lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Whole histone H10(~100 μg) obtained from human placenta by RP-HPLC fractionation (Fig. 1) was digested with α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) (Sigma type I-S, 1:150 w/w) in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, for 3–4 h at room temperature. The digest was subjected to RP-HPLC. Whole histone H10(~100 μg) obtained from human placenta by RP-HPLC fractionation (Fig. 1) was dissolved in 50 μl of 70% formic acid containing 10 mg/ml cyanogen bromide (21D'Anna J.A. Gurley L.R. Becker R.R. Barham S.S. Tobey R.A. Walters R.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The tubes were sealed with Parafilm and left in the dark at room temperature, with occasional shaking, for 20 h. The solution thus obtained was then immediately analyzed by RP-HPLC. Peptide sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Inc. (ABI) model 492 Procise protein sequenator. Sequencer grade solvents were purchased from ABI. To partially deblock the acetylated N terminus, the histones were incubated in the cartridge for 3 h at 48 °C using gaseous trifluoroacetic acid. Determination of the molecular masses of the four histone H10 subfractions obtained by the HILIC run (Fig. 1 B) was carried out by electrospray ion-mass spectrometry technique using a MAT 900 instrument (Finnigan/MAT GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Samples (5–10 μg) were dissolved in 50% aqueous methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and injected into ion source. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used for determination of the molecular masses of the seven peptide fractions obtained by RP-HPLC separation (Fig. 3) of chymotrypsin-digested human placenta H10. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a KOMPACT MALDI III (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK) linear type mass spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode of detection. The matrix solution was prepared by making a saturated solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid with water/acetonitrile (1:2). Sample preparations were performed as in the following: typically 2 μl of the matrix stock solution was placed in an Eppendorf tube, and 1 μl of each sample peptide solution (10 pm/μl) and 1 μl of ubiquitin solution (10 pm/μl) were added as internal mass standard. The solution was briefly mixed using vortex stirring. 0.8 μl of the matrix/peptide/ubiquitin mixture was applied onto the sample slide. Polyacrylamide (15%) gel electrophoresis (16 cm × 18 cm × 0.75 mm) was carried out in acetic acid-urea, essentially as described by Lennox et al. (28Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were stained for 1 h with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 40% (v/v) ethanol, 5% (v/v) acetic acid and destained in 20% (v/v) ethanol, 5% (v/v) acetic acid. Perchloric acid-extracted linker histones from human placenta were fractionated using RP-HPLC with a semi-preparative column filled with Nucleosil 300-5 C4 and a two-step water/acetonitrile gradient. The three fractions obtained (Fig.1 A) were characterized by SDS- and AU-PAGE (data not shown). The histone H10 fraction eluted at about 19 min as a single peak. By applying a new high performance capillary electrophoresis method (20Lindner H. Wurm M. Dirschlmayer A. Sarg B. Helliger W. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this fraction was further separated into two major peaks (data not shown). This result was not further surprising since it is known (15Harris M.R. Smith B.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Smith B.J. Johns E.W. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Pina B. Suau P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Lindner H. Helliger W. Sarg B. Meraner C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that long acid-urea-polyacrylamide gels also resolve histone H10 into two subfractions (designated H10a and H10b). Excellent separations of modified core and H1 histones, recently achieved in our laboratory using the HILIC method (23Lindner H. Sarg B. Meraner C. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 743: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Lindner H. Sarg B. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 782: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), prompted us to test this HPLC technique for fractionating histone H10from human placenta. Therefore, the histone H10 fraction obtained in the RP-HPLC run (Fig. 1 A) was subjected to HILIC using a PolyCAT A column with a triethylammonium phosphate buffer system, pH 3.0, in the presence of 70% acetonitrile. As shown in Fig.1 B, five major peaks were found. Since the peak eluting at about 15 min consists of protamine sulfate, which was generally added to the linker histone fractions isolated by RP-HPLC in order to stabilize the proteins (24Lindner H. Sarg B. Helliger W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1997; 782: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), peaks 1–4 are due to H10subfractions. The results obtained with CE and HILIC clearly indicate that the individual H10 subcomponents differ in both their charge and hydrophilicity. Furthermore, it is evident that the proteins of peaks 3 and 4 exhibit a more hydrophilic nature than do the proteins of peaks 1 and 2. To characterize the proteins in Fig. 1 B, each peak was first subjected to AU gel electrophoresis. It was found thatpeaks 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 B correspond to the subfraction called H10a and peaks 3 and4 to that of H10b (shown in Fig.2). In order to localize the region responsible for the diversity of the H10 proteins, whole H10 histone obtained from the RP-HPLC run shown in Fig.1 A was treated with cyanogen bromide. Histone H10 contains only 1 methionine residue at position 30 and, therefore, cleavage with cyanogen bromide should produce two peptide fragments, a larger peptide from residue 31 to the C terminus and a smaller one originating from the N-terminal H10 domain (residues 1–30; shown in Table I). In our experiments, however, we were unable to detect the small peptide when using RP-HPLC and CE. This finding that the small CNBr peptide is not detectable agrees well with observations made by other investigators using gel electrophoresis (16Smith B.J. Johns E.W. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Gabrielli F. Tsugita A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 71: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Both CE and HILIC analysis of the large C-terminal peptide produced by treatment with cyanogen bromide and characterized by Edman degradation revealed that this fragment was homogeneous (data not shown). Based on this result we assumed that the heterogeneity of H10 is due to differences within the first 30 residues of the N-terminal H10 region. In order to obtain peptides containing this N-terminal region we digested whole H10 histone from human placenta with chymotrypsin and separated the peptides by means of RP-HPLC. The fragmentation yielded seven main peptide peaks, as shown in Fig.3. The purity and homogeneity of the fractions were assessed by CE (data not shown). Fraction I alone was non-uniform and resolved into two components. To identify the seven peptide fractions, amino acid sequencing of the first three amino acids and MALDI-TOF analysis were performed. The result is shown in Table I. Thus, it was established that fraction I consists of a peptide containing the N-terminal 52 residues of histone H10. To unambiguously confirm our assumption that the N-terminal domain is responsible for the microheterogeneity of histone H10, we analyzed fraction I under HILIC conditions. As expected, four subfractions designated 1′ to 4′ were obtained (Fig.4). The chromatogram closely resembled that obtained by HILIC analysis of undigested H10 (shown in Fig. 1 B).Table IChymotryptic peptides of human placenta histone H10 and human H10 primary structureThe peptide fractions of chymotrypsin-digested human placenta H10 were separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3) and analyzed by both amino acid sequencing of the first three amino acids and by MALDI-TOF-MS.

The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 65% B(5 min) and from 65 to 100% B (45 min). The HILIC fractions (designated 1′-4′) were desalted using RP-HPLC. The peptide fractions obtained in this way were collected and applied on an ABI protein sequencer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The peptide fractions of chymotrypsin-digested human placenta H10 were separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3) and analyzed by both amino acid sequencing of the first three amino acids and by MALDI-TOF-MS.

https://openalex.org/W1979261873,"Most disease-causing missense mutations in short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase are thought to compromise the mitochondrial folding and/or stability of the mutant proteins. To address this question, we studied the biogenesis of SCAD proteins in COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA corresponding to two SCAD missense mutations, R22W (identified in a patient with SCAD deficiency) or R22C (homologous to a disease-associated R28C mutation in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency). After cultivation at 37 °C the steady-state amounts of SCAD antigen and activity in extracts from cells transfected with mutant SCAD cDNAs were negligible compared with those of cells transfected with SCAD wild type cDNA, documenting the deleterious effect of the two mutations. Analysis of metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated SCAD wild type and mutant proteins showed that the two mutant proteins were synthesized as the 44-kDa precursor form, imported into mitochondria and processed to the mature 41.7-kDa form in a normal fashion. However, the intramitochondrial level of matured mutant SCAD proteins decreased rapidly to very low levels, indicating a rapid degradation of the mutant proteins at 37 °C. A rapid initial elimination phase was also observed following cultivation at 26 °C; however, significantly higher amounts of metabolically labeled and immunoprecipitated mature mutant SCAD proteins remained detectable. This corresponds well with the appreciable steady-state levels of SCAD mutant enzyme activity observed at 26 °C. In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy of immunostained cells showed that the SCAD mutant proteins were localized intramitochondrially. Together, these results show that newly synthesized SCAD R22W and R22C mutant proteins are imported and processed in the mitochondrial matrix, but that a fraction of the proteins is rapidly eliminated by a temperature-dependent degradation mechanism. Thermal stability profiles of wild type and mutant enzymes revealed no difference between the two mutants and the wild type protein. Furthermore, the turnover of the SCAD mutant enzymes in intact cells was comparable to that of the wild type, indicating that the rapid degradation of the mutant SCAD proteins is not due to lability of the correctly folded tetrameric structure but rather to elimination of partly folded or misfolded proteins along the folding pathway.

SCAD and MCAD are two of four homologous acyl-CoA dehydrogenases that catalyze the initial α,β-dehydrogenation step in mitochondrial β-oxidation of straight-chain fatty acids (6Beinert H.

Subunits of both enzymes are nuclear encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as precursors, whereupon they are imported into mitochondria, proteolytically processed, folded, and assembled into the biologically active homotetrameric form in the matrix, with one molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide per subunit (9Ikeda Y. Keese S.M. Fenton W.A. Tanaka K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

In one of the patients with SCAD deficiency two distinct mutant alleles of the SCAD gene were identified, which shows that this patient is a compound heterozygote (1Naito E. Indo Y. Tanaka K. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both mutant alleles were found to contain a C to T transition, one at position 136 and the other at position 319 of the cDNA sequence. The 136 C→T transition, leading to replacement of arginine-22 in the mature protein with tryptophan (R22W), is of particular interest, as a disease-causing mutation at the homologous position in MCAD (R28C) has been described (14Andresen B.S. Bross P. Jensen T.G. Winter V. Knudsen I. Kølvraa S. Jensen U.B. Bolund L. Duran M. Kim J.J. Curtis D. Divry P. Vianey-Saban C. Gregersen N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 730-739PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of cultivated skin fibroblast cells from the patient harboring the two SCAD mutant alleles has shown that the synthesized SCAD R22W mutant protein is unstable (10Naito E. Indo Y. Tanaka K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate further the deleterious effect of the R22W mutation we have studied this SCAD mutant protein in a COS-7 cell-derived expression system at 37 °C. Using such a system we have shown that the SCAD R22W enzyme activity is undetectable at steady state (40Kristensen T.J. Jensen T.G. Corydon M.J. Bross P. Lund T.B. Jensen U.B. Kim J-J.P. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Molecular Chaperones and the Heat Shock Response, May 1–5, 1996.

Mutat. 1995; 6: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the folding properties of the MCAD mutant were studied in Escherichia coli. By manipulating the amount of available chaperonins and growth temperature of E. coli cells overexpressing this mutant, the yield of active enzyme could be modulated between undetectable and 100% of the MCAD WT level, thus indicating that the deleterious effect of the mutation is predominantly related to the folding process (12Bross P. Jespersen C. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Kristensen M.J. Winter V. Nandy A. Kräutle F. Ghisla S. Bolundi L. Kim J.-J.P. Gregersen N. J. Biol.

Sequence alignment of human precursor pSCAD and pMCAD shows that these proteins have highly similar sequences with 37% identical residues (16Naito E. Ozasa H. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, the two enzyme proteins display almost superimposable three-dimensional structures (17Kim J.J.P. Wang M.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Following mitochondrial import, unfolded MCAD (and by inference possibly also unfolded SCAD) initially complexes with mitochondrial hsp70 and subsequently with hsp60, whereby it attains an assembly-competent conformation (13Saijo T. Welch W.J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the structural similarity of MCAD and SCAD, it is surprising that the expression of the SCAD R22W protein is much lower than the MCAD R28C protein. An explanation for this may be that the folding of the SCAD R22W protein is very severely compromised, resulting in almost complete proteolytic elimination. We therefore speculate that the SCAD mutant may serve as probe for the processes in the protein quality control machinery in which chaperones promote folding of folding-competent chains and proteases eliminate aberrant polypeptide chains (20Langer T. Neupert W. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). As a first approach to define the protein quality control system involved we have studied the synthesis, intracellular processing, localization, residual enzyme activity, thermal stability profiles, and site of degradation of the protein variants SCAD R22W and SCAD R22C in transfected COS-7 cells cultivated at different temperatures. Mutagenesis of the SCAD WT cDNA was performed according to the megaprimer polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis procedure described by Sarkar and Sommer (22Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). As template for the SCAD mutagenesis plasmid pCpreWT (vector comprising the coding region of human SCAD WT cDNA) (23Corydon M.J. Gregersen N.

Amplified product was purified and ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) followed by transformation of competent E. coli cells. Clones were checked for the absence of polymerase chain reaction errors. SCAD WT, R22W, and R22C cDNA fragments were isolated from vectors and ligated into the expression plasmid pMP6 (an adeno-associated virus-based vector) between the cytomegalovirus promotor and the SV40 processing signal. Supercoiled pMP6 plasmids were purified by using a Maxi preparation kit (Qiagen). COS-7 cells (24Cooper G.M. Science. 1982; 217: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) were cultivated in 75-cm2flasks, 10-cm2 slide flasks, or 10-cm2 dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 5% (v/v) CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (In Vitro, Copenhagen, Denmark) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells were transfected with SCAD WT, R22C, or R22W cDNA constructs using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (25Graham F.L. Eb A.J. v. d.

All cells were cultivated at 37 °C, 33 °C, or 26 °C and examined between 24 and 48 h post-transfection. In some experiments cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Merck) for 5 min at 4 °C followed by one wash in phosphate-buffered saline. Disruption of cells and Northern and Western blotting were performed as described elsewhere (26Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Bross P. Jensen U.B. Holme E. Kølvraa S. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Biochim.

Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The activity of SCAD enzymes was determined with the ferricenium ion-based colorimetric assay essentially as described by Lehman et al. (29Lehman T.C. Hale D.E. Bhala A. Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).n-Butyryl-CoA was used as substrate (Sigma). Samples of extracts from cells expressing SCAD WT and mutant proteins (cultivated at 26 °C) were incubated in ferricenium assay buffer solution (29Lehman T.C. Hale D.E. Bhala A. Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) at various temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 60 °C for 10 min and chilled on ice. Enzyme activity was measured as described above. Transfected COS-7 cells were cultivated at 26 °C for 2 days. Protein synthesis was arrested by adding cycloheximide to a final concentration of 10 μm, which was optimized in a control experiment. Aliquots of cells were harvested after various periods of incubation and extracts analyzed for SCAD activity (see above). COS-7 cells were transfected and cultivated at 26 °C or 37 °C. 24 h after transfection the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (50 μCi, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 500 μl of labeling medium for 15 min, washed, and harvested as described previously (30Corydon T.J. Bross P. Holst H.U. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When rhodamine 6G chloride (Sigma) was used, it was added to the medium at a final concentration of 2.1 μm 30 min before the medium was replaced with the medium containing label (31Ikeda Y. Keese S.M. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7081-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Fenton W.A. Hack A.M. Kraus J.P. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated for 15 min in the labeling medium containing the same concentration of rhodamine 6G. Cells in the chase experiments were labeled as described above. After a 15-min pulse, the labeling medium was removed and cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Then 1 ml of medium containing no label was added to each dish, and the cells were harvested after a 15-, 30-, 60-, or 180-min chase period, respectively. The frozen cells were resuspended, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as described previously (30Corydon T.J. Bross P. Holst H.U. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 10 μg of anti-rat SCAD antibody (28Ikeda Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to each sample. Aliquots from immunoprecipitated SCAD protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were subjected to fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and fluorographed as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). COS-7 cells were transfected with the various SCAD cDNA constructs and cultivated at 26 °C. In order to detect both SCAD and mitochondria, fixed cells were incubated with rabbit anti-rat SCAD antibodies (28Ikeda Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal mouse anti-human hsp60 antibodies (Sigma) as described previously (30Corydon T.J. Bross P. Holst H.U. Neve S. Kristiansen K. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Then the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated porcine anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma). Controls for the hsp60 staining were incubated in equal concentrations of serum from a nonimmunized mouse, followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. We have previously shown that the SCAD R22W protein and enzyme activity in transfected COS-7 cells are undetectable at steady state (15Jensen T.G. Bross P. Andresen B.S. Lund T.B. Kristensen T.J. Jensen U.B. Winther V. Kølvraa S. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 6: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the behavior of the MCAD R28C protein with the positionally homologous mutation (14Andresen B.S. Bross P. Jensen T.G. Winter V. Knudsen I. Kølvraa S. Jensen U.B. Bolund L. Duran M. Kim J.J. Curtis D. Divry P. Vianey-Saban C. Gregersen N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 730-739PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jensen T.G. Bross P. Andresen B.S. Lund T.B. Kristensen T.J. Jensen U.B. Winther V. Kølvraa S. Gregersen N. Bolund L. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 6: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine the extent to which this difference is caused by the different replacements at the homologous position, the SCAD R22C mutation was also constructed, and plasmids harboring the various SCAD cDNAs (WT, R22C, and R22W) were transfected into COS-7 cells. Transcription and processing of SCAD mRNA did not differ significantly as judged by the amount of SCAD mRNA (Northern blot analysis; data not shown). Because lower temperature in itself has a positive effect on folding of MCAD mutant proteins (12Bross P. Jespersen C. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Kristensen M.J. Winter V. Nandy A. Kräutle F. Ghisla S. Bolundi L. Kim J.-J.P. Gregersen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10284-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the effect of cultivation temperature (26 °C, 33 °C, and 37 °C) on the biogenesis of active SCAD mutant proteins was tested. For the SCAD WT enzyme, the activity in the samples was highest at 33 °C (Fig. 1,top). The activity at 26 °C and 33 °C was about 68% and 121% of the activity at 37 °C, respectively. In all three samples immunoreactive protein with a size corresponding to that of mature SCAD WT protein was observed (Fig. 1, bottom) by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-rat SCAD antibodies. At 37 °C, no significant SCAD activity above background could be detected from COS-7 cells transfected with SCAD R22W or R22C cDNAs, showing that at this temperature no significant amount of active mutant enzyme is accumulated. This notion was further supported by the fact that only slightly higher amounts of immunoreactive protein compared with the background level were observed in these cells at 37 °C. However, the residual activity of the two SCAD mutant variants became detectable at reduced cultivation temperatures. For the R22C variant the activity was increased up to approximately 12% (33 °C) and 20% (26 °C) of that of WT activity (Fig. 1). The activity of the R22W variant was increased up to approximately 2% (33 °C) and 6% (26 °C). Concomitantly, increased levels of immunoreactive SCAD mutant proteins became detectable at these temperatures. This shows that the SCAD mutations affect protein biogenesis and that the mutant enzymes can be partially rescued by reducing the cultivation temperature. Reduced cultivation temperature might have an influence on the kinetic stability of the synthesized SCAD proteins. As a measure of this parameter thermal stability profiles of residual active mutant enzymes produced at the permissive temperature (26 °C) were determined in extracts from transfected COS-7 cells. Aliquots from cell extracts were incubated at different temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 60 °C for 10 min, and the SCAD enzyme activity was measured. As shown in Fig.2, the curves for the two SCAD mutant enzymes are not shifted to lower temperatures compared with WT, showing that the active R22W and R22C mutant enzymes are as resistant to thermal inactivation as the WT (Fig. 2, A and B). The temperature of 50% inactivation (T 50%) of the SCAD proteins was approximately 40 °C. From E. coliexperiments it has previously been demonstrated that the curve of another SCAD mutant enzyme (G185S) (2Kristensen M.J. Kmoch S. Bross P. Andresen B.S. Gregersen N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) clearly is shifted to lower temperatures, showing that this mutation displays a lower resistance to thermal inactivation of the tetramer once it is formed (23Corydon M.J. Gregersen N. Lehnert W. Ribes A. Rinaldo P. Kmoch S. Christensen E. Kristensen T.J. Andresen B.S. Bross P. Winter V. Martinez G. Neve S. Jensen T.G. Bolund L. Kølvraa S. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The SCAD G185S mutant enzyme was therefore tested after expression in the mammalian system, and the thermal stability profile demonstrated that the T 50% of the SCAD G185S enzyme was about 4 °C lower than that of the SCAD WT enzyme (Fig. 2 C), which is in good agreement with the result found in the E. coli system (23Corydon M.J. Gregersen N. Lehnert W. Ribes A. Rinaldo P. Kmoch S. Christensen E. Kristensen T.J. Andresen B.S. Bross P. Winter V. Martinez G. Neve S. Jensen T.G. Bolund L. Kølvraa S. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Next we investigated whether the unaltered resistance to thermal inactivation of SCAD variant enzymes observed correlates with an unchanged kinetic stability of the variant enzymes in intact transfected COS-7 cells cultivated at 26 °C. For this purpose SCAD activity was measured at different time points in cells where the protein synthesis was arrested with cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 3, the SCAD activity, normalized on a percentage scale, from cells expressing WT, R22C, or R22W mutant enzymes remains unchanged up to 24 h after addition of cycloheximide. This illustrates that for that proportion of the mutant tetramers which acquires the native conformation the kinetic stability in the cells cultivated at 26 °C is indistinguishable from that of WT. To compare further the intracellular fate of the SCAD WT and mutant proteins pulse-labeling experiments of transfected COS-7 cells cultivated at 37 °C followed by immunoprecipitation were performed. Cells were labeled for 15 min in the presence or absence of rhodamine 6G, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial uptake of precursor polypeptides (10Naito E. Indo Y. Tanaka K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Aliquots of immunoprecipitated SCAD proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography as shown in Fig.4. When pulse-labeled in the absence of rhodamine 6G, a band with a molecular mass of 41.7 kDa was observed, representing mature SCAD protein (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). Scanning of the gels of two separate experiments shows that the signal of the fluorographic band for the two mature SCAD mutants was almost identical to that for the WT, indicating similar synthesis rates. When rhodamine 6G was present during pulse labeling, the 41.7-kDa mature band was barely detectable, but a 44-kDa precursor band was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 5–7). The intensities of the bands for the WT and the mutant precursors were comparable. Neither 41.7-kDa nor 44-kDa bands were detected when cells were transfected with a vector without SCAD cDNA insert (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and8), illustrating that the observed bands indeed represent overexpressed mature and precursor SCAD, respectively. Interestingly the amount of precursor WT and mutant proteins obtained from cells incubated with rhodamine 6G is decreased compared with the observed amount of proteolytically processed WT and mutant proteins in cells without rhodamine 6G treatment, indicating that the half-life of the precursor in the cytosol is markedly shorter than that of the matured forms within the mitochondria. In support of this notion, it has previously been shown that the half-life of the matured SCAD enzyme in intact cultivated rat liver cells was much longer than that of the corresponding precursor (9Ikeda Y. Keese S.M. Fenton W.A. Tanaka K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, the pulse-labeling data support the hypothesis that the two mutant SCAD proteins are synthesized in normal amounts and efficiently transported into mitochondria. The lack of detection of the two mutant SCAD proteins at steady state at 37 °C, observed in Fig.1, therefore cannot be due to cytoplasmic degradation or defective transport into mitochondria. As the kinetic stability of the correctly folded enzyme variants is indistinguishable from that of WT (see above), we hypothesize that the disappearance is caused by increased intramitochondrial degradation of partly folded or misfolded intermediates. In order to test this hypothesis, pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments in transfected COS-7 cells cultivated at two different temperatures (37 °C and 26 °C) were performed. In all cases the initial counts were normalized to 100% (Fig.5). In cells expressing WT protein at 37 °C the intensity of the fluorographic band for mature SCAD decreased only slightly with time, and after 3 h the signal was approximately 80% of the signal immediately after the pulse labeling (Fig. 5 A). However, in cells transfected with either SCAD R22C or R22W cDNAs, the bands corresponding to the two mutant proteins were clearly diminished at 15 min to approximately 40%. After 1 h only approximately 20% of the SCAD R22C and R22W proteins were left, and after 3 h the R22W and R22C bands were almost unchanged compared with those detected at 1 h (Fig.5 A). At 26 °C the turnover of SCAD WT was similar to that observed at 37 °C (Fig. 5, A and B). If the failure to detect the two SCAD mutant proteins at steady state (Fig. 1) was due to degradation of unstable intermediates, improved folding conditions should increase the cellular level of R22C and R22W SCAD mutants. In fact, as shown in Fig. 5 B, we found that reduced cultivation temperature increased the intramitochondrial level of SCAD R22C and R22W compared with the level detected at physiological temperature. The intensity of both mutant proteins was approximately 70% after 15 min of chase. However, after 30 min the intensity of the R22W band was decreased to a lower level than that of R22C. After 1 h the rapid elimination phase of the two mutant bands had almost stopped, and at 3 h the intensities of the R22C and R22W bands were approximately 45% and 10%, respectively. This indicates that the mutations strongly affect the kinetic stability of the mutant proteins at some stage in the folding pathway, and that this effect is to some extent compensated by reduced cultivation temperature. To pinpoint the intracellular localization of the SCAD R22C and R22W mutant proteins, double-labeling with the anti-rat SCAD antibody and a monoclonal antibody directed against human hsp60 followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells was performed (Fig.6). Analysis of cells cultivated at 26 °C revealed in all cases a typical mitochondrial staining pattern, and no other subcellular structure was labeled. No mitochondrial staining was observed in cells transfected with vector without SCAD cDNA insert (data not shown). Furthermore, our results showed complete co-localization between SCAD and hsp60 immunoreactivity, demonstrating that mutant SCAD and hsp60 produced at 26 °C co-localize in mitochondria. These data further corroborate our hypothesis that SCAD R22C and R22W mutant proteins are imported and processed in the mitochondrial matrix. The data presented indicate strongly that substitution of the conserved arginine-22 in SCAD with either tryptophan or cysteine compromises biogenesis and/or turnover of these proteins, as evidenced by the negligible amounts of mutant proteins detectable in transfected cells cultivated at 37 °C. The aim of the present investigation was to elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved in the handling of these missense mutant SCAD proteins. SCAD and MCAD are mitochondrial matrix proteins and participate in the fatty acid β-oxidation spiral. The biogenesis and turnover of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial SCAD and MCAD matrix proteins involves a series of steps, all of which may be influenced by mutations. However, missense mutations in genes involved in the fatty acid oxidation very rarely compromise the transcription of the gene and the maturation of the RNA transcript (14Andresen B.S. Bross P. Jensen T.G. Winter V. Knudsen I. Kølvraa S. Jensen U.B. Bolund L. Duran M. Kim J.J. Curtis D. Divry P. Vianey-Saban C. Gregersen N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 730-739PubMed Google Scholar, 16Naito E. Ozasa H. Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Andresen B.S. Vianey-Saban C. Bross P. Divry P. Roe C.R. Nada M.A. Knudsen I. Gregersen N. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the 136 C→T transition leading to the R22W substitution is localized distally to the exon-intron boundaries (34Corydon M.J. Andresen B.S. Bross P. Kjeldsen M. Andreasen P.H. Eiberg H. Kølvraa S. Gregersen N. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this mutation would not be expected to affect maturation of the precursor mRNA. We therefore reasoned that the primary pathogenic defect in the two SCAD mutant proteins investigated here resides in their biogenesis. To elucidate the mechanisms involved we have transfected COS-7 cells with cDNA containing the two SCAD missense mutations. Northern blot analysis of the transfected COS-7 cells cultivated at 37 °C revealed no difference in the levels of SCAD mRNA from the mutant and WT SCAD cDNAs and showed that the defective mechanism is post-transcriptional. The post-transcriptional processes are: 1) translation of the mRNA to the 44-kDa pSCAD; 2) targeting to and transport through the mitochondrial membrane and maturation of pSCAD to the 41.7-kDa mature SCAD; 3) folding and assembly of the mature SCAD to the tetrameric functional SCAD; and 4) degradation of the tetrameric SCAD protein. Our investigations have pinpointed the defective site in the biogenesis pathway of the SCAD R22W and R22C mutant proteins to folding of the polypeptide chains. The evidence is based on the following experimental findings. First, both SCAD R22W and R22C mutant proteins are synthesized as the 44-kDa precursor form, imported into mitochondria, and processed to the mature 41.7-kDa form in a normal fashion. Second, the elimination of the imported mutant proteins is biphasic (Fig. 5). At 37 °C the initial phase is very fast and proceeds nearly to complete elimination before reaching the second phase, which seems to parallel the kinetics of the WT protein. At 26 °C the initial phase is slower and the second phase is reached at a higher level, from which the elimination parallels the WT. The elimination rate in the initial phase is thus temperature-dependent and the amounts of rescued mutant SCAD proteins are also dependent on the cultivation temperature. The temperature effect is possibly a combination of both slowing productive folding and misfolding pathways as well as the rate of degradation. Third, following a lowering of the cultivation temperature the steady-state SCAD activity from the R22W and R22C mutant proteins increases from negligible up to approximately 6% and 20% of WT activity, respectively. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy of immunostained cells showed that the mutant SCAD proteins are localized intramitochondrially. Thus, there is a correlation between the increase in the protein amounts left for the second phase in the pulse-chase experiments and the amount of rescued intramitochondrial enzyme in the steady-state experiments. We therefore conclude that the majority of the SCAD protein detected in the second phase represents active tetrameric SCAD and that the steep slope in the initial phase of the pulse-chase experiment is due to impaired folding of the SCAD mutant proteins and a rapid elimination of folding intermediates at some stage in the folding pathway. This interpretation of the results is supported by the normal kinetic stability of the tetrameric functional SCAD mutant proteins at low cultivation temperature, which indicates that the degradation rate of the tetramers is not affected. In a similar fashion, it has been shown that temperature-sensitive folding mutations in, for example, the phage P22 tail spike and coat proteins, which show stability identical to that of WT, can be rescued by lowering the cultivation temperature (35Mitraki A. Danner M. King J. Seckler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20071-20075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interpretation of our results is compatible with the emerging view of the biogenesis pathway and quality control concept for mitochondrial proteins (20Langer T. Neupert W. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view it has been shown that the homologous MCAD protein, upon import into the mitochondria, first forms an intermediary complex with the mitochondrial hsp70 chaperone before it is handed over to the hsp60 chaperonin which, in cooperation with the co-chaperonin hsp10, assists folding to the native structure (13Saijo T. Welch W.J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work on the bacterial hsp60/10 homologues GroEL and GroES (for review, see Refs. 37Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar and 38Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar) has suggested that hsp60/10-assisted folding occurs through iterative rounds of binding in the cavity of the chaperonin ring complex and ATP-driven release of fully or partly folded polypeptide chains. After release from the chaperonin, polypeptide chains committed to the native state do not rebind to the chaperonin, whereas partly folded or misfolded chains may bind again and try a second round. During each round a certain percentage of the protein is fully folded, implying that another fraction, which is not folded to the final structure, may be susceptible to proteolytic attacks. It can be inferred from this model that mutations which impair folding will decrease the fraction of the protein that is fully folded after each round. This may in turn result in a larger fraction of partly folded or misfolded chains that at any time is complexed with the chaperonins, as has been observed for the MCAD K304E mutant (13Saijo T. Welch W.J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4401-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, co-overexpression of the GroESL chaperonins and a series of missense mutant SCAD (G185S) and MCAD (K304E and R28C) proteins inE. coli has shown that increasing the pool of chaperonins increases the fraction of these proteins that acquire the native structure (5Andresen B.S.

Our observation that the elimination rate of the SCAD R22W and R22C mutant proteins is slowed by lowering the temperature and that the rescued fraction of mutant proteins is increased support the concept of a mitochondrial protein quality control system, as has been proposed by Langer and Neupert (20Langer T. Neupert W. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because only negligible amounts of the SCAD mutant proteins “escape” the quality control system at physiological temperature and because they can only be partially rescued by cultivating the cells at 26 °C, we believe that the two SCAD mutations investigated here can be considered as severe folding mutations. Conversely, we have characterized a SCAD R147W mutation in a number of patients with SCAD deficiency that may be considered as a mild folding mutation (39Gregersen N. Winter V. Corydon M.J. Corydon T.J. Rinaldo P. Ribes A. Martinez G. Bennett M.J. Vianey-Saban C. Bhala A. Hale D.E. Lehnert W. Kmoch S. Roig M. Riudor E. Eiberg H. Andresen B.S. Bross P. Bolund L. Kølvraa S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This mutant protein, which actually represents a polymorphic variant with an allele frequency of 8% in the general population, displays a steady-state SCAD activity in transfected COS-7 cells of 45% of WT at 37 °C. At 26 °C the activity can be rescued to 85% of WT activity. This illustrates that the cellular handling of missense mutations may be quite different for different mutations. Taken together, we have demonstrated that the two SCAD mutant variants studied here are subjected to rapid intramitochondrial degradation of partly folded or misfolded intermediates and that they can be partially rescued in intact cells by lowering the cultivation temperature. Furthermore, the study has indicated that a matrix-located mitochondrial protein quality control system is involved in the cellular handling of certain SCAD mutant proteins.

Mitochondria from mammals and yeast contain two homologous enzymes: (i) an active MPP within the mitochondrial matrix and (ii) an inactive MPP within the cytochromec reductase complex. To elucidate the evolution of MPP, the cytochrome c reductase complexes from lower plants were isolated and tested for processing activity.

An evolutionary model is suggested that assumes a correlation between the presence of an active MPP within the cytochromec reductase complex and the occurrence of chloroplasts. The mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase (also called the bc 1 complex or complex III) is a multisubunit enzyme of the respiratory chain that catalyzes reduction of cytochrome c by oxidation of ubiquinol. Coupled to this reaction, it translocates protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the space between the two mitochondrial membranes and thereby contributes to the chemiosmotic gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The function of cytochrome c reductase is based on three subunits, which are directly involved in electron transport: cytochromes b and c 1 and the “Rieske” iron-sulfur protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In several bacteria, the bc 1 complex only contains these three so-called “respiratory” subunits. However, all mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase complexes characterized so far comprise six to eight additional subunits, the functions of which are not entirely understood. Two of them are large and have molecular masses around 50 kDa, whereas four to six are small (<15 kDa). The primary structures of the large subunits, which are traditionally called the “core I” and “core II” proteins, are known for man, beef, yeast, potato, and Euglena (reviewed in Ref. 3Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both core proteins are located on the matrix exposed side of cytochrome c reductase, as revealed by electron microscopy of membrane crystals from Neurospora crassa (4Leonard K. Wingfield P. Arad T.

Mutational analysis of the two core proteins from yeast revealed involvement of both subunits in assembly of the multisubunit complex (6Oudshoorn P. van Steeg H. Swinkels B.W. Schoppink P.

The two core subunits exhibit some sequence similarity. Furthermore their primary structures resemble the sequences of the two subunits of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; BN, Blue-native; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane.; α- and β-subunits), which is a heterodimeric matrix-localized enzyme that removes presequences of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins upon their transport into the organelle (reviewed in Refs. 9Brunner M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1043-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, in potato, the two core subunits of cytochrome c reductase even represent the subunits of MPP and the cytochrome creductase complex from this plant is a highly active processing peptidase (12Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The same results have been shown for cytochromec reductase from spinach and wheat (13Eriksson A.C. Sjo¨ling S. Glaser E Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 221-231Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Bo¨dicker M. Schmitz U.K. Planta. 1995; 195: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An intermediate situation was found in N. crassa; the core I protein has β-MPP activity, whereas the α-subunit of MPP is localized in the mitochondrial matrix (15Schulte U. Arretz M. Schneider H. Tropschug M. Wachter E. Neupert W. Weiss H. Nature. 1989; 339: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Weiss H. Leonard K. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 178-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These molecular data can be explained by an evolutionary model, which was suggested recently (3Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Braun H.P. Jänsch L. Schmitz U.K. Hopsu-Havu V.K. Järvinen M. Kirschke H. Proteolysis and Protein Turnover. IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 290-297Google Scholar). (i) Early in evolution, MPP developed starting from a preexisting bacterial protease and became part of the cytochrome c reductase complex; (ii) later in evolution, the two subunits of MPP became detached from the enzyme complex to allow independent regulation of protein processing and respiration in some organisms; (iii) the detachment was realized by gene duplications, because due to the co-evolution of cytochrome c reductase and MPP, the two subunits of MPP became indispensable for assembly of this respiratory protein complex. From the perspective of this model, the core subunits are relics of an ancient processing peptidase and the bifunctional cytochrome c reductase complex in plants represents a situation that was originally present in the mitochondria from all organisms. To test this model on the co-evolution of the cytochrome creductase complex and the mitochondrial processing peptidase, we decided to analyze the processing activity of cytochrome creductase from lower plants. A micro-isolation procedure is employed for the purification of cytochrome c reductase from the staghorn fern Platycerium bifurcatum, from the horsetailEquisetum arvense, and from the alga Polytomella, which is based on organelle preparations, Blue-native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), and electroelution. We present data on the subunit composition and the function of the purified cytochromec reductase complexes. Interestingly, the enzyme complexes from P. bifurcatum and E. arvense exhibit highly specific processing activity, whereas cytochrome c reductase from Polytomella is proteolytically inactive. Evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed. Mitochondria from potato tubers were isolated as described in Ref. 18Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. The organelles were suspended in 0.4m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, at a concentration of 10 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml. For the purification of the bc 1 complex by BN-PAGE, 100 μl of purified mitochondria were used per lane. Polytomella ssp. (198.80, E. G. Pringsheim) was obtained from the “SAG-Sammlung von Algenkulturen” at the University of Go¨ttingen (Go¨ttingen, Germany) and was grown in 2.5-liter culture flasks without shaking in the dark using the medium described by Schlo¨sser (19Schlo¨sser U.G. SAG-Sammlung von Algenkulturen Catalogue of Strains 1994: BOACEJ. 3. University of G, 1994: 113-186Google Scholar) at 25 °C. Mitochondria were isolated basically as described in Ref. 20Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. VaÖzquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. GonzaÖlez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The resulting crude mitochondria were washed with 0.4 mmannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and purified by Percoll step gradient centrifugation (14%, 22%, 45% Percoll in 0.4m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2) at 70,000 × g for 45 min. Pure mitochondrial fraction was washed twice; resuspended in 0.4 m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, at a concentration of 2 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml; and divided into aliquots of 200 μl. Plants were obtained from the greenhouse of the “Berggarten” at the University of Hannover. The young round, barren leaves (“mantle” leaves) were separated from the plants and cut into small pieces. All subsequent steps of mitochondria isolation were carried out at 4 °C. Pieces of leaves were homogenized three times in two volumes of 0.4 mmannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 15.0 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mm PMSF, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, for 3 s using a Waring blender. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of muslin. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. To obtain the mitochondrial fraction, the supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in 0.4 m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2; homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer; and purified by Percoll step gradient centrifugation (14%, 26%, 45% Percoll in 0.4m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, at 70,000 × g for 45 min). Mitochondria formed two light brown bands in the 26% phase. They were washed twice in resuspension buffer, solved at a concentration of 1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml, and divided into aliquots of 600 μl. Wild plants were used. Mitochondria were isolated from the etiolated part of the stems from vegetative shoots, which are located near to the surface of the soil. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The brown, silicified epidermis was peeled off. Stems were homogenized by grinding in a mortar in 10 volumes of 0.4 m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 15.0 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mm PMSF, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.8. Subsequent steps of differential centrifugation and Percoll step gradient centrifugation were carried out as described above for isolating mitochondria from P. bifurcatum. Mitochondria formed a light, reddish brown band in the 26% phase of the gradient. The mitochondria were removed, washed twice, and finally solved in 0.4 m mannitol, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, at a concentration of ~1.5 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml. Aliquots of 300 μl were used as starting material of sample preparation for BN-PAGE. Blue-native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sample preparation for BN-PAGE was carried out as described in Ref. 21Jänsch L. Kruft K. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar. Starting points for sample preparation were the obtained aliquots of mitochondria from S. tuberosum,Polytomella spp.,P. bifurcatum, and E. arvense. The mitochondrial protein complexes from each organism were resolved on a separate gel consisting of a stacking gel (4% acrylamide) comprising 10 slots and a separating gel (4.95–12.6% acrylamide), respectively. The blue protein bands representing cytochrome creductase complexes were cut out after BN-PAGE and electroeluted as described in Ref. 22Schägger H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar. Electroelution was performed with the electroelutor/concentrator ECU-040 (CBS Scientific Co., Del Mar, CA) overnight at 150 V and 4 °C with electrode buffer (25 mmTricine, 7.5 mm Bis-Tris, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 7.0). Entire lanes from BN-PAGE with separated native-mitochondrial protein complexes were used for the resolution of subunits and identification of complexes by Tricine-SDS-PAGE as described in Ref.21Jänsch L. Kruft K. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar. Tricine-SDS-PAGE was carried out in the PROTEAN II cell from Bio-Rad (gel dimensions: 20 × 16 × 0.1 cm) according to the protocol published by Schägger and von Jagow (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 μg of electroeluted enzyme complex was mixed with equal volumes of 2× loading buffer (10% SDS, 30% glycerol, 100 mm Tris, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.006% bromphenol blue) and loaded into the slots. The electrophoresis was carried out at 20 °C; it was started at 30 V for 45 min and continued at 30 mA for 16 h. Proteins were either silver-stained or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany) and incubated overnight with 1000-fold diluted antiserum. Visualization of immunopositive proteins was performed as described in Ref. 24Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. In vitro processing of radiolabeled precursor proteins was carried out for 1 h at 28 °C in a final volume of 120 μl, including 88 μl of processing buffer (22 mmTris-HCl, 25 mm NaCl, 0.6% Triton X-100, 1 mmPMSF, 300 μm ZnCl2), 1–4 μl of radiolabeled precursor protein, and about 2 μg of electroeluted cytochrome c reductase. The processing reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated loading buffer (10% SDS, 30% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.006% bromphenol blue). Inhibition of processing activity was carried out by addition of 3 mm EDTA. Processing products were separated by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed with 50% acetic acid, incubated with Amplify (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and exposed to X-OMAT™ films (Eastman Kodak Corp.). The isolation of highly pure mitochondria from plants devoid of chloroplast contaminations is facilitated by the use of etiolated starting material like tubers or dark grown seedlings. Hence, most biochemical studies on plant mitochondria were carried out with organelles from potato tuber or etiolated seedlings from different higher plants. However, lower plants lack suitable etiolated tissues for the preparation of mitochondria. The starting materials for our investigation were mantle leaves from the staghorn fern P. bifurcatum, which have a reduced content of chloroplasts, and subterranean parts of stems from the horsetail E. arvense. Furthermore, the colorless algaePolytomella spp. was used for isolating mitochondria, which is related to Chlamydomonas but lacks chloroplasts. Mitochondria from potato tuber were prepared as control organelles. Procedures for the isolation of mitochondria from potato andPolytomella were adapted from preexisting protocols (18Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,20Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. VaÖzquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. GonzaÖlez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the method for the purification of fern and horsetail mitochondria was newly established (see “Experimental Procedures”). Owing to limited starting material, the overall amount of organelles was low for the fern and the horsetail. Therefore, a micro-isolation procedure was used for the purification of respiratory enzyme complexes, which is based on BN-PAGE and electroelution. BN-PAGE is a powerful tool for the separation of membrane-bound protein complexes (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar); proteins are solubilized under mild conditions using non-ionic detergents, and Coomassie dyes are employed to introduce charge shifts on the polypeptides prior to electrophoresis. A two-dimensional resolution of mitochondrial protein complexes from P. bifurcatum, E. arvense, and Polytomella spp. is shown in Fig. 1. The cytochrome c reductase complexes were identified by their subunit compositions and by immunostaining (see below). Protein bands corresponding to the native cytochromec reductase complexes from potato, P. bifurcatum,E. arvense, and Polytomella spp. were cut out from one-dimensional Blue-native gels and the enzyme complexes were electroeluted. Subsequently, the obtained fractions were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fig.2 shows the subunits of cytochromec reductase complexes from all four organisms after the electroelution step. The resolved cytochrome c reductase complexes were blotted onto membrane filters and analyzed by immunostaining with antibodies directed against the core I protein and the iron-sulfur protein (Fig. 3). Some additional further protein bands were identified by direct protein sequencing (Table I). The combined data from Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table I allow us to draw the following conclusions on the subunit compositions of the purified protein complexes.Figure 3Identification of the core I and the iron-sulfur subunit by immunoblotting. The cytochrome creductase complexes from S. tuberosum (St),P. bifurcatum (Pb), E. arvense(Ea), and Polytomella spp. (Ps) were resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 2 and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.

(i) Cytochrome c reductase from potato, which is a well characterized protein complex (2Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and which was analyzed as a control enzyme complex, comprises 10 subunits (Fig. 2): the core I protein (apparent molecular mass: 56 kDa), the core II protein (52 kDa), cytochrome b (35 kDa), cytochrome c 1(31 kDa), the FeS protein (24 kDa), a “14-kDa” subunit, and four subunits below 10 kDa. (ii) The cytochrome c reductase from P. bifurcatum is contaminated by some subunits of the F0F1-ATP synthase complex (both enzyme complexes have a very similar size on the native gel dimension, see Fig. 1). The core I protein (apparent molecular mass: 53 kDa) was identified by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The core II protein is assumed to migrate just above (Fig. 2,lane 2), as (a) the band at 53 kDa appeared to be a doublet on several gels and (b) the upper part of the band has a brown color on silver-stained gels typical for core II proteins, whereas the lower part of the band has a red-brown color typical for core I proteins. The N-terminal sequence of the 30-kDa band (Table I) exhibits significant sequence identity to the mature N terminus of cytochrome c 1 from potato. The band at 26 kDa strongly cross-reacts with an antiserum directed against the iron-sulfur protein from N. crassa (Fig. 3 B). The N-terminal sequence of the 26-kDa protein was determined by direct protein sequencing but only exhibits low sequence identity to iron-sulfur proteins from other species. However, this result is not unexpected due to the low degree of sequence conservation at the N terminus of iron-sulfur subunits from different organisms. At least three small proteins (apparent molecular masses 14 kDa, two proteins <10 kDa) form part of the cytochrome c reductase complex from P. bifurcatum (Fig. 2, lane 2). For unknown reasons, the cytochrome b subunit of P. bifurcatum could not be detected on the gel in Fig. 2. However, it is highly unlikely that cytochrome b is absent, as it forms the core of the cytochrome c reductase complexes and as the apparent molecular mass of the dimeric protein complex from P. bifurcatum lies at 500 kDa on native gels (data not shown) in accordance with the molecular mass of cytochrome c reductase complexes from other organisms (2Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). (iii) The cytochrome c reductase complex from the horsetailE. arvense could be obtained in highly pure form (Fig. 2) and comprises 10 subunits: the core I and core II proteins (apparent molecular masses: 53 kDa), cytochrome b (36 kDa), cytochromec 1 (32 kDa), the FeS protein (26 kDa), the 14-kDa protein (which runs at 15 kDa), and four proteins below 10 kDa. The core I protein was identified by immunoblotting (Fig.3 A), cytochrome c 1 by direct protein sequencing (Table I), and the FeS protein by protein sequencing and immunoblotting (Table I, Fig. 3 B). The core II protein most likely has a molecular mass identical to the core I protein, as the 53-kDa band seemed to be a doublet on several gels (data not shown). The first 20 amino acids of the second smallest subunit of cytochromec reductase from E. arvense could be determined by cyclic Edman degradation. The protein exhibits 65% sequence identity to the potato 8.2-kDa subunit of the cytochrome creductase complex, which is homologous to the yeast qcr8 gene product. (iv) Likewise, the cytochrome c reductase complex fromPolytomella spp. was isolated in very pure form (Fig. 2) and could be resolved into nine different subunits: core I protein (53 kDa), core II protein (49 kDa), cytochromes b andc 1 at 32 kDa, FeS protein (24 kDa), 14-kDa protein, and three or more subunits below 12 kDa. Cytochromec reductase from this organism was purified before by GonzaÖlez-Halphen and co-workers (20Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. VaÖzquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. GonzaÖlez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and similar values were reported for the molecular weights of the subunits. The identities of the subunits were determined by direct protein sequencing and immunoblotting (20Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. VaÖzquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. GonzaÖlez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GonzaÖlez-Halphen and co-workers were able to resolve one more small subunit below 12 kDa. To investigate whether the purified cytochromec reductase complexes include the activity of the mitochondrial processing peptidase, an in vitro processing assay was carried out using two radiolabeled mitochondrial precursor proteins: the β subunit of the ATP synthase complex and the FeS protein of cytochrome c reductase (Fig.4). Both precursor proteins are converted into their mature form when incubated with cytochrome creductase complex from potato, which was shown previously to be an efficient processing peptidase (12Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Potato MPP is a metallopeptidase, and the processing reaction can be inhibited by the metal chelator EDTA (Fig. 4, lanes 2). Identical results were obtained with the isolated cytochrome c reductase complexes from P. bifurcatum and E. arvense. Both enzyme complexes efficiently process the tested precursor proteins into their mature forms in the absence of EDTA (Fig. 4, lanes 3–6). In contrast, cytochrome c reductase from Polytomellaspp. did not exhibit detectable processing activity. Hence, the cytochrome c reductase complexes from potato, P. bifurcatum, and E. arvense do contain both subunits of MPP, whereas Polytomella spp. lacks at least one of the MPP proteins. Blue-native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been shown here to be a suitable method for the isolation of mitochondrial protein complexes from P. bifurcatum, E. arvense andPolytomella. The procedure is especially valuable if the starting material for organelle preparations is limited. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a biochemical preparation of a mitochondrial enzyme from a fern or a horsetail. The cytochromec reductase complexes from E. arvense andPolytomella could be obtained in highly pure form, whereas the cytochrome c reductase complex from the fern P. bifurcatum was contaminated by subunits of the ATP synthase complex. Cytochrome c reductase complexes from three very different eukaryotes (beef, yeast, and potato) have been studied extensively (2Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,27Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Brandt U. Uribe S. Schägger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12947-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three enzyme complexes comprise 10 subunits: 3 respiratory proteins, 2 large core proteins, and 5 small polypeptides. In beef, the presequence of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is retained in the cytochrome c reductase complex after proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein and is considered to be an eleventh subunit (29Borchart U. Machleidt W. Schägger H. Link T.A. von Jagow G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,30Brandt U. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8387-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the cytochrome c reductase complex fromE. arvense comprises 10 subunits, which have molecular weights very similar to the one reported for potato. The same number of subunits was reported for the cytochrome c reductase complex from Polytomella (20Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. VaÖzquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. GonzaÖlez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome c reductase complex, which differs remarkably from the structure of the corresponding prokaryotic protein complex, seems to be highly conserved in very different organisms and most likely evolved early in the development of the eukaryotic cell. The electron transfer activities of the cytochrome creductase complexes from potato, P. bifurcatum, E. arvense, and Polytomella prepared by Blue-native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution were not measured, but there are several indications that the enzyme complexes are intact and most likely active. (i) The iron-sulfur protein, which easily dissociates from cytochrome creductase complexes causing low enzymatic activity, forms part of all four cytochrome c reductase complexes as monitored by direct protein sequencing and immunoblotting; (ii) the apparent molecular masses of the cytochrome c reductase complexes from potato,P. bifurcatum, and E. arvense complexes during native gel electrophoresis was in the range of 500 kDa (data not shown), which is similar to the values reported for the intact dimeric cytochrome c reductase complexes from yeast and beef (2Braun H.P. Schmitz U.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Only the enzyme complex from Polytomella had a smaller size, which is in line with previous reports (20Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. VaÖzquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. GonzaÖlez-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9147-9154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the mitochondrial processing peptidase was shown to reside within the mitochondrial matrix in yeast, Neurospora, and rat (31Yang M. Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. Oppliger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 32Hawlitschek G. Schneider H. Schmidt B. Tropschug M. Hartl F.U. Neupert W.

In vitro processing assays with the isolated cytochrome c reductase complexes from yeast,Neurospora, and beef revealed no detectable processing activity of this respiratory enzyme complex (14Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Bo¨dicker M. Schmitz U.K. Planta. 1995; 195: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the MPP activity forms part of cytochrome c reductase in all plants investigated so far: potato, spinach, and wheat (12Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Eriksson A.C. Sjo¨ling S. Glaser E Biochim. Biophys.

These experimental findings are in line with the sequence data presently available for the large subunits of the cytochrome creductase complex, the so-called core subunits (Fig.5). The core I proteins from man, beef, and yeast exhibit some sequence similarity to β-MPP subunits from different organisms, but they have an incomplete inverse zinc-binding motif, which was shown to be essential for the proteolytic activity of MPP (34Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Striebel H.M. Rysavy P. Adamec J. Spizek J. Kalousek J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Similarily, the sequences of the core II subunit from man, beef, and yeast resemble α-MPP sequences from various organisms, but lack a highly conserved stretch of uncharged amino acids, which is present in all α-MPP proteins sequenced so far and which is believed to be a prerequisite for the function of α-MPP in protein processing (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, the core I protein from potato includes a complete inverse zinc-binding motif and the core II protein from this organism comprises the characteristic uncharged “α-MPP domain” (12Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3219-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Emmermann M. Braun H.P. Arretz M. Schmitz U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18936-18942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fungusNeurospora represents an intermediate situation; the core I protein has an inverse zinc-binding motif, but the core II protein lacks the α-MPP domain. 2S. Brumme, U. K. Schmitz, and H.-P. Braun, unpublished data.Hence, the cytochrome c reductase complex fromNeurospora does not exhibit processing activity (14Braun H.P. Emmermann M. Kruft V. Bo¨dicker M. Schmitz U.K. Planta. 1995; 195: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Schulte U. Arretz M. Schneider H. Tropschug M. Wachter E. Neupert W. Weiss H. Nature. 1989; 339: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cytochrome c reductase complex fromEuglena, which was not tested for processing activity so far, seems to represent such an intermediate situation; a zinc-binding motif is present in the the core I protein but no α-MPP domain in the core II protein (Fig. 5, A and B). Processing activity of cytochrome c reductase complexes from three other plants: the fern P. bifurcatum, the horsetailE. arvense, and the colorless alga Polytomella, was tested. In agreement with the data from other plants, cytochromec reductase from the fern and the horsetail comprise processing activity, whereas the enzyme complex from the colorless algaPolytomella has no proteolytic activity. These data allow us to draw some new conclusions on the evolution of the MPP subunits and the core proteins. To date, experimental or structural data on the proteolytic activity of the large subunits of cytochrome creductase complexes from 12 organisms are known: the vertebrata man, beef, and rat; the fungi yeast and Neurospora; the plants potato, spinach, wheat, P. bifurcatum, and E. arvense; and the nongreen algae Polytomella andEuglena. It is generally accepted that mitochondria arose from purple bacteria and have a monophyletic origin (37Gray M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 38Lang B.F. Burger G. O'Kelly C.J. Cedergren R. Golding G.B. Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Gray M.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). As MPP is a heterodimer in all organisms investigated so far, the early mitochondria most likely contained α- and β-MPP, which probably both formed part of cytochrome c reductase. This situation is still valid in all plants. In other organisms, one or two gene duplications occurred, which were the prerequisite for the development of a MPP enzyme in the soluble mitochondrial fraction: (i) a duplication of the α-MPP protein, which gave rise to the core II protein, and (ii) a duplication of the β-MPP protein, which gave rise to the core I protein. Both gene duplications occurred in mammals and yeast, one duplication in Neurospora,Euglena, and probably Polytomella. Considering the current knowledge about the phylogeny of eukaryotes, these duplications must have taken place several times independently. This is in line with very recent findings that duplication of entire genomes occurred in the evolution of several higher eukaryotes like vertebrata or yeast (39Spring J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 40Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The question is: why did these genome duplications lead to the evolution of core subunits in some organisms but not in others? Interestingly, all organisms that comprise proteolytically inactive core subunits and a soluble matrix-localized MPP are non-green organisms, which generally or temporarily lack chloroplasts. Possibly, the presence of chloroplasts, a second organelle involved in the bioenergetics of the cell, alleviated the evolutionary pressure on plant mitochondria, so that a soluble MPP was dispensable. Plant mitochondria have unique functions in the metabolism of the green cell, which seem not to require an independent regulation of respiration and protein processing. Investigation of cytochrome c reductase from further organisms may give further insights into the co-evolution of this respiratory enzyme complex and the subunits of MPP.

https://openalex.org/W1995891481,"The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is activated by ionizing radiation and certain other DNA-damaging agents. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene product, effectors in the DNA damage response, contribute to the induction of c-Abl activity. The present study demonstrates that c-Abl is expressed in mouse and rat testes, and predominantly in pachytene spermatocytes of meiosis I. The results also demonstrate that c-Abl interacts directly with meiotic chromosomes. In concert with a requirement for c-Abl at the pachytene stage, we show that, in contrast to wild-type mice, testes from Abl-/- mice exhibit defects in spermatogenesis. These findings provide the first demonstration that c-Abl plays a functional role in meiosis."

The analyses of ku86-deficient cells, ku86 knockout mice,dna-pkcs-deficient cells, and severe combined immune deficiency (scid) mice demonstrated that the DNA-PK affects the machinery of V(D)J recombination, double strand break repair, and the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (19Fulop G.M. Phillips R.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Taccioli G.E. Rathbun G. Oltz E. Stamato T. Jeggo P.A. Alt F.W.

The role of DNA-PK in the above mechanisms remains to be elucidated on the molecular level.While both ku86 and dna-pkcs-deficient cells are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation, they exhibit different phenotypes in the joint formation of V(D)J recombination. Both joint formation steps, i.e. coding joint and signal joint formation, are defective in ku86-deficient cells (xrs-6 and lymphocytes derived from ku86 knockout mice). In contrast, dna-pkcs-deficient cells (scid, V3 and irs-20) retain the ability to form correct signal joint even though they are inflicted with a severe defect in coding joint formation (22Lieber M.R.

Recently, however, it was suggested in a study on equine scid caused by the aberration of the DNA-PKcs molecule that not only coding joint formation but also signal joint was severely impaired (25Shin E.K. Perryman L.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3565-3569PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wiler R. Leber R. Moore B.B. VanDyk L.F. Perryman L.E. Meek K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Detailed studies on V(D)J recombination using DNA-PK mutants will help to clarify how DNA-PK holoenzyme and/or DNA-PKcs molecule itself contributes to joint formation of V(D)J recombination and double strand break repair.We previously established the radiosensitive cell line SX9 from the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line FM3A by treatment withN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (27Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar). Employing the cell fusion technique, we found that SX9 cells belong to a complementation group different from that of radiosensitive mammalian cell lines irs-1,2,3 and L5178Y-S (28Sato K. Chen D.J. Eguchi-Kasai K. Itsukaichi H. Odaka T. Strniste G.F. J. Radiat. Res. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 36: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of the responsible gene and mutation for the SX9 cell line.DISCUSSIONThe defect of DNA-PK activity in SX9 cells was suggested. Furthermore, our complementation test using DNA-PK defective cell lines by the cell fusion technique indicated that cell lines SX9 andxrs-6 (XRCC5) belong to different complementation groups and that cell lines SX9 and V3 (XRCC7) are in the same group. Recently, a similar observation was reported on the basis of in vitro assay (30Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).To verify the fact that SX9 belongs to XRCC7, we compared the dna-pkcs cDNA sequence isolated from SX9 and the control cell line SR-1 and found a T to C transition in the SX9dna-pkcs gene at nucleotide number 9572 (Fig.2 B). None of the other mutations was found in the open reading frame. The mutation could be identified in thedna-pkcs cDNA of SX9 cells but in that of neither SR-1 cells nor SX10 cells (Fig. 2 C). Our investigation indicates the responsibility of identified T to C transition for SX9 abnormal phenotype.Interestingly, the analyses using genomic DNA demonstrated that the mutation occurs in only one allele (Fig. 3). The phenomenon that mRNA is transcribed from only one allele while the other allele is silent was also demonstrated in the ku86 gene locus ofku86-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines (18Singleton B.K. Priestley A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S.P. Lehmann A.R. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,35Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Referred to as “functional hemizygosity,” it is often observed in rodent cells (36Gupta R.S. Chan D.Y. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1978; 14: 1007-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Indeed, revertant exhibiting radio-resistant phenotype of SX9 is observed during long-term culture.The identified T to C transition on 9572 in the dna-pkcsgene results in substitution of leucine (3191) to proline. Conformational change of the protein molecule may occur because the rotation of peptide bond of proline residue is severely restricted. Proline residue is virtually nonpermissive for conservative change during evolution.The relationship between quantity and activity of DNA-PKcs products in cell lines SR-1, SX9, and SX10 was analyzed. The cell line SX10 exhibits a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation but a normal level of DNA-PK activity. Intriguingly, the quantity of DNA-PKcs molecules decreases to about one-half in SX10 as well as SX9 cells. However, it was shown that DNA-PK activity in SX10 cells is indistinguishable from that in normal cells (30Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR of thedna-pkcs gene in SR-1, SX9 cell lines, and SX10 supports this observation (Fig. 2 A). These investigations indicate that the reduction of DNA-PK activity in SX9 cells cannot be explained by the moderate reduction of its quantity. We conclude that the identified leucine to proline substitution in DNA-PKcs products is responsible for the aberration of SX9 cells.The next question is how this mutation causes the radiosensitivity. To address this issue, we tested the V(D)J recombination in SX9 cells. The coding joint formation was severely impaired. The recombination frequency was reduced to less than 1/13. On the other hand, the frequency and the fidelity of signal joint formation are also reduced in SX9 cells. The frequency decreased to approximately 1/10 that of the parent cell. Moreover, ApaLI positive clones generated by precise joint formation were reduced to 12.2% of total recombined clones (Table I). These observations are somewhat different from those in other previously reported dna-pkcs-deficient cell lines such as scid, V3, and irs-20. In those cell lines, the coding joint formation is drastically impaired although the signal joint formation is nearly equal to normal control or only slightly reduced. Therefore, the drastic reduction of the fidelity of signal joint formation in SX9 is especially noteworthy. In that regard, SX9 cells resemble ku86-deficient mutant cells, xrs-6 rather than dna-pkcs-deficient cells. Both coding joint and signal joint formation are impaired in xrs-6 cells (16Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar).In detailed analyses, DNA sequence of 86 ApaLI negative signal joints demonstrated that almost all of the recombinations in the clones prepared from rag-introduced SX9 cells took place within the RSS (Fig. 4, A and B). Another interesting point is that the deletions in signal joint in SX9 cells occurred symmetrically as shown in Fig. 4, A andB. This finding suggests that the deletion took place when the two RSSs were assembled together and protected by some protein, because two intermediates, including RSS, with 23 or 12 spacers exist separately and are independently attacked by some exonuclease, deletion from the border of RSS by exonuclease activity may occur independently and the deletion in signal joint may not occur in a symmetric manner.Recently, equine scid was reported as a mutant with a defect in signal joint formation as well as in coding joint formation (26Wiler R. Leber R. Moore B.B. VanDyk L.F. Perryman L.E. Meek K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, detailed analyses strongly suggested that thedna-pkcs gene is the responsible gene for equinescid, and the point mutation just upstream from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain making the nonsense codon resulting in the truncation of the product was suggested as a candidate for the responsible genetic aberration (25Shin E.K. Perryman L.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3565-3569PubMed Google Scholar). Complete determination of the equine scid dna-pkcs gene sequence will shed light on the precise mechanism.V(D)J recombination in SX9 and previously reported DNA-PKcs-deficient cell lines is shown (Table II). The mutation of SX9 and equine scid exist just upstream from the conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain in DNA-PKcs but the mutation of mouse scid exists downstream from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain (Fig.6). These findings suggest the crucial role of protein kinase activity in DNA-PKcs for signal joint formation.Table IIV(D)J recombination activity of radiosensitive mutantsMutant/parent cell lineSignal jointCoding joint Relative frequency2-cRearrangement of the substrate was assessed by PCR analysis.ReferenceMutationReferenceRelative frequency2-aFrequency was assessed by ampicillin-chloramphenicol resistant assay with extrachromosomal vectors and normalized using each parental cell lines.Fidelity2-bPrecise signal joint was assessed with ApaLI digestion.%SX9/SR-10.10120.03This studyDNA-PKcs 3191Leu → ProThis studyMurine SCID0.1~1.050~80<0.0120, 22DNA-PKcs 4046Tyr → ter11–13V3/AA80.54600.0224DNA-PKcs, not identifiedirs-20/CHO-10B20.10800.0323DNA-PKcs, not identifiedEquine SCID2-cRearrangement of the substrate was assessed by PCR analysis.26DNAPKcs, 5-bp deletion → frame shift25xrs-6/CHO-K10.04140.0120Ku80 13-bp insertion → frame shift17, 182-a Frequency was assessed by ampicillin-chloramphenicol resistant assay with extrachromosomal vectors and normalized using each parental cell lines.2-b Precise signal joint was assessed with ApaLI digestion.2-c Rearrangement of the substrate was assessed by PCR analysis. Open table in a new tab Although it has not been proved experimentally, it seems likely that the DNA-PK activity in murine scid is partial. Therefore, in murine scid the association and/or activation of other participants (especially XRCC4-ligase IV complex) involved in V(D)J recombination, which is controlled by the kinase activity of DNA-PK, might be stronger than those in SX9. Furthermore, the activation energy for signal joint formation seems to be lower than that for coding joint, since coding joint formation is more complex and may require more proteins than signal joint formation (37Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These may be the reasons why the signal joint formation is normal only in murinescid. In other words, the difference in DNA-PK activity causes the difference in activation of other participants involved in V(D)J recombination. The requirement of activity in the joining step of V(D)J recombination differs between signal and coding joint formation. This hypothesis should be tested.Finally, to confirm the responsibility of DNA-PKcs for SX9 abnormal V(D)J recombination, full-length cDNA of dna-pkcscDNA was introduced into SX9 cells and the V(D)J recombination activity was assessed. Restoration of frequency and fidelity in coding and signal joint formation was observed (Table I and Fig. 5). Although the restoration of frequency was not enough in coding joint and signal joint formation, it seems reasonable because the assay was performed under transient expression of rag-1, -2, assay vector, anddna-pkcs gene. If the probability of simultaneous introduction of these genes is considered, it seems natural that the restoration by the dna-pkcs gene was not complete. We obtained similar results when the full-length dna-pkcs gene constructed in other expression vectors were used (data not shown). Additionally, complete restoration of V(D)J recombination is generally difficult (16Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the scid cell line was introduced by human chromosome 8, in which human dna-pkcsexists, radiosensitivity but not V(D)J recombination was restored completely (data not shown). We are currently trying to determine whether the radiosensitivity, DNA-PK activity, and activation of c-Abl are restored in the stable transformants.To date, murine scid is the only DNA-PKcs-deficient mutant in which DNA sequence has been determined. A candidate for the responsible genetic aberration in dna-pkcs in equinescid was also suggested (25Shin E.K. Perryman L.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3565-3569PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of other DNA-PKcs-deficient mutants at the DNA sequence level are required to elucidate the biological mechanism.SX9 is the second cell line in which the DNA sequence of thedna-pkcs gene was completely determined. This cell line should therefore contribute to a better understanding not only of V(D)J recombination but also of the repair mechanism including double strand break repair. The ionizing radiation-sensitive mammalian cell lines reported to date can be divided into at least six complementation groups (1Caldecott K. Jeggo P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus far, the responsible genes for three of the groups (XRCC4, 5, and 7) have been identified and isolated.

Extensive studies demonstrated the critical role of DNA-PK in following signal transduction in response to ionizing radiation, through the binding of the DNA-PK complex to the double strand break ends caused by DNA damaging agents including ionizing radiation (10Kharbanda S.

DNA-PK holoenzyme consists of Ku70 (70 kDa), Ku86 (86 kDa), and DNA-PKcs (465 kDa). The responsible genes for XRCC5 and XRCC7encode Ku86 and DNA-PKcs molecules, respectively (11Araki R. Fujimori A.

The analyses of ku86-deficient cells, ku86 knockout mice,dna-pkcs-deficient cells, and severe combined immune deficiency (scid) mice demonstrated that the DNA-PK affects the machinery of V(D)J recombination, double strand break repair, and the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (19Fulop G.M. Phillips R.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Taccioli G.E. Rathbun G. Oltz E. Stamato T. Jeggo P.A. Alt F.W.

Cell. 1996; 86: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The role of DNA-PK in the above mechanisms remains to be elucidated on the molecular level. While both ku86 and dna-pkcs-deficient cells are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation, they exhibit different phenotypes in the joint formation of V(D)J recombination. Both joint formation steps, i.e. coding joint and signal joint formation, are defective in ku86-deficient cells (xrs-6 and lymphocytes derived from ku86 knockout mice). In contrast, dna-pkcs-deficient cells (scid, V3 and irs-20) retain the ability to form correct signal joint even though they are inflicted with a severe defect in coding joint formation (22Lieber M.R.

Recently, however, it was suggested in a study on equine scid caused by the aberration of the DNA-PKcs molecule that not only coding joint formation but also signal joint was severely impaired (25Shin E.K. Perryman L.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3565-3569PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wiler R. Leber R. Moore B.B. VanDyk L.F. Perryman L.E. Meek K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Detailed studies on V(D)J recombination using DNA-PK mutants will help to clarify how DNA-PK holoenzyme and/or DNA-PKcs molecule itself contributes to joint formation of V(D)J recombination and double strand break repair. We previously established the radiosensitive cell line SX9 from the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line FM3A by treatment withN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (27Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar). Employing the cell fusion technique, we found that SX9 cells belong to a complementation group different from that of radiosensitive mammalian cell lines irs-1,2,3 and L5178Y-S (28Sato K. Chen D.J. Eguchi-Kasai K. Itsukaichi H. Odaka T. Strniste G.F. J. Radiat. Res. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 36: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification of the responsible gene and mutation for the SX9 cell line. DISCUSSIONThe defect of DNA-PK activity in SX9 cells was suggested. Furthermore, our complementation test using DNA-PK defective cell lines by the cell fusion technique indicated that cell lines SX9 andxrs-6 (XRCC5) belong to different complementation groups and that cell lines SX9 and V3 (XRCC7) are in the same group. Recently, a similar observation was reported on the basis of in vitro assay (30Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).To verify the fact that SX9 belongs to XRCC7, we compared the dna-pkcs cDNA sequence isolated from SX9 and the control cell line SR-1 and found a T to C transition in the SX9dna-pkcs gene at nucleotide number 9572 (Fig.2 B). None of the other mutations was found in the open reading frame. The mutation could be identified in thedna-pkcs cDNA of SX9 cells but in that of neither SR-1 cells nor SX10 cells (Fig. 2 C). Our investigation indicates the responsibility of identified T to C transition for SX9 abnormal phenotype.Interestingly, the analyses using genomic DNA demonstrated that the mutation occurs in only one allele (Fig. 3). The phenomenon that mRNA is transcribed from only one allele while the other allele is silent was also demonstrated in the ku86 gene locus ofku86-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines (18Singleton B.K. Priestley A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S.P. Lehmann A.R. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,35Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Referred to as “functional hemizygosity,” it is often observed in rodent cells (36Gupta R.S. Chan D.Y. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1978; 14: 1007-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Indeed, revertant exhibiting radio-resistant phenotype of SX9 is observed during long-term culture.The identified T to C transition on 9572 in the dna-pkcsgene results in substitution of leucine (3191) to proline. Conformational change of the protein molecule may occur because the rotation of peptide bond of proline residue is severely restricted. Proline residue is virtually nonpermissive for conservative change during evolution.The relationship between quantity and activity of DNA-PKcs products in cell lines SR-1, SX9, and SX10 was analyzed. The cell line SX10 exhibits a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation but a normal level of DNA-PK activity. Intriguingly, the quantity of DNA-PKcs molecules decreases to about one-half in SX10 as well as SX9 cells. However, it was shown that DNA-PK activity in SX10 cells is indistinguishable from that in normal cells (30Peterson S.R. Stackhouse M. Waltman M.J. Chen F. Sato K. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR of thedna-pkcs gene in SR-1, SX9 cell lines, and SX10 supports this observation (Fig. 2 A). These investigations indicate that the reduction of DNA-PK activity in SX9 cells cannot be explained by the moderate reduction of its quantity. We conclude that the identified leucine to proline substitution in DNA-PKcs products is responsible for the aberration of SX9 cells.The next question is how this mutation causes the radiosensitivity. To address this issue, we tested the V(D)J recombination in SX9 cells. The coding joint formation was severely impaired. The recombination frequency was reduced to less than 1/13. On the other hand, the frequency and the fidelity of signal joint formation are also reduced in SX9 cells. The frequency decreased to approximately 1/10 that of the parent cell. Moreover, ApaLI positive clones generated by precise joint formation were reduced to 12.2% of total recombined clones (Table I). These observations are somewhat different from those in other previously reported dna-pkcs-deficient cell lines such as scid, V3, and irs-20. In those cell lines, the coding joint formation is drastically impaired although the signal joint formation is nearly equal to normal control or only slightly reduced. Therefore, the drastic reduction of the fidelity of signal joint formation in SX9 is especially noteworthy. In that regard, SX9 cells resemble ku86-deficient mutant cells, xrs-6 rather than dna-pkcs-deficient cells. Both coding joint and signal joint formation are impaired in xrs-6 cells (16Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar).In detailed analyses, DNA sequence of 86 ApaLI negative signal joints demonstrated that almost all of the recombinations in the clones prepared from rag-introduced SX9 cells took place within the RSS (Fig. 4, A and B). Another interesting point is that the deletions in signal joint in SX9 cells occurred symmetrically as shown in Fig. 4, A andB. This finding suggests that the deletion took place when the two RSSs were assembled together and protected by some protein, because two intermediates, including RSS, with 23 or 12 spacers exist separately and are independently attacked by some exonuclease, deletion from the border of RSS by exonuclease activity may occur independently and the deletion in signal joint may not occur in a symmetric manner.Recently, equine scid was reported as a mutant with a defect in signal joint formation as well as in coding joint formation (26Wiler R. Leber R. Moore B.B. VanDyk L.F. Perryman L.E. Meek K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, detailed analyses strongly suggested that thedna-pkcs gene is the responsible gene for equinescid, and the point mutation just upstream from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain making the nonsense codon resulting in the truncation of the product was suggested as a candidate for the responsible genetic aberration (25Shin E.K. Perryman L.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3565-3569PubMed Google Scholar). Complete determination of the equine scid dna-pkcs gene sequence will shed light on the precise mechanism.V(D)J recombination in SX9 and previously reported DNA-PKcs-deficient cell lines is shown (Table II). The mutation of SX9 and equine scid exist just upstream from the conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain in DNA-PKcs but the mutation of mouse scid exists downstream from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase domain (Fig.6). These findings suggest the crucial role of protein kinase activity in DNA-PKcs for signal joint formation.Table IIV(D)J recombination activity of radiosensitive mutantsMutant/parent cell lineSignal jointCoding joint Relative frequency2-cRearrangement of the substrate was assessed by PCR analysis.ReferenceMutationReferenceRelative frequency2-aFrequency was assessed by ampicillin-chloramphenicol resistant assay with extrachromosomal vectors and normalized using each parental cell lines.Fidelity2-bPrecise signal joint was assessed with ApaLI digestion.%SX9/SR-10.10120.03This studyDNA-PKcs 3191Leu → ProThis studyMurine SCID0.1~1.050~80<0.0120, 22DNA-PKcs 4046Tyr → ter11–13V3/AA80.54600.0224DNA-PKcs, not identifiedirs-20/CHO-10B20.10800.0323DNA-PKcs, not identifiedEquine SCID2-cRearrangement of the substrate was assessed by PCR analysis.26DNAPKcs, 5-bp deletion → frame shift25xrs-6/CHO-K10.04140.0120Ku80 13-bp insertion → frame shift17, 182-a Frequency was assessed by ampicillin-chloramphenicol resistant assay with extrachromosomal vectors and normalized using each parental cell lines.2-b Precise signal joint was assessed with ApaLI digestion.2-c Rearrangement of the substrate was assessed by PCR analysis. Open table in a new tab Although it has not been proved experimentally, it seems likely that the DNA-PK activity in murine scid is partial. Therefore, in murine scid the association and/or activation of other participants (especially XRCC4-ligase IV complex) involved in V(D)J recombination, which is controlled by the kinase activity of DNA-PK, might be stronger than those in SX9. Furthermore, the activation energy for signal joint formation seems to be lower than that for coding joint, since coding joint formation is more complex and may require more proteins than signal joint formation (37Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T. Gellert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These may be the reasons why the signal joint formation is normal only in murinescid. In other words, the difference in DNA-PK activity causes the difference in activation of other participants involved in V(D)J recombination. The requirement of activity in the joining step of V(D)J recombination differs between signal and coding joint formation. This hypothesis should be tested.Finally, to confirm the responsibility of DNA-PKcs for SX9 abnormal V(D)J recombination, full-length cDNA of dna-pkcscDNA was introduced into SX9 cells and the V(D)J recombination activity was assessed. Restoration of frequency and fidelity in coding and signal joint formation was observed (Table I and Fig. 5). Although the restoration of frequency was not enough in coding joint and signal joint formation, it seems reasonable because the assay was performed under transient expression of rag-1, -2, assay vector, anddna-pkcs gene. If the probability of simultaneous introduction of these genes is considered, it seems natural that the restoration by the dna-pkcs gene was not complete. We obtained similar results when the full-length dna-pkcs gene constructed in other expression vectors were used (data not shown). Additionally, complete restoration of V(D)J recombination is generally difficult (16Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the scid cell line was introduced by human chromosome 8, in which human dna-pkcsexists, radiosensitivity but not V(D)J recombination was restored completely (data not shown). We are currently trying to determine whether the radiosensitivity, DNA-PK activity, and activation of c-Abl are restored in the stable transformants.To date, murine scid is the only DNA-PKcs-deficient mutant in which DNA sequence has been determined. A candidate for the responsible genetic aberration in dna-pkcs in equinescid was also suggested (25Shin E.K. Perryman L.E. Meek K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3565-3569PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of other DNA-PKcs-deficient mutants at the DNA sequence level are required to elucidate the biological mechanism.SX9 is the second cell line in which the DNA sequence of thedna-pkcs gene was completely determined. This cell line should therefore contribute to a better understanding not only of V(D)J recombination but also of the repair mechanism including double strand break repair. The defect of DNA-PK activity in SX9 cells was suggested. Furthermore, our complementation test using DNA-PK defective cell lines by the cell fusion technique indicated that cell lines SX9 andxrs-6 (XRCC5) belong to different complementation groups and that cell lines SX9 and V3 (XRCC7) are in the same group.

PKC-alpha, -delta, and -zeta were barely detectable in IR antibody precipitates of unstimulated cells, while increasing by 7-, 3.5-, and 3-fold, respectively, after insulin addition. Preexposure of 3T3hIR cells to staurosporine reduced insulin-induced receptor coprecipitation with PKC-alpha, -delta, and -zeta by 3-, 4-, and 10-fold, respectively, accompanied by a 1.5-fold decrease in insulin degradation and a similar increase in insulin retroendocytosis. Selective depletion of cellular PKC-alpha and -delta, by 24 h of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) exposure, reduced insulin degradation by 3-fold and similarly increased insulin retroendocytosis, with no change in PKC-zeta. In lysates of NIH-3T3 cells expressing the R1152Q/K1153A IRs (3T3Mut), insulin-induced coprecipitation of PKC-alpha, -delta, and -zeta with the IR was reduced by 10-, 7-, and 3-fold, respectively. Similar to the 3T3hIR cells chronically exposed to TPA, untreated 3T3Mut featured a 3-fold decrease in insulin degradation, with a 3-fold increase in intact insulin retroendocytosis. Thus, in NIH-3T3 cells, insulin elicits receptor interaction with multiple PKC isoforms. Interaction of PKC-alpha and/or -delta with the IR appears to control its intracellular routing."

In patients with type IA maple syrup urine disease, the E1α subunit is affected, resulting in the loss of E1 and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase catalytic activities. To study the effect of human E1α missense mutations on E1 subunit assembly, we have developed a pulse-chase labeling protocol based on efficient expression and assembly of human (His)6-E1α and untagged E1β subunits inEscherichia coli in the presence of overexpressed chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Assembly of the two35S-labeled E1 subunits was indicated by their co-extraction with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The nine E1α maple syrup urine disease mutants studied showed aberrant kinetics of assembly with normal E1β in the 2-h chase compared with the wild type and can be classified into four categories of normal (N222S-α and R220W-α), moderately slow (G245R-α), slow (G204S-α, A240P-α, F364C-α, Y368C-α, and Y393N-α), and no (T265R-α) assembly. Prolonged induction in E. coli grown in the YTGK medium or lowering of induction temperature from 37 to 28 °C (in the case of T265R-α), however, resulted in the production of mutant E1 proteins.

In contrast, a subset of E1α missense mutations caused the occurrence of exclusive αβ dimers (Y393N-α and F364C-α) or of both α2β2 tetramers and lower molecular weight species (Y368C-α and T265R-α). Thermal denaturation at 50 °C indicated that mutant E1 proteins aggregated more rapidly than wild type (rate constant, 0.19 min−1), with the T265R-α mutant E1 most severely affected (rate constant, 4.45 min−1). The results establish that the human E1α mutations in the putative thiamine pyrophosphate-binding pocket that are studied, with the exception of G204S-α, have no effect on E1 subunit assembly.

This multienzyme complex is organized around a dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) core, to which a branched-chained α-ketoacid decarboxylase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions (2Pettit F.H.

E1 is a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzyme comprising two E1α and two E1β subunits that assemble into an α2β2 tetramer. E2 is a 24-meric protein consisting of identical lipoic acid-bearing subunits arranged on octahedral 4,3,2-point group symmetry. Each E2 polypeptide contains three independently folded domains (i.e. lipoyl-bearing, E1/E3-binding, and inner core) that are highly conserved among E2 proteins of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (4Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes include pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and BCKD complexes (3Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 247: 625-632Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). E3 is a homodimeric flavoprotein that is common to members of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (3Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 247: 625-632Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The kinase and the phosphatase are specific for the BCKD complex and regulate its activity through a reversible phosphorylation (inactivation) and dephosphorylation (activation) cycle (5Harris R.A. Paxton R. Powell S.M. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Han A.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1986; 25: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) or branched-chain ketoaciduria, the activity of the BCKD complex is deficient. This leads to clinical manifestations including often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangements, and mental retardation (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beuadet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1333-1377Google Scholar). The molecular genetics of MSUD are heterogeneous as mutations in the E1α, E1β, E2, and E3 genes have been described (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beuadet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Barchi R.L. Kunkel L.M. The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological Disease. 2nd Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston1997: 1175-1193Google Scholar). Based on the locus affected, genetic subtypes of MSUD have been proposed, with type IA referring to mutations in the E1α gene, type IB to the E1β gene, type II to the E2 gene, and type III to the E3 gene (1Chuang D.T.

It has been suggested that certain type IA MSUD missense mutations, for example Y393N-α (7Fisher C.R. Chuang J.L. Cox R.P. Fisher C.W. Star R.A. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Y368C-α (8Chuang J.L. Fisher C.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar), may impede the assembly of mutant E1α with normal E1β subunit, resulting in the degradation of E1 subunits in patient's cells.We have recently established that chaperonins GroEL and GroES are essential for efficient folding and assembly of the E1 tetramer inEscherichia coli (9Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the E2 24-mer in vitro(10Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Zhi W. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8962-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the biochemical basis of the apparently impaired assembly of E1 in type IA MSUD, we have co-expressed both mature mutant E1α and normal E1β in E. colico-transformed with a second plasmid overproducing chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Pulse-chase labeling of both E1 subunits was carried out to measure the kinetics of assembly of the mutant E1α with normal E1β in the bacterial cell. The results showed a marked reduction in the rate of E1 assembly in certain E1α mutants compared with normal. It was also found that a subset of E1α mutations affect the assembly state of mutant E1 after the prolonged induction in E. coli. Thermostability and protease digestion studies further indicated these slowly assembled mutant E1 proteins had less stable conformations than the wild type. These results define the residues that are critical for subunit interactions and stability of E1 and have implications for understanding chaperonin-mediated biogenesis of hetero-oligomeric structures.DISCUSSIONThe major focus of this investigation is to characterize the effect of human E1α mutations in type IA MSUD on the assembly and stability of mutant E1 proteins. For these studies, we have developed efficient bacterial expression systems for folding and assembly of E1 α2β2 tetramers. We showed previously that co-expression of mature MBP-E1α and E1β sequences of the human BCKD complex in the same E. coli cells is essential for MBP-E1 assembly; however, the yield was very low (12Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16601-16606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-transformation of a second plasmid that overexpressed GroEL and GroES into the sameE. coli cell resulted in a 500-fold increase in the yield of active MBP-E1 tetramers (9Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, a (His)6affinity tag is fused to the mature E1α N terminus through a TEV protease recognition site. Co-transformation with the pGroESL plasmid was also found necessary and sufficient for productive folding and assembly of (His)6-E1. The results argue against the suggestion that the dependence of human E1 on chaperonins for a high yield is due to the presence of the MBP sequence in the chimeric E1α polypeptide (23Lessard I.A.D. Persham R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent in vitro refolding results indicate that the reconstitution of untagged E1, MBP-E1, and (His)6-E1 show the same chaperonin-dependent kinetics. 2J. L. Chuang, R. M. Wynn, and D. T. Chuang, manuscript in preparation. The findings further established that productive folding and assembly of mature human E1 have an absolute requirement for enrichment for chaperonins GroEL and GroES and are not affected by the presence of affinity tags. Thus, the pulse-chase labeling protocol developed in this study provides the first approximation of the rate of E1 subunit assembly under optimal conditions through the augmentation of bacterial chaperonins that are homologue of mitochondrial chaperonins Hsp60 and Hsp10, respectively.The wild-type and mutant human E1α and the wild-type E1β subunits are expressed at relatively equal efficiencies and are stable, as indicated by Western blotting of the total crude lysates prepared 12 h after induction (Fig. 3 A). This allows one to follow the fates of E1α and E1β subunits synthesized during the 1-min window of pulse-labeling. The presence of the (His)6-tag in the wild-type and mutant E1α subunits facilitates the isolation of the 35S-labeled subunit. One can measure the kinetics of the E1β assembly with the wild-type and mutant E1α subunits by the co-purification of the untagged E1β with (His)6-E1α with the Ni2+-NTA resin as a function of time. The equally strong signals of E1α and E1β subunits during the 2-h chase (Fig. 2 A) indicate that both subunits are efficiently synthesized. The total numbers of cysteine and methionine residues in the E1α and E1β subunits are similar, which are 16 and 15, respectively. The autoradiogram of the co-purified E1 subunits as separated by SDS-PAGE cannot discern the assembly state of the associated subunits. However, size fractionation of the pulse-chase labeled products by HPLC show that the wild-type E1α and E1β assemble during the 2-h chase occur predominantly as inactive αβ dimers, which are later converted to active α2β2 tetramers (Fig. 4, A andB). It is noteworthy that a significant amount of the wild-type αβ dimeric intermediate was observed only when E. coli cells were grown on the C2 broth minimal medium. When the bacterial cells were cultured on the YTGK medium, wild-type E1 was expressed predominantly as α2β2 tetramers (Fig. 5) with little or no accumulation of αβ dimers during the 16-h induction period (data no shown). The factors responsible for the apparent effects of culture media on the accumulation of the wild-type dimeric intermediate during E1 assembly are currently unknown. The major differences between the two bacterial culture media lie in the fact that the C2 minimal medium is low in the content of SO42− and amino acids when compared with the YTGK medium (18Guzman-Verduzco L.M. Kupersztoch Y.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible effects of these ingredients on the dimerization of wild-type αβ dimers are under investigation.It is of interest that a weak GroEL signal co-purifies with wild-type (His)6-E1α and E1β at 120 min into the chase (Fig.2 A). This apparent ternary complex is also observed in the early fractions of the Imidazole gradient during purification of wild-type (His)6-E1 (Fig. 1). The GroEL-E1α-E1β ternary complex is a productive intermediate at a later step of the chaperonin-mediated assembly of E1 α2β2tetramers.2 Only a GroEL-E1α binary complex is observed in F364C-α because the assembly of E1β with mutant E1α did not occur within the 2-h chase. The weak and sub-stoichiometric signal of GroEL relative to E1 subunits is a result of isotopic dilution by the overabundance of unlabeled GroEL in E. coli.The assembled mutant αβ dimers were produced in E. coligrown on the YTGK medium after the 16-h induction with “slow assembly” E1α mutants including Y393N-α and F364C-α. The results indicate that this group of mutations not only reduces the rate of the assembly of the mutant E1α with normal E1β but also prevents conversion of the dimeric assembly intermediate into the stable α2β2 structure of wild-type E1. The production of these mutant αβ dimers apparently is not affected by growth media, as the expression of mutant E1 carrying these mutations in E. coli grown in the C2 broth minimal medium also resulted in the expression of exclusive dimers. In vitroreconstitution of the 6 m urea-denatured mutant Y393N-α E1 in the presence of chaperonins GroEL and GroES also resulted exclusively in mutant αβ dimers.2 The unstable Y393N-α dimeric intermediate as demonstrated by its propensity for thermal aggregation and proteolytic digestion compared with the wild-type tetramer explains the markedly reduced levels E1α and E1β subunits in cells from Mennonite MSUD patients homozygous for the Y393N-α mutation (24Matsuda I. Nobunkuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Indo Y. Indo F. Asaka J. Harada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 451-464Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Fisher C.R. Fisher C.W. Chuang D.T. Cox R.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 429-434PubMed Google Scholar). The present study establishes that C-terminal aromatic residues (F364-α, Y368-α, and Y393-α) in the E1α subunit are crucial for proper E1 assembly. The important roles of the C terminus in subunit assembly and protein interactions have been demonstrated. For example, the C-terminal 25 amino acid residues of the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL26.5 protein are required for the assembly of the icosahedral capsid shell (26Kennard J. Rixon F.J. McDougall I.M. Tatman J.D. Preston V.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the case of the E2 core of the related pyruvate dehydrogenase complex fromAzotobacter vinelandii, the C-terminal residues 632–637 comprise a 310-like helix (H6) which acts as a “hydrophobic knob” that fits into a “hole” in the 2-fold related subunit to produce the 24-mer cubic assembly (27Mattevi A. Obmodova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. deKok A. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Introduction of a polyhistidine tag into the C terminus of BCKD-E2, which is highly homologous to the bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase-E2, results in the formation of stable trimers instead of the native 24-mer structure (data not shown).The T265R-α subunit, when expressed at 37 °C, was largely insoluble even in the presence of excess chaperonins GroEL and GroES. This was indicated by the rapid disappearance of the mutant E1α signal in the soluble fraction during the 2-h chase (Fig.2 A); however, the level of the T265R-α subunits in total crude lysates was comparable to that of wild type (Fig. 3 A). These results strongly suggest that the T265R-α residue is important for proper folding of the E1α subunit. It is also of interest that lowering of the induction temperature from 37 to 28 °C resulted in the production of a significant amount of assembled mutant E1 protein carrying the T265R-α mutation. The yield of the mutant E1 was 5 mg/liter culture at 28 °C compared with 20–40 mg/liter culture for the wild-type E1 expressed at 37 °C (data not shown). The finding is consistent with the thesis that lowering the expression temperature slows the folding kinetics of the nascent peptide, thereby reducing the probability of the off-pathway folding reactions, as demonstrated by the expression of rabbit muscle phosphorylase (28Browner M.F. Rosor P. Tugendreich S. Fletterick R.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the human E1β (13Wynn R.M. Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Fisher C.W. Hale M.A. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1881-1889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the assembled T265R-α mutant E1 has a grossly altered conformation, which renders it very unstable as indicated by its most rapid thermal aggregation at 50 °C among the nine E1α mutants studied. This unstable conformation is also manifested by the apparent dissociation of the mutant tetramers to lower molecular weight species as detected by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The current data indicate that the T265R-α residue also plays a key role in subunit interactions and are consistent with the location of this residue at the putative subunit-interaction site conserved between BCKD and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 proteins (29Wexler I.D. Hemalatha S.G. Patel M.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of the E1 α2β2 has not been solved, but structures are known for the related TPP-dependent proteins transketolase (30Nikkola M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and pyruvate decarboxylase (31Dyda F. Furey W. Swaminathan S. Sax M. Farrenkopf B. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6165-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and pyruvate oxidase from Lactobacillus plantarum (32Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The transketolase is a homodimer, whereas the human E1 is a tetramer made up of two non-identical subunits. Sequence alignment between the two enzymes shows that the highly conserved TPP-binding pocket in E1 is composed of residues from both E1α and E1β subunits (33Robinson B.H. Chun K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Meng M. Chuang D.T. Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Harris R.A. α-Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1996: 101-117Google Scholar). Aromatic residues from E1β form a hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the pyrimidium and thiazolium rings of cofactor TPP. On the other hand, the highly conserved TPP-binding motif GDG(X)22–28NN, which was first described by Hawkins et al. (35Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and is essential for binding the pyrophosphate moiety, is located in the E1α subunit (Fig.8). It should be mentioned that a D440E mutation introduced via mutagenesis into this motif in pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis yielded a homodimeric enzyme with reduced affinity for TPP, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme which exists as a homotetramer (36Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was proposed that deficient TPP binding may have caused a failure in the conversion of the mutant dimeric forms into native tetramers. However, the occurrence of αβ dimers in the mutant E1 carrying Y393N-α and F364C-α substitutions is likely through a different mechanism, since these residues are not involved in TPP binding and are located in the C-terminal region. G204S-α, R220W-α, and N222S-α that are affected in type IA MSUD are residues within the TPP-binding motif (Fig. 8). Specifically, N222S-α aligns with Asn-187 in the yeast transketolase and provides a ligand to this pentameric coordination involving the Mg2+ cation. The N222S-α mutation conceivably disrupts the pentameric coordination, resulting in the inability of E1 to bind the pyrophosphate moiety of TPP and the loss of E1 catalytic function. However, the N222S-α mutation is without effect on the assembly of the mutant E1α with normal E1β, as determined by pulse-chase labeling (Fig. 2 A). The R220W-α mutation, which is also located in the pyrophosphate moiety binding site, also has no adverse effect on E1 subunit assembly. In contrast, G204S-α mutation, which is presumably located at the interface between the two non-identical subunits of E1, based on the yeast transketolase structure (37Sunderstro¨m M. Lindqvist Y.

This multienzyme complex is organized around a dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) core, to which a branched-chained α-ketoacid decarboxylase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions (2Pettit F.H.

E1 is a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzyme comprising two E1α and two E1β subunits that assemble into an α2β2 tetramer. E2 is a 24-meric protein consisting of identical lipoic acid-bearing subunits arranged on octahedral 4,3,2-point group symmetry. Each E2 polypeptide contains three independently folded domains (i.e. lipoyl-bearing, E1/E3-binding, and inner core) that are highly conserved among E2 proteins of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (4Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes include pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and BCKD complexes (3Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 247: 625-632Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). E3 is a homodimeric flavoprotein that is common to members of the α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (3Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 247: 625-632Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The kinase and the phosphatase are specific for the BCKD complex and regulate its activity through a reversible phosphorylation (inactivation) and dephosphorylation (activation) cycle (5Harris R.A. Paxton R. Powell S.M. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Han A.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1986; 25: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) or branched-chain ketoaciduria, the activity of the BCKD complex is deficient. This leads to clinical manifestations including often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangements, and mental retardation (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beuadet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

The molecular genetics of MSUD are heterogeneous as mutations in the E1α, E1β, E2, and E3 genes have been described (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beuadet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Based on the locus affected, genetic subtypes of MSUD have been proposed, with type IA referring to mutations in the E1α gene, type IB to the E1β gene, type II to the E2 gene, and type III to the E3 gene (1Chuang D.T.

In the present study, the ionizing radiation sensitivity was determined for a series of rat embryo fibroblast (REF) cell lines transfected with an activated form of the H-ras oncogene alone, or in combination with a variety of missense-mutant p53 (MTp53) alleles. Transformed REF clones which expressed exogenous MTp53 and p21ras proteins (CLASS II clones) were generally radioresistant in culture as determined by higher values for the surviving fraction after 2 Gy (SF2 value) and the radiation dose required to reduce survival to a fraction of 0.1 (D10 value), compared either to transformed REF clones expressing p21ras protein alone (CLASS I clones), or to non-transfected REF control cell lines expressing baseline endogenous levels of p21ras and WTp53 protein. The increased radioresistance observed in the CLASS II clones (following both HDR- and LDR-irradiation), was significantly correlated with increased expression of MTp53 protein, and a decreased radiation-induced G1 arrest response. The variability observed in clonogenic radiosensitivity among REF clones was not explained by differential radiation-induced apoptosis. Using the Comet assay performed after continuous low dose-rate (LDR)-irradiation, MTp53-expressing REF clones were also found to be more proficient at the rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks (DNA-dsb), compared to WTp53-expressing REF clones. These results suggest that an enhanced DNA and cellular repair capacity may, in part, explain the increased radiation survival observed in some MTp53-expressing transformed fibroblasts and tumours."

LPH levels are high in newborn mammals, but decrease after weaning. We have previously suggested that the promoter element CE-LPH1, located at −40 to −54, plays an important role in this down-regulation, because the DNA binding activity of a nuclear factor that binds to this site is present specifically in small intestinal extracts and is down-regulated after weaning. In an effort to clone CE-LPH1-binding factors, a yeast one-hybrid genetic selection was used, resulting in the isolation of a partial cDNA encoding the human homeodomain protein HOXC11. The full-length HOXC11 sequence was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. It was shown in a yeast assay and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that HOXC11 binds to the CE-LPH1 element with similar specificity to the endogenous intestinal factor. Two HOXC11 transcript sizes were identified by Northern blot analysis. The larger transcript (2.1 kilobase pairs) is likely to contain a translational start site in good context and is present in HeLa cells. The shorter 1.7-kilobase pair transcript, present in HeLa and Caco-2 cells, probably encodes a protein lacking 114 amino acids at the N-terminal end. Both forms of HOXC11 potentiate transcriptional activation of the LPH promoter by HNF1α. The expression of HOXC11 mRNA in human fetal intestine suggests a role in early intestinal development."
https://openalex.org/W1686416112,"The specificity of δ ribozyme cleavage was investigated using a trans-acting antigenomicδ ribozyme. Under single turnover conditions, the wild type ribozyme cleaved the 11-mer ribonucleotide substrate with a rate constant of 0.34 min−1, an apparent K mof 17.9 nm and an apparent second-order rate constant of 1.89 × 107 min−1m−1. The substrate specificity of theδ ribozyme was thoroughly investigated using a collection of substrates that varied in either the length or the nucleotide sequence of their P1 stems. We observed that not only is the base pairing of the substrate and the ribozyme important to cleavage activity, but also both the identity and the combination of the nucleotide sequence in the substrates are essential for cleavage activity. We show that the nucleotides in the middle of the P1 stem are essential for substrate binding and subsequent steps in the cleavage pathway. The introduction of any mismatches at these positions resulted in a complete lack of cleavage by the wild type ribozyme.

Our findings suggest that factors more complex than simple base pairing interactions, such as tertiary structure interactions, could play an important role in the substrate specificity of δ ribozyme cleavage. δ ribozymes derived from the genome of hepatitisδ virus (HDV) 1The abbreviations used are: HDV, hepatitis δ virus; nt, nucleotide(s).are metalloenzymes. Like other catalytically active ribozymes, namely hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes, the δ ribozymes cleave a phosphodiester bond of their RNA substrates and give rise to reaction products containing a 5′-hydroxyl and a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate termini. Two forms of δ ribozymes, namely genomic and antigenomic, were derived and referred to by the polarity of the HDV genome from which the ribozyme was generated. Both δ ribozyme forms exhibit self-cleavage activity, and it has been suggested that they are involved in the process of viral replication (1Lazinski D.W. Taylor J.M. RNA ( New York ). 1995; 1: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar). This type of activity has been described as cis-acting δ ribozymes (2Perrotta A.T. Been M.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Like other ribozymes, δ ribozymes have a potential application in gene therapy in which an engineered ribozyme is directed to inhibit gene expression by targeting a specific mRNA molecule. It has been demonstrated that a very low concentration (<0.1 mm) of Ca2+ and Mg2+ is required for δ ribozyme cleavage (3Wu H.N. Lin Y.J. Lin F.P. Makino S. Chang M.F. Lai M.M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1831-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). δ ribozymes have a unique characteristic in their substrate binding, namely that only the 3′-portion of the substrate is required for binding to the ribozyme. A short stretch of nucleotides (7 nt) located on the substrate is required for cleavage. Although one might suspect the specificity ofδ ribozyme cleavages due to their short recognition site, we view this characteristic of the δ ribozyme as an advantage for the future development of a therapeutic means of controlling, for example, a viral infection. Since little is known about the kinetic properties of δribozymes, study of the trans-acting system will enable us to answer some basic questions on both the structure required and the kinetic properties, including the substrate specificity, ofδ ribozymes. Depending on the predicted secondary structures used, various trans-acting δribozyme systems were generated by separating the RNA molecule into ribozyme and substrate molecules at various positions (4Branch A.D.

It was demonstrated that cleavage activity was not destroyed by the interchanging of one to four nucleotide pairs between the substrate and the δ ribozyme (2Perrotta A.T. Been M.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8Wu H.N. Wang Y.J. Hung C.F. Lee H.J. Lai M.M.C. J. Mol.

One or two nucleotide mismatches at any position of the P1 stem, except positions 5 and 11 (numbering according to Fig. 1), completely destroyed the activity (2Perrotta A.T.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11843-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although these are composite results from various versions ofδ ribozymes, these findings could be interpreted as indicating that the positions located at both extremities of the base paired stem formed by the substrate and the ribozyme were more likely to tolerate a mismatch, resulting in distortion of the P1 stem, than the internal positions. There is no information on how each nucleotide of the substrate affects the cleavage activity and its kinetics since most investigations were carried out at only one or two positions at a time, and the findings generally reported in a plus/minus manner (e.g. cut or uncut). Therefore, the substrate specificity ofδ ribozyme could not be deduced from previous reports. To determine how substrate sequences affect δ ribozyme cleavage activity, we performed kinetic studies using a collection of short oligonucleotide substrates (11 nt) with a trans-actingδ ribozyme. In this report, we demonstrate that each nucleotide of the P1 stem contributes differently to the cleavage activity. We compare the observed cleavage rate constants for cleavable substrates and the equilibrium dissociation constants for the uncleavable substrates with those of the wild type substrate. We present evidence that strongly suggests that the nucleotides located in the center of the P1 stem formed between substrate and ribozyme (Fig.1, positions 7 and 8) are important not only for substrate recognition but probably also for subsequent steps, for example a conformation change yielding a transition complex. The antigenomic ribozyme sequence of the hepatitisδ virus described by Makino et al. (13Makino S. Chang M.F. Shieh C.K. Kamahora T. Vannier D.M. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) was used to generate a trans-acting δ ribozyme with some modifications as shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, the construction was performed as follows. Two pairs of complementary and overlapping oligonucleotides, representing the entire length of the ribozyme (57 nt), were synthesized and subjected to an annealing process prior to cloning into pUC19. The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated toHindIII and SmaI co-digested pUC19 to give rise to a plasmid harboring the δ ribozyme (referred to as pδRzP1.1). A mutant ribozyme (δRzP1.2) was then constructed by modifying the substrate recognition site of pδRzP1.1 by ligation of an oligonucleotide containing the altered sequence flanked by restriction endonuclease sites to RsrII/SphI predigested pδRzP1.1. The sequences of engineered ribozymes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing wild type and mutant ribozymes were then prepared using Qiagen tip-100 (Qiagen Inc.), digested with SmaI, purified by phenol and chloroform extraction, and precipitated for further use as templates for in vitro transcription reactions. In vitro transcription reactions contained 5 μg of linearized recombinant plasmid DNA as template, 27 units RNAGuard® RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 mm of each ribonucleotide (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 80 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 24 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 unit of pyrophosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) and 25 μg of purified T7 RNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 μl, and were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Deoxyoligonucleotides (500 pmol) containing the substrate and T7 promoter sequence were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in a 20-μl mixture containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl2, and allowed to cool slowly to 37 °C. The in vitro transcription reactions were carried out using the resulting partial duplex formed as template under the same conditions as described for the production of the ribozyme. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were fractionated by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide) containing 45 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, 7m urea, and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction products were visualized by UV shadowing. The bands corresponding to the correct sizes of either ribozymes or substrates were cut out, and the transcripts eluted overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5 m ammonium acetate. The transcripts were then precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.2 volumes of ethanol. Transcript yield was determined by spectrophotometry. Purified transcripts (10 pmol) were dephosphorylated in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 units of RNAGuard®, and 0.2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then extracted twice with a same volume of phenol:chloroform (1:1). Dephosphorylated transcripts (1 pmol) were end-labeled in a mixture containing 1.6 pmol [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 3 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by applying the reaction mixture onto a spin column packed with a G-50 Sephadex gel matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentration of labeled transcripts was adjusted to 0.01 pmol/ml by the addition of water. To initiate a cleavage reaction, we tested different procedures and chose the method that yielded the highest cleavage rate constant and the maximum cleavage product as described by Fauzi et al. (14Fauzi H. Kawakami J. Nishikawa F. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3124-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of ribozymes were mixed with trace amounts of substrate (final concentration <1 nm) in a 18-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and subjected to denaturation by heating at 95 °C for 2 min. The mixtures were quickly placed on ice for 2 min and equilibrated to 37 °C for 5 min prior to the initiation of the reaction. Unless stated otherwise, cleavage was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to 10 mm final concentration. The cleavage reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and followed for 3.5 h or until the end point of cleavage was reached. The reaction mixtures were periodically sampled (2–3 μl), and these samples were quenched by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution containing 95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol. The resulting samples were analyzed by a 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Both the substrate (11 nt) and the reaction product (4 nt) bands were detected using a Molecular Dynamics radioanalytic scanner after exposition of the gels to a phosphorimaging screen. Kinetic analyses were performed under single turnover conditions as described by Hertel et al. (15Hertel K.J. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3751-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, trace amounts of end-labeled substrate (<1 nm) were cleaved by various ribozyme concentrations (5–500 nm). The fraction cleaved was determined, and the rate of cleavage (k obs) obtained from fitting the data to the equation A t =A ∞(1 − e −kt) whereA t is the percentage of cleavage at timet, A ∞ is the maximum percent cleavage (or the end point of cleavage), and k is the rate constant (k obs). Each rate constant was calculated from at least two measurements. The values ofk obs obtained were then plotted as a function of ribozyme concentrations for determination of the other kinetic parameters: k cat, K m andk cat/K m. Values obtained from independent experiments varied less than 15%. The requirement for Mg2+ by both ribozymes was studied by incubating the reaction mixtures with various concentrations of MgCl2(1–500 mm) in the presence of an excess of ribozyme (500 nm) over substrate (<1 nm). The concentrations of Mg2+ at the half-maximal velocity were determined for both ribozymes. For mismatched substrates that could not be cleaved by the ribozyme, the equilibrium dissociation constants were determined using a slight modification of the method described by Fedor and Uhlenbeck (16Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Eleven different ribozyme concentrations, ranging from 5 to 600 nm, were individually mixed with trace amounts of end-labeled substrates (<1 nm) in a 9-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, heated at 95 °C for 2 min and cooled to 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, in a manner similar to that of a regular cleavage reaction. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, at which time 2 μl of sample loading solution (50% glycerol, 0.025% of each bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol) was added, and the resulting mixtures were electrophoresed through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (20% acrylamide with a 19:1 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 45 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 7.5 and 10 mmMgCl2). Polyacrylamide gels were prerun at 20 W for 1 h prior to sample loading, and the migration was carried out at 15 W for 4.5 h at room temperature. Quantification of bound and free substrates was performed following an exposure of the gels to a phosphorimaging screen as described earlier. The trans-acting δ ribozymes used in this report were derived from the antigenomic δ ribozyme of HDV (13Makino S. Chang M.F. Shieh C.K. Kamahora T. Vannier D.M. Govindarajan S. Lai M.M.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Some features of the antigenomic δ ribozyme were modified to improve its structural stability and to aid in transcript production. Based on a pseudo knot-like structure described by Perrotta and Been (2Perrotta A.T. Been M.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), Fig. 1 shows the structure of the δ ribozymes used with some modifications: (i) the single-stranded region between substrate and ribozyme (region J1/2) was eliminated to separate the substrate molecule from the ribozyme; (ii) the substrate contains only 11 nt and produces 7- and 4-nt cleavage products, and the GGG at the 5′-end was added to increase the yield during in vitro transcription (17Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar); (iii) three G-C base pairs were introduced in the P2 region to improve both the structural stability and transcript production; and (iv) the P4 stem was shortened to the minimum length reported to result in an active ribozyme (18Been M.D. Perrotta A.T. RNA ( New York ). 1995; 1: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to performing a cleavage reaction, native gel electrophoresis was used to test for the possible presence of aggregates or multimer forms of the transcripts. Various concentrations of ribozyme, ranging from 5 nm to 2 μm, were mixed with trace amounts of end-labeled ribozyme (less than 0.5 nm) and fractionated under nondenaturing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” We detected the presence of a slow migrating species of ribozyme in the mixture containing 2 μm ribozyme (data not shown). The quantification of the slow migrating band showed that the band amounted to approximately 2% of the total radioactive material. However, a single band was detected at the concentrations used for kinetic analysis and under single turnover conditions (5–600 nm). Similar experiments were performed for each substrate. There was no substrate multimer detected at the concentrations used (data not shown). The equimolar mixture of end-labeled substrate and ribozyme was also fractionated under nondenaturing conditions, and it resulted a single band of ribozyme and substrate complex similar to those observed for the K d measurement shown in Fig.4. Two forms of trans-acting δ ribozymes (δRzP1.1 and δRzP1.2) were used with their corresponding substrates (11 nt) for the kinetic studies. δRzP1.2 differs from δRzP1.1 in that δRzP1.2 has two nucleotides, at positions 22 and 24 of δRzP1.1, interchanged (Fig. 1,5′-CCCAGCU-3′). Time course experiments for cleavage reactions catalyzed by both δRzP1.1 and δRzP1.2 were monitored by the appearance of the 4 nt cleavage product. An example of a time course experiment for a cleavage reaction catalyzed by δRzP1.1 is shown in Fig. 2, panel A. In this particular experiment, 100 nm of δRzP1.1 was incubated with 1 nm end-labeled substrate, SP1.1. The newly formed product and the remaining substrate bands at each time point were quantified, and the percentage of cleavage was plotted as a function of time (Fig. 2, panel B). δRzP1.1 cleaved approximately 60% of the substrate within 10 min. The data were fitted to a single exponential equation as described under “Materials and Methods” so as to obtain the observed rate constant (k obs = 0.21 min−1). We attempted to fit the data as biphasic reactions as described for the hairpin (19Esteban J.A. Banerjee A.R. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13629-13639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the hammerhead (20Amiri K.M. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) ribozymes. We observed that the standard deviation (χ2) of data fitted to a double-exponential equation was higher (χ2 = 0.01203) than that fitted to a single exponential equation (χ2 = 0.000203). Although we could not exclude or dismiss completely the possibility that more than one conformation of the active ribozyme could be formed, the data were treated as if the reactions were monophasic in their kinetics for comparison purposes.Figure 2Time course for a cleavage reaction catalyzed by δRzP1.1. Panel A, an autoradiogram of a polyacrylamide gel showing a cleavage assay carried out under single turnover conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” 100 nm δRzP1.1 were incubated with 1 nmend-labeled SP1.1 at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. The positions of xylene cyanol (XC) and bromphenol blue (BPB) are indicated. Panel B, quantification of the data in panel A.

The values of k obs of both δRzP1.1 and δRzP1.2 increased with an increase in ribozyme concentration up to approximately 200 nm (Fig. 3,panel A). The concentration of ribozyme at which the reaction velocity reached half-maximal (apparent K m,K m′) is 17.9 ± 5.6 nm for δRzP1.1 and 16.7 ± 6.4 nm for δRzP1.2. Under the reaction conditions used, in which the increase in ribozyme concentration has no significant effect on the rate of cleavage, the cleavage rate (k obs) is therefore represented by the catalytic rate constant (k cat). The cleavage rate constants are 0.34 min−1 for δRzP1.1 and 0.13 min−1 for δRzP1.2. Apparent second-order rate constants (k cat/K m′) were calculated to be 1.89 × 107 min−1m−1 for δRzP1.1 and 0.81 × 107 min−1m−1 for δRzP1.2 (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of wild type ribozyme (δRzP1.1) and mutant ribozyme (δRzP1.2)Kinetic parametersδRzP1.1δRzP1.2k cat(min−1)0.34 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.01K m′ (nm)17.9 ± 5.616.7 ± 6.4k cat/K m′ (min−1m−1)1.89 × 1070.81 × 107K Mg (mm)2.2 ± 1.02.1 ± 0.8Under single turnover conditions, trace amounts of end-labeled substrate (<1 nm) were cleaved by various concentrations of ribozyme (5–600 nm).

Open table in a new tab Under single turnover conditions, trace amounts of end-labeled substrate (<1 nm) were cleaved by various concentrations of ribozyme (5–600 nm). Reactions carried out under these conditions displayed monophasic kinetics. The values were calculated from at least two independent experiments, and standard variations were less than 15%. Since we observed that the k cat of δRzP1.2 is about 3 times less than that of δRzP1.1, whereas theK m′ is similar, we investigated whether an increased amount of Mg2+ in the cleavage reaction would affect thek cat of δRzP1.2. Under single turnover conditions, in which the ribozyme and substrate concentrations were kept at 500 and 1 nm, respectively, we found that both ribozymes cleave their complementary substrates at Mg2+concentrations as low as 1 mm, which is the estimated physiological concentration of Mg2+ (21Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). At this concentration, the k obs obtained were 0.11 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01 min−1, for δRzP1.1 and δRzP1.2, respectively (Fig. 3, panel B). A maximumk obs for δRzP1.2 was observed when the concentration of Mg2+ was 10 mm. Higher concentrations of Mg2+ did not increase either thek obs or the extent of cleavage for both ribozymes. We did not observe a decrease in the cleavage rate when higher concentrations of Mg2+ were used (e.g.500 mm). The requirement for magnesium at half-maximal velocity (K Mg) was 2 mm for both δRzP1.1 and δRzP1.2. To compare the specificity of the δ ribozyme with various substrates, δRzP1.1 was used under single turnover conditions as described above. The cleavage reactions were performed with a trace amount of each substrate (<1 nm) and 500 nmδRzP1.1. Under these conditions, the observed rates reflect the rates of cleavage without interference from either product dissociation or inhibition. For each substrate both the observed cleavage rate constants (k obs) and the extent of cleavage were calculated and compared with those of the wild type substrate, as shown in Table II.Table IICleavage activity of shorter or mismatched substrates as compared to the wild type substrate (SP1.1)SubstratesSequencek obsExtent of cleavagek relΔΔG ‡min−1%kcal/molWild-type substrate (S11-mer)GGGCG5G6G7U8C9G10G110.34 ± 0.0248.3 ± 0.91S10-merGGGCGGGUCG0.022 ± 0.0128.8 ± 4.30.063−1.69S9-merGGGCGGGUCND2-aND, no detectable cleavage activity after a 3.5-h incubation period.NDS8-merGGGCGGGUNDNDSG5AGGGCAGGUCGG0.009 ± 0.00220.0 ± 2.40.026−2.25SG5CGGGCCGGUCGG0.047 ± 0.0171.7 ± 0.20.138−1.22SG6AGGGCGAGUCGG0.026 ± 0.0065.8 ± 0.50.076−1.59SG6UGGGCGUGUCGG0.071 ± 0.0263.7 ± 0.30.209−0.96SG7AGGGCGGAUCGGNDNDSG7UGGGCGGUUCGGNDNDSU8CGGGCGGGCCGGNDNDSU8GGGGCGGGGCGGNDNDSC9AGGGCGGGUAGG0.016 ± 0.0078.2 ± 3.00.047−1.88SC9UGGGCGGGUUGG0.031 ± 0.00521.2 ± 1.00.091−1.48SG10UGGGCGGGUCUG0.016 ± 0.0028.4 ± 0.50.047−1.88SG11UGGGCGGGUCGU0.011 ± 0.00132.1 ± 2.50.032−2.12Bold letters represent the nucleotides of wild type substrate recognized by δRzP1.1.

https://openalex.org/W1997771467,"The methylated form of the Ada protein (meAda) binds the ada andaidB promoters between 60 and 40 base pairs upstream from the transcription start and activates transcription of theEscherichia coli ada and aidB genes. This region is also a binding site for the α subunit of RNA polymerase and resembles the rrnB P1 UP element in A/T content and location relative to the core promoter. In this report, we show that deletion of the C-terminal domain of the α subunit severely decreasesmeAda-independent binding of RNA polymerase toada and aidB, affecting transcription initiation at these promoters. We provide evidence thatmeAda activates transcription by direct interaction with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase ς70 subunit (amino acids 574–613). Several negatively charged residues in the ς70 C-terminal domain are important for transcription activation by meAda; in particular, a glutamic acid to valine substitution at position 575 has a dramatic effect onmeAda-dependent transcription. Based on these observations, we propose that the role of the α subunit atada and aidB is to allow initial binding of RNA polymerase to the promoters.

Based on these observations, we propose that the role of the α subunit atada and aidB is to allow initial binding of RNA polymerase to the promoters. However, transcription initiation is dependent on meAda-ς70 interaction. Transcription activation is one of the principal strategies used by bacteria to respond to external stimuli and to adapt to a changing environment. Most Escherichia coli activators stimulate transcription by establishing protein-protein interaction with RNA polymerase. Different subunits of RNA polymerase can be a target for transcription activators; however, the majority of activators interact with either the α or the ς70 subunits (1Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). α and ς70 are also the subunits of RNA polymerase responsible for specific binding to promoters; ς70 contacts the −35 and −10 promoter elements (core promoter elements), whereas α interacts with UP elements. At the strong rrnB P1 promoter, an UP element stimulates transcription initiation 30-fold through direct interaction with the α subunit C-terminal domain (αCTD), 1The abbreviations used are: αCTD, α subunit C-terminal domain; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; meAda, the methylated form of the Ada protein. in the absence of any other protein factors (3Ross W. Gosink K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Exposure of E. coli to sublethal concentrations of methylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) activates expression from three promoters: the ada promoter (which also controls expression of the alkB gene), thealkA promoter, and the aidB promoter. This process is called the adaptive response (4Karran P. Hjelmgren T. Lindahl T. Nature. 1982; 296: 770-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Kataoka H. Yamamoto Y. Sekiguchi M. J.

The product of theada gene, the Ada protein, plays a dual role in the adaptive response; Ada transfers methyl groups from DNA to two of its cysteine residues, thereby functioning as a DNA repair protein. Upon self-methylation, Ada is converted into an activator able to stimulate transcription of the adaptive response genes, including its own (8Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ada is a 39-kDa protein organized in two independently structured domains, each with one methyl-acceptor cysteine (11McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2683-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Methylation of Cys-69, in the N-terminal domain, triggers specific DNA binding by Ada and is required for transcription activation. In contrast, Ada protein singly methylated at Cys-321 is not capable of specific DNA binding activity. However, the Ada C-terminal domain does play a role in transcription activation; deletions in Ada CTD affect transcription of ada, even though they do not affect specific DNA binding (12Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Shevell D. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The methylated Ada protein (meAda) recognizes the sequence AAT(N)6GCAA, which at ada and aidB is located 5 and 7 base pairs upstream of the −35 sequence, respectively (10Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8285-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the model for meAda activation previously proposed (16Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),meAda contacts RNA polymerase through protein-protein interaction with αCTD and recruits RNA polymerase to the promoter region (15Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a previous report (17Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was shown that RNA polymerase binds the ada and aidB promoters via αCTD, regardless of the presence of Ada. In the absence ofmeAda, RNA polymerase binds to the −60 to −40 region, which also includes the meAda binding site. This region closely resembles the UP element of the rrnB P1 promoter in A/T content, in location, and in its function as a binding site for the α subunit of RNA polymerase. Mutations in αCTD that abolish α binding to the rrnB P1 UP element also affect binding to the −60 to −40 region of ada and aidB (17Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as transcription activation by meAda (16Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Landini P. Gaal T. Ross W. Volkert M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15914-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Due to these similarities, the −60 to −40 regions of ada andaidB can be considered as “UP-like elements.” UP-like elements promote RNA polymerase binding to the ada andaidB promoters in the absence of meAda, but the resulting RNA polymerase-promoter binary complexes can only initiate transcription with poor efficiency. Binding of meAda promotes the formation of a ternary complex that is proficient in transcription initiation (17Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that although αCTD is responsible for the formation of the initial RNA polymerase-promoter binary complex, transcription activation requires protein-protein interaction betweenmeAda and the C-terminal domain of the ς70factor of RNA polymerase (ς70 CTD). Our observations suggest that α and ς70 CTD are necessary for different steps in transcription initiation at the ada andaidB promoters. The minimal sequence requirement for Ada-dependent activation of the aidB promoter is shown in Fig. 1. This fragment was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the plasmid pSL1180 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), producing plasmid pPL115. The substitutions of the −10 and −35 promoter elements to consensus sequences, and of the aidB −60 to −40 region to the rrnB P1 UP element (see “Results”), were introduced by using double strand oligodeoxynucleotides. Plasmid pPL115 was digested with either BamHI andNcoI or NcoI and MluI and religated in the presence of complementary double strand oligodeoxynucleotides carrying the desired substitutions and the corresponding restriction sites. The ligation mixtures were used to transform E. colistrain RB791 (19Sedgwick B. Robins P. Mol. Gen.

The promoters were then tested for theirin vivo activity by β-galactosidase assays in therpoS strain MV2792. Deletion of the rpoS gene completely abolishes ada-independent regulation ofaidB (20Volkert M.R. Hajec L.I. Matijasevic Z. Fang F.C. Prince R. J.

Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)) was used to transform MV3766 (ada-alkB::lacZ). Strain MV3766 carries a lacZ transcriptional fusion in thealkB gene, which lies downstream of the ada gene and whose transcription is driven by the ada promoter. Additional mutagenesis of the terminal segment of the rpoDgene was performed by two independent polymerase chain reactions from an XhoI site (corresponding to amino acid 528 of ς70) to a HindIII site immediately downstream of the stop codon. Strain MV3766 was transformed with the plasmid library. Transformants were plated on LB medium and replica-plated onto MacConkey medium both in the presence and in the absence of 0.02% MMS. In the presence of MMS, colonies with normal levels ofada-dependent transcription are pink, whereas colonies with decreased levels are white. The replica-plating step is necessary to avoid exposure of the colonies to the mutagenic effects of MMS. Colonies corresponding to the mutant candidates were picked from the MacConkey plates with no MMS and tested for β-galactosidase activity as described above. Fig.1 shows the sequence of theada and aidB promoters. The −60 to −40 regions of the two promoters show a high degree of similarity to the UP element of the rrnB P1 promoter. This region is also the binding site for meAda, and its deletion abolishesada-dependent activation (Ref. 26Nakamura T. Tokumoto Y. Sakumi K. Koibe G. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Fig.2). Although both promoters have recognizable −35 and −10 sequences, they differ from the consensus hexamers TTGACA and TATAAT. At positively controlled promoters, one of the functions of activator proteins is to improve recognition of one or more weak promoter elements by RNA polymerase through either protein-protein interaction or modification of local DNA structure. To understand which of the weak promoter elements is the target ofmeAda activation, we constructed a set of derivatives of the aidB promoter in which either the −35 or the −10 elements were substituted by perfect consensus hexamers, and the UP-like element was substituted by the UP element of rrnBP1. We investigated the effects of these substitutions on both basal and ada-activated levels of transcription in vivo. Results shown in Fig. 2 suggest that at the rrnB UP element/aidB hybrid promoter (aidB“rrnB UP”), ada-independent transcription levels are only slightly higher than for the wild type aidBpromoter (1.6-fold, Fig. 2). Thus, meAda does not activate transcription by converting the α binding site of aidBinto a better UP element. Because this substitution also replaces the Ada binding site, ada-dependent activation is almost completely abolished. Changes to consensus −35 or −10 sequences did have more pronounced effects on transcription; the consensus −10 increased ada-independent transcription levels by almost 5-fold, and introduction of a consensus −35 resulted in a more than 12-fold increase. However, neither substitution completely relieved the dependence on meAda for optimal promoter expression; meAda activates the aidBpromoter derivative with a consensus −10 element (aidB“−10 con”) by 5-fold, and the derivative with a consensus −35 element (aidB “−35 con”) by 2.3-fold (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that meAda activates transcription by affecting RNA polymerase interaction with both the −35 and −10 elements of aidB. Sakumi et al. (16Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had proposed that meAda activates transcription by direct contact with the CTD of the α subunit. We further investigated the role of αCTD in activation by meAda by performingin vitro transcription experiments using two forms of reconstituted RNA polymerase different with respect to their α subunits: one form carried wild type α, the other a mutant α deleted of the C-terminal 94 amino acids (α-235). Although α-235 RNA polymerase is impaired in UP element utilization and in transcription from some activator-dependent promoters, it is proficient in transcription from factor-independent and promoters dependent on activators that do not interact with α (1Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2483-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the two forms of reconstituted RNA polymerase for transcription from the wild type aidB promoter (aidB wt) as well as from an otherwise identical promoter in which the −10 sequence was changed to consensus (aidB“−10 con”). The latter promoter shows 5-fold higher basal transcription level in vivo compared with the wild typeaidB promoter but is still dependent on meAda for maximal promoter expression (Fig. 2). Deletion of the αCTD dramatically affects both meAda-dependent and independent transcription from the wild type aidB promoter, even though activation by meAda is not totally abolished (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and6). Transcription from aidB “−10 con” by α-235 RNA polymerase is also affected; however, at this promotermeAda activates transcription by both forms of RNA polymerase to a similar extent (5.2-fold for wild type α- and 4-fold for α-235 RNA polymerase; Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). These results strongly suggest that, although αCTD is necessary for efficient transcription at the wild type aidB promoter, it is not required for activation by meAda. The results of in vitro transcription experiments raise the possibility that α-235 RNA polymerase is not proficient in carrying out transcription from the wild type aidB promoter because it is affected in RNA polymerase-promoter interaction, rather than interaction with meAda. To investigate this possibility, we tested both wild type and α-235 RNA polymerase for their ability to bind the wild type aidB promoter in the absence ofmeAda. As shown in Fig. 4, wild type RNA polymerase binds aidB wt at 0.04–0.08 μm, whereas α-235 RNA polymerase fails to bind the promoter at concentrations up to 0.32 μm. A similar result was obtained for the wild type ada promoter (data not shown). Both forms of RNA polymerase were equally as efficient in binding both the lacUV5 and the galP1 promoters under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). The above results show that αCTD promotes recruitment of RNA polymerase to theada and aidB promoters independently ofmeAda. The location of meAda binding sites at the ada and aidB promoters is consistent with the possibility of interaction with the ς70 factor of RNA polymerase. To investigate this possibility, gel retardation experiments were performed with meAda and purified ς70. ς70 is capable of specific DNA binding only when assembled into RNA polymerase holoenzyme (27Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed, no binding of ς70 alone to either the ada oraidB promoters could be detected; however, addition of ς70 (0.5 μm) to ameAda·promoter complex resulted in a supershift at both the ada (Fig. 5) and theaidB (data not shown) promoters. This suggests that ς70 is able to form a ternary complex withmeAda at either the ada or the aidBpromoter DNA. The presence of multiple shifts is possibly due to partial dissociation of the meAda·DNA complex in the experimental conditions used and is a typical pattern formeAda (10Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8285-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In control gel retardation experiments, no significant binding by meAda and ς70 was detected with unrelated DNA fragments; ς70 was unable to promote binding of the unmethylated Ada protein to the adapromoter. Finally, ς70 did not produce any supershift when added to a CRP·gal P1 promoter complex (data not shown). Gel retardation experiments were performed with two ς70deletion mutants, ς574 and ς529; these mutants, deleted of 39 and 84 amino acids in the C-terminal domain, respectively, are impaired in interaction with some activators when assembled into RNA polymerase holoenzyme (24Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Concentrations up to 5 μm of the two mutant ς factors promote little formation of ternary complexes at either the ada (Fig.6) or the aidB (data not shown) promoter; in the same experiment, complete supershift of the two complexes occurred at 1 μm with wild type ς70. The above gel retardation experiments suggest that the C-terminal domain of ς70 could be the target for activation bymeAda. Therefore, we expected mutations in the terminal segment of the rpoD gene to specifically affectada-dependent transcription. We screened for this class of rpoD mutants using a plasmid library carryingrpoD alleles in which the segment encoding for amino acids 528–613 of ς70 had been mutagenized by polymerase chain reaction. The plasmid library was used to transform strain MV3766. This strain carries a lacZ transcriptional fusion in the chromosomal alkB gene, whose transcription is driven by theada promoter. Over 1700 colonies were screened and four mutant colonies were isolated. The mutant rpoD alleles were sequenced; three carried nonsense mutations, which resulted in truncations of ς70 at amino acid 560 (1 clone) or at amino acid 584 (2 clones). The fourth candidate carried a missense mutation, resulting in a glutamic acid to valine change at position 575 of ς70 (E575V). In addition to polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis, we also tested a set of plasmids (kindly given by C. Gross, UCSF) carryingrpoD alleles with single alanine substitutions at 17 amino acids of ς70CTD (Fig. 7). β-Galactosidase assays were performed to quantify the effect of the alanine substitutions, as well as the E575V mutation, on transcription from the ada promoter. In strain MV3766, wild type ς70 from the chromosomal rpoD gene is normally expressed, and mutated ς factors are present in only a slight excess to wild type ς70 (data not shown). Nevertheless, expression of several mutant rpoD alleles resulted in altered levels of in vivo transcription at theada promoter: E574A, E575V, I590A, E591A, E605A, and D612A substitutions significantly decreasedada-dependent transcription, with E575V having the most severe effect (Fig. 7). Some mutations, such as R596A, K597A, R608A, and D613A, resulted instead in an increased level ofada-dependent transcription (120–150%, Fig.7). To verify that inhibition of ada-dependent transcription in vivo is indeed due to disruption ofmeAda-ς70 interaction, we purified both wild type and E575V ς factors and reconstituted RNA polymerase in vitro. As shown in Fig. 8, E575V ς70-RNA polymerase was able to carry out transcription from the lacUV5 promoter with the same efficiency as wild type ς70-RNA polymerase, which suggests that the E575V mutation does not affect either core enzyme-ς70interaction or factor-independent transcription; however,meAda-dependent transcription by the mutant RNA polymerase at both ada (Fig. 8) and aidB (data not shown) was drastically impaired. In a previous report, we showed that RNA polymerase binds to theada and aidB promoters via the α subunit, independently of the Ada protein. Thus, meAda does not recruit RNA polymerase to the promoters but rather converts the RNA polymerase-promoter complex into a ternary complex proficient in transcription initiation (17Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The location of the meAda binding site suggests the possibility of interactions with either αCTD or ς; alternatively, the mechanism for activation bymeAda could involve turning the α-binding sites ofada and aidB into more efficient UP elements. Our experiments with hybrid promoters show that when the UP-like element ofaidB is substituted by the rrnB P1 UP element, no significant stimulation of transcription occurs (Fig. 2). In contrast, changing either the −35 or −10 sequences of aidB to consensus results in a significant stimulation ofada-independent transcription in vivo, suggesting that meAda improves RNA polymerase interaction with the core promoter region (Fig. 2). Thus, meAda activates transcription either by improving initial binding of RNA polymerase to the −35 or by facilitating a later step in transcription initiation, such as isomerization to open complex. Deletion of αCTD severely affects meAda-activated transcription (Ref. 16Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 3) and prevents RNA polymerase binding to the ada and aidB promoters (Fig. 4). However, at an aidB derivative in which the −10 sequence was changed to consensus (aidB “−10 con”), meAda is able to activate transcription by α-235 RNA polymerase (Fig. 3) to roughly the same extent as wild type RNA polymerase. Thus, dependence on αCTD for transcription at Ada-dependent promoters can be by-passed by strengthening the core promoter, presumably by providing an alternative binding site for α-235 RNA polymerase that compensates for its loss of interaction with the UP-like element. Although it is possible that altering the −10 sequence of the aidBpromoter also modifies the interaction between meAda and RNA polymerase, the results at the aidB −10 con promoter clearly demonstrate that meAda can activate transcription by RNA polymerase containing an α subunit deleted of its CTD. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of direct α-meAda interaction, we propose that inefficient transcription by RNA polymerase deleted of its αCTD results from the loss of the α-UP-like element interaction and consequent inability of RNA polymerase to bind the promoter, rather than from lack of interaction with meAda. Several lines of evidence show that meAda interacts with ς70. Gel retardation experiments (Figs. 5 and 6) indicate that the terminal 39 amino acids of ς70 are necessary for this interaction. This region contains determinants for the recognition of the −35 element (region 4.2), followed by the so-called “basic cluster” (28Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Several amino acids in both region 4.2 and in the basic cluster have been found to be important for interaction with transcription activators, such as PhoB, bacteriophage λ cI protein, and FNR (29Makino K. Amenura M. Kim S.K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Kuldell N. Hochschild A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. Lonetto, V. Rhodius, K. Lamberg, P. Kiley, S. Busby, and C. Gross, unpublished observations. A set of substitutions between amino acids 570 and 580 of ς70severely impairs transcription activation by PhoB at thepstS promoter (31Kim S.K. Makino K. Amenura M. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and also affects activation by cI at λ PRM promoter (30Kuldell N. Hochschild A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2991-2998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of ς70CTD suggests that meAda interacts with a set of negatively charged residues both in and downstream of region 4.2 (Fig. 7). With the exception of I590A, all the substitutions that significantly affect ada-dependent transcription involve negatively charged amino acids (Glu-574, Glu-575, Glu-591, Glu-605 and Asp-612); substitution to alanine of several positively charged residues (Arg-596, Lys-597, Arg-608) results in increased levels of ada-dependent transcription (Fig. 7), supporting the hypothesis that meAda interacts with a negatively charged patch in ς70 CTD. One of the residues important for meAda-ς70 interaction, glutamic acid at position 575 (Glu-575), also plays a role in transcription activation by PhoB (29Makino K. Amenura M. Kim S.K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that the location of this residue allows interaction with different transcription activators. The Glu-575 residue does not seem to be necessary for activator-independent transcription; neither the E575V mutation described in this report nor the E575K mutation described in Ref. 29Makino K. Amenura M. Kim S.K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar has any effect on transcription from the lacUV5 promoter in vitro (Fig. 8), nor do they affect growth rates in any of the reporter strains tested (data not shown; Ref. 29Makino K. Amenura M. Kim S.K. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The specificity of meAda-ς70 interaction, the location of its determinants in the terminal 39 amino acids of ς70, and the strong effect of the E575V mutation in vitro point to ς70CTD as the principal target of activation by meAda at the ada andaidB promoters. Interestingly, meAda is also able to activate transcription by ςs-RNA polymerase at both promoters (21Landini P. Hajec L.I. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Volkert M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Taverna P. Sedgwick B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5105-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ςs is an alternative ς factor, highly expressed in the stationary phase of bacterial growth (33Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). ςs is homologous to ς70 in region 4.2 (28Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and the amino acids important formeAda-dependent transcription are either conserved residues (Glu-574/Glu-289 and Ile-590/Ile-305) or conservative substitutions (Glu-575/Asp-290, Glu-591/Gln-306, and Glu-605/Gln-320) in ςs. Thus, it is possible thatmeAda could contact amino acids conserved in both ς factors; future experiments of site-directed mutagenesis in ςs will allow better understanding of activation of ςs-dependent transcription bymeAda. A model for meAda-activation of ada andaidB is presented in Fig. 9. In the absence of meAda, RNA polymerase can bind to theada and aidB promoters via its αCTD but fails to establish any strong interaction with the core promoter (17Landini P. Volkert M.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4329-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).meAda does not recruit RNA polymerase to the adaand aidB promoters, but upon binding of α to the UP element it interacts with ς70 CTD, triggering transcription initiation; therefore, α subunit-promoter andmeAda-ς70 interactions act at separate but interdependent steps of transcription initiation. It is possible that Ada CTD is responsible for this interaction; deletions in Ada CTD abolish transcription activation at the ada promoter without affecting DNA binding by meAda (14Saget B. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

These results suggest that transcriptional errors, particularly with regard to damage bypass, may contribute to the mutational burden of the cell. It is well documented that genomic instability can result from errors made during DNA replication, repair, or recombination. However, less is known concerning the effects of inaccurate transcription and/or translation on the integrity of the genetic information. Transcriptional and translational errors may lead to production of mutant proteins. If the defective protein is involved in DNA replication or repair, then even its transient presence may result in permanent changes in the cell's DNA. In fact, a recent paper by Slupska et al. (1Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Lloyd R. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4380-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggests that translational miscoding may result in a mutator phenotype in Escherichia coli due to production of mutant DNA polymerases with dysfunctional proofreading activity. A likely source of transcriptional errors is damage to the DNA template and/or ribonucleotide pools. Some DNA lesions, such as UV light-induced cyclobutane dimers, block the progression of RNA polymerase (2Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21330-21336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such lesions have been shown to be preferentially repaired, relative to other parts of the genome, when present in the template strand of an actively transcribed gene (3Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 4Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, lesions that are bypassed by the polymerase may result in erroneous transcripts that, if translated, will give rise to mutant proteins. The biological consequences of transcriptional mutagenesis may be particularly significant in nondividing cells in which some mutant proteins may accumulate over time. Evidence presented by van Leeuwen et al. (5van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P.V. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Ko¨ycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) points to transcription errors as a possible source of a mutant form of β-amyloid precursor protein found in neurons of Alzheimer's and Down's syndrome patients. Deposition of this mutant protein in neuritic plaque is probably involved in neuron degeneration. A recent study indicates that oxidative damage to ribonucleotide pools may result, through transcriptional miscoding, in production of mutant proteins. Taddei et al. (6Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M.-F. Cirinesi A.-M. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) observed an increase in phenotypic suppression of the Lac− phenotype in MutT− E. coli relative to MutT+ as a result of 8-oxo-GTP misincorporation during transcription. TheE. coli MutT protein, which is known to degrade 8-oxo-dGTP (7Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), the product of dGTP oxidation, was shown to also degrade 8-oxo-GTP. The finding that MutT is responsible for cleansing the rNTP pools raises the question of whether other mechanisms exist, such as RNA-specific repair processes, to control the production of mutant proteins. Our knowledge of how RNA polymerases react to various spontaneous or induced DNA lesions is limited. In particular, little is known about the mutagenic potential of transcriptional damage bypass synthesis. Several recent studies have examined the behavior of SP6 and/or T7 RNAP 1The abbreviations used are: BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydro-9,10-diol epoxides; T7 RNAP, T7 RNA polymerase; RF, replicative form. at small, nondistortive DNA lesions such as abasic sites, 8-oxoguanine, and dihydrouracil. These results indicate that all three lesions are easily bypassed and that bypass involves a misincorporation event, most often insertion of an A opposite the lesion (8Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Chen Y.-H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, the methods used in these studies were not quantitative and only sensitive enough to detect high frequency events. We have developed an in vitro system that allows quantitative assessment of the fidelity of transcription. 2K. M. Remington and K. Bebenek, manuscript in preparation. Here, this system is employed to examine transcription by T7 RNAP past an adenine residue adducted with (−)-anti-trans- or (+)-anti-trans- benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE). BPDE is a metabolite of the common environmental pollutant, benzo[a]pyrene. The stereochemistry of BPDE has an influence on its potent mutagenic and carcinogenic properties (11Harvey R.G.

The primary product formed when BPDE reacts with DNA is deoxyguanosine adducted at the N2-position. Adenine adducts at the N6-position are also formed but in smaller amounts (11Harvey R.G. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: Chemistry and Carcinogenicity. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1991: 1-396Google Scholar). Studies have shown that at high, nonphysiological concentrations, BPDE induces mutations primarily at dG. However, at lower, more physiological doses, mutations at dA become much more significant (28Wei S.-J.C. Chang R.L. Wang C.-Q. Bhachech N. Cui X.X. Hennig E. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M.

In this study, we demonstrate that T7 RNAP is found capable of transcribing past BPDE-adducted adenine and report on the fidelity of this bypass synthesis. E. coli strains, bacteriophage, and gapped substrate preparation have been described previously (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RNase H-deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II) and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. T7 RNA polymerase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and Sequenase version 2.0 was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. The two stereospecific BPDE adducts were constructed on adenine N6 at position 10 within a 16-base deoxyoligonucleotide. The 16-mers, 5′-GTAAAACTTAAGCCAG-3′ (lacZα, positions +46 to +75), were modified by the postoligomerization methodology previously described (32Kim S.J. Stone M.P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. J. Am.

The collected peaks were lyophilized, redissolved, and desalted on OPC™ cartridges according to the manufacturer's directions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peak 1 (10R isomer) base composition based on enzyme digestion was as follows: dC (3.0); dG (3.1); T (2.7); dA (5.8); dAN6(10R)-BPDE (1.2); theory: dC (3.0); dG (3.0); T (3.0); dA (6.0); dAN6(10R)-BPDE (1.0).

Purity was checked by capillary gel electrophoresis and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of32P-end-labeled samples. Each peak contained ~15% of the other isomer. The DNA substrate for the ochre codon-based transcription assay was constructed as follows. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed (35Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) using M13mp2SV (36Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) to replace the ninth codon of the lacZα gene (GTC, positions +66 to +68, where position +1 is the first transcribed base) with an ochre (TAA) codon. In addition, a silent change to the eighth codon was made (GCC → GCT) that resulted in a unique recognition site for the restriction endonuclease AflII. A DNA fragment containing the modified lacZα coding sequence from the EcoRI site at lac position +53 to the Bsu36I site at lac position +277 was ligated into M13mp2T7prCMVpr (“template”), an M13mp2 DNA that contained both the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer sequences.2 The correctness of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Deoxyoligonucleotide (16-mer) comprising (+)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted, (−)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted, or unadducted adenine was phosphorylated in a T4 polynucleotide kinase-dependent reaction and annealed (100 pmol) to single-stranded template (33 pmol) in a 50-μl volume of annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl). Primer extension reactions (256 μl) consisted of 10 μl of the annealing reaction, 1 mm dNTPs, 1 mm ATP, 20 units of T7 DNA polymerase (unmodified), and 20 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase in extension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin). Following incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, reactions were heat-inactivated 10 min at 75 °C, supplemented with NaCl (50 mm), and 200 units of restriction endonucleaseAflII were added to the reactions containing BPDE-adducted DNA in order to cleave any unadducted DNA molecules. Incubation was continued 1 h, after which reactions were terminated with EDTA (15 mm) and resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gel slices containing the covalently closed circular (RF I) DNA of each of the three primer extension reactions were cut from the gel; the DNA was then eluted using an Elutrap device (Schleicher and Schuell), concentrated, and equilibrated in dH20. Prior to use in transcription reactions, templates were linearized at position +195 by restriction with FspI. Transcription reactions (50 μl) were performed as described previously (37Boyer J.C. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6919-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)2 and contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 6 mm MgCl2; 2 mm spermidine; 10 mm NaCl; 10 mmdithiothreitol; 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (RNasin, Promega); 200 ng of modified or unmodified, linearized M13mp2 DNA; a 500 μm concentration each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP; 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol); and 15 units of T7 RNA polymerase. Reaction components were mixed at room temperature and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Template DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Ambion, 1 unit/μg DNA) for 15 min at 37 °C. The RNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and resuspended in RNase-free water. An aliquot of the transcript was analyzed on a denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics STORM 860). The average yield of transcription products, including full-length and truncated ones, was 200 and 170 ng from (−)-anti-trans- and (+)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted templates, respectively. Transcription with the unadducted template generated an average of 510 ng of full-length transcript. RNA-templated DNA synthesis reactions (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm of each dNTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 50 units of RNasin, 10–50 ng of RNA transcript, 2 pmol of a 21-mer DNA oligonucleotide primer, and 0.5 pmol of RNase H-deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The RNA was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice before adding to the other reagents. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then terminated by the addition of EDTA to 15 mm. The RNA:DNA hybrids were denatured at 80 °C and cooled on ice, and the RNA was digested with 50 units of RNase A and 800 units of RNase T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, using glycogen as a carrier, and resuspended in sterile water. An aliquot of the cDNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized with a PhosphorImager. The amount of cDNA synthesis was estimated by cutting out the cDNA bands from the gel and determining the radioactivity in a 5-ml scintillation cocktail in an LS7800 scintillation counter (Beckman). The 5′-end of the cDNA was phosphorylated in a 50-μl reaction that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm ATP, and 100 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase per pmol of cDNA. Phosphorylation reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by heating at 70 °C for 5 min. The cDNA fragment was hybridized to a double-stranded circular M13mp2 substrate that contained a 442-base single-stranded gap. The gap spanned the sequence in the lacZα gene complementary to the cDNA (lac positions −216 to +195). A molar excess of cDNA was mixed with gapped M13mp2 DNA in 300 mmNaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, heated to 70 °C, and slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed product was analyzed by electrophoresis in an 0.8% agarose gel and transfected into anE. coli α-complementation host, and mutations were scored, all as described previously (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Templates for transcription were constructed that contained the lacZαmutational target and the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The target for measuring transcriptional errors, a TAA stop codon, was engineered at positions +66 to +68 in the lacZα sequence on the nontranscribed (+)-strand. Opposite the T of the ochre codon, the transcribed strand contained either (+)-anti-trans-N 6-BPDE-adducted adenine, (−)-anti-trans-N 6-BPDE-adducted adenine, or nonadducted adenine (Fig.1). To ensure that the BPDE-adducted transcription templates produced by primer extension reactions actually contained BPDE-adducted adenine, a unique recognition site for the restriction endonucleaseAflII, CTTAAG, was created by changing the alanine codon preceding the ochre codon from GCC to GCT, which also codes for alanine. Accordingly, the BPDE-adducted adenine was predicted to reside in the center of the AflII recognition sequence (5′-CTTA*AG-3′, where A* represents BPDE-adducted adenine) and to inhibit restriction of an adducted template. This was indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 1 C. Templates containing BPDE-adducted adenine were resistant to AflII restriction (Fig.1 C, lanes 4 and 5), whereas the unadducted template was completely cleaved (Fig. 1 C,lane 6). Thus, by treating the BPDE-adducted templates withAflII following completion of the primer extension reactions and prior to gel purification, a homogeneous, fully adducted transcription template was assured. Run-off transcription fromFspI-linearized templates is predicted to generate a transcript 313 nucleotides in length (from position −118 through +195). Reactions performed using either an unadducted template or a template in which adenine at position +66 was adducted with (+)-anti-trans- or (−)-anti-trans-BPDE generated 313-nucleotide transcripts, as shown in Fig.2 A. In each reaction with an adducted template, several shorter bands were observed, including one major band. These truncated transcripts indicate that the polymerase had stalled or dissociated. We have estimated that the major band representing the truncated product is approximately 3 nucleotides shorter than a transcript generated from an AflII-linearized template, which is predicted to yield a 186-nucleotide transcript. If transcription was aborted after insertion of a nucleotide directly opposite the adduct, the RNA would be 184 nucleotides in length. Therefore, we deduce that the transcript is probably truncated one base 5′ of the adduct, at position +65. Based on the amount of full-length transcript relative to the total amount of products in the lane, there was 32% bypass for (−)-anti-trans-BPDE and an 18% bypass for (+)-anti-trans-BPDE (Fig. 2 B). The amount of full-length transcript in reactions with the (−)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted template was significantly greater than in reactions with the (+)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted template. This was verified by the Wilcoxon rank sum test, which gave a p value of 0.05. As is indicated by the presence of truncated transcripts, the BPDE adducts did impede transcription; however, T7 RNAP was able to bypass both adducts to generate full-length transcripts. The observation that T7 RNAP was capable of transcription past the BPDE adducts allowed us to examine the fidelity of bypass synthesis. Transcriptional fidelity measurements were obtained using an ochre codon reversion assay based on complementation of β-galactosidase activity by the α-peptide portion of the enzyme. This assay is a modification of a method that we used previously to examine the fidelity of reverse transcription (37Boyer J.C. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6919-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, transcription was carried out from the T7 promoter, which was located 5′ to the lacZα gene. The run-off transcript was primed with a DNA oligonucleotide and cDNA synthesis performed. The cDNA was hybridized to a double-stranded, circular M13mp2 substrate containing a single-stranded gap that spanned the lacZα gene complementary to the cDNA. The products of cDNA hybridization reactions were transfected into an E. coli α-complementation host, which yielded rescued errors as mutant plaques. This assay focuses specifically on single-base substitution errors at the three-base mutational target, the TAA ochre codon in the lacZα sequence. Accurate transcription of the ochre codon-containing template results in a white plaque. Of the nine possible single base substitutions at the TAA codon, seven are predicted to restore partial or complete lacZαcomplementation and result in a blue plaque phenotype, while two result in nonsense codons and do not yield a phenotypically detectable change in plaque color (38Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar). Transcripts generated from the two BPDE-adducted templates and the control, unadducted template were used as templates for cDNA synthesis. The cDNAs were then hybridized to a gapped M13mp2 substrate containing the TAA ochre codon at positions +66 to +68 within the single-stranded region (see “Experimental Procedures”). We specifically selected full-length or nearly full-length transcripts as templates for cDNA products by using a 21-mer oligonucleotide cDNA primer complementary to the 3′-terminal region of a full-length, run-off transcript (primer extends from lacposition +172 to +191). The products of the hybridization reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. The mobility of these products was compared with that of gapped M13mp2 and double-stranded, nicked M13mp2 RF II DNAs. The products of all three hybridization reactions co-migrated with the double-stranded M13mp2 RF II DNA (data not shown), ensuring that all gapped DNA molecules have received a cDNA copy. Recovery of transcription errors required not only successful cDNA synthesis and hybridization to the gapped substrate, but also expression of the M13mp2 minus strand containing the hybridized cDNA upon transfection. To determine the efficiency at which the cDNA genotypes were expressed, cDNAs were made from transcripts that contained either GAA or AAA in place of the ochre codon. M13mp2 DNA with either of the two codons in place of the ochre codon at positions +66 to +68 yields a dark blue plaque phenotype upon transfection. GAA or AAA cDNAs were hybridized to colorless (TAA) gapped substrate, and the resulting “blue-white” heteroduplexes were transfected into E. coli. The number of white plaques, which result from expression of the plus strand, was compared with the number of dark blue plaques, which represent expression of the minus strand. 47 and 22% minus strand expression was observed for AAA and GAA codon-containing heteroduplexes, respectively, each being an average of two independent determinations. While 47% expression is similar to the average minus strand expression values previously observed (37Boyer J.C. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6919-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 22% expression is roughly 2-fold lower. This difference (47 versus 22%) is not inconsistent with previous results (Ref. 39Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 3K. M. Remington, S. E. Bennett, C. M. Harris, T. M. Harris, and K. Bebenek, unpublished observations.indicating that the expression of the minus strand for different heteroduplexes may vary up to 2-fold. We have used the values of 47 and 22% to calculate the error rate of AAA and GAA revertants, respectively. For calculation of the error rate of other events and the overall base substitution error rate, we have used the mean of AAA and GAA expression efficiency values, 35%. Competent E. coli cells were transfected with the products of the hybridization reactions. Reactions containing cDNAs generated from transcripts of the unadducted template yielded an average overall reversion frequency of 0.3 × 10−4(Table I). In contrast, products of hybridization reactions containing cDNAs generated from transcription of the (−)-anti-trans- and (+)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted templates yielded reversion frequencies of 3300 × 10−4 and 1800 × 10−4, respectively (Table I). Both transcription and reverse transcription may contribute to these reversion frequencies. However, the reversion frequency resulting from reverse transcription errors is at most 0.3 × 10−4, assuming that all errors observed from reactions with the unadducted template were introduced by the reverse transcriptase. Thus, the observed 11,000- and 6000-fold increase in reversion frequency for reactions with the (−)-anti-trans- and (+)-anti-trans-BPDE-adducted templates, respectively, relative to reactions with the unadducted template, is clearly due to transcription errors. We therefore conclude that transcriptional bypass of BPDE-adducted adenine is highly mutagenic.Table IReversion frequencies for reactions with BPDE-adducted or unadducted templatesTemplatePlaques scoredReversion frequency1-aReversion frequencies were derived from the proportion of revertants compared with the total number of plaques.IncreaseRevertantsTotal× 10−4-foldUnadducted Expt.1-bExpt., experiment. 14220,0000.20 Expt. 29240,0000.38 Mean0.301(−)-anti-trans-BPDE Expt. 1220064003400 Expt. 2190055003400 Expt. 3220070003200 Mean330011,000(+)-anti-trans-BPDE Expt. 198060001600 Expt. 275037002000 Mean18006000Reactions, transfections, and platings were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Ref. 31Bebenek K.

https://openalex.org/W2006500380,"HOX proteins are dependent upon cofactors of the PBX family for specificity of DNA binding. Two regions that have been implicated in HOX/PBX cooperative interactions are the YPWM motif, found N-terminal to the HOX homeodomain, and the GKFQ domain (also known as the Hox cooperativity motif) immediately C-terminal to the PBX homeodomain. Using derivatives of the E2A-PBX oncoprotein, we find that the GKFQ domain is not essential for cooperative interaction with HOXA1 but contributes to the stability of the complex. By contrast, the YPWM motif is strictly required for cooperative interactions in vitro and in vivo, even with mutants of E2A-PBX lacking the GKFQ domain. Using truncated PBX proteins, we show that the YPWM motif contacts the PBX homeodomain. The presence of the GKFQ domain increases monomer binding by the PBX homeodomain 5-fold, and the stability of the HOXA1·E2A-PBX complex 2-fold. These data suggest that the GKFQ domain acts mainly to increase DNA binding by PBX, rather than providing a primary contact site for the YPWM motif of HOXA1. We have identified 2 residues, Glu-301 and Tyr-305, required for GKFQ function and suggest that this is dependent on α-helical character."

Proteinases react with α2M by cleaving any of a number of susceptible peptide bonds in the “bait region,” which includes amino acids 666–706 (1Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem.

Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bait region cleavage causes α2M to undergo a major conformational change, which effectively “traps” the attacking proteinase in a complex that is nondissociable, even when the proteinase and the inhibitor are not covalently linked (1Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 6Bjo¨rk I. Fish W.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Gonias S.L.

Conformational change also reveals binding sites for the α2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (9Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M.

These binding sites have been localized to 18-kDa peptides at the C terminus of each α2M subunit; Lys-1370 and Lys-1374 play particularly important roles (10Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J.

Like the complement components, C3 and C4, each α2M subunit contains a novel thiol ester bond, which is formed from the side chains of Cys-949 and Glu-952 (14Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Swenson R.P. Howard J.B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 18Gettins P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When α2M reacts with a proteinase, the thiol esters emerge from within hydrophobic, solvent-restricted clefts and are cleaved by nucleophiles or H2O (14Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 18Gettins P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Small primary amines, such as methylamine, penetrate the hydrophobic clefts and react with α2M thiol esters independently of proteinases, inducing an equivalent or nearly equivalent conformational change (6Bjo¨rk I. Fish W.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Gonias S.L. Reynolds J.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to its activity as a proteinase inhibitor, α2M functions as a major carrier and regulator of certain cytokines, including isoforms of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family. O'Connor-McCourt and Wakefield (19O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first identified α2M as a physiologically significant carrier of TGF-β in human serum (19O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their studies demonstrated that nearly all of the TGF-β1 in serum is associated with α2M and that the bound TGF-β1 is inactive. Huang et al. (20Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1535-1541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed the role of α2M as a TGF-β-carrier and demonstrated that the TGF-β binding activity of α2M depends on its conformational state. More recent studies have demonstrated the function of α2M as a TGF-β-carrier in animal model systems. When radioiodinated TGF-β1 is injected intravascularly in mice, the cytokine is cleared rapidly at first; however, this is followed by a slow clearance phase, during which time the TGF-β is almost entirely α2M-associated (21Philip A.

Neutralization of endogenously synthesized TGF-β results in altered gene expression, including greatly increased expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase by murine macrophages and increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor α-receptor by vascular smooth muscle cells (27Lysiak J.J.

The function of α2M as a significant modulator of TGF-β activity in vivo andin vitro has prompted us to elucidate the α2M-TGF-β interaction on a molecular level. Binding of TGF-β to α2M is initially noncovalent and reversible; however, the complex can become covalently stabilized as a result of thiol-disulfide exchange (23Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B.S. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 737: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter reaction is observed primarily with conformationally altered α2M, since native α2M lacks free thiol groups (23Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B.S.

We have used a number of complementary methods to determine equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) for the interaction of TGF-β with α2M (23Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B.

Biophys. 1992; 292: 449-487Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The K Dvalues for the binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to native α2M are 300 and 10 nm, respectively; the KD values for the binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to methylamine-modified α2M (α2M-MA) are 80 and 10 nm, respectively. These binding constants accurately predict the ability of α2M to neutralize TGF-β in cell culture systems (26Webb D.J. Atkins T.L. Crookston K.P. Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30402-30406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

The mechanism by which α2M binds cytokines remains unclear. Early studies, suggesting a prominent role for the thiol ester-derived Cys-residues, were not confirmed for TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (32Crookston K.P. Gonias S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1578-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When α2M-MA was treated with papain to release the 18-kDa receptor binding domains, the TGF-β-binding activity remained with the residual 600-kDa α2M fragment (36LaMarre J. Hayes M.A. Wollenberg G.K. Hussaini I. Hall S.W. Gonias S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytokine- and LRP-binding sites are not co-localized. The goal of this study was to determine whether TGF-β-binding can be localized to a specific region in the structure of α2M. An alternative model is that the central cavity in the structure of α2M, which serves as the proteinase trap, also nonspecifically binds cytokines. Arguments in support of the alternative model include the complex quaternary structure of α2M, the known trapping mechanism by which α2M interacts with proteinases, and the large number of structurally unrelated cytokines that have been reported to associate with α2M (37LaMarre J. Wollenberg G.K. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence demonstrating, for the first time, that TGF-β binding to α2M is not dependent on α2M quaternary structure and thus not dependent on the α2M trap. Furthermore, we localize the TGF-β-binding site to a single 20-kDa peptide that also contains the α2M bait region. The 20-kDa peptide, when expressed as a GST fusion protein, binds both TGF-β isoforms with equivalent or increased affinity, compared with intact α2M. The peptide also neutralizes the activity of TGF-β in endothelial cell proliferation assays and macrophage NO synthesis experiments. Thus, this 20-kDa peptide mimics the TGF-β-regulatory activity of intact homotetrameric α2M. TGF-β2 was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). TGF-β1 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Nerve growth factor-β (NGF-β) was purified from male mouse submaxillary glands by the method of Darling and Shooter (38Darling T.L. Shooter E.M. Barnes D.W. Sirbasku D.A. Sato G.H.

Methylamine HCl, chloramine T, iodoacetamide (IAM), dithiothreitol (DTT), isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside, N-octyl glucopyranoside, glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione, anti-GST IgG fraction of antiserum, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. Na125I was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pGEX-3X, pGEX-2T, and prepacked glutathione-Sepharose-4B columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immulon 2 microtiter plates were from Dynatech Laboratories (Chantilly, VA). Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and nitrocellulose membranes were from Millipore Corp. IODO-GEN was from Pierce. RPMI 1640, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and Trypsin-EDTA were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone Laboratories. Acidic fibroblast growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor were from Promega. Human α2M was purified from plasma by the method of Imber and Pizzo (39Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murinoglobulin (MUG) was purified from the plasma of CD-1 female mice as described previously (30Webb D.J. Wen J. Lysiak J.J. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified MUG revealed a single band with an apparent mass of 180 kDa. α2M-MA was prepared by dialyzing human α2M against 200 mm methylamine-HCl in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.2, for 12 h at 22 °C followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), at 4 °C. Complete modification of native α2M by methylamine was confirmed by loss of trypsin binding activity (greater than 96%) (40Ganrot P.O. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 16: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and by the characteristic increase in electrophoretic mobility, when analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE (41Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 42Van Leuven F. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric α2M was prepared by exposing the native form of the protein to a high concentration of DTT (2 mm) under nondenaturing conditions, as described by Moncinoet al. (43Moncino M.D. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1545-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Incompletely dissociated α2M was separated from the monomers by FPLC on Superose-6. Monomeric α2M, which is prepared as described, does not reassociate at 22 °C (44Gonias S.L. Marshall L.B. Figler N.L. Hussaini I.M. Moncino M.D. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The human α2M cDNA in pAT153/PvuII/8 (pAT-α2M) was obtained from the ATCC (16Kan C.-C. Solomon E. Belt K.T. Chain A.C. Hiorns L.R. Fey G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2282-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Restriction digest analysis revealed an additionalSacI cleavage site, which was not predicted by the published sequence (16Kan C.-C. Solomon E. Belt K.T. Chain A.C. Hiorns L.R. Fey G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2282-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), due to a single base substitution at nucleotide 2431 (C → T). To generate a construct encoding GST-α2M peptide fusion protein-1 (FP1), a fragment from pAT-α2M that encodes amino acids 122–415 was excised with BstXI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into pGEX-3X at theSmaI site. The construct encoding FP2 was prepared by digesting pAT-α2M with EcoRI andNsiI, to yield a partial cDNA encoding amino acids 364–712, which was further digested with SacI, to generate a cDNA encoding amino acids 364–613. This fragment was blunt-ended and ligated into pGEX-2T at the SmaI site. Constructs encoding FP3 and FP4 were prepared by isolating cDNAs, from aSacI digest of pAT-α2M, corresponding to amino acids 614–797 and 798–1082, respectively. These cDNAs were blunt-ended and ligated into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T. The construct encoding FP5 was prepared by digesting pAT-α2M with XhoI and PstI. A resulting cDNA, which encodes amino acids 1053–1302, was blunt-ended and ligated into pGEX-2T at the SmaI site. Restriction digest analysis of the five constructs confirmed that the α2M cDNA inserts were in the correct orientation. Fig. 1shows the relationship of the five peptides to the intact structure of α2M. BL21 cells harboring pGEX-α2M-peptide expression constructs were induced with 0.1 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 3 h at 37 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0. Nearly pure fusion protein preparations were generated by treating bacterial suspensions with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min on ice. The suspensions were then sonicated and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. All five fusion proteins remained in the insoluble fraction. These fractions were suspended in 10 mm deoxycholate for 2 h, sonicated, and subjected to a second centrifugation step. The fusion proteins, which again remained in the insoluble fractions, were solubilized by sonication in 2.0% SDS. To block free sulfhydryls, each fusion protein was reacted with 1 mm IAM in SDS for 2 h at 25 °C. The IAM was then removed by dialysis. Final fusion protein preparations were stored in SDS. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. Highly purified preparations of FP3 and FP4 were isolated in the absence of SDS by treating the original lysozyme extracts with 1.5% (w/v) Sarkosyl and 5 mm DTT. The FP3 and FP4, which solubilized in the Sarkosyl, were passed sequentially through 18- and 25-gauge needles and subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 ×g. The supernatants, which contained the fusion proteins, were treated with Triton X-100 (2% v/v) to sequester the Sarkosyl (45Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and then subjected to affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. FP3 and FP4, which eluted from the column, were dialyzed against 1.5% Sarkosyl, 1 mm DTT and treated with IAM (5 mm) for 2 h at 25 °C to block free sulfhydryl groups. The final preparations were then dialyzed extensively against PBS. Native α2M, α2M-MA, MUG, and BSA were incubated in 2% SDS, in the presence or absence of 1 mm DTT, for 30 min at 37 °C. To block free sulfhydryls, some samples were treated with 5 mmIAM for 2 h at 25 °C. Equivalent amounts of each protein (5 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% slabs. IAM-treated GST-α2M-peptide fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE as well. All samples were electrotransferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 12 h at 4 °C and then rinsed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T). Membranes with native α2M, α2M-MA, MUG, and BSA were probed with125I-TGF-β2 (20 pm),125I-TGF-β1 (20 pm), or125I-NGF-β (50 pm) for 2 h at 25 °C; membranes with the five GST-α2M peptide fusion proteins were probed with 125I-TGF-β2. The TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were radioiodinated, to a specific activity of 100–200 μCi/μg, as described previously (46Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NGF-β was radioiodinated with IODO-GEN, to a specific activity of 2–5 μCi/μg, using the method recommended by the manufacturer. To determine whether TGF-β binding to FP3 is noncovalent and specific, membranes containing immobilized FP3 (0.5 μg) were incubated with 125I-TGF-β1 (0.25 nm) or 125 I-TGF-β2 (0.25 nm) in the presence of unlabeled TGF-β1 (200 nm), unlabeled TGF-β2 (200 nm), or solution phase FP3 (1.0 μm). After washing the membranes with PBS-T, bound radioligands were detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). GST-α2M peptide fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T for 12 h at 4 °C, incubated with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes GST and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Binding of secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 125I-TGF-β2 (0.5 nm) was incubated with FP3 or FP4 (0.5 μm) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. The FP3 and FP4 were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, treated with IAM, and free of detergents.125I-TGF-β2-fusion protein complexes were separated from free 125I-TGF-β2 by FPLC on prepacked Superose-12 columns. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. Elution of FP3 or FP4 was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm.125I-TGF-β2 was detected in elution fractions using a γ-counter. To calibrate the FPLC, the following proteins were subjected to chromatography on the same column: soybean trypsin inhibitor (M r ~21,500,V e of 14.1 ml), ovalbumin (M r ~45,000, V e of 12.9 ml), BSA (M r ~66,000,V e of 12.1 ml), and BSA dimer (M r ~132,000, V e of 10.9 ml). α2M-MA (1 μg in 100 μl) was incubated in 96-well microtiter plates for 4 h at 22 °C, as described previously (33Webb D.J. Crookston K.P. Hall S.W. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 449-487Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This procedure results in the immobilization of approximately 90 fmol of α2M-MA. The wells were washed three times with PBS-T and blocked with PBS-T for 16 h at 4 °C. As a control, some wells were blocked with PBT-T without first immobilizing α2M-MA. 125I-TGF-β1 or125I-TGF-β2 (0.1 nm) was incubated with the immobilized α2M-MA in the presence of increasing concentrations of FP3 or FP4 (4–250 nm) for 1 h at 22 °C. The fusion proteins were purified and detergent-free. The wells were then washed three times with PBS-T.125I-TGF-β, which was associated with the immobilized phase, was recovered in 0.1 m NaOH, 2% SDS and quantitated in a γ-counter. Results were analyzed by plotting the specific binding of 125I-TGF-β versus the log of the fusion protein concentration. In these experiments, the concentration of TGF-β (TGF-β1 or TGF-β2) was at least 100-fold lower than theK D for TGF-β-binding to immobilized α2M-MA. Thus, TGF-β-binding was linearly related to the free TGF-β concentration ([βF]), according to the following equation: B = (B max/K D)[βF]. In the presence of a fusion protein (FP) that binds TGF-β, the total concentration of TGF-β ([βT]) was related to [βF], at equilibrium, as follows: [βT] = [βF](1 + [FP]/K I). If the fusion protein-TGF-β complex did not bind to immobilized α2M-MA, then TGF-β-binding was reduced by 50% (the IC50) when [βT]/[βF] = 2, and the fusion protein concentration that yielded the IC50was equal to the K I. FBHE cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 20 ng/ml acidic fibroblast growth factor, and 80 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and passaged at subconfluence with trypsin-EDTA. To perform proliferation assays, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104/well (24-well plates) in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS. The cells were pulse-exposed to TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (10 pm), in the presence and absence of FP3 or FP4 (200 nm), for 1 h. The fusion proteins were preincubated with the TGF-β for 15 min and then added to the cultures. At the completion of an incubation, the cultures were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and then allowed to incubate in DMEM with 0.2% FBS for 30 h. [3H]Thymidine was added for an additional 18 h; the cells were then harvested, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was quantitated. NO synthesis by RAW 264.7 cells was quantitated by measuring the stable NO oxidation product, nitrite, in conditioned medium, as described previously (47Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J.

Cells were plated at a density of 104/well in 96-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS for 24 h and then in RPMI 1640 without serum (SFM) for an additional 24 h. α2M-MA, FP3, FP4, or GST was added separately to the cultures in SFM. The fusion proteins were purified and detergent-free. After 24 h, conditioned medium (100 μl) was recovered, and nitrite was measured.

EP-DNA binds RFXI, a member of a novel family of DNA-binding proteins that is conserved through evolution and in yeast, it controls differentiation and exit from the mitotic cycle to G0. EP-associated proteins are preferentially tyrosine phosphorylated and the associated c-Abl has strong tyrosine kinase activity. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying this c-Abl kinase activity. We show that RFXI and c-Abl are in direct interaction, in vitro and in cell extracts, through the RFXI proline rich (PxxP) motif and the c-Abl SH3 domain. Remarkably, this interaction significantly potentiates c-Abl but not v-Abl auto-kinase activity. Collectively, we describe a novel mechanism of c-Abl recruitment to a defined DNA-cis element with its concomitant kinase activation. We propose that this mechanism may act to regulate cell-cycle control genes."

To investigate the role of the different domains of CSW, we constructed domain-specific csw mutations and assayed their effects on CSW function. Our results indicate that CSW SH2 domain function is essential, but either CSW SH2 domain can fulfill this requirement. We also found that CSW and activated SEV are associatedin vivo in a manner that does not require either CSW SH2 domain function or tyrosine phosphorylation of SEV. In contrast, the interaction between CSW and Daughter of Sevenless, a CSW substrate, is dependent on SH2 domain function. These results suggest that the role of the CSW SH2 domains during SEV signaling is to bind Daughter of Sevenless rather than activated SEV. We also found that although CSW protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity is required for full CSW function, a catalytically inactive CSW is capable of providing partial function. In addition, we found that deletion of either the CSW protein- tyrosine phosphatase insert or the entire CSW carboxyl terminus, which includes a conserved DRK/GRB2 SH2 domain binding sequence, does not abolish CSW function."
https://openalex.org/W2332774334,"A peptide signal, which may control nucleo-cytoplasmic protein trafficking, was newly identified in human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) Rev, a lentiviral post-transcriptional transactivator. The sequence, in the amino-terminal portion of HIV-1 Rev, maintains a Rev mutant with a dysfunctional nuclear/nucleolar targeting signal outside of the nucleus, although this Rev molecule itself is small enough to pass through the nuclear pores. Transition of this sequence to the N-terminus of human T-lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) p21x, which is usually located evenly distributed throughout the cell, resulted in capture of p21x in the cytoplasm. Mutational analysis clarified that a 14 residue peptide sequence was sufficient to display this inhibitory effect against nuclear entry. Furthermore, this HIV-1 Rev sequence was capable of inhibiting nuclear entry of a fragment of a human ribosomal protein, when it was fused to the carboxy terminus. The identified nuclear entry inhibitory signal (NIS) contains a conserved hydrophilicity motif, which forms an amphipathic helix. Significantly, this motif and its helical structure were shown to be important for NIS function and the HIV-1 Rev function itself. Possible roles for NIS as a molecular anchor are proposed herein."

Sandhoff K. Kwon H.Y. Harzer K. Nakano T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7556-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 13 (or 14) exons are spread over ~30 kb of human chromosome 10. Interestingly, the prosaposin gene, a presumed “housekeeping” gene, displays temporally and spatially regulated expression (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the ubiquitous role of lysosomal hydrolases in all tissue types, the level of prosaposin expression is highly dependent on the cell type and maturation. The highest levels of expression are in specific neurons of the adult cerebrum, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and neurons of the lateral regions of the spinal cord (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Components of the hind brain also show higher levels of mRNA expression early in embryogenesis (15Sprecher-Levy H. Orr-Urtreger A. Lonai P. Horowitz M. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1993; 39: 287-299PubMed Google Scholar).Previously, we characterized the 5′ region of the murine prosaposin gene including the first exon that contains the translation initiation site (16Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The first intron of the mouse prosaposin locus is unusually large, almost 15 kb, and constitutes nearly 60% of the gene. Like many other housekeeping genes, the promoter region of the murine prosaposin gene is “TATA-less” and GC rich. The prosaposin gene has a major and a minor transcription start site. Transfection of deletion constructs containing reporter genes into NS20Y, NIH-3T3, or SF-7 (Sertoli) cells showed positive and negative regulatory elements within 2,400 bp 5′ to the transcription start sites (16Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report the characterization of a major regulatory fragment located within 310 bp 5′ to the murine prosaposin gene transcription start site. DNA footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and site-directed mutagenesis were used to analyzein vitro the interaction of transcription factors that bind to this fragment. Sp members 1, 3, and 4; RORα (the orphan nuclear receptor); and an unknown transcription factor (U) were identified to be involved in the regulation of the murine prosaposin gene. A complex interaction of multiple transcription factors is proposed to modulate gene expression from one essential Sp1 binding site within 16 bp 5′ to the transcription start site.DISCUSSIONThe multifunctional properties of prosaposin, its intracellular and extracellular functions, and the temporal and spatial regulation of its locus provided the rationale for the current studies to define the elements that facilitate expression of the prosaposin gene. Of lysosomal loci, prosaposin (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar), lysosomal acid lipase (26Du H. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 937-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and acid α-glucosidase (27Ponce E. Witte D.P. Hirschhorn R. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum Genet. 1997; 61 (abstr.): 180Google Scholar) have shown sufficient temporal and spatial variation in transcript levels to permit differential detection byin situ hybridization. Thus, elucidation of the control elements for transcription of the prosaposin locus is essential to understanding the relationship of this regulation, biological function, and the modulation of its activities in various tissues. For the current studies, we have focused on the 310-bp 5′ to the transcriptional start site, since initial analysis in transgenic mice indicates that this is an important region for promoter activity in the central nervous system. The present results indicate a potential for complex regulation based upon the milieu of transcription factors present in various tissues. The current studies define an essential Sp1 binding site (Sp1D) just 5′ to the transcription start site and a 5′ functional Sp1/U cluster (Sp1A, -B, and -C, and an unknown factor (U)), and RORE. All of these participate in the modulation of prosaposin transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Sp1 and Sp3 interact at sites in the Sp1/U cluster to modulate prosaposin transcriptional activity. Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 bind to the Sp1D site. Other potential binding sites in this region, i.e. AP-1 and GATA, were nonfunctional and apparently play little role in the modulation of transcriptional activity of this locus.The most 3′ Sp1 site, just 16 bp upstream from the major transcriptional start site, is essential to promoter activity. From EMSA, the Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 members of the Sp family of transcription factors bind to this region. Although Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed with some temporal and spatial regulation of expression (28Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), Sp4 expression appears to be limited to brain and the reproductive system (29Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 284-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 at the Sp1D site depends on the transcription factor milieu that may determine the tissue specific expression of prosaposin. The NS20Y line used here has cholinergic properties and prosaposin exerts neurite outgrowth effects in this particular NS20Y subculture (8Qi X. Qin W. Sun Y. Kondoh K. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6874-6880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, a high level of expression of the prosaposin gene was observed in NS20Y cells by immunofluorescence analyses. 2P. Jin, Y. Sun, and G. A. Grabowski, unpublished observation.Thus, we selected this cell type to assess the specific effects of our constructs in nervous system tissues, since primary cultures of various neurons are not clearly adaptable to transfection assays. It appears that the NS20Y cells contain at least some complement of the endogenous transcription factors present in specific neurons in the brain and probably are not representative of all specific neuronal types throughout the brain substance. Ongoing transgenic analyses in these laboratories show that the Sp1D site is also essential to prosaposin expression in transgenic animals (30Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59 (abstr.): 160Google Scholar). Based upon the ubiquitous expression of Sp1 and Sp3, we would propose that the Sp1D site is responsible for basal expression of prosaposin in a variety of tissues. Thus, the basal expression provided by this Sp1 site could be modulated by varying and competitive Sp3 or Sp4 levels. The Sp1D site would provide for necessary lysosomal functions of the derived saposins on glycosphingolipid hydrolases throughout the body. This Sp1 site would require interaction with other promoter components for tissue-specific modulation of transcription and activity observed throughout development and in a variety of cellular types, particularly in the brain and reproductive system.The Sp1A, -B, and -C; U; and RORE sites appear to have a primarily negative regulatory effects on the basal activity of Sp1D in NS20Y cells. This conclusion is based upon the findings that individual mutations of these binding sites lead to an enhanced activity of the reporter gene when the Sp1D site is functional. However, when the Sp1D site is mutated, these upstream sites have some positive effects on the reporter gene transcription and can provide a substantial level expression. Mutation of all of the sites, the 5′ Sp1/U cluster, RORE, and the Sp1D, nearly obliterates activity. The negative modulatory effects on the Sp1D site of these upstream sites are supported by the relatively weak protection in DNA footprinting of the most Sp1A, -B, and -C sites and the U site. Indeed, an explanation for this relatively weak footprint is the presence of competing transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, and potentially U, for this region leading to a less clear footprint than might be anticipated. Strong and very distinct footprints are obtained in the 5′ Sp binding regions with purified Sp1 protein. The EMSA assays clearly show specific binding to sites in this Sp1/U cluster region and competition between Sp1 and Sp3. Although the Sp1C and U sites overlap, EMSA analysis indicated they have separable activities. The U site is not an MZF binding site as is evident from competition assays with cold oligonucleotides. Thus, the transcription factor binding to the U site remains unidentified. However, the mutagenesis, supershift, and competition assays support interaction of Sp1, Sp3, and U in a complex manner for the binding sites at this upstream region. The mutagenesis of individual Sp1 and the U sites within this cluster leads to increased promoter activity over the wild-type sequence. The largest increases were observed with mutagenesis of the Sp1B and -C sites in the cluster with or without U mutations. Lower promoter activity was found with two of these cluster Sp1 sites, with or without U being obliterated. These results indicate a negative interaction between the factors binding to the Sp1B or -C sites and the U site in the cluster. The increase in absolute activity between m234 and m310 shows a positive overall effect of the presence of this 5′ cluster. The RORE has additive effects (~23%) on promoter activity in the context of the Sp1D site. In constructs containing the 5′ Sp1/U cluster, the effects are less than expected. For example, m310mK increased promoter activity relative to wild type when RORE was mutated; i.e. this indicates a negative interaction between factors binding at RORE and the 5′ Sp1/U cluster. The greater activity with m310mQ than m310mG suggests that negative interaction is primarily via the Sp1A and -B sites in the cluster, but U is not involved. Thus, it is likely that the tissue milieu of transcription factors that compete for these upstream sites could provide a variety of suppressive interactions for the Sp1D site and modulate the background activity provided by an unmodulated Sp1D site.The RORα nuclear receptor is expressed primarily in neurons of the brain and provides a tempting target for the neuronal specific expression modulation of prosaposin. In particular, the recent identification of the RORα gene deletion in the staggerermouse indicates the profound effects of the absence of this receptor (31Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L Berkel V.V. Birren B. Kruglyak L. Lander E. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the staggerer mouse, Purkinje cell development and migration as well as olivo-pontine neurons degenerate progressively through adulthood (32Hadj-Sahraoui N. Frederic F. Zanjani H. Herrup K. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Mariani J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 98: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, some target sequences for RORα have a maintenance and, potentially, trophic effect upon these specific types of neurons during brain development. The massive destruction of neurons in the brains of the prosaposin knockout make it difficult to assess trophic effects of prosaposin deficiency in that animal model, but thestaggerer mouse may provide an interesting model system for the evaluation of prosaposin trophic effects on cerebellar development and maintenance.The mutagenesis and expression studies support a complex model of prosaposin promoter function within the first 310 bp 5′ to the transcription start site. A model is proposed in Fig.8 that indicates a basal functional activity of the 3′ Sp1 site and a combination of transcription factor interactions at the more upstream sites that are primarily negative in their modulatory functions. The negative effects are principally mediated by a negative (competitive) interaction of factors binding to the Sp1/U cluster, since enhanced promoter activity is observed when any of the sites in this cluster are obliterated. RORE factors also negatively interact with this cluster, since enhanced activity of m310 is apparent when RORE is destroyed. For the Sp1/U cluster, we showed competition of Sp1 and Sp3. We would propose that such competition could be extended to Sp4 at the Sp1D site and that the occupancy of various transcription sites, depending upon the chromatin and DNA structure in the region, could interfere or interact with each other to down- or up-regulate the basal Sp1D site function. These studies have not defined factors that are clearly tissue-specific for the modulation of prosaposin function in neurons, the reproductive tract, or specific epithelial cells throughout the body. Our previous in vitrostudies indicate negative regulatory elements within the first 741 bp 5′ to the transcription start site and the large first intron (~15 kb) provide additional targets for tissue specificity and/or facilitator functions of prosaposin expression in more physiologic systems. However, our preliminary transgenic data (30Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59 (abstr.): 160Google Scholar) show that the first 310 bp 5′ to the start site contains elements that promote prosaposin expression in neurons of the central nervous system and that the interaction of the factors described here must have a significant effect on the modulation of regional prosaposin expression in that organ system. Prosaposin is a multifunctional protein with specific intra- and extracellular functions. It is the precursor of four 80-amino acid glycoprotein activators (1O'Brien J.S. Kretz K.A. Dewji N.

Prosaposin also functions in glycosphingolipid transfer between artificial membranes (10Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the murine prosaposin gene resulted in a complex phenotype including severe central nervous system disease and widespread storage of multiple sphingolipids (11Fujita N.

The human gene for prosaposin has been partially characterized to contain 13 (or 14) exons and 12 (or 13) introns (12Holtschmidt H. Sandhoff K. Kwon H.Y. Harzer K. Nakano T. Suzuki K. J. Biol.

Sandhoff K. Kwon H.Y. Harzer K. Nakano T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7556-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 13 (or 14) exons are spread over ~30 kb of human chromosome 10. Interestingly, the prosaposin gene, a presumed “housekeeping” gene, displays temporally and spatially regulated expression (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the ubiquitous role of lysosomal hydrolases in all tissue types, the level of prosaposin expression is highly dependent on the cell type and maturation. The highest levels of expression are in specific neurons of the adult cerebrum, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and neurons of the lateral regions of the spinal cord (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Components of the hind brain also show higher levels of mRNA expression early in embryogenesis (15Sprecher-Levy H. Orr-Urtreger A. Lonai P. Horowitz M. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1993; 39: 287-299PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized the 5′ region of the murine prosaposin gene including the first exon that contains the translation initiation site (16Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The first intron of the mouse prosaposin locus is unusually large, almost 15 kb, and constitutes nearly 60% of the gene. Like many other housekeeping genes, the promoter region of the murine prosaposin gene is “TATA-less” and GC rich. The prosaposin gene has a major and a minor transcription start site. Transfection of deletion constructs containing reporter genes into NS20Y, NIH-3T3, or SF-7 (Sertoli) cells showed positive and negative regulatory elements within 2,400 bp 5′ to the transcription start sites (16Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the characterization of a major regulatory fragment located within 310 bp 5′ to the murine prosaposin gene transcription start site. DNA footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), and site-directed mutagenesis were used to analyzein vitro the interaction of transcription factors that bind to this fragment. Sp members 1, 3, and 4; RORα (the orphan nuclear receptor); and an unknown transcription factor (U) were identified to be involved in the regulation of the murine prosaposin gene. A complex interaction of multiple transcription factors is proposed to modulate gene expression from one essential Sp1 binding site within 16 bp 5′ to the transcription start site. DISCUSSIONThe multifunctional properties of prosaposin, its intracellular and extracellular functions, and the temporal and spatial regulation of its locus provided the rationale for the current studies to define the elements that facilitate expression of the prosaposin gene. Of lysosomal loci, prosaposin (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar), lysosomal acid lipase (26Du H. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 937-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and acid α-glucosidase (27Ponce E. Witte D.P. Hirschhorn R. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum Genet. 1997; 61 (abstr.): 180Google Scholar) have shown sufficient temporal and spatial variation in transcript levels to permit differential detection byin situ hybridization. Thus, elucidation of the control elements for transcription of the prosaposin locus is essential to understanding the relationship of this regulation, biological function, and the modulation of its activities in various tissues. For the current studies, we have focused on the 310-bp 5′ to the transcriptional start site, since initial analysis in transgenic mice indicates that this is an important region for promoter activity in the central nervous system. The present results indicate a potential for complex regulation based upon the milieu of transcription factors present in various tissues. The current studies define an essential Sp1 binding site (Sp1D) just 5′ to the transcription start site and a 5′ functional Sp1/U cluster (Sp1A, -B, and -C, and an unknown factor (U)), and RORE. All of these participate in the modulation of prosaposin transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Sp1 and Sp3 interact at sites in the Sp1/U cluster to modulate prosaposin transcriptional activity. Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 bind to the Sp1D site. Other potential binding sites in this region, i.e. AP-1 and GATA, were nonfunctional and apparently play little role in the modulation of transcriptional activity of this locus.The most 3′ Sp1 site, just 16 bp upstream from the major transcriptional start site, is essential to promoter activity. From EMSA, the Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 members of the Sp family of transcription factors bind to this region. Although Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed with some temporal and spatial regulation of expression (28Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), Sp4 expression appears to be limited to brain and the reproductive system (29Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 284-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 at the Sp1D site depends on the transcription factor milieu that may determine the tissue specific expression of prosaposin. The NS20Y line used here has cholinergic properties and prosaposin exerts neurite outgrowth effects in this particular NS20Y subculture (8Qi X. Qin W. Sun Y. Kondoh K. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6874-6880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, a high level of expression of the prosaposin gene was observed in NS20Y cells by immunofluorescence analyses. 2P. Jin, Y. Sun, and G. A. Grabowski, unpublished observation.Thus, we selected this cell type to assess the specific effects of our constructs in nervous system tissues, since primary cultures of various neurons are not clearly adaptable to transfection assays. It appears that the NS20Y cells contain at least some complement of the endogenous transcription factors present in specific neurons in the brain and probably are not representative of all specific neuronal types throughout the brain substance. Ongoing transgenic analyses in these laboratories show that the Sp1D site is also essential to prosaposin expression in transgenic animals (30Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59 (abstr.): 160Google Scholar). Based upon the ubiquitous expression of Sp1 and Sp3, we would propose that the Sp1D site is responsible for basal expression of prosaposin in a variety of tissues. Thus, the basal expression provided by this Sp1 site could be modulated by varying and competitive Sp3 or Sp4 levels. The Sp1D site would provide for necessary lysosomal functions of the derived saposins on glycosphingolipid hydrolases throughout the body. This Sp1 site would require interaction with other promoter components for tissue-specific modulation of transcription and activity observed throughout development and in a variety of cellular types, particularly in the brain and reproductive system.The Sp1A, -B, and -C; U; and RORE sites appear to have a primarily negative regulatory effects on the basal activity of Sp1D in NS20Y cells. This conclusion is based upon the findings that individual mutations of these binding sites lead to an enhanced activity of the reporter gene when the Sp1D site is functional. However, when the Sp1D site is mutated, these upstream sites have some positive effects on the reporter gene transcription and can provide a substantial level expression. Mutation of all of the sites, the 5′ Sp1/U cluster, RORE, and the Sp1D, nearly obliterates activity. The negative modulatory effects on the Sp1D site of these upstream sites are supported by the relatively weak protection in DNA footprinting of the most Sp1A, -B, and -C sites and the U site. Indeed, an explanation for this relatively weak footprint is the presence of competing transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, and potentially U, for this region leading to a less clear footprint than might be anticipated. Strong and very distinct footprints are obtained in the 5′ Sp binding regions with purified Sp1 protein. The EMSA assays clearly show specific binding to sites in this Sp1/U cluster region and competition between Sp1 and Sp3. Although the Sp1C and U sites overlap, EMSA analysis indicated they have separable activities. The U site is not an MZF binding site as is evident from competition assays with cold oligonucleotides. Thus, the transcription factor binding to the U site remains unidentified. However, the mutagenesis, supershift, and competition assays support interaction of Sp1, Sp3, and U in a complex manner for the binding sites at this upstream region. The mutagenesis of individual Sp1 and the U sites within this cluster leads to increased promoter activity over the wild-type sequence. The largest increases were observed with mutagenesis of the Sp1B and -C sites in the cluster with or without U mutations. Lower promoter activity was found with two of these cluster Sp1 sites, with or without U being obliterated. These results indicate a negative interaction between the factors binding to the Sp1B or -C sites and the U site in the cluster. The increase in absolute activity between m234 and m310 shows a positive overall effect of the presence of this 5′ cluster. The RORE has additive effects (~23%) on promoter activity in the context of the Sp1D site. In constructs containing the 5′ Sp1/U cluster, the effects are less than expected. For example, m310mK increased promoter activity relative to wild type when RORE was mutated; i.e. this indicates a negative interaction between factors binding at RORE and the 5′ Sp1/U cluster. The greater activity with m310mQ than m310mG suggests that negative interaction is primarily via the Sp1A and -B sites in the cluster, but U is not involved. Thus, it is likely that the tissue milieu of transcription factors that compete for these upstream sites could provide a variety of suppressive interactions for the Sp1D site and modulate the background activity provided by an unmodulated Sp1D site.The RORα nuclear receptor is expressed primarily in neurons of the brain and provides a tempting target for the neuronal specific expression modulation of prosaposin. In particular, the recent identification of the RORα gene deletion in the staggerermouse indicates the profound effects of the absence of this receptor (31Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L Berkel V.V. Birren B. Kruglyak L. Lander E. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the staggerer mouse, Purkinje cell development and migration as well as olivo-pontine neurons degenerate progressively through adulthood (32Hadj-Sahraoui N. Frederic F. Zanjani H. Herrup K. Delhaye-Bouchaud N. Mariani J. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 98: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, some target sequences for RORα have a maintenance and, potentially, trophic effect upon these specific types of neurons during brain development. The massive destruction of neurons in the brains of the prosaposin knockout make it difficult to assess trophic effects of prosaposin deficiency in that animal model, but thestaggerer mouse may provide an interesting model system for the evaluation of prosaposin trophic effects on cerebellar development and maintenance.The mutagenesis and expression studies support a complex model of prosaposin promoter function within the first 310 bp 5′ to the transcription start site. A model is proposed in Fig.8 that indicates a basal functional activity of the 3′ Sp1 site and a combination of transcription factor interactions at the more upstream sites that are primarily negative in their modulatory functions. The negative effects are principally mediated by a negative (competitive) interaction of factors binding to the Sp1/U cluster, since enhanced promoter activity is observed when any of the sites in this cluster are obliterated. RORE factors also negatively interact with this cluster, since enhanced activity of m310 is apparent when RORE is destroyed. For the Sp1/U cluster, we showed competition of Sp1 and Sp3. We would propose that such competition could be extended to Sp4 at the Sp1D site and that the occupancy of various transcription sites, depending upon the chromatin and DNA structure in the region, could interfere or interact with each other to down- or up-regulate the basal Sp1D site function. These studies have not defined factors that are clearly tissue-specific for the modulation of prosaposin function in neurons, the reproductive tract, or specific epithelial cells throughout the body. Our previous in vitrostudies indicate negative regulatory elements within the first 741 bp 5′ to the transcription start site and the large first intron (~15 kb) provide additional targets for tissue specificity and/or facilitator functions of prosaposin expression in more physiologic systems. However, our preliminary transgenic data (30Sun Y. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59 (abstr.): 160Google Scholar) show that the first 310 bp 5′ to the start site contains elements that promote prosaposin expression in neurons of the central nervous system and that the interaction of the factors described here must have a significant effect on the modulation of regional prosaposin expression in that organ system. The multifunctional properties of prosaposin, its intracellular and extracellular functions, and the temporal and spatial regulation of its locus provided the rationale for the current studies to define the elements that facilitate expression of the prosaposin gene. Of lysosomal loci, prosaposin (14Sun Y. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1390-1398PubMed Google Scholar), lysosomal acid lipase (26Du H. Witte D.P. Grabowski G.A. J.
