https://openalex.org/W2112918293,"Abstract Injection of guinea pig anti-insulin serum into rats decreased the concentration of glycogen in the liver and increased the level of nonesterified fatty acid and glucose in the blood and the concentration of citrate in the heart. The uptake of glucose was reduced in hearts removed from antiserum-treated rats and perfused in vitro. Glucose production by perfused livers from rats treated with antiserum in vivo was increased as a result of accelerated glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Urea production and K+ efflux were also increased. The rates of these processes could be reduced to or below control values by addition of insulin to the perfusion medium. Insulin added in vitro also decreased these processes and the loss of inorganic phosphate in livers from normal rats. Antiserum added to the medium perfusing normal hearts or livers was without effect except that it abolished the action of insulin. Administration of anti-insulin serum in vivo caused a progressive rise in the liver cyclic AMP concentration. Diabetes induced by alloxan also resulted in an increase in liver cyclic AMP, which was rapidly abolished by insulin treatment. Insulin added to the medium perfusing livers from normal or antiserum-treated rats caused a small decrease in liver cyclic AMP. Insulin antagonized the effects of epinephrine and glucagon on glucose output by the perfused liver and reduced the level of cyclic AMP in the presence of glucagon. The hypothesis is advanced that changes in cyclic AMP levels may be partly responsible for the alterations in liver metabolism caused by insulin and diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1854604370,"The structure of an abnormal human hemoglobin with a low affinity for oxygen and little heme-heme interaction has been determined. Threonine replaces asparagine in position 102 of the β chain, which is the fourth residue of the G helix. Although this is a neutral substitution, the hemoglobin is nevertheless chromatographically and electrophoretically distinguishable from normal human hemoglobin. No other abnormality has been found. The tetrameric hemoglobin dissociates at least to a dimer upon oxygenation at neutral pH and at protein concentrations at which normal hemoglobin does not dissociate significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1496682912,"Aqueous solutions of polyhydric alcohols protect the native conformation of ribonuclease against denaturation by heat, acid, and urea. The protective effect increases with the length of the molecule of the polyhydric alcohol and with its concentration. This stabilizing effect is explained in terms of a lessened hydrogen bond-rupturing capacity of the medium. Aqueous solutions of monovalent alcohols destabilize ribonuclease at high pH (high Tm) more than at low pH (low Tm). At elevated temperatures, at which it is principally hydrophobic bonds that determine the stability of the protein molecule, the interaction between hydrophobic molecules of the medium and the hydrophobic parts of the protein molecule is increased, resulting in a lessened stability of the protein molecule. Divalent alcohols destabilize ribonuclease to a much smaller degree than monovalent alcohols, when equimolar quantities of —CH2— and CH3— groups are present. This might be due to the fact that the interaction with water is increased by the second —OH group and hence the potency of the alcohol for weakening the hydrophobic bonds is decreased. The lowering in Tm of ribonuclease caused by urea is, in contrast to that caused by 1-propanol, counteracted by glycerol and sorbitol."
https://openalex.org/W1495014693,"Abstract In rat thymus cells exposed under aerobic conditions to a glucose pulse, cortisol at 10-6 m reduces the rates of glucose uptake and lactic acid output, and reduces the magnitude of the glucose-induced increase in glucose 6-phosphate. Effects are discernible by 15 to 20 min of exposure to cortisol. These results are interpreted as showing that cortisol produces a block at the level of glucose transport or phosphorylation, or both. Under anaerobic conditions a marked Pasteur effect is observed, and all the above effects of cortisol are abolished."
https://openalex.org/W1575595973,"Abstract The enzymes, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, α-mannosidase, β-glucosidase, and β-acetylglucosaminidase, have been purified from the germinating seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris. All five enzymes have been simultaneously isolated in a highly active form. The pH optimum, Km, and energy of activation of each glycosidase for the reaction of hydrolysis of the appropriate p-nitrophenyl glycoside have been determined. The specificity of the enzymes has been studied by using synthetic and natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, lactose, mannobiose, methyl α-d-mannopyranoside, cellobiose, gentiobiose, sophorose, and methyl β-d-glucopyranoside. All these enzymes appear to be highly specific for the glycopyranosyl group and the anomeric configuration of the glycosidic linkage. Their action on macromolecules, such as galactomannans from guar and locust bean gums, desialyzed fetuin and its tryptic glycopeptides, a glycopeptide from orosomucoid, and ribonuclease B, has been studied."

https://openalex.org/W1571266414,"Abstract Decapitation of fetuses in utero rendered rat liver tyrosine transaminase (l-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.5) occasionally inducible by hydrocortisone. By placing fetal rat liver in organ culture, reproducible induction by the steroid could be obtained. Histological and biochemical studies supported the conclusion that the hepatocytes remained healthy over a 3-day period in culture. The response to hormone was very low in fresh explants for the first 12 hours, but thereafter a 4- to 8-fold elevation in enzyme activity was obtained within 4 to 6 hours. The induced level of the transaminase was maintained unless steroid was removed, and then the activity fell rapidly back toward the control level. The optimal effective concentration of hydrocortisone was 10-6 m, but levels as low as 10-8 m produced a limited response. Only the glucocorticoids and the protein hormones insulin and glucagon were active inducers among a number of hormones tested. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D prevented enzyme induction, but hydrocortisone did not affect either general RNA or protein synthesis. Lactic dehydrogenase activity in explants of fetal liver was unaffected by hydrocortisone. Titrations against antibody showed that the tyrosine transaminases in fetal and adult liver are immunologically identical and proved that the increase in enzyme activity in explants exposed to hydrocortisone was due to an increase in enzyme protein. Immunochemical labeling experiments confirmed that synthesis de novo of enzyme protein is stimulated by hydrocortisone. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the synthesis of this enzyme is repressed during gestation."
https://openalex.org/W1594848999,"Abstract An exo-β-d-(1 → 3)-glucanase has been purified from the culture medium of Basidiomycete species QM 806. The purification involves evaporation of the culture filtrate, ammonium sulfate fractionation, column chromatography, and preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final preparation is homogeneous on the basis of disc electrophoresis on acrylamide gel, sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge, and the absence of contaminating enzymatic activities. Various physical and chemical characteristics of the purified protein have been determined; a complete amino acid analysis is presented. The kinetic parameters, Km and V, of the action of the enzyme on a homologous series of β-d-(1 → 3)-linked glucose oligosaccharides have been determined. These indicate that the extent of binding and rate of attack increase rapidly with chain length but do not appear to reach maximal values even at a chain length of 15 to 20 glucose units."

https://openalex.org/W1569670216,"Abstract The experiments reported here indicate that polynucleotide phosphorylase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus degrades a given polyribonucleotide chain to completion before releasing a small, resistant oligonucleotide and initiating hydrolysis of another chain. This mode of attack has been termed processive degradation. Two types of experiments support this hypothesis. First, during the phosphorolysis of polynucleotides, the only materials present at all stages of degradation are intact polynucleotide, nucleoside diphosphate, and very short oligonucleotides. Second, in the course of the phosphorolysis of polynucleotides that are radioactively labeled at one or the other end of the chain, the percentage of radioactive product released is equivalent to the over-all percentage of hydrolysis at all stages of the reaction. A procedure which leads to the preparation of polynucleotide phosphorylase (M. lysodeikticus) of a high degree of purity is also described."
https://openalex.org/W1677490328,"Abstract With dilute suspensions of rat epididymal adipose tissue cells, glucose utilization was estimated by the conversion of glucose-14C to 14CO2 and 14C-labeled lipids. The maximal effect of insulin was observed with a glucose concentration of 1.25 mm or less. The same rate of glucose utilization was observed with and without insulin when the glucose concentration was 80 mm. Glucose utilization was stimulated with 1 microunit of insulin per ml, and insulin concentrations above 25 microunits per ml produced no further stimulation. The rate of glucose utilization was linear for 2 hours when the insulin concentration was 3 microunits per ml. With 5 microunits of insulin per ml, the glucose utilized in 2 hours did not increase when the volume of the incubation medium was doubled. The stimulatory effect of insulin was reversed by washing the cell suspension or by the addition of anti-insulin serum. These findings indicated that (a) a dilute suspension of fat cells did not inactivate insulin rapidly enough to lower the insulin concentration of the incubation medium significantly, and (b) the continued presence of insulin was required for a continuation of its biological effect. With a 30 times more concentrated suspension of fat cells, the change in immunoreactive insulin concentration of the incubation medium was measured. A rapid phase of insulin uptake occurred within the first minute, was linearly related to insulin concentration up to 10,000 microunits per ml, was not temperature-sensitive, and was abolished by a 30-sec exposure to 10-3 m maleimide. A subsequent phase of insulin uptake was slower, temperature-sensitive, and not abolished by maleimide. Cells previously incubated with insulin showed undiminished insulin uptake when reincubated in fresh medium. When insulin-treated cells were washed, no immunologically or biologically active insulin was released. It was concluded that (a) the rapid phase of insulin uptake may be the hormone-cell interaction which is necessary for the action of insulin to be manifest, and (b) a study of the factors which influence this process may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of hormone action."

https://openalex.org/W1569757465,"Abstract The determination of the complete amino acid sequence of Peptostreptococcus elsdenii rubredoxin has shown that the molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain of 52 residues. When it is compared with the sequence of rubredoxin from Micrococcus aerogenes which contains 53 residues, matching amino acid residues are found in 24 positions. The 4 cysteines which are bound to the iron, 2 lysines, 2 tyrosines, and the sole tryptophan occur in identical positions in the two proteins. The possible importance of these findings for the active site of this non-heme iron protein is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1483040246,"Abstract Cold ethanol or acetone precipitated about 75% of the N2-fixing enzyme complex from extracts of Clostridium pasteurianum freed of nucleic acids. This simple preparation fixes about 45 nmoles of N2 per mg of protein per min and is adequate for many studies of N2 fixation. The preparation exhibited a dilution effect in N2 fixation supported by Na2S2O4 and an ATP-generating system. H2 was evolved vigorously through an ATP-requiring, CO-insensitive reaction; the preparation evolved H2 less vigorously in the absence of ATP through the CO-sensitive pathway unless ferredoxin was added. The N2-fixing complex required 4.0 to 4.6 molecules of ATP per H2 evolved or per third of a molecule of N2 fixed throughout the time course of the reactions. At pH 6.0 the ATP/2e- ratio approached 4.0, and it was near 4.6 at pH 8.0. Both N2 fixation and ATP-dependent H2 evolution had pH optima between pH 6.5 and 6.6."

https://openalex.org/W1516144445,"Abstract Sodium-2-oxo-propanesulfonate (acetone sulfonate) was found to be a competitive inhibitor of acetoacetate carboxy lyase (acetoacetic decarboxylase, EC 4.1.1.4) the Ki of which was numerically equal to the Km for acetoacetate at all temperatures investigated. Km like Ki in this case is therefore concluded to represent a dissociation constant. ΔH for the dissociation of either acetoacetate or acetone sulfonate from the enzyme was 7.3 kcal per mole. From the variation of Vm with temperature, the apparent enthalpy of activation of the enzymic decarboxylation reaction was found to be 11.4 kcal per mole. Acetylacetone was a potent reversible inhibitor of the enzyme whose association with and dissociation from the sensitive sites were perceptibly slow at room temperature. It exhibited both slope and intercept effects in Lineweaver-Burk (12) analyses, the former effects being greater than the latter. Ki was calculated from the slope effects and K'i from the intercept effects. Investigation of the effects of temperature on Ki and on K'i for acetylacetone revealed that Ki increased uniformly and moderately with temperatures in the range 14.8–64°, whereas K'i showed an abrupt increase with temperature above 45°. At all temperatures above 45°, K'i was effectively infinite, and acetylacetone was therefore competitive. In the case of nitrate inhibition K'i was greater than Ki and, from the effects of temperature on K'i, ΔH was found to be 14.3 kcal per mole, while the corresponding value derived from the variation of Ki with temperature was 18.3 kcal per mole. Mixed inhibition studies with acetylacetone, nitrate, and acetone sulfonate indicated identical sites of action for all three. Borohydride reduction of the enzyme in the presence of acetone sulfonate was performed in a manner which allowed quantitative comparisons to be made. On the basis of its facilitation of borohydride inhibition, a Ki for acetone sulfonate was obtained which was in agreement with that derived from the classical kinetic analysis. Acetylacetone did not support borohydride inhibition of the enzyme; indeed, it strongly protected the enzyme against inhibition by BH4- in the presence of acetone sulfonate. Nitrate exhibited a similar protective effect. From the effects of temperature on the rate of borohydride inhibition of the enzyme, it was inferred that ΔH for the association of BH4- with the sensitive site on the enzyme was -11.5 kcal per mole. Hypotheses are advanced to explain and correlate these observations."
https://openalex.org/W1547172913,"Abstract The latent form of tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.13.1.12), which can be demonstrated in the soluble supernatant of liver through the addition of adenosine 3',5'-phosphate or other purine derivatives, differs from the form which is activated by the addition of hematin, the prosthetic group of this enzyme. Adenosine 3',5'-phosphate has to be converted to hypoxanthine in order to act as an activator. Theophylline, which blocks the cleavage of this nucleotide, prevents the activation, as does adenosine triphosphate. Xanthine oxidase, also present in the soluble rat liver preparations, serves to activate tryptophan oxygenase in the presence of its substrate hypoxanthine, which is formed from adenosine 3',5'-phosphate or from other purine derivatives. 4-Hydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (allopurinol), an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, blocks the activation of tryptophan oxygenase by adenosine 3',5'-phosphate or by other purine derivatives, including hypoxanthine. This inhibitor inhibits the tryptophan oxygenase activity in the whole liver homogenates and prevents the activating effect of liver cytoplasmic particles in the soluble liver preparations. Catalase reduces the activation of tryptophan oxygenase by hypoxanthine, indicating probable participation of hydrogen peroxide in the activation effect of the purines via xanthine oxidase. Uric acid, the other product of the xanthine oxidase reaction, does not exhibit any activating effect."
https://openalex.org/W1584399837,"Abstract The presence in rat liver microsomes of a unique, low molecular weight RNA is described. This RNA, which for convenience is referred to as membrane RNA, is not present in ribosomes prepared from microsomes by deoxycholate treatment. It comprises 15 to 20% of the total microsomal RNA and has the following chemical and biological properties: (a) high content of guanosine + cytidine similar to transfer RNA; (b) low content of 3'-terminal adenosine groups, methylated bases, and pseudouridylic acid; (c) heterogeneous behavior on hydroxylapatite columns; and (d) little or no amino acid acceptor activity. These properties distinguish membrane RNA from both 5 S RNA and biologically active transfer RNA. Evidence is presented which suggests that this new RNA is not the result of degradation of high molecular weight RNA during the preparative procedures used."

https://openalex.org/W1480629405,"Abstract By using different pH indicators it is possible to demonstrate, in the presence or absence of phosphorylation, the existence of two compartments in chloroplasts, one of which becomes more acidic and the other more basic during electron flow. The observed magnitude of the pH differential between these two compartments is over 1.5 pH units. Cations, such as NH4+, N-methylphenazonium methosulfate, and protonated neutral red, which compete with H+ ions for entry into chloroplasts, inhibit the development of pH gradients within chloroplasts. Diffusible anions, such as acetate and orthophosphate, also block formation of these internal pH gradients. All of the above inhibitors of formation of internal pH gradients also inhibit phosphorylation, in a parallel manner. Sonic treatment of chloroplasts causes progressive and parallel inhibition of phosphorylation and formation of internal pH gradients. These data support the concept that chloroplasts contain a proton-translocating oxidation-reduction chain and that the resultant efflux of H+ ions through chloroplast membranes supplies the energy for phosphorylation."

These values correspond with calculations from earlier data from another laboratory, and seem reasonable for a peptide-protein interaction involving noncovalent bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1481114503,"Abstract A simplified method for the preparation of a large amount of crystalline lactate oxygenase from Mycobacterium phlei has been introduced. The crystalline enzyme exhibited one component on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and revealed a single homogeneous peak (s20,w = 12.5 S) in an ultracentrifuge. The enzyme has a typical flavoprotein spectrum, and the prosthetic group was shown to be flavin mononucleotide as judged by enzymatic, paper chromatographic, and fluorometric methods. The apparent molecular weights derived from diffusion and sedimentation constants, the method of Archibald, and gel filtration were 399,000, 383,000 and 340,000, respectively. The minimum molecular weight from the analysis of flavin was 55,300 to 56,200. On the basis of these results, the conclusion is that the enzyme contains 6 to 7 moles of FMN per mole of protein. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of only l-lactate and α-hydroxy-n-butyrate, and is inhibited competitively by d-lactate."
https://openalex.org/W1557778156,"Abstract Experiments are reported on the steady state kinetic behavior of Escherichia coli glutaminase. The ratios of rates of hydrolysis and hydroxylaminolysis are the same for acid, amide, ester, and thioester substrates of the enzyme, whereas the corresponding ratios for similar derivatives of acetic acid in nonenzymatic reactions vary over several orders of magnitude. The kcat for all substrates is constant between pH 3.5 and pH 5.6, but above pH 5.3 the Km values increase very rapidly with pH so that, in effect, the enzyme becomes inactive at about pH 5.8. Velocities of hydrolysis of several substrates are 1.1- to 1.5-fold faster in H2O than in D2O. The thermodynamic activation parameters have been determined for the hydrolysis of certain substrates. These results and those reported in the accompanying papers lead to the following conclusions. The Km values are dissociation constants for the ES complex. All substrates bind to the same ionic form of the enzyme, which is stabilized by the cooperative action of 4 or 5 acidic groups per active site. The hydrolysis of all substrates proceeds through a common intermediate, the formation of which is the slowest step in the catalytic cycle. The characteristics of the rate-determining step do not clearly indicate whether covalent reactions or noncovalent (conformational) processes are involved. If the latter is the case, then it is not possible with the steady state methods used to decide between an acylation-deacylation pathway and a single displacement mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1524727554,"Mannose inhibited the growth rate of Euglena when glucose, fructose, pyruvate, acetate, ethanol, succinate, oxalacetate, or glutamine was the sole source of carbon. The degree of inhibition was a function of the particular substrate and, in the case of glucose, of the glucose to mannose concentration ratio. The metabolic basis of growth inhibition was investigated. Mannose does not critically inhibit glucose entry or phosphorylation and does not interfere with the Krebs cycle. Mannose 6-phosphate, however, is an inhibitor of phosphoglucose isomerase, and this may account for much of the growth inhibition when fructose or glucose is the carbon source. That inhibition at this site alone cannot account entirely for growth inhibition is indicated by the sensitivity to mannose of growth on substrates which enter metabolism at the level of the Krebs cycle, and by the results of experiments in which pairs of substrates were used as carbon sources. Mannose by itself does not support growth. 14C from mannose-1-14C, however, was incorporated into protein, phospholipids, and wax, but not into CO2. Trapping of 14C-acetyl groups generated from glucose-1-14C with sulfanilamide was associated with a decrease in 14CO2 and 14C-phospholipid, but not of 14C-wax formation, whereas sulfanilamide inhibited neither 14C-phospholipid nor 14C-wax formation from mannose-1-14C. Mannose increased 14CO2 production and 14C incorporation from pyruvate-2-14C into phospholipids, but decreased 14C incorporation into wax. Based on these observations, the existence of two metabolic compartments for lipid synthesis in Euglena is postulated."

https://openalex.org/W1491283823,"Abstract Studies on the exchange of oxygen catalyzed by Escherichia coli glutaminase between water and substrates are reported. The rates of the virtual hydrolysis of glutamic acid, i.e. the exchange of 18O between water and the γ-carboxyl oxygen atoms, allow determination of the Km and kcat values for this substrate. These values are 2.9 mm and 5080 sec-1, respectively, at 25° and pH 5.0. The kcat, which is shown to be the number of complete catalytic cycles of the enzyme per sec, is the highest of any known substrate of this enzyme, and among the highest for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction of a carboxylic derivative. Glutaminase does not catalyze exchange between the γ-carbonyl oxygen atoms of glutamine and water."
