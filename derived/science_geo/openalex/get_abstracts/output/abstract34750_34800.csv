https://openalex.org/W2036830225,"When grown in vitro, cells from Kaposi's sarcoma lesions of AIDS patients (AIDS-KS cells) constitutively release several growth promoting activities. When inoculated into nude mice, the AIDS-KS cells induce a KS-like lesion of mouse origin. Here it is shown that the AIDS-KS cells express messenger RNA for a complex mixture of cytokines that correlate with several of the biological activities of these cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor, which is a potent angiogenic factor, and interleukin-1 messenger RNAs are expressed at very high levels and seem to account for a large proportion of the activities, since their corresponding proteins are released in biologically active form into the culture media where they induce autocrine and paracrine growth effects."
https://openalex.org/W1483721839,"A peroxide reductase (peroxidase) which converts lipid hydroperoxides and other alkyl hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols, using either NADH or NADPH as the reducing agent, has been identified in both Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. This enzyme is shown to play a role in protecting against alkyl hydroperoxide mutagenesis. To our knowledge this work represents the first description of an NAD(P)H peroxidase in enteric bacteria and the first reported bacterial peroxidase to exhibit high activity toward alkyl hydroperoxides. A high performance liquid chromatography-based assay for the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase has been developed by monitoring the reduction of cumene hydroperoxide, a model alkyl hydroperoxide. By using this assay, the enzyme has been purified from a S. typhimurium regulatory mutant, oxyR1, which overexpresses a number of proteins involved in defenses against oxidative damage, and which contains 20-fold more of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase than the wild-type strain. The purified activity requires the presence of two separable components having subunit molecular weights of 22,000 and 57,000. The 57-kDa protein contains a bound FAD cofactor and can use either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor for the direct reduction of redox dyes, or of alkyl hydroperoxides when combined with the 22-kDa protein. This enzyme may thus serve as a prokaryotic equivalent to the glutathione reductase/glutathione peroxidase system in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2037402061,"We present the DNA sequence and a functional dissection of the 1483 residue yeast activator HAP1. Salient results are, first, a single DNA binding domain (1-148) specifies binding to the two target sites of different sequence, UAS1 and CYC7. This domain contains a cysteine-rich zinc finger, and mutation of either of two cysteines abolishes binding to both sites. Second, mutations that specifically abolish binding to UAS1 or to CYC7 exist. These changes lie either in the residue immediately amino-terminal to the finger or in sequences carboxyl to the finger. Thus, both the base of the finger and carboxyl flanking residues are involved in specific DNA binding. Third, a distinct region (residues 245-445) mediates heme induction by masking the DNA binding domain in the absence of inducer; heme counteracts this masking, perhaps by interacting with a repeat sequence of metal binding character in this region. While sequences between 445 and 1308 have no obvious function, a highly acidic carboxyl terminus mediates transcriptional activation by HAP1."
https://openalex.org/W2099600512,It has been proposed in several eukaryotic systems that the regulation of gene transcription involves phosphorylation of specific transcription factors. We report here that the yeast transcriptional activator ADR1 is phosphorylated in vitro by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and that mutations which enhance the ability of ADR1 to activate ADH2 expression decrease ADR1 phosphorylation. We also show that increased kinase activity in vivo inhibits ADH2 expression in an ADR1 allele-specific manner. Our data suggest that glucose repression of ADH2 is in part mediated through a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation-inactivation of the ADR1 regulatory protein.

https://openalex.org/W2077757626,"An important question in protein folding is whether the natural amino and carboxyl termini and the given order of secondary structure segments are critical to the stability and to the folding pathway of proteins. Here it is shown that two circularly permuted versions of the gene of a single-domain beta alpha barrel enzyme can be expressed in Escherichia coli. The variants are enzymically active and are practically indistinguishable from the original enzyme by several structural and spectroscopic criteria, despite the creation of new termini and the cleavage of a surface loop. This novel genetic approach should be useful for protein folding studies both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1593098626,"Abstract The protease of human immunodeficiency virus has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. Immunoreactivity toward anti-protease peptide sera copurified with an activity that cleaved the structural polyprotein gag p55 and the peptide corresponding to the sequence gag 128-135. The enzyme expressed as a nonfusion protein exhibits proteolytic activity with a pH optimum of 5.5 and is inhibited by the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin with a Ki of 1.1 microM. Replacement of the conserved residue Asp-25 with an Asn residue eliminates proteolytic activity. Analysis of the minimal peptide substrate size indicates that 7 amino acids are required for efficient peptide cleavage. Size exclusion chromatography is consistent with a dimeric enzyme and circular dichroism spectra of the purified enzyme are consistent with a proposed structure of the protease (Pearl, L.H., and Taylor, W.R. (1987) Nature 329, 351-354). These data support the classification of the human immunodeficiency virus protease as an aspartic protease, likely to be structurally homologous with the well characterized family that includes pepsin and renin."
https://openalex.org/W1999385494,"Growth of neurite processes is a critical step in neuronal development, regeneration, differentiation, and response to injury. The discovery of compounds that can stimulate neurite formation would be important for developing new therapeutics against both neurodegenerative disorders and trauma-induced neuronal injuries. Semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin, an active compound in Artemisia annua, have been effectively used in malaria treatment, but they have been shown to possess neurotoxic potential. In this study, we found unexpectedly that artemisinin and its derivatives induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Artemisinins containing an endoperoxide bridge such as artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin induced growth of neurite processes at concentrations that were slightly cytotoxic, artemisinin having the most potent maximal effect among them. Deoxyartemisinin, which lacks the endoperoxide bridge, was ineffective. Artemisinin-treated cells expressed increased levels of the neuronal marker βIII-tubulin. Artemisinin upregulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), critical signaling molecules in neuronal differentiation. Consistent with activation of the two MAPKs, neurite outgrowth induced by artemisinin was inhibited by the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Artemisinin also induced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) that was almost completely attenuated by PD98059 but not by SB203580. Taken together, our results indicate that artemisinin and its derivatives containing the endoperoxide bridge induced differentiation of PC12 cells toward a neuronal phenotype and suggest that both activation of ERK signaling pathway, which leads to CREB phosphorylation, and activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway are involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2093545596,"The protein encoded by SAC6, a gene that can mutate to suppress a temperature-sensitive defect in the yeast actin gene, has been identified as a 67-kilodalton actin-binding protein (ABP 67) that associates with all identifiable actin structures. This finding demonstrates the in vivo functional importance of the actin-ABP 67 interaction previously established in vitro and illustrates the use of suppressor analysis to identify physically interacting proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1977782469,"The α factor pheromone inhibits the division of yeast a cells. A general method was developed for isolating mutants that exhibit constitutive activation of the pheromone response pathway. A dominant allele of the STE4 locus was recovered in addition to recessive mutations in the SCG1 gene. SCG1 and STE4 are known to encode Gα and Gβ homologs, respectively. Analysis of double mutants suggests that the STE4 gene product functions after the SCG1 product but before the STE5 product."
https://openalex.org/W2070596390,"Intron mobility in the T-even phages has been demonstrated. Efficient nonreciprocal conversion of intron minus (In-) alleles to intron plus (In+) occurred for the td and sunY genes, but not for nrdB. Conversion to In+ was absolutely dependent on expression of the respective intron open reading frame (ORF). Introns were inserted at their cognate sites in an intronless phage genome via an RNA-independent, DNA-based, duplicative recombination event that was stimulated by exon homology. The td intron ORF product directs the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA, targeting the site of intron integration. A 21 nucleotide deletion of the integration site abolished high frequency intron inheritance. These experiments provide a novel example of gene conversion in prokaryotes, while suggesting a molecular rationale for the inconsistent distribution of introns within highly conserved exon contexts of the T-even phage genomes."

https://openalex.org/W1602037468,"Protease Ti, a new ATP-dependent protease in Escherichia coli, degrades proteins and ATP in a linked process, but these two hydrolytic functions are catalyzed by distinct components of the enzyme. To clarify the enzyme's specificity and the role of ATP, a variety of fluorogenic peptides were tested as possible substrates for protease Ti or its two components. Protease Ti rapidly hydrolyzed N-succinyl(Suc)-Leu-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin (AMC) (Km = 1.3 mM) which is not degraded by protease La, the other ATP-dependent protease in E. coli. Protease Ti also hydrolyzed, but slowly, Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-AMC and Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC. However, it showed little or no activity against basic or other hydrophobic peptides, including ones degraded rapidly by protease La. Component P, which contains the serine-active site, by itself rapidly degrades the same peptides as the intact enzyme. Addition of component A, which contains the ATP-hydrolyzing site and is necessary for protein degradation, had little or no effect on peptide hydrolysis. N-Ethylmaleimide, which inactivates the ATPase, did not inhibit peptide hydrolysis. In addition, this peptide did not stimulate the ATPase activity of component A (unlike protein substrates). Thus, although the serine-active site on component P is unable to degrade proteins, it is fully functional against small peptides in the absence of ATP. At high concentrations, Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC caused a complete inhibition of casein breakdown, and diisopropylfluorophosphate blocked similarly the hydrolysis of both protein and peptide substrates. Thus, both substrates seem to be hydrolyzed at the same active site on component P, and ATP hydrolysis by component A either unmasks or enlarges this proteolytic site such that large proteins can gain access to it."
https://openalex.org/W1579942088,"Abstract Complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an important component of both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of the aerobic respiratory chains of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The enzyme has been purified from numerous sources and appears to be highly conserved from considerations of both the amino acid sequences of the catalytic subunits and from the prosthetic groups associated with the enzyme. The sdh operon has been cloned and sequenced from Escherichia coli, but the enzyme from this source has, so far, resisted attempts at biochemical purification. In this work, a one-step purification of the enzyme is described which yields a stable four-subunit enzyme which has a high specific activity. This purification takes advantage of a strain which overproduces the enzyme by 10-fold due to the presence of a multicopy plasmid containing the cloned sdh operon. The purified complex II has one FAD, eight non-heme irons, seven acid-labile sulfides, and one protoheme IX per molecule. The enzyme has been reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles and demonstrated to reduce ubiquinone-8, the natural electron acceptor, at a high rate."
https://openalex.org/W1503706399,"We have examined the supercoiling requirement for the in vitro Mu DNA strand transfer reaction and found that optimal efficiency requires a high level ( σ ¯ = −0.06) of donor plasmid superhelicity. At in vivo levels of supercoiling ( σ ¯ = −0.025) the reaction does not occur. Using an unreactive donor plasmid with a near physiological level of supercoiling, we identified an Escherichia coli protein factor which has the novel property of reducing the donor plasmid supercoiling requirement for the in vitro Mu DNA strand transfer reaction by 40%. This protein, which we named supercoiling relief factor was purified to near homogeneity and found to be identical to integration host factor (IHF), a protein known to induce site specific bends in DNA. The dramatic reduction in the supercoiling requirement was promoted by about 1.5 IHF dimers/donor substrate molecule. At these low levels of IHF, the HU requirement for the reaction was also reduced; a synergistic effect of the two proteins resulted in a greater than 10-fold stimulation of the reaction under appropriate conditions. Furthermore, at high concentrations of IHF, HU could be completely eliminated from the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1582299835,"Abstract Acidic phospholipids such as cardiolipin partially unfold an artificial precursor protein which consists of a mitochondrial presequence fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (Endo, T., and Schatz, G. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 1153-1158). We now show that import of this precursor protein into isolated yeast mitochondria is blocked by adriamycin, a drug binding to cardiolipin and other acidic phospholipids. This inhibition is lessened if the precursor's dihydrofolate reductase moiety is labilized by point mutations; inhibition is abolished altogether if the wild-type precursor is presented to mitochondria in a urea-denatured state. These and other observations suggest that adriamycin interferes with the generation of a translocation-competent, loose structure of the precursor protein. They imply that acidic phospholipids such as cardiolipin participate, directly or indirectly, in the translocation of this fusion protein into isolated mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1544985540,"Although increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity is often associated with enhanced resistance of cells and organisms to oxidant challenges, few direct tests of the antioxidant importance of this enzyme have been carried out. To assess the importance of SOD in defending against gamma-radiation, we employed Escherichia coli with deficient, normal, and super-normal enzyme activities. Surprisingly, the radiation sensitivity of E. coli actually increases as bacterial SOD activity increases. Elevated intracellular SOD activity sensitizes E. coli to radiation-induced mortality, whereas SOD-deficient bacteria show normal or decreased radiosensitivity. Toxic effects of activated oxygen species are involved in this phenomenon; bacterial SOD activity has no effect on radiation sensitivity under anaerobic conditions or on the lethality of other, non-oxygen-dependent, toxins such as ultraviolet radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1549887344,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of glycolate oxidase from spinach has been fitted to an electron density map at 2.2 A resolution. From a refined model we give a detailed description of the flavin mononucleotide-binding site and the residues which might be involved in the catalytic action of the enzyme. The cofactor is bound to the enzyme at the carboxy end of the beta strands in the alpha/beta barrel domain and forms a number of hydrogen bonds both to residues at the end of the beta strands and in the loop regions after the strands. In particular Lys-230 interacts with atoms N1 and O2 of the isoalloxazine ring, which produces an inductive effect that could enhance the nucleophilicity of the electron acceptor N5 of the flavin ring. Almost the entire coenzyme is buried in the interior of the enzyme. The exceptions are one phosphate oxygen atom and a region around the N5 position on the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring, which are accessible to solution. Based on a model of bound glycolate to our structure we propose that the following residues are important in the catalytic reaction: Arg-257, Tyr-24, and Tyr-129 for binding the substrate, and His-254 for abstracting a proton from the C2 atom of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1534279694,"Transcription of bacteriophage Mu is modulated by its repressor, by negative supercoiling, and by the Escherichia coli protein integration host factor (IHF). Two converging Mu promoters regulate lytic and lysogenic development. The influence of IHF on these convergent promoters depended on the DNA conformation. When Mu operator DNA changed from the relaxed to the negative supercoiled form, IHF changed from a stimulatory factor to an inhibitor of the repressor promoter, and the ratio of the lytic transcript relative to the repressor transcript increased by 40-fold. Flexibility in Mu operator DNA was demonstrated by an unusual supercoil-induced DNA conformation, which was detectable by chemical modification with bromoacetaldehyde or digestion with P1 nuclease. IHF binding adjacent to this site induced dramatic bending of Mu DNA. A topological model we call a superloop is proposed to explain the effect of IHF on Mu transcription in vitro and on the lytic-lysogeny decision of the virus grown in IHF and gyrase mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1531180750,"Mutations in the Escherichia coli secB gene lead to protein export defects in vivo (Kumamoto, C.A., and Beckwith, J. (1985) J. Bacteriol. 163, 267-274). To demonstrate directly the participation of the secB gene product (SecB) in protein export, SecB was purified, and its effects on in vitro protein translocation were analyzed. SecB was purified from soluble extracts of a strain that overproduced it, by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and differential precipitation at acid pH. The chromatographic behavior on gel filtration columns indicated apparent molecular masses of approximately 90 kDa for both purified SecB and SecB in cytosolic extracts of wild type cells. When added to a translocation mixture, purified SecB stimulated pro-OmpA translocation into membrane vesicles. SecB also suppressed the thermoinduced defect in translocating activity of membranes derived from a secY24 mutant. The results of these in vitro studies and of previous in vivo studies demonstrate that SecB plays a direct role in normal protein export in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1525497997,"Several studies have suggested that insulin and glucose increase adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL). To study the mechanism of the glucose-induced stimulation of LPL, the effects of glucose and glycosylation were examined in primary rat adipocyte cultures. In cells cultured in the presence of 1 mg/ml glucose, a 55-kDa LPL protein was synthesized and secreted into the medium, whereas cells cultured in glucose-free medium synthesized a 49-kDa form of LPL which was not secreted. The treatment of the mature 55-kDa form of LPL with peptide:N-glycosidase-F resulted in the formation of a 49-kDa form of LPL. When cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin, a 49-kDa form of LPL was synthesized by the cells but was not secreted. In addition, LPL activity was reduced by 90% when glycosylation was blocked by either tunicamycin or glucose deprivation. LPL synthetic rate was examined in cells cultured in a spectrum of glucose concentrations. LPL synthetic rate increased directly with medium glucose concentration and was decreased 80% in the absence of glucose compared to the synthetic rate in the presence of 1 mg/ml glucose. In addition, LPL synthetic rate in the presence of insulin was approximately 200% of the synthetic rate in untreated control cells at all glucose concentrations and even in the absence of glucose. In spite of the effect of glucose on LPL synthetic rate, glucose had no effect on the level of LPL mRNA. In contrast, the mRNA for the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) was increased in adipocytes cultured in glucose-free medium. In summary, glucose was essential for glycosylation of LPL, and glycosylation was essential for LPL catalytic activity and secretion. In addition, glucose stimulated LPL synthetic rate and potentiated the stimulatory effects of insulin, but had no specific effect on LPL mRNA. Whereas insulin stimulates LPL by increasing the level of LPL mRNA, glucose stimulates LPL translation and post-translational processing."
https://openalex.org/W1605560583,"Abstract Thioredoxin reductase (TRR), a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes, undergoes two sequential thiol-disulfide interchange reactions with thioredoxin during catalysis. In order to assess the catalytic role of each nascent thiol of the active site disulfide of thioredoxin reductase, the 2 cysteines (Cys-136 and Cys-139) forming this disulfide have been individually changed to serines by site-directed mutageneses of the cloned trxB gene of Escherichia coli. Spectral analyses of TRR(Ser-136,Cys-139) as a function of pH and ionic strength have revealed two pKa values associated with the epsilon 456, one of which increases from 7.0 to 8.3 as the ionic strength is increased, and a second at 4.4 which is seen only at high ionic strength. epsilon 458 of wild type TRR(Cys-136,Cys-139) and epsilon 453 of TRR(Cys-136,Ser-139) are pH-independent. A charge transfer complex (epsilon 530 = 1300 M-1 cm-1), unique to TRR(Ser-136,Cys-139), has been observed under conditions of high ammonium cation concentration (apparent Kd = 54 microM) at pH 7.6. These results suggest the assignment of Cys-139 as the FAD-interacting thiol in the reduction of thioredoxin by NADPH via thioredoxin reductase. If, as with other members of this enzyme family, the two distinct catalytic functions are each carried out by a different nascent thiol, then Cys-136 would perform the initial thiol-disulfide interchange with thioredoxin. Steady state kinetic analyses of the proteins have revealed turnover numbers of 10 and 50% of the value of the wild type enzyme for TRR(Ser-136,Cys-139) and TRR(Cys-136,Ser-139), respectively, and no changes in the apparent Km values of TR(S2) or NADPH. The finding of activity in the mutants indicates that the remaining thiol can carry out interchange with the disulfide of thioredoxin, and the resulting mixed disulfide can be reduced by NADPH via the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1665931340,"Periplasmic permeases are composed of four proteins, one of which has an ATP-binding site that has been postulated to be involved in energy coupling. Previous data suggested that these permeases derive energy from substrate level phosphorylation (Berger, E. A. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 70, 1514-1518); however, conflicting results later cast doubt upon this hypothesis. Here, we make use of two well characterized periplasmic permeases and of a well characterized unc mutant (ATPase-) to examine this energetics problem in depth. We have utilized the histidine and maltose periplasmic permeases in Escherichia coli as model systems. Isogenic unc strains were used in order to study separately the effect of the proton-motive force and of ATP on transport. These parameters were analyzed concomitantly with transport assays. Starvation experiments indicate that both histidine and maltose transport require ATP generation and that a normal level of delta psi is not sufficient. Uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone and 2,4-dinitrophenol dissipated the delta psi without decreasing the ATP level and without significant effect on these permeases, showing that delta psi is not needed. Inhibition of ATP synthesis by arsenate eliminates transport through both permeases, confirming the need for ATP. In agreement with previous results with the glutamine permease (Plate, C. A. (1979) J. Bacteriol. 137, 221-225), valinomycin plus K+ dissipates delta psi without affecting ATP levels and inhibits histidine transport; however, maltose transport is not inhibited under these conditions. This result is discussed in terms of the artefactual side effects caused by valinomycin/K+ treatment on some periplasmic permeases. Histidine transport is also shown to be sensitive to changes in the cytoplasmic pH. It is concluded that periplasmic permeases indeed have an obligatory requirement for ATP (or a closely related molecule), whereas the proton-motive force is neither sufficient nor essential."
https://openalex.org/W1545444940,"This paper presents the complete amino acid sequence of the low molecular weight acid phosphatase from bovine liver. This isoenzyme of the acid phosphatase family is located in the cytosol, is not inhibited by L-(+)-tartrate and fluoride ions, but is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. The enzyme consists of 157 amino acid residues, has an acetylated NH2 terminus, and has arginine as the COOH-terminal residue. All 8 half-cystine residues are in the free thiol form. The molecular weight calculated from the sequence is 17,953. The sequence was determined by characterizing the peptides purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography from tryptic, thermolytic, peptic, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and chymotryptic digests of the carboxymethylated protein. No sequence homologies were found with the two known acylphosphatase isoenzymes or the metalloproteins porcine uteroferrin and purple acid phosphatase from bovine spleen (both of which have acid phosphatase activity). Two half-cystines at or near the active site were identified through the reaction of the enzyme with [14C] iodoacetate in the presence or in the absence of a competitive inhibitor (i.e. inorganic phosphate).

https://openalex.org/W1604168298,"The amino-terminal arms of dimeric Escherichia coli trp repressor were removed by chymotryptic cleavage of the first 6 residues from each subunit. The role of the arms in structure and function of the repressor was probed by comparing the properties of intact and proteolyzed forms. The armless protein retains the ability to form stable dimers and to bind the corepressor L-tryptophan, but its affinity for both operator and nonoperator DNA is reduced by about 50-fold. Footprinting analysis shows that the intact repressor makes contacts with nucleotides on only one face of operator DNA. Thus, the arms do not wrap around the DNA as is the case for several other DNA binding proteins. All the contact sites identified by footprinting using the intact repressor are preserved in the complex formed with the armless repressor. This result indicates that the arms do not occupy a unique position on the DNA although they contribute substantially to the energy of DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1896429533,"Transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with the expression vector containing rabbit brain HepG2-type glucose transporter cDNA resulted in a dramatic over-expression (approximately 10-fold) of glucose transporter as assessed by either immunoblotting with antipeptide antibody against rabbit brain glucose transporter or photoaffinity labeling with [3H]cytochalasin B. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was also increased 4-fold in the transfected cells, while no increase in transport activity or transporter amount was observed in cells that were transfected with the expression vector alone without glucose transporter cDNA. Significantly, insulin (10(-7) M) increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in both control and transfected cells, but the increased amount of the transported 2-deoxyglucose by insulin in the transfected cells was 4.2-fold greater than that in control cells, indicating that the expressed rabbit brain HepG2-type glucose transporter responded to insulin. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that the HepG2-type glucose transporter exists in rat adipocytes and responds to insulin in a fashion similar to a majority of other types of glucose transporters (Oka, Y., Asano, T., Shibasaki, Y., Kasuga, M., Kanazawa, Y., and Takaku, F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13432-13439). In contrast, insulin did not stimulate glucose transport activity in HepG2 cells or IM-9 lymphocytes that have a significant amount of the HepG2-type glucose transporter. Thus, the results in this study further support the notion that insulin regulation of glucose transport activity depends on a tissue-specific signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1606217776,"Abstract Ribosomes from Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli exhibit non-specific translation of bacterial mRNAs. That is, they are able to translate mRNAs from a variety of sources in a manner independent of the strength of the Shine-Dalgarno region, in contrast to ribosomes from many Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, which show specific translation in only being able to translate other Gram-positive mRNA, or mRNAs that have strong Shine-Dalgarno regions. There is an evolutionary correlation between the translational specificity and the absence of a protein analogous to E. coli ribosomal protein S1. The specificity observed with B. subtilis ribosomes is a function of their 30 S subunit which lacks S1; translation of Gram-negative mRNA can occur with heterologous ribosomes containing the 30 S subunit of E. coli ribosomes and the 50 S subunit of B. subtilis ribosomes. However, the addition of E. coli S1 alone to B. subtilis ribosome does not overcome their characteristic inability to translate mRNA from Gram-negative organisms. By contrast, the removal of S1 from E. coli ribosomes results in translational behavior similar to that shown by B. subtilis ribosomes in that the S1-depleted E. coli ribosomes can translate mRNA from Gram-positive sources in the absence of added S1, although addition of S1 stimulates further translation of such mRNAs by the E. coli ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1512073660,"Abstract Distinct cell-surface glycoconjugates are expressed on specific subsets of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and DRG terminals projecting to the superficial dorsal horn of rat spinal cord (Dodd, J., and Jessell, T. M. (1985) J. Neurosci. 5, 3278-3294). Carbohydrate antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) TC6, KH10, and LD2 are restricted to about 20% of DRG neurons projecting to lamina IIB (dorsal), whereas antigens recognized by mAb LA4 are expressed by about 50% of DRG neurons projecting to lamina IIB (ventral). These mAbs were generated against rat pancreatic acinar cell line AR4-2J antigens. The glycolipid antigens in AR4-2J cells reacting with these mAbs have been structurally characterized by sequential hydrolysis with various exoglycosidases, immunochemical tests, linkage analysis of permethylated alditol acetates, capillary gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, mass spectrometry of permethylated compounds, and by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the native antigens. The structure of the major antigen (IA) in AR4-2J cells was determined to be: (formula; see text) The asialo derivative of IA and the novel disialo form of IA (Gal alpha 1----3(Fuc alpha 1----2)----GD1b) have been also identified. The DRG neurons contained only the neutral glycolipid, asialo form of IA. All these antigens reacted equivalently in the high performance thin layer chromatography-immuno overlay assay with the TC6, LD2, and LA4 mAbs. The molecular specificity of the three mAbs was determined by rection with a variety of possible antigens and appears to be the same. All three mAbs required terminal Gal alpha 1----3(Fuc alpha 1----2)Gal beta 1----3GalNAc (or 4GlcNAc) for full reactivity. Only partial reactivity was observed with compounds in which alpha-Fuc was removed. The observed restricted reactivity of mAbs TC6, LD2, and LA4 in subsets of DRG neurons and in ventral and dorsal areas of lamina IIB may be due to different topographical expression of the antigen in the neuronal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1520525371,"Growth activation of quiescent cells leads to enhanced low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression at the cell surface. To determine the basis for this stimulated receptor activity, we measured LDL receptor activity, changes in receptor protein mass, and mRNA abundance in quiescent and growth-activated cultured human skin fibroblasts. Growth activation, using insulin or platelet-derived growth factor, led to dose-dependent increases in cellular LDL receptor mRNA level (average 5.2-fold increase at 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, 4.1-fold increase at 58 ng/ml insulin) and cell surface expression (average 3.5-fold increase at 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, 2.5-fold increase at 58 ng/ml insulin). Increased LDL receptor mRNA levels could be detected as early as 2 h after addition of growth factor (3.2-fold), whereas increased levels of LDL receptor binding and mass were not detected until after 4-8 h. Growth activation led to induction of LDL receptor gene transcription, led to induction of LDL receptor gene transcription, and the increase of LDL receptor mRNA produced by addition of growth factor was completely prevented by actinomycin D. These observations indicate that growth-related activation of the LDL receptor pathway is accounted for, primarily, by growth-activated enhancement of LDL receptor gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1550592241,"Abstract We have purified the 31-kDa precursor of human interleukin 1 beta (proIL1 beta) from recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the protein. The recombinant precursor was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, spectroscopy, Western blot, and for biological and receptor binding activity. The protein migrates at the expected molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical gel filtration columns. The specific activity of the recombinant precursor is less than 10(2) units/mg in the EL4 thymoma assay compared with 5 x 10(8) units/mg for the recombinant 17-kDa mature protein. The inactivity of the precursor is attributable to the inability of the protein to bind the IL1 receptor on EL4 cells as shown by receptor competition studies using 125I-labeled 17-kDa IL1 beta. Inactivity of the IL1 beta precursor is not due to degradation of the protein in either the bioactivity or receptor binding assays. The inactive IL1 beta precursor is converted to an active form following proteolysis with chymotrypsin which generates a carboxyl-terminal fragment of 17 kDa that is 6 orders of magnitude more active than the starting IL1 beta precursor. Removal of the first 114 amino acids from proIL1 beta generates a fully active molecule. In contrast, removal of the first 77 amino acids by treatment with trypsin only partially restores activity. The resultant 22-kDa protein exhibits a 600-fold increase in both biological and receptor binding activity, demonstrating a direct correlation between the ability of sequences within the pro-region to inhibit biological activity and inhibit binding to the IL1 receptor. Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that proIL1 beta is similar in secondary structure to mature IL1 beta; both proteins are nonhelical beta sheet proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1602204759,"Abstract Mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-R) are composed of two unique, but closely related polypeptides, which in the rat are designated rat hepatic lectins 1 and 2/3 (RHL 1, RHL 2/3). Despite numerous studies, the composition of a functional ASGP-R has remained unclear. We examined this question in rat hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells (which lack endogenous ASGP-R) that were co-transfected with cDNAs for both RHL 1 and RHL 2/3. The original population was cloned, but derivatives were unstable. We therefore used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate a subpopulation of cells (positive) that specifically endocytosed fluoresceinated asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) from one that did not (negative). We then used indirect immunofluorescence with polypeptide-specific ASGP-R antibodies, immunoanalysis, and binding and uptake studies with two Gal ligands (ASOR and NAc-galactosylated poly-L-lysine (Gal-Lys] to further define the ASGP-R status in these two populations. As reported by others, we found that expression of both RHL 1 and RHL 2/3 in the positive cells resulted in binding, uptake and degradation of ASOR, the most commonly used ASGP-R ligand. The negative cells expressed only RHL 1 and neither bound nor processed ASOR. However, the presence of RHL 1 was sufficient for specific high affinity binding and processing of the synthetic ligand, Gal-Lys, by negative cells. These results show that RHL 1 can function as an ASGP-R, given a highly galactosylated ligand, and that RHL 2/3 must play an important role in the organization of native ASGP-R in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1559172215,"The availability of isotype-specific antisera for beta-tubulin, coupled with genetic and biochemical analysis, has allowed the determination of beta-tubulin isotype expression and distribution in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Using genetic manipulations involving selection for colcemid resistance followed by reversion and reselection for drug resistance, we have succeeded in isolating cell lines that exhibit three major and one minor beta-tubulin spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In concert with isotype-specific antibodies, analysis of these mutants demonstrates that CHO cells express two copies of isotype I, at least one copy of isotype IV, and very small amounts of isotype V. All three isotypes assemble into both cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules and are similar in their responses to cold, colcemid, and calcium-induced depolymerization. They have comparable turnover rates and are equally sensitive to depression of synthesis upon colchicine treatment. These results suggest that beta-tubulin isotypes are used interchangeably to assemble microtubule structures in CHO cells. However, of 18 colcemid-resistant mutants with a demonstrable alteration in beta-tubulin, all were found to have the alteration in isotype I, thus leaving open the possibility that subtle differences in isotype properties may exist."
https://openalex.org/W1604265162,"Abstract A highly selective affinity labeling procedure has been applied to map the active center of DNA primase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Enzyme molecules that have been modified by covalent attachment of benzaldehyde derivatives of adenine nucleotides are autocatalytically labeled by incubation with a radioactive ribonucleoside triphosphate. The affinity labeling of primase requires a template DNA, is not affected by DNase and RNase treatments, but is sensitive to proteinase K. Both the p58 and p48 subunits of yeast DNA primase appear to participate in the formation of the catalytic site of the enzyme, although UV-photocross-linking with [alpha-32P]ATP locates the ribonucleoside triphosphate binding site exclusively on the p48 polypeptide. The fixation of the radioactive product has been carried out also after the enzymatic reaction. Under this condition the RNA primers synthesized by the DNA polymerase-primase complex under uncoupled DNA synthesis conditions are linked to both DNA primase and DNA polymerase. When DNA synthesis is allowed to proceed first, the labeled RNA chains are fixed exclusively to the DNA polymerase polypeptide. These results, in accord with previous data, have been used to propose a model illustrating the interactions and the putative roles of the polypeptides of the DNA polymerase-primase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1945572199,"A particulate fraction from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mnn1 mutant was obtained after extracting a 115,000 x g pellet with 0.75% Triton X-100. Incubation of this preparation with labeled Man8GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc in the presence of GDP-mannose followed by high pressure liquid chromatography showed the formation of Man9GlcNAc and Man10GlcNAc, respectively. Analysis by high resolution 1H NMR of the products indicates that, in each case, the mannose residue added is alpha-1,6-linked to the alpha-1,6-mannose residue of the substrate as follows (where M represents mannose and Gn represents N-acetylglucosamine): (Formula: see text). The mannosyltransferase therefore catalyzes the first step specific to the biosynthesis of the outer chain of yeast mannoproteins. The apparent Km values for both substrates are similar: 0.39 mM for Man8GlcNAc and 0.35 mM for Man9GlcNAc. The alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase exhibits maximum activity between pH 7.1 and 7.6 in Tris maleate buffer, has an absolute requirement for Mn2+, and also requires Triton X-100. These results indicate that removal of the alpha-1,2-linked mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc is not essential for the alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase which initiates outer chain synthesis, at least when oligosaccharides are used as substrates in a cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W1557485885,"Abstract Most investigations of the allosteric properties of the regulatory enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from Escherichia coli are based on the sigmoidal dependence of enzyme activity on substrate concentration and the effects of the inhibitor, CTP, and the activator, ATP, on the saturation curves. Interpretations of these effects in terms of molecular models are complicated by the inability to distinguish between changes in substrate binding and catalytic turnover accompanying the allosteric transition. In an effort to eliminate this ambiguity, the binding of the 3H-labeled bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) to aspartate transcarbamoylase in the absence and presence of the allosteric effectors ATP and CTP has been measured directly by equilibrium dialysis at pH 7 in phosphate buffer. PALA binds with marked cooperativity to the holoenzyme with an average dissociation constant of 110 nM. ATP and CTP alter both the average affinity of ATCase for PALA and the degree of cooperativity in the binding process in a manner analogous to their effects on the kinetic properties of the enzyme; the average dissociation constant of PALA decreases to 65 nM in the presence of ATP and increases to 266 nM in the presence of CTP while the Hill coefficient, which is 1.95 in the absence of effectors, becomes 1.35 and 2.27 in the presence of ATP and CTP, respectively. The isolated catalytic subunit of ATCase, which lacks the cooperative kinetic properties of the holoenzyme, exhibits only a very slight degree of cooperativity in binding PALA. The dissociation constant of PALA from the catalytic subunit is 95 nM. Interpretation of these results in terms of a thermodynamic scheme linking PALA binding to the assembly of ATCase from catalytic and regulatory subunits demonstrates that saturation of the enzyme with PALA shifts the equilibrium between holoenzyme and subunits slightly toward dissociation. Ligation of the regulatory subunits by either of the allosteric effectors leads to a change in the effect of PALA on the association-dissociation equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1577161093,"Abstract A monocistronic luxAB gene containing the luxA and luxB genes coding for bacterial luciferase has been generated by site-specific mutagenesis so that it is now possible to express luciferase under control of a single promoter in eukaryotes as well as in prokaryotes. The fused luciferase subunits (alpha and beta), linked by a decapeptide, were synthesized in yeast under the Gal-4 promoter, in Escherichia coli under the T7-phage promoter, and in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate after transcription and capping of the mRNA under the SP6 phage promoter. Replacement of the ATG codon initiating the luxB sequence in the fused luxAB gene with CAG prevented internal initiation and allowed purification of a highly active fused luciferase in the absence of the beta-luciferase subunit. Consequently luciferase activity can be directly attributed to the fused luciferase alone and does not require complementation with free beta subunit of luciferase. Light emission could be measured in yeast and bacterial cells without the need for cell lysis providing the basis for measuring gene expression directly in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential applicability of the fused bacterial luciferase genes as a reporter of gene expression both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1896171101,"The conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate to (+)-α-pinene and to (-)-β-pinene is considered to proceed by the initial isomerization of the substrate to (-)-(3R)- and to (+)-(3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate, respectively, and the subsequent cyclization of the anti, endo-conformer of these bound intermediates by mirror-image sequences which should result in the net retention of configuration at C1 of the geranyl precursor. Incubation of (1R)-[2-14C,1-3H]- and (1S)-[2-14C,1-3H]geranyl pyrophosphate with (+)-pinene cyclase and with (-)-pinene cyclase from common sage (Salvia officinalis) gave labeled (+)-α- and (-)-β-pinene of unchanged 3H/14C ratio in all cases, and the (+)- and (-)-olefins were stereoselectively converted to (+)- and (-)-borneol, respectively, which were oxidized to the corresponding (+)- and (-)-isomers of camphor, again without change in isotope ratio. The location of the tritium was determined in each case by stereoselective, base-catalyzed exchange of the exo-α-hydrogens of these derived ketones. The results indicated that the configuration at C1 of the substrate was retained in the enzymatic transformations to the (+)- and (-)-pinenes, which is entirely consistent with the syn-isomerization of geranyl pyrophosphate to linalyl pyrophosphate, transoid to cisoid rotation, and anti, endo-cyclization of the latter. The absolute stereochemical elements of the antipodal reaction sequences were confirmed by the selective enzymatic conversions of (3R)- and (3S)-1Z-[1-3H]linalyl pyrophosphate to (+)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene, respectively, and by the location of the tritium in the derived camphors as before. The summation of the results fully defines the overall stereochemistry of the coupled isomerization and cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to the antipodal pinenes."
https://openalex.org/W1526125304,"Abstract An efficient post-translational assay for solubilized yeast signal peptidase has been developed. The enzyme can be solubilized in nonionic detergent (0.5% Nikkol) without added salt, but salt increased the efficiency of solubilization. Radiosequencing of the cleaved substrate revealed that the enzyme removed the signal peptide. The substrate (prepro-alpha-factor) must be pretreated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to be cleaved. The enzyme displays a broad, alkaline pH optimum, retaining activity at pH 12. Moderately high temperatures (35 degrees C), excess detergent (greater than 0.5% Nikkol), or high salt (greater than 300 mM KOAc) will inactivate the enzyme. Phosphatidylcholine is necessary for optimal activity. The optimal ratio of Nikkol:lipid:sodium dodecyl sulfate is 6.4:2.2:1. The membrane association of yeast signal peptidase is resistant to carbonate extraction, indicating that it is an integral membrane protein."

https://openalex.org/W1678156302,"Abstract Escherichia coli growing anaerobically respond to NO3- plus PQ2+ with a 20-30-fold induction of an inactive form of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Mutants lacking a functional nitrate reductase fail to show this response. This inactive enzyme can be activated by addition of Mn(II) salts to cell extracts in the presence of acidic guanidinium chloride, followed by dialysis against neutral buffer. Direct addition of Mn(II) to cell extracts does not result in activation. However, addition of Mn(II) to purified apo-MnSOD results in partial activation. Inactive, reconstitutable MnSOD is induced 13-fold within 15 min of exposure to NO3- plus PQ2+. Western blot analysis revealed a 15-fold increase in immunoreactive MnSOD under these conditions, suggestive of de novo synthesis of this protein. A strain of E. coli bearing a multicopy plasmid carrying the MnSOD gene (sodA) overproduces inactive MnSOD 19-fold compared to the parent strain under anaerobic conditions. Strains of E. coli with an inactivating insertion in the sodA gene do not induce inactive, reconstitutable MnSOD in response to NO3- plus PQ2+ and lack the immunoreactive MnSOD band. These results, in toto, suggest that the inactive protein synthesized under anaerobic conditions in the presence of NO3- plus PQ2+, acting as an electron sink, is a product of the sodA gene and is devoid of activity due to occupation of the manganese site by another metal."
https://openalex.org/W1597230783,"An in vitro system has been utilized to study the translocation of newly synthesized Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) into inverted membrane vesicles. Approximately 40% of precursor MBP (pMBP) synthesized with a wild-type signal peptide was imported into vesicles. However, MBP species with even minor alterations in the signal peptide hydrophobic core were imported into vesicles with an efficiency much lower than predicted from in vivo studies. Posttranslational import of wild-type pMBP into vesicles could be demonstrated if membranes were added after the termination of protein synthesis. However, if vesicles were present throughout the synthesis reaction, most pMBP import occurred either cotranslationally or very soon after completion of synthesis. The wild-type pMBP rapidly became incompetent for posttranslational translocation upon continued incubation in the absence of membranes, whereas pMBP species with altered folding properties remained competent for significantly longer periods. The rate of in vitro pMBP folding was affected by the nature of the signal peptide. The evidence suggests that one or more soluble factors may interact with the newly synthesized pMBP to help maintain it in a translocation-competent state and to promote its entrance into the export pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1591171090,"Abstract The 22-residue synthetic signal peptide of the glucitol permease (Enzyme IIgut of the bacterial phosphotransferase system; gut22), which in the intact protein is believed to function in envelope targeting, was found to insert into phospholipid monolayers of various phospholipid compositions up to high limiting pressures (36-41 milliNewton/m). The partition coefficient, derived from monolayer area expansion experiments, was greatest for the negatively charged gut22 when partitioning into monolayers of the zwitterionic lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine (about 1.1 X 10(5] as compared with that obtained with a mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine and the negatively charged lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Gut22 contains a titratable histidyl residue (pKa = 6.8), and its protonation decreased the relative monolayer area increase 3-fold. Circular dichroism spectra showed that gut22 formed an amphiphilic alpha-helix when incorporated into lipid membranes (estimated percent helix = 65%). Fluorescence measurements indicated that tryptophan 11 is in a more hydrophobic environment in the presence of lipid than in its absence, with the environment being more hydrophobic at pH 5 than at pH 8. The more hydrophilic 15-residue signal peptide of the mannitol permease (mtl15) also incorporated into monolayers and detergent micelles (although to a lesser extent) with induction of secondary structure. Based on these results and a parallel with mitochondrial targeting in eucaryotes, we suggest that the induction of N-terminal amphiphilic structures and their association with a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface are important for envelope targeting and the initiation of the membrane insertion of bacterial phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system permeases."
https://openalex.org/W1490166974,"Using the number and concentration of amino acids in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as reference (DMEM = 100%), we found that a maximally effective concentration of insulin (10 ng/ml) stimulated protein synthesis by 125% over basal rate in the presence of 50% amino acids (EC50 = 19%), but by only 48% in amino acid-free buffer. Moreover, time course experiments revealed that amino acid regulation of insulin action was very rapid (t½ of 9.5 min) and readily reversible ( In conclusion: 1) amino acids modulate insulin action by enhancing maximal insulin responsiveness and insulin sensitivity of the protein synthesis system, and the regulatory site of amino acid action appears to be distal to the common signal pathway, within the insulin action-protein synthesis cascade, and 2) the effects of amino acids are specific, in that basal rates of protein synthesis are unaffected, only certain amino acids influence insulin action, and amino acids fail to alter insulin binding or the insulin-responsive glucose transport system. These studies, together with those in the companion paper, demonstrate that the pleiotropic actions of insulin on enhancing glucose uptake and protein synthesis are mediated through divergent pathways that can be independently regulated. It is likely that such control mechanisms are involved in coordinating the disposition of metabolic substrates during the daily fluctuations inam ino acids and glucose associated with dietary uptake andm ay be relevant to the etiology of certain insulin-resistant states such as type II diabetes and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1576136680,"Abstract When adipocytes were exposed to [3H]leucine for times ranging from 5 to 180 s, leucine was found to enter cells rapidly and equilibrate with the cell interior within 5 s. After an additional 15-30 s [3H]leucine was incorporated into nascent protein, and the rate of incorporation was linear for up to 6 h in both control and insulin-treated cells. Since treatment of adipocytes with 10 ng/ml insulin enhanced the rate of leucine incorporation 2-3-fold with minimal or no effect on the rate of protein degradation or leucine uptake, we conclude that the predominant effect of insulin is on enhancement of protein synthesis. To assess the time required for insulin to stimulate protein synthesis, we preincubated cells with 10 ng/ml of insulin for various times from 2 to 30 min and then measured [3H]leucine incorporation into protein during a 4-min assay. These results revealed that the insulin stimulation of protein synthesis is rapid (t 1/2 of 4.4 min), but 9-fold slower than insulin activation of glucose transport (t 1/2 less than 0.5 min under identical conditions). In contrast to the rapidity of insulin activation, we found that deactivation proceeded at much slower rates (t 1/2 of 32 and 21 min for protein synthesis and glucose transport, respectively). Desensitization of the glucose transport system has previously been shown to occur after adipocytes are exposed to high glucose and insulin. To examine the specificity of desensitization, we treated cells for 6 h with 20 mM glucose and 25 ng/ml insulin and then examined insulin sensitivity and maximal insulin responsiveness of both the glucose transport and protein synthesis systems. After treatment, the glucose transport was markedly insulin-resistant (60% loss in maximal insulin responsiveness and a marked loss in insulin sensitivity), whereas the protein synthesis system exhibited neither diminished insulin responsiveness nor loss of insulin sensitivity. In fact, insulin sensitivity actually increased, as indicated by the finding that less insulin was required to stimulate protein synthesis (insulin ED50 values of 0.25 and 18 ng/ml at 0 and 6 h of treatment). From these studies we conclude that desensitization of the glucose transport system by glucose and insulin treatment appears to be specific for this particular effector system and does not reflect a state of generalized cellular insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1563246884,"Abstract We previously reported the isolation and functional characterization of seven adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) DNA-binding protein (DBP) point mutants (Quinn, C. O., and Kitchingman, G. R. (1986) J. Virol. 60, 653-661). Six of the seven mutants were defective in their ability to help adeno-associated virus replicate its DNA. To determine the level at which the mutations affect this function of the DBP, we analyzed several properties of the mutant proteins. All are transported to the nucleus and are post-translationally phosphorylated to the same extent. The half-lives of the proteins, measured by pulse-chase, were nearly identical to that of the wild-type DBP. The mutant DBPs were examined for their ability to bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Mutations in amino acids 322, 323, and 470 lowered the affinity of the DBP for ssDNA, while a mutation in amino acid 181 had no affect. Combinations of mutations in amino acid 470 with either 322 or 323 did not further lower the affinity of the protein for ssDNA. These data indicate that the functional defect for adeno-associated virus helper activity of the six mutants is due mainly, if not totally, to their reduced affinity for single-stranded DNA. These experiments have thus identified a functional domain of the adenovirus type 5 DBP potentially involved in DNA-protein interactions. Comparisons with temperature-sensitive DBP mutants indicate that the conserved region mutants are functionally distinct and represent a new class of DBP mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1501390808,"Abstract Chemical modification experiments have shown that sulfhydryl groups play an important role in the mechanism of action of Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase. One of these sulfhydryl groups has been localized in the beta-subunit of the enzyme using the coenzyme A affinity analog, CoA disulfide-S,S-dioxide (Collier, G. E., and Nishimura, J. S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4938-4943). Recently, it has been shown that the reactive sulfhydryl group resides in Cys325 (Nishimura, J. S., Mitchell, T., Ybarra, J., and Matula, J. M., submitted to Eur. J. Biochem. for publication). In the present study, we have changed Cys325 to a glycine residue using the technique of site-directed mutagenesis and have purified the mutant enzyme to homogeneity. The resulting mutant enzyme is 83% as active as wild type enzyme. In contrast to wild type succinyl-CoA synthetase, the mutant is refractory to chemical modification by CoA disulfide-S,S-dioxide and methyl methanethiolsulfonate. It is also less reactive with N-ethylmaleimide. Thus, beta-Cys325 is a nonessential active site residue."

This process is strongly influenced by the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. These features contrast with the properties of most eucaryotic proteins which are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum. We have extended these studies by introducing the gene for the wild-type and several mutant forms of prepro-α-factor into Escherichia coli. Prepro-α-factor is secreted into the periplasm and processed to pro-α-factor. Its translocation across the plasma membrane requires the membrane potential and the secY gene product. Deletion mutant analysis showed that features of the pro-segment were essential for secretion of prepro-α-factor in E. coli, while the carboxyl-terminal region, which is required in yeast, is dispensible in E. coli. Neither size nor the presence of a unique topogenic sequence was sufficient to explain the requirement for the pro-segment."
