https://openalex.org/W4214881544,"Abstract CRISPR–Cas9 as a programmable genome editing tool is hindered by off-target DNA cleavage 1–4 , and the underlying mechanisms by which Cas9 recognizes mismatches are poorly understood 5–7 . Although Cas9 variants with greater discrimination against mismatches have been designed 8–10 , these suffer from substantially reduced rates of on-target DNA cleavage 5,11 . Here we used kinetics-guided cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of Cas9 at different stages of mismatch cleavage. We observed a distinct, linear conformation of the guide RNA–DNA duplex formed in the presence of mismatches, which prevents Cas9 activation. Although the canonical kinked guide RNA–DNA duplex conformation facilitates DNA cleavage, we observe that substrates that contain mismatches distal to the protospacer adjacent motif are stabilized by reorganization of a loop in the RuvC domain. Mutagenesis of mismatch-stabilizing residues reduces off-target DNA cleavage but maintains rapid on-target DNA cleavage. By targeting regions that are exclusively involved in mismatch tolerance, we provide a proof of concept for the design of next-generation high-fidelity Cas9 variants."
https://openalex.org/W4220749138,"Biaryl compounds, with two connected aromatic rings, are found across medicine, materials science and asymmetric catalysis1,2. The necessity of joining arene building blocks to access these valuable compounds has inspired several approaches for biaryl bond formation and challenged chemists to develop increasingly concise and robust methods for this task3. Oxidative coupling of two C–H bonds offers an efficient strategy for the formation of a biaryl C–C bond; however, fundamental challenges remain in controlling the reactivity and selectivity for uniting a given pair of substrates4,5. Biocatalytic oxidative cross-coupling reactions have the potential to overcome limitations inherent to numerous small-molecule-mediated methods by providing a paradigm with catalyst-controlled selectivity6. Here we disclose a strategy for biocatalytic cross-coupling through oxidative C–C bond formation using cytochrome P450 enzymes. We demonstrate the ability to catalyse cross-coupling reactions on a panel of phenolic substrates using natural P450 catalysts. Moreover, we engineer a P450 to possess the desired reactivity, site selectivity and atroposelectivity by transforming a low-yielding, unselective reaction into a highly efficient and selective process. This streamlined method for constructing sterically hindered biaryl bonds provides a programmable platform for assembling molecules with catalyst-controlled reactivity and selectivity. A study presents a biocatalytic method for the formation of sterically hindered biaryl bonds, providing a tunable approach for assembling molecules with catalyst-controlled reactivity, site selectivity and atroposelectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4214827978,"Topological domains in ferroelectrics1-5 have received much attention recently owing to their novel functionalities and potential applications6,7 in electronic devices. So far, however, such topological polar structures have been observed only in superlattices grown on oxide substrates, which limits their applications in silicon-based electronics. Here we report the realization of room-temperature skyrmion-like polar nanodomains in lead titanate/strontium titanate bilayers transferred onto silicon. Moreover, an external electric field can reversibly switch these nanodomains into the other type of polar texture, which substantially modifies their resistive behaviours. The polar-configuration-modulated resistance is ascribed to the distinct band bending and charge carrier distribution in the core of the two types of polar texture. The integration of high-density (more than 200 gigabits per square inch) switchable skyrmion-like polar nanodomains on silicon may enable non-volatile memory applications using topological polar structures in oxides."
https://openalex.org/W4220972523,"The ability to slow or reverse biological ageing would have major implications for mitigating disease risk and maintaining vitality1. Although an increasing number of interventions show promise for rejuvenation2, their effectiveness on disparate cell types across the body and the molecular pathways susceptible to rejuvenation remain largely unexplored. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20 organs to reveal cell-type-specific responses to young and aged blood in heterochronic parabiosis. Adipose mesenchymal stromal cells, haematopoietic stem cells and hepatocytes are among those cell types that are especially responsive. On the pathway level, young blood invokes new gene sets in addition to reversing established ageing patterns, with the global rescue of genes encoding electron transport chain subunits pinpointing a prominent role of mitochondrial function in parabiosis-mediated rejuvenation. We observed an almost universal loss of gene expression with age that is largely mimicked by parabiosis: aged blood reduces global gene expression, and young blood restores it in select cell types. Together, these data lay the groundwork for a systemic understanding of the interplay between blood-borne factors and cellular integrity. A transcriptomics study demonstrates cell-type-specific responses to differentially aged blood and shows young blood to have restorative and rejuvenating effects that may be invoked through enhanced mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W4214942061,"Macromolecular function frequently requires that proteins change conformation into high-energy states1,2,3,4. However, methods for solving the structures of these functionally essential, lowly populated states are lacking. Here we develop a method for high-resolution structure determination of minorly populated states by coupling NMR spectroscopy-derived pseudocontact shifts5 (PCSs) with Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion6 (PCS–CPMG). Our approach additionally defines the corresponding kinetics and thermodynamics of high-energy excursions, thereby characterizing the entire free-energy landscape. Using a large set of simulated data for adenylate kinase (Adk), calmodulin and Src kinase, we find that high-energy PCSs accurately determine high-energy structures (with a root mean squared deviation of less than 3.5 angström). Applying our methodology to Adk during catalysis, we find that the high-energy excursion involves surprisingly small openings of the AMP and ATP lids. This previously unresolved high-energy structure solves a longstanding controversy about conformational interconversions that are rate-limiting for catalysis. Primed for either substrate binding or product release, the high-energy structure of Adk suggests a two-step mechanism combining conformational selection to this state, followed by an induced-fit step into a fully closed state for catalysis of the phosphoryl-transfer reaction. Unlike other methods for resolving high-energy states, such as cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, our solution PCS–CPMG approach excels in cases involving domain rearrangements of smaller systems (less than 60 kDa) and populations as low as 0.5%, and enables the simultaneous determination of protein structure, kinetics and thermodynamics while proteins perform their function."
https://openalex.org/W4214813171,"The Hadean eon, following the global-scale melting of the mantle1-3, is expected to be a dynamic period, during which Earth experienced vastly different conditions. Geologic records, however, suggest that the surface environment of Earth was already similar to the present by the middle of the Hadean4,5. Under what conditions a harsh surface environment could turn into a habitable one remains uncertain6. Here we show that a hydrated mantle with small-scale chemical heterogeneity, created as a result of magma ocean solidification, is the key to ocean formation, the onset of plate tectonics and the rapid removal of greenhouse gases, which are all essential to create a habitable environment on terrestrial planets. When the mantle is wet and dominated by high-magnesium pyroxenites, the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is expected to be more than ten times faster than the case of a pyrolitic homogeneous mantle and could be completed within 160 million years. Such a chemically heterogeneous mantle would also produce oceanic crust rich in olivine, which is reactive with ocean water and promotes serpentinization. Therefore, conditions similar to the Lost City hydrothermal field7-9 may have existed globally in the Hadean seafloor."

Given the decrease in quantitative SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibody titers three months after the second BNT162b2 dose, healthcare workers received a third booster six months after completing the original protocol. This study aimed to analyze the quantitative SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibody titers and the safety of the third dose.A prospective longitudinal cohort study included healthcare workers who received a third booster six months after completing the BNT162b2 regimen. We assessed the quantitative SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibody titers 21-28 days after the first and second dose, three months after the completed protocol, 1-7 days following the third dose, and 21-28 days after booster administration.The cohort comprised 168 participants aged 41(10) years old, 67% of whom were female. The third dose was associated with an increase in quantitative antibody titers, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 history. In cases with a negative SARS-CoV-2 history, the median (IQR) antibody titer values increased from 379 (645.4) to 2960 (2010) AU/ml, whereas in cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 history, from 590 (1262) to 3090 (2080) AU/ml (p<0.001). The third dose caused a lower number of total (local and systemic) adverse events following immunization (AEFI) compared with the first two vaccines. However, in terms of specific symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, and adenopathy, the proportion was higher in comparison with the first and second doses (p<0.05). The most common AEFI after the third BNT162b2 vaccine was pain at the injection site (n = 82, 84.5%), followed by fatigue (n = 45, 46.4%) of mild severity (n = 36, 37.1%).The third dose applied six months after the original BNT162b2 regimen increased the quantitative SARS-CoV-2 spike 1-2 IgG antibody titers. The booster dose was well tolerated and caused no severe AEFI."
https://openalex.org/W4214859875,"All disc-accreting astrophysical objects produce powerful outflows. In binaries containing neutron stars (NS) or black holes, accretion often takes place during violent outbursts. The main disc wind signatures during these eruptions are blue-shifted X-ray absorption lines, which are preferentially seen in disc-dominated ""soft states"". By contrast,optical wind-formed lines have recently been detected in ""hard states"", when a hot corona dominates the luminosity. The relationship between these signatures is unknown, and no erupting system has revealed wind-formed lines between the X-ray and optical bands yet, despite the many strong resonance transitions in this ultraviolet (UV) region. Here, we show that the transient NS binary Swift J1858.6-0814 exhibits wind-formed, blue-shifted absorption associated with C IV, N V and He II in time-resolved UV spectroscopy during a luminous hard state. This represents the first evidence for a warm, moderately ionized outflow component in this state. Simultaneously observed optical lines also display transient blue-shifted absorption. Decomposing the UV data into constant and variable components, the blue-shifted absorption is associated with the former. This implies that the outflow is not connect to the luminous flares in the data. The joint presence of UV and optical wind features reveals a multi-phase and/or stratified outflow from the outer disc. This type of persistent mass loss across all accretion states has been predicted by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations and helps to explain the shorter-than-expected outbursts duration."

https://openalex.org/W4214847427,"The relationship between COVID-19 patient's clinical characteristics and disease manifestation remains incompletely understood. The impact of ethnicity on mortality of patients with COVID-19 infection is poorly addressed in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that many risk factors are related to symptoms severity and mortality risk, emphasizing the necessity of fulfilling this knowledge gap that may help reducing mortality from COVID-19 infections through tackling the risk factors.To explore epidemiological and demographic characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from different ethnic origins living in the UAE, compare them to findings reported across the globe and determine the impact of these characteristics and ethnicity on mortality during hospitalization.A single center, retrospective chart review study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a large COVID-19 referral hospital in UAE. The following outcomes were assessed: patients' clinical characteristics, disease symptoms and severity, and association of ethnicity and other risk factors on 30-day in hospital mortality.A total of 3296 patients were recruited in this study with an average age of 44.3±13.4 years old. Preliminary data analysis indicated that 78.3% (n = 2582) of cases were considered mild. Average duration of hospital stay was 6.0±7.3 days and 4.3% (n = 143) were admitted to ICU. The most frequently reported symptoms were cough (32.6%, n = 1075) and fever (22.2%, n = 731). The 30-day mortality rate during hospitalization was 2.7% (n = 90). Many risk factors were associated with mortality during hospitalization including: age, respiratory rate (RR), creatinine, and C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation (SaO2), hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, creatinine, C-reactive protein, anemia, COPD, Chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, Vitamin-D Deficiency, and ethnic origin (p <0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that higher mortality rates during hospitalization was associated with anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, and Middle Eastern origin (p<0.05).The results indicated that most COVID-19 cases were mild and morality rate was low compared to worldwide reported mortality. Mortality rate during hospitalization was higher in patients from Middle East origin with preexisting comorbidities especially anemia, COPD, and chronic kidney disease. Due to the relatively small number of mortality cases, other identified risk factors from univariate analysis such as age, respiratory rate, and Vitamin-D (VitD) deficiency should also be taken into consideration. It is crucial to stratify patients on admission based on these risk factors to help decide intensity and type of treatment which, possibly, will reduce the risk of death."
https://openalex.org/W4214858167,"Objectives To determine the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 from a Peruvian national hospital. Methods Retrospective cohort study of medical records of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at Hospital Nacional Hipólito Unanue (HNHU) during the months of April to August 2020. The dependent variable was in-hospital mortality. Independent variables included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, physical examination findings, oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) at admission, treatment received during hospitalization and laboratory results at admission. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios for associated factors. Results We included 1418 patients. Median age was 58 years (IQR 47–68 years) and 944 (66.6%) were male. The median length of hospitalization was 7 (4–13) days, and the mortality rate was 46%. The most frequent comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. In the adjusted analysis, mortality was associated with age (HR 1.02; 95%CI 1.02–1.03), history of surgery (HR 1.89; 95%CI 1.31–2.74), lower oxygen saturation at admission (HR 4.08; CI95% 2.72–8.05 for SaO 2 &lt;70% compared to SaO 2 &gt;94%), the presence of poor general condition (HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.29–2.53), altered state of consciousness (HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.18–2.11) and leukocyte levels (HR 1.01; 95%CI 1.00–1. 02). Treatment with ivermectin (HR 1.44; 95%CI 1.18–1.76) and azithromycin (HR 1.25; 95%CI 1.03–1.52) were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses was associated with lower mortality (HR 0.56 95%CI 0. 37–0. 86) in comparison to no steroid use. Conclusion A high mortality was found in our cohort. Low oxygen saturation at admission, age, and the presence of hematological and biochemical alterations were associated with higher mortality. The use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin or azithromycin was not useful and was probably associated with unfavorable outcomes. The use of corticosteroids at moderate doses was associated with lower mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4220969470,"In multicellular organisms, cells actively sense and control their own population density. Synthetic mammalian quorum-sensing circuits could provide insight into principles of population control and extend cell therapies. However, a key challenge is reducing their inherent sensitivity to “cheater” mutations that evade control. Here, we repurposed the plant hormone auxin to enable orthogonal mammalian cell-cell communication and quorum sensing. We designed a paradoxical population control circuit, termed “Paradaux,” in which auxin stimulates and inhibits net cell growth at different concentrations. This circuit limited population size over extended timescales of up to 42 days of continuous culture. By contrast, when operating in a non-paradoxical regime, population control became more susceptible to mutational escape. These results establish auxin as a versatile “private” communication system and demonstrate that paradoxical circuit architectures can provide robust population control."
https://openalex.org/W4214943918,"The spatial resolutions of even the most sensitive isotope analysis techniques based on light or ion probes are limited to a few hundred nanometres. Although vibrational spectroscopy using electron probes has achieved higher spatial resolution1–3, the detection of isotopes at the atomic level4 has been challenging so far. Here we show the unambiguous isotopic imaging of 12C carbon atoms embedded in 13C graphene and the monitoring of their self-diffusion via atomic-level vibrational spectroscopy. We first grow a domain of 12C carbon atoms in a pre-existing crack of 13C graphene, which is then annealed at 600 degrees Celsius for several hours. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy–electron energy loss spectroscopy, we obtain an isotope map that confirms the segregation of 12C atoms that diffused rapidly. The map also indicates that the graphene layer becomes isotopically homogeneous over 100-nanometre regions after 2 hours. Our results demonstrate the high mobility of carbon atoms during growth and annealing via self-diffusion. This imaging technique can provide a fundamental methodology for nanoisotope engineering and monitoring, which will aid in the creation of isotope labels and tracing at the nanoscale. Vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy is used to distinguish two stable isotopes of carbon and to monitor their diffusion with subnanometre spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4214906612,"The interaction of intense particle bunches with plasma can give rise to plasma wakes capable of sustaining gigavolt-per-metre electric fields, which are orders of magnitude higher than provided by state-of-the-art radio-frequency technology. Plasma wakefields can, therefore, strongly accelerate charged particles and offer the opportunity to reach higher particle energies with smaller and hence more widely available accelerator facilities. However, the luminosity and brilliance demands of high-energy physics and photon science require particle bunches to be accelerated at repetition rates of thousands or even millions per second, which are orders of magnitude higher than demonstrated with plasma-wakefield technology. Here we investigate the upper limit on repetition rates of beam-driven plasma accelerators by measuring the time it takes for the plasma to recover to its initial state after perturbation by a wakefield. The many-nanosecond-level recovery time measured establishes the in-principle attainability of megahertz rates of acceleration in plasmas. The experimental signatures of the perturbation are well described by simulations of a temporally evolving parabolic ion channel, transferring energy from the collapsing wake to the surrounding media. This result establishes that plasma-wakefield modules could be developed as feasible high-repetition-rate energy boosters at current and future particle-physics and photon-science facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4214935434,"Sericin, a natural protein from silk cocoon, has been reported for various biological properties in the biomaterials field. Modified forms of sericin have been studied for bone tissue engineering, while its unmodified form has been scarcely reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate physical and biological properties of unmodified sericin for potential use in bone surgery. Sericin was extracted from silk cocoons using a chemical-free boiling method. Sericin extract showed distinct bands with molecular weight ranging from 25 to 42 kDa including smear bands. Fourier transform infrared spectra presented characteristic peaks of amide I, II, and III, confirming the chemical composition of sericin. Based on biological activity, sericin extract at a concentration of 40 μg/mL increased the proliferation of osteoblast cells up to 135%, compared with the untreated control. Moreover, increase in antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, both clinical isolates and the reference strain ATCC 29213, was demonstrated for sericin extract with normal saline, while no antibacterial activity was observed for sericin with broth. It was found that sericin with normal saline showed higher zeta potential than sericin without normal saline, indicating higher system stability. This was confirmed by the average particle size of sericin extract with NaCl (3,249.3±226.1 nm) showing approximately 10 times smaller than sericin solution (29,015.9 ± 8,085.6 nm). Furthermore, sericin extract at the minimal inhibitory concentration significantly reduced the biofilm formation of S. aureus up to 95%. The study indicates biological activities of sericin, which could be applied as a dual-functional bioactive material to support bone regeneration and treat bone infections."

https://openalex.org/W4214872333,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority (80-85%) of all lung cancers. All current available treatments have limited efficacy. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in the development and progression of NSCLC, with high EGFR expression associated with increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis. Thus, interfering with EGFR signaling has been shown to effectively reduce cell proliferation and help in the treatment of NSCLC. We previously demonstrated that the progesterone receptor (PR) contains a polyproline domain (PPD) that directly interacts with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing molecules and expression of PR-PPD peptides inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated whether the introduction of PR-PPD by cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) could inhibit EGF-induced cell proliferation in NSCLC cells. PR-PPD was attached to a cancer-specific CPP, Buforin2 (BR2), to help deliver the PR-PPD into NSCLC cells. Interestingly, addition of BR2-2xPPD peptides containing two PR-PPD repeats was more effective in inhibiting NSCLC proliferation and significantly reduced EGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2. BR2-2xPPD treatment induced cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK2 genes in EGFR-wild type A549 cells. Furthermore, the combination treatment of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including Gefitinib or Erlotinib, with BR2-2xPPD peptides further suppressed the growth of NSCLC PC9 cells harboring EGFR mutations as compared to EGFR-TKIs treatment alone. Importantly, BR2-2xPPD peptides mediated growth inhibition in acquired Gefitinib- and Erlotinib- resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our data suggests that PR-PPD is the minimal protein domain sufficient to inhibit NSCLC cell growth and has the potential to be developed as a novel NSCLC therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W4214941512,"Free-roaming dog population management is conducted to mitigate risks to public health, livestock losses, wildlife conservation, and dog health and welfare. This study aimed to determine attitudes towards free-roaming dogs and their management and describe dog ownership practices in three European countries. We distributed an online questionnaire comprising questions relating to dog ownership practices and attitudes towards free-roaming dogs using social media. We used logistic regression and ordinal probit models to determine associations between demographic and other factors with ownership practices and attitudes towards free-roaming dogs. This study found that most surveyed respondents wanted to see a reduction in free-roaming dog numbers, and felt that this should be achieved through sheltering, catch-neuter-release, and by controlling owned dog breeding. We identified significant associations between both attitudes and ownership practices with gender, religious beliefs, age, education level, reason for dog ownership, previous experience with free-roaming dogs, and country of residence. Respondents who identified as: (i) male, (ii) holding religious beliefs, (iii) owning dogs for practical reasons, (iv) being young, or (v) having no schooling or primary education had a lower probability of neutering and a higher probability of allowing dogs to roam. Respondents who identified as: (i) female, (ii) feeling threatened by free-roaming dogs, (iii) older, or (iv) having more education had a higher probability of answering that increases in free-roaming dog numbers should be prevented. These findings can help to inform future dog population management interventions in these countries. We emphasise the importance of considering local attitudes and dog ownership practices in the development of effective dog population management approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4214809937,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes more than five million deaths worldwide. Pregnant women are at high risk for infection due to the physiologic change in the immune and cardiopulmonary system and also it increases the risk of severe disease, intensive care unit admission, and receive mechanical ventilation when compared with non-pregnant women. It is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. So pregnant women need to have adhered to preventive measures to prevent COVID-19 related consequences. Therefore, this study aimed to assess adherence toCOVID-19 preventive practice and associated factors among pregnant women in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 1st to 30th, 2021, in Gondar city. A cluster sampling technique was employed to select 678 pregnant women. Data were collected using a pre-tested, face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI DATA version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify associated factors. Adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to report the association between covariates and the outcome variable.The prevalence of good adherence to COVID-19 preventive practice was 44.8% (95% CI: 41.3, 48.7). Maternal age (≤24 years) [AOR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.37, 6.10], maternal education (secondary school) [AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.58, 5.53] and (college and above) [AOR = 4.57,95% CI: 2.42, 8.62], having ANC follow up [AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.35, 6.46] and adequate knowledge towards COVID-19 [AOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.41] were significantly associated with good adherence to COVID-19 preventive practice.In this study, adherence towards COVID-19 preventive practice in pregnant women is low. Hence, it is important to strengthen women's awareness about COVID-19 through different media and health education. In addition, empowering women to attain ANC and special consideration should be given to women who had no formal education."
https://openalex.org/W4214922795,"While zebrafish represent an important model for the study of the visual system, visual perception in this species is still less investigated than in other teleost fish. In this work, we validated for zebrafish two versions of a visual discrimination learning task, which is based on the motivation to reach food and companions. Using this task, we investigated zebrafish ability to discriminate between two different shape pairs (i.e., disk vs. cross and full vs. amputated disk). Once zebrafish were successfully trained to discriminate a full from an amputated disk, we also tested their ability to visually complete partially occluded objects (amodal completion). After training, animals were presented with two amputated disks. In these test stimuli, another shape was either exactly juxtaposed or only placed close to the missing sectors of the disk. Only the former stimulus should elicit amodal completion. In human observers, this stimulus causes the impression that the other shape is occluding the missing sector of the disk, which is thus perceived as a complete, although partially hidden, disk. In line with our predictions, fish reinforced on the full disk chose the stimulus eliciting amodal completion, while fish reinforced on the amputated disk chose the other stimulus. This represents the first demonstration of amodal completion perception in zebrafish. Moreover, our results also indicated that a specific shape pair (disk vs. cross) might be particularly difficult to discriminate for this species, confirming previous reports obtained with different procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4214492066,"Osteoporosis is caused by enhanced bone resorption and relatively reduced bone formation. There is an unmet need to develop new agents with both antiresorptive and anabolic effects to treat osteoporosis, although drugs with either effect alone are available. A small molecular compound, plumbagin, was reported to inhibit receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand-induced osteoclast (OC) differentiation by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation-mediated canonical NF-κB activation. However, the key transcriptional factor RelA/p65 in canonical NF-κB pathway functions to promote OC precursor survival but not terminal OC differentiation. Here, we found that plumbagin inhibited the activity of NF-κB inducing kinase, the key molecule that controls noncanonical NF-κB signaling, in an ATP/ADP-based kinase assay. Consistent with this, plumbagin inhibited processing of NF-κB2 p100 to p52 in the progenitor cells of both OCs and osteoblasts (OBs). Interestingly, plumbagin not only inhibited OC but also stimulated OB differentiation in vitro. Importantly, plumbagin prevented trabecular bone loss in ovariectomized mice. This was associated with decreased OC surfaces on trabecular surface and increased parameters of OBs, including OB surface on trabecular surface, bone formation rate, and level of serum osteocalcin, compared to vehicle-treated mice. In summary, we conclude that plumbagin is a NF-κB-inducing kinase inhibitor with dual anabolic and antiresorptive effects on bone and could represent a new class of agent for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4214831584,"Nondisclosure of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, asexual, or otherwise queer (LGBTQA) identities in the workplace is both common and stressful to those who do not disclose. However, we lack direct evidence that nondisclosure of LGBTQA identity affects worker productivity. In two surveys of LGBTQA-identified scientists, we found that those who did not disclose LGBTQA identities in professional settings authored fewer peer-reviewed publications-a concrete productivity cost. In the second survey, which included straight and cisgender participants as a comparison group, we found that LGBTQA participants who disclosed their sexual orientation had publication counts more like non-LGBTQA participants than those who did not disclose, and that all three groups had similar time since first publication given their academic career stage. These results are most consistent with a productivity cost to nondisclosure of LGBTQA identity in professional settings, and suggest a concrete need to improve scientific workplace climates for sexual and gender minorities."
https://openalex.org/W4214855982,"Salt impairs endothelial function and increases arterial stiffness independent of blood pressure. The mechanisms are unknown. Recent evidence suggests that there is a possible link between salt consumption and sodium buffering capacity and cardiovascular disease but there is limited evidence in the populations living in Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of our study was to explore the relationship between erythrocyte sodium buffering capacity and sociodemographic, clinical factors, and self-reported salt consumption at Livingstone Central Hospital.We conducted a cross sectional study at Livingstone Central hospital among 242 volunteers accessing routine medical checkups. Sociodemographic and dietary characteristics were obtained along with clinical measurements to evaluate their health status. Sodium buffering capacity was estimated by erythrocyte sodium sensitivity (ESS) test. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to describe and examine associations between erythrocyte sodium sensitivity and independent variables.The median age (interquartile range) of the study sample was 27 (22, 42) years. 54% (n = 202) and 46% (n = 169) were males and females, respectively. The majority (n = 150, 62%) had an ESS of >120%. High salt intake correlated positively with ESS or negatively with vascular sodium buffering capacity.Self-reported high salt intake was associated with poor vascular sodium buffering capacity or high ESS in the majority of middle-aged Zambians living in Livingstone. The poor vascular sodium buffering capacity implies a damaged vascular glycocalyx which may potentially lead to a leakage of sodium into the interstitium. This alone is a risk factor for the future development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, future studies need to validate vascular function status when using ESS testing by including established vascular function assessments to determine its pathophysiological and clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W4214866103,"Electric shocks may have neurological consequences for the victims. Although the literature on the neurological consequences of electric shocks is limited by retrospective designs, case studies and studies of selected patient groups, previous research provides some evidence of a link between electric shocks, and diseases and symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS)(e.g. epilepsy, migraine and vertigo) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS)(e.g. loss of sensation, neuropathy and muscle weakness). This study aims to employ a register-based, matched cohort study, to investigate whether individuals demonstrate a greater risk of neurological diseases and symptoms of the CNS or PNS in the years following an electrical injury.We identified 14,112 electrical injuries over a period of 19 years in two Danish registries, and matched these with three different groups of persons in a prospective matched cohort study: (1) patients with dislocation/sprain injuries, (2) patients with eye injuries and (3) persons employed in the same occupation. Year of injury, sex and age were used as matching variables. The outcomes we identified comprised neurological disorders and central or peripheral nervous system symptoms that covered a range of diagnoses in the Danish National Patient Register. The associations were analysed using conditional logistic regression for a range of time periods (six months to five years) and conditional Cox regression for analyses of the complete follow-up period (up to 20 years).For victims of electric shock, the CNS sequelae we identified included an increased risk of epilepsy, convulsions, abnormal involuntary movements, headache, migraine and vertigo. We also identified an uncertain, increased risk of spinal muscular atrophy and dystonia, whereas we identified no increased risk of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, multiple sclerosis or other degenerative diseases of the nervous system. For victims of electric shock, the PNS sequelae we identified included an increased risk of disturbances of skin sensation, mononeuropathy in the arm or leg and nerve root and plexus disorders. We also identified an uncertain, increased risk of facial nerve disorders, other mononeuropathy, and polyneuropathy.Our results confirm that electrical injuries increase the risk of several neurological diseases and symptoms of the CNS or PNS in the years following the injury. Most often the diseases and symptoms are diagnosed within the first six months of the injury, but delayed onset of up to 5 years cannot be ruled out for some symptoms and diagnoses. Some of the conditions were rare in our population, which limited our ability to identify associations, and this warrants cautious interpretation. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm our findings, as are studies that examine the mechanisms underlying these associations."

They are also now the most threatened directly by some combination of overfishing, floodplain deforestation, and dam construction. Limited governmental monitoring and implemented regulations impede adequate management of the fisheries at adequate scale. We summarize the current stock status of the three most heavily exploited long-distance migratory species, which are two goliath catfishes (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii and B. vaillantii) and the characiform Colossoma macropomum. In addition, we analyze impacts beyond overfishing on these species. Our results indicate: (i) the overfishing trends for these important species are either ominous or indicate the verge of collapse of the commercial fisheries based on them, and (ii) a dangerous synergy between overfishing, hydroelectric dams, and floodplain deforestation further challenge fisheries management of migratory species in the Amazon. We propose eight direct governmental actions as a proactive approach that addresses the main impacts on the fisheries. We consider that the most practical way to assess and manage overfishing of migratory species in the short run in an area as large as the main commercial fishing area in the Amazon is at market sites where enforced regulations can control fish catch. The management of the three species considered here has implications beyond just their sustainability. Their management would represent a paradigm shift where the governments assume their legal responsibilities in fishery management. These responsibilities include regulation enforcement, data collecting, inter-jurisdictional cooperation to protect migratory species at realistic life history scales, mitigation of the Madeira dams to assure goliath catfish passage to the largest western headwater region, and recognition of monitoring and managing wetland deforestation for the protection of fish and other aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4214850142,"Poeple living with HIV have higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and metabolic perturbations compared to non-HIV populations. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome co-morbidities add significant burden to HIV care. Currently, WHO recommends integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) as the first or second line therapy in people with HIV due to overall good tolerability and safety profile. However, whether INSTI use increases the risk of incident diabetes (with or without metabolic syndrome) compared to other anti-retroviral therapies (ART) is controversial. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to examine this risk in HIV-positive populations receiving INSTIs compared to other ART regimens (not containing INSTIs).The study will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. This protocol adheres to the Standard Protocol Items for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses checklist. Eligibility criteria will be original peer-reviewed published articles and conference abstracts with no language or geographical restriction; that report the ocurrence of diabetes mellitus as a discrete outcome or part of metabolic syndrome, in adult PLWHIV receiving INSTIs compared to other ART regimens. PubMed/ Medline, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched from 1st- January-2000 to 31st-January-2022. Per our a priori, screening, inclusion and data extraction will be conducted separately by two investigators, and a senior researcher will be consulted in case of disagreement. The quality of included studies will be assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies and the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB2) for randomized controlled trials. The quantitative synthesis of the study outcomes will be explored in different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Meta regression will also be performed to further test the predictors of the outcome.Ethical approval is waived as the study is a review of published litterature. The analyses will be presented in conferences and published as a scientific article.PROSPERO registration number is; CRD42021273040."
https://openalex.org/W4214892955,"Land plants have diverse defenses against herbivores. In some cases, plant response to insect herbivory may be chronological and even transgenerational. Feeding by various stink bugs, such as the bean bug Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae), induce physiological changes in soybean, called as green stem syndrome, which are characterized by delayed senescence in stems, leaves, and pods. To investigate the plant response to the bean bug feeding in the infested generation and its offspring, we studied the effects of R. pedestris infestation on Glycine soja, the ancestral wild species of soybean. Field surveys revealed that the occurrence of the autumn R. pedestris generation coincided with G. soja pod maturation in both lowland and mountainous sites. Following infestation by R. pedestris, pod maturation was significantly delayed in G. soja. When G. soja seeds obtained from infested and non-infested plants were cultivated, the progeny of infested plants exhibited much earlier pod maturation and larger-sized seed production than that of control plants, indicating that R. pedestris feeding induced transgenerational changes. Because earlier seed maturity results in asynchrony with occurrence of R. pedestris, the transgenerational changes in plant phenology are considered to be an adaptive transgenerational and chronological defense for the plant against feeding by the stink bug."
https://openalex.org/W4214923626,"Millions of children worldwide especially in the Asian subcontinent are vulnerable to early childhood stunting. There are contradictory reports of the association between catch-up growth in childhood and school age cognition.A community-based birth cohort recruited between 2010 and 2012 from urban slums in Vellore, India was followed up until 9 years of age. From regular anthropometric measurements, stunting status for each individual child was calculated at 2, 5 and 9 years. Cognition was assessed at 9 years of age using the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC). Children were divided into groups based on stunting at each time point as well as catch-up growth, and a regression model was utilised to evaluate their association with cognition at 9 years.Among 203 children included in this analysis, 94/203 (46.31%) children were stunted at 2 years of age, of whom 39.36% had a catch-up growth at 5 years of age, and 38.30% at 9 years. Around 10% of the cohort remained stunted at all time points. In the multivariable analysis, children who were stunted at 2, 5 and 9 years had a significantly lower verbal and total intelligence quotient (IQ) scores by 4.6 points compared to those who were never stunted. Children with catch up growth following stunting at 2 years had higher cognition scores than those who were persistently stunted throughout the childhood.This study showed persistent stunting in childhood was associated with lowering of 4-5 IQ points in childhood cognition at 9 years of age. Recovery from early life stunting in children with catch up growth prevented further lowering of cognition scores in these children compared to persistently stunted children. Nutritional supplementation during late infancy and early toddlerhood in addition to continuing nutritional supplementation programmes for preschool and school children can improve childhood stunting and cognitive abilities in vulnerable populations."

However, little is known about the active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms that mediate the action of P. sinensis against RA.The compounds contained in P. sinensis were analyzed by Q Exactive Focus mass spectrometer. The active constituents and pharmacological mechanism of P. sinensis against RA were clarified using a network pharmacology-based investigation. LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells was used to verify anti-inflammatory effects of the active compounds screened by network pharmacology. Collagen-induced arthritis model was used to further investigate the mechanism of P. sinensis against RA.The potential components and targets of P. sinensis against RA were analyzed using network pharmacology, and five compounds, twenty-five targets, and eight pathways were identified. Experimental validation suggested that P. sinensis extract and five compounds (esculetin, umbelliferone, trans-N-feruloyltyramine, caffeic acid and scopolin) could inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators (NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell. P. sinensis extract attenuated the severity, pathological changes, and release of cytokines (IL-6 and HIF-1α) during RA progression by regulating the PI3K/AKT and HIF-1 pathways.The study provides a basis for the application of P. sinensis against RA. Our findings may provide suggestions for developing P. sinensis into a substitute for Erycibes Caulis."

We sequenced Viral RNA from 37 sampled Covid-19 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed infections across the UAE and developed time-resolved phylogenies with 69 local and 3,894 global genome sequences. Furthermore, we investigated specific clades associated with the UAE cohort and, their global diversity, introduction events and inferred domestic and international virus transmissions between January and June 2020. The study comprehensively characterized the genomic aspects of the virus and its spread within the UAE and identified that the prevalence shift of the D614G mutation was due to the later introductions of the G-variant associated with international travel, rather than higher local transmissibility. For clades spanning different emirates, the most recent common ancestors pre-date domestic travel bans. In conclusion, we observe a steep and sustained decline of international transmissions immediately following the introduction of international travel restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4214858370,"Inositol polyphosphates (InsPs) play key signaling roles in diverse cellular functions, including calcium homeostasis, cell survival and death. Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (Minpp1) affects the cellular levels of InsPs and cell functions. The Minpp1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident but localizes away from its cytosolic InsPs substrates. The current study examines the heterogeneity of Minpp1 and the potential physiologic impact of Minpp1 isoforms, distinct motifs, subcellular distribution, and enzymatic potential. The NCBI database was used to analyze the proteome diversity of Minpp1 using bioinformatics tools. The analysis revealed that translation of three different Minpp1 variants resulted in three isoforms of Minpp1 of varying molecular weights. A link between the minpp1 variant-2 gene and ER-stress, using real-time PCR, suggests a functional similarity between minpp1 variant-1 and variant-2 . A detailed study on motifs revealed Minpp1 isoform-2 is the only other isoform, besides isoform-1, that carries a phosphatase motif for InsPs hydrolysis but no ER-retention signal. The confocal microscopy revealed that the Minpp1 isoform-1 predominantly localized near the nucleus with a GRP-78 ER marker, while Minpp1 isoform-2 was scattered more towards the cell periphery where it co-localizes with the plasma membrane-destined multivesicular bodies biomarker CD63. MCF-7 cells were used to establish that Minpp1 isoform-2 is secreted into exosomes. Brefeldin A treatment resulted in overexpression of the exosome-associated Minpp1 isoform-2, suggesting its secretion via an unconventional route involving endocytic-generated vesicles and a link to ER stress. Results further demonstrated that the exosome-associated Minpp1 isoform-2 was enzymatically active. Overall, the data support the possibility that an extracellular form of enzymatically active Minpp1 isoform-2 mitigates any anti-proliferative actions of extracellular InsPs, thereby also impacting the makeup of the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W4214879128,"Peatlands historically have acted as a C sink because C-fixation rates exceeded the rate of heterotrophic decomposition. Under future warmer conditions predicted for higher latitudes, however, that balance may shift towards higher rates of heterotrophic respiration leading to the release of previously stored C as CO2 and CH4. The Spruce and Peatlands Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment is designed to test the response of peatlands to climate forcing using a series of warmed enclosures in combination with peat below-ground heating from 0 to +9°C above ambient conditions. This experimental design allowed a test of chemical changes occurring within peatland soils following five years of warming. We analyzed samples in the uppermost 2m of peat using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to quantify the relative abundance of carbohydrate and aromatic compounds in the peat. The peat soils were subjected to deep peat heating (DPH) beginning in June of 2014 followed by whole ecosystem warming (WEW) in August of 2015. We found that the relative amounts of labile and recalcitrant chemical compound groups across the full peat depth interval did not significantly change after five years of exposure to warming. This appears the case even though previous studies have shown that net C losses and loss of bulk peat mass to be instability over that time period. Results suggest that the current store of carbon in peatlands are largely compositionally stable leading to no changes the in the ratio of chemical moieties on the initial four-year timescale of this experiment."
https://openalex.org/W4214813793,"Background Food service in hospital is one of the essential parts of the treatment process that determines recovery length and a hospital stay of patients. Even though many researches have been conducted on patients’ satisfaction with healthcare services, there is a lack of studies that specifically address the satisfaction with food service at healthcare facilities in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess patient satisfaction with regular hospital food service and associated factors among adults admitted to in-patient departments of hospitals. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted to interview 423 patients admitted to three randomly selected hospitals namely Wolaita Sodo University Referral and Teaching Hospital, Dubo St. Catholic Hospital and Sodo Christian Hospital. Participants were recruited based on probability proportional to the number of clients in each hospital. After data entry using EpiInfo v7.2.2.6, the data were exported to SPSS v23 software for further analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were undertaken to see the association between variables. Statistically significant variables were declared using an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Result Among the total participants 33.6% (95%CI: [29.1, 38.3]) of patients were satisfied with regular hospital food services. Multivariate analysis revealed that residence (AOR = 2.16; 95%CI: [1.28, 3.63]), monthly income (AOR = 5.64; 95%CI: [2.30, 8.28]), flavour of meal, (AOR = 2.63; 95%CI: [1.34, 5.56]), and provision of easily chewable food (AOR = 7.50; 95%CI: [2.00, 12.82]) were influencing factors for satisfaction on hospital foodservices. Conclusion This research ascertained a low patient satisfaction with regular hospital meal service. The identified factors need to be addressed giving attention for each foodservice dimension to scale up the patient satisfaction with hospital food services."

In this context, this study aimed to uncover the consequences of conflict on victims' health and on health service provision, and their perceived health status during the post-accord stage in the Meta region, located in the country's eastern plains. Historically, this region has been one of the territories most affected by the presence of conflict-related groups and armed confrontations. Through focus groups, this research explored the health perceptions and experiences of victims of armed conflict. Ten focus groups were conducted with men and women, victims of the armed-conflict, in four municipalities with different degrees of armed conflict intensity. The focus group transcripts were coded using NVivo. The results show that the way women have experienced conflict and the effects of conflict on mental health in general for men, women, and children were recurrent themes in the dialogue of victims. Likewise, it highlights the need to understand the barriers that the current health model imposes on the right to health itself. From the victim's perspective, they experience stigmatization, discrimination, and revictimization when accessing health services. These barriers co-occur along with structural limitations of the health system that affect the general population."
https://openalex.org/W4214912232,"Background Flow-diverting stents are increasingly used for the minimally-invasive treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, a correct positioning of such devices can be challenging due to varying vessel diameters as well as the complex anatomy of the neurovasculature. As a consequence, unsuccessful treatment outcomes are increasingly reported requiring an improvement of the understanding of stent-induced flow modification. Methods To evaluate the effect of different degrees of flow diverter stent malposition on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic changes, a controlled hemodynamic configuration was created using an idealized intracranial aneurysms model. Afterwards, four different treatment scenarios were reproduced comprising of 1) the ideal treatment, 2) an insufficient wall apposition in the region of the ostium, 3) a distorted device migrating into the aneurysm sac and 4) an inaccurately deployed stent due to wrong release location. For the assessment of the individual flow modifications, high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were carried out. Results The analysis of the precise in-vitro PIV measurements reveals that in all cases a considerable reduction of the cycle-averaged and peak-systolic velocity was obtained. Compared to the untreated aneurysm configuration, the flow reduction ranged from 63% (scenario 4) up to 89% (scenario 3). The ideal treatment reached a reduction of 78%, which is known to be sufficient for a successful therapy. However, inaccurate device positioning leads to increased oscillating flow towards the lateral directions reducing the chances of sufficient thrombus formation. Conclusions High-resolution in-vitro PIV measurements enable an accurate quantification of the treatment efficacy for flow-diverting devices. Furthermore, insufficient treatment outcomes can be reproduces allowing for an assessment of intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic changes."
https://openalex.org/W4214928566,"Direct reciprocity plays an essential role in forming cooperative relationships. Direct reciprocity requires individuals to keep track of past interactions and condition their behavior on the previous behavior of their partners. In controlled experimental situations, it is known that children establish direct reciprocity according to the partner’s behavior, but this has not been verified in real life. This study aims to identify the establishment of short-term direct reciprocity in response to peers’ behaviors among Japanese preschoolers aged 5 and 6. It employs naturalistic observation at a nursery school. In addition, the psychological process for direct reciprocity was examined. The findings demonstrated that after receiving prosocial behavior, the recipient child returned the prosocial behavior more frequently within 7 minutes, compared with control situations; this suggests that 5-to 6-year-olds formed direct reciprocity in the short term when interacting with their peers. Additionally, recipient children tended to display affiliative behavior after receiving prosocial behavior. Positive emotions toward initiating children may have been caused by receiving prosocial behavior, and this psychological change modified short-term direct reciprocity."
https://openalex.org/W4214930198,"Background Globally, the burden of overweight and obesity is a major cardiovascular disease risk factor and is even higher among patients with psychiatric disorders compared to the general population. This is mainly due to the deleterious lifestyles characterized by physical inactivity, excessive substance use, and unhealthy diets common among patients with psychiatric disorders, as well as the negative metabolic effects of psychotropic medications. Despite these conditions being a high burden among patients with psychiatric illness, little attention is given to them during routine reviews in psychiatric clinics in most African nations, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate and compare the prevalence of and associated risk factors for overweight and obesity among patients with psychiatric illnesses. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted between severely ill psychiatric patients and non-psychiatric patients in Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. The study included 192 study participants (96 psychiatric patients and 96 non-psychiatric controls). Weight and height were measured for 192 study participants. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of psychiatric and non-psychiatric patients were described. The data were cleaned and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Version 21. The intergroup comparisons were performed using an independent sample t-test and Chi-square tests. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between overweight/obesity and the associated variables. Results The magnitude of overweight/obesity was significantly higher in the severely ill psychiatric groups (43.8%) than in the non-exposed controls (20.80%). The prevalence of overweight/obesity was highest in major depressive disorders (40%), followed by schizophrenia (32%), and bipolar disorder (28%). Conclusions There was a high prevalence of obesity/overweight among psychiatric patients. Educational status, unemployment, and late stages of the disease were significant predictors of overweight/ obesity. Clinicians should be aware of the health consequences of overweight/obesity, and considering screening strategies as a part of routine psychiatric care is strongly recommended."

Geospatial information in combination with agricultural-relevant information is a great source of knowledge for farmers. Including maps in collaborative mobile agriculture applications benefits communication processes related to agricultural-relevant questions. Ensuring a positive user experience with map interfaces depends on their design. To develop design guidelines for map-oriented mobile agricultural applications, this study evaluates 24 different map design variations (varying in their elements and degrees of complexity) and characterizes their user experience with 72 coffee farmers as study participants. Our findings show that the most crucial factors for a positive user experience were restricted interactivity, simple tasks to conduct (selecting single point features), and a simplified base map style, highlighting relevant landmarks. Since our farmers consisted primarily of less-experienced smartphone and map users, our findings may also be helpful for users in general, sharing similar user characteristics. While empirical, in-situ studies pose many challenges, they provide relevant insights into the real use situation and user behavior of mobile map applications. Our findings help establish some basic principles for designing map adaptations, serving as a guideline for creating effective mapping applications, which adapt to the farmers' contextual factors. Based on our study results, we suggest future research for continuing conceptualizing principles of map design adaptation and support this effort through empirical, in-situ studies for relating contextual user factors to the adaptation behavior of map applications."

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs; mg/L) of antimicrobials were determined using Etest on gonococcal isolates collected during January 1, 2017-August 30, 2020 at Hamad Medical Corporation, a national public healthcare provider. During 2017–2020, resistance in isolates from urogenital sites of 433 patients was 64.7% (95% CI: 59.5–69.6%; range: 43.9–78.7%) for ciprofloxacin, 50.7% (95% CI: 45.3–56.1%; range: 41.3–70.4%) for tetracycline, and 30.8% (95% CI: 26.3–35.6%; range: 26.7–35.8%) for benzylpenicillin. Percentage of isolates non-susceptible to azithromycin was 4.1% (95% CI: 2.0–7.4%; range: 2.7–4.8%) and all (100%) isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Two (1.6%) isolates from 2019 and one (2.2%) isolate from 2020 had high-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC≥256 mg/L). Overall, 1.0% (4/418) of isolates had a ceftriaxone MIC of 0.25 mg/L, which is at the ceftriaxone susceptibility breakpoint (MIC≤0.25 mg/L).

https://openalex.org/W4220748185,"Identifying mechanisms able to sustain costly cooperation among self-interested agents is a central problem across social and biological sciences. One possible solution is peer punishment: when agents have an opportunity to sanction defectors, classical behavioral experiments suggest that cooperation can take root. Overlooked from standard experimental designs, however, is the fact that real-world human punishment-the administration of justice-is intrinsically noisy. Here we show that stochastic punishment falls short of sustaining cooperation in the repeated public good game. As punishment noise increases, we find that contributions decrease and punishment efforts intensify, resulting in a 45% drop in gains compared to a noiseless control. Moreover, we observe that uncertainty causes a rise in antisocial punishment, a mutually harmful behavior previously associated with societies with a weak rule of law. Our approach brings to light challenges to cooperation that cannot be explained by economic rationality and strengthens the case for further investigations of the effect of noise-and not just bias-on human behavior."

Nevertheless, to date, multiple clinical studies and meta-analyses found inconsistent results of their anti-cancer effects. This study aims to evaluate the credibility of the published systematic reviews and meta-analyses that assessed the effects of statin exposure for the incidence and mortality of urologic cancers through an umbrella review.The guidance of overviews of systematic reviews reported in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions will be followed while performing and reporting this umbrella review. This project was registered in PROSPERO with the registration number of CRD42020208854. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library will be searched for systematic reviews to identify and appraise systematic reviews or meta-analyses of interventional and observational studies examining statin use and the risks of urologic cancer incidence and mortality without language restriction. The search will be carried out on 10 February 2022. Systematic reviews based on qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods studies will be involved and critically evaluated by two authors using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2, an updated version of AMSTAR) tool. We will determine the level of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) tool. The summary effect estimates will be calculated using random-effects models. Between- study heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic. Furthermore, we will also assess the evidence of excess significance bias and evidence of small study effects.Ethics approval is not required as we will search and gather data based on the published systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Primary outcome was acute hospitalization; secondary outcomes included long-term care (LTC) entry and mortality. The relationship between frailty and outcomes were explored with multivariable Cox regression, estimating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).Over mean follow-up of 2.5 years, 33% (69/209) of fit, 58% (152/260) mildly frail and 79% (85/108) moderate-severely frail participants at baseline had at least one acute hospitalization. Compared to the fit group, significantly increased risk of acute hospitalization were identified in mildly frail (adjusted HR = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.41-2.51, p<0.001) and moderate-severely frail (adjusted HR = 3.52, 95%CI = 2.53-4.90, p<0.001) groups. Similar increased risk in moderate-severely frail participants was seen in LTC entry (adjusted HR = 5.60 95%CI = 2.47-12.72, p<0.001) and mortality (adjusted HR = 5.06, 95%CI = 1.71-15.02, p = 0.003).The FI derived from interRAI-CHA has robust predictive validity for acute hospitalization, LTC entry and mortality.

https://openalex.org/W4214892929,"Cash transfers have been shown to improve birth outcomes by improving maternal nutrition, increasing healthcare use, and reducing stress. Most of the evidence focuses on programs targeting the poorest in the US-a context with non-universal access to healthcare and strong health inequalities. It is thus unclear whether these results would apply to cash transfers targeting a less disadvantaged population and whether they apply to other contexts. We provide evidence on the impact of unemployment benefits on birth outcomes in Switzerland, where access to healthcare is near-universal and social assistance is relatively generous. Our study taps into a policy reform that reduced unemployment benefits by 56%. We use linked parent-child register data and difference-in-differences estimates as well as within sibling comparisons. We find that the reform did not impact birth outcomes when fathers were unemployed but reduced the birthweight of children when mothers were unemployed by 80g and body length by 6mm. There are stronger effects for children whose mothers were the primary earner before job loss, but effects do not differ systematically by household income. These results suggest that in the Swiss context, unemployment benefits improve birth outcomes by reducing (job search) stress rather than by improving nutrition or healthcare use. As such, cash transfers likely play a role for newborn health in most other contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4214899176,"The postoperative imaging assessment of Cochlear Implant (CI) patients is imperative. The main obstacle is that Magnetic Resonance imaging (MR) is contraindicated or hindered by significant artefacts in most cases with CIs. This study describes an automatic cochlear image registration and fusion method that aims to help radiologists and surgeons to process pre-and postoperative 3D multimodal imaging studies in cochlear implant (CI) patients.We propose a new registration method, Automatic Cochlea Image Registration (ACIR-v3), which uses a stochastic quasi-Newton optimiser with a mutual information metric to find 3D rigid transform parameters for registration of preoperative and postoperative CI imaging. The method was tested against a clinical cochlear imaging dataset that contains 131 multimodal 3D imaging studies of 41 CI patients with preoperative and postoperative images. The preoperative images were MR, Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) or Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) while the postoperative were CBCT. The average root mean squared error of ACIR-v3 method was 0.41 mm with a standard deviation of 0.39 mm. The results were evaluated quantitatively using the mean squared error of two 3D landmarks located manually by two neuroradiology experts in each image and compared to other previously known registration methods, e.g. Fast Preconditioner Stochastic Gradient Descent, in terms of accuracy and speed.Our method, ACIR-v3, produces high resolution images in the postoperative stage and allows for visualisation of the accurate anatomical details of the MRI with the absence of significant metallic artefacts. The method is implemented as an open-source plugin for 3D Slicer tool."

https://openalex.org/W4214910577,"Globally, tobacco consumption continues to cause a considerable burden of preventable diseases. Although the smoking prevalence in Nigeria may be declining over the last years, the absolute number of active smokers remains one of the highest in Africa. Little is known about the disease burden and economic costs of cigarette smoking in Nigeria. Consequently, there is an evidence gap to inform the design and implementation of an effective policy for tobacco control.We applied a microsimulation model to estimate the burden attributable to smoking in terms of morbidity, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and direct medical costs and indirect costs (e.g., productivity loss costs, informal caregivers' costs). We also modeled the health and economic impact of different scenarios of tobacco price increases through taxes.We estimated that smoking is responsible for approximately 29,000 annual deaths in Nigeria. This burden corresponds to 816,230 DALYs per year. In 2019, the total economic burden attributable to tobacco was estimated at ₦ 634 billion annually (approximately U$D 2.07 billion). If tobacco cigarettes' prices were to be raised by 50% through taxes, more than 30,000 deaths from smoking-attributable diseases would be averted in 10 years, with subsequent savings on direct and indirect costs of ₦597 billion and increased tax revenue collection of ₦369 billion.In Nigeria, tobacco is responsible for substantial health and economic burden. Increasing tobacco taxes could reduce this burden and produce net economic benefits."

A revision of the genus is presented, including analysis of the type material of M. minuta (Hartman, 1965) and M. apalpata Jumars, 1974, as well as specimens collected from shelf and slope continental areas in Brazil. A neotype was designated for M. minuta and its distribution was extended to Brazil. The identity of M. chilensis (Hartmann-Schröder, 1965) is questioned and three new species from 21 to 1,300.7 meters depth are also described. Meiodorvillea penhae sp. nov. has furcate chaeta only in the first anterior chaetigers. In contrast, Meiodorvillea hartmanae sp. nov. has very small palps and asymmetrical thin furcate chaeta and Meiodorvillea jumarsi sp. nov. has dorsal cirri and geniculate chaeta only in the first anterior chaetigers."
https://openalex.org/W4214919972,"Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI is frequently compromised by transient severe motion artifacts (TSM) in the arterial phase, which limits image interpretation for the detection and differentiation of focal liver lesions and for the recognition of the arterial vasculature before and after liver transplantation. The purpose of this study was to investigate which patient factors affect TSM in children who undergo Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI and whether younger children are affected as much as adolescents.One hundred and forty-eight patients (65 female, 83 male, 0.1-18.9 years old), who underwent 226 Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRIs were included retrospectively in this single-center study. The occurrence of TSM was assessed by three readers using a four-point Likert scale. The relation to age, gender, body mass index, indication for MRI, requirement for sedation, and MR repetition was investigated using uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis.In Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRIs, TSM occurred in 24 examinations (10.6%). Patients with TSM were significantly older than patients without TSM (median 14.3 years; range 10.1-18.1 vs. 12.4 years; range 0.1-18.9, p<0.001). TSM never appeared under sedation. Thirty of 50 scans in patients younger than 10 years were without sedation. TSM were not observed in non-sedated patients younger than 10 years of age (p = 0.028). In a logistic regression analysis, age remained the only cofactor independently associated with the occurrence of TSM (hazard ratio 9.152, p = 0.049).TSM in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI do not appear in children under the age of 10 years."
https://openalex.org/W4214933192,"The aim of the present study was to determine associations between biological and behavioral factors in early life and food consumption in Brazilian adolescents. The sample was composed of 36,956 adolescents (12–17 years of age) who participated in the “Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents”. Sociodemographic, biological, and behavioral variables were collected using questionnaires self-administered by the adolescents. Early-life factors were assessed using a questionnaire administered to the parents/guardians of the adolescents. Dependent variables related to food consumption (total energy intake and percentages of macronutrient intake [carbohydrates, lipids and proteins]) were measured using the 24-hour recall method and compared to dietary reference intakes. Data analysis was performed with the aid of STATA 14.0, using multiple linear regression analysis with respective β coefficients. The level of significance was set at 5% (p ≤ 0.05). Adolescents born with low weight had lower energy intake (-94.8 kcal, 95%CI: -177.2; -12.3, p = 0.024) and 1.25% higher carbohydrate intake (95%CI: 0.15; 2.34, p = 0.025) compared to those born with adequate weight. Those who received exclusive breast breastfeeding for three to six months ingested 1.32% more lipids than those who received exclusive breast breastfeeding for less than three months (95%CI: 0.37; 2.26, p = 0.006). In conclusion, low birth weight was associated with lower energy intake and a higher percentage of carbohydrate intake, whereas breastfeeding three to six months was associated with a higher percentage of lipid intake."
