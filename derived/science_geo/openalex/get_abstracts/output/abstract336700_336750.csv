https://openalex.org/W1969431166,"A device that provides an electric shock makes it possible to collect pure venom from several thousand honey bees (Apis mellifera). The collection apparatus fits underneath the brood chamber of a colony of bees and may be moved from hive to hive. Each colony is ""milked"" for 5 minutes. An average of 20 hives must be ""milked"" to obtain 1 gram of venom. Under optimum conditions this quantity of venom is produced by 10,000 worker bees."

Quenstedt's muscles are proposed as a name for the small modified, one-time pedal muscles of unknown function, discovered by Quenstedt."

https://openalex.org/W1964920440,"A straight-chain alkylben-zene sulfonate was 90 to 95 percent biologically degraded in a laboratory bench-scale septic tank and drain field. Under the same conditions, only about 35 percent of a highly branched alkylbenzene sulfonate was degraded."

https://openalex.org/W2012830733,Purified hiydrogen is obtained by impressing a potential gradient across a cell containintg two efficient electrodes separated by a barrier electrolyte phase and passing an impure hydrogen stream into the anode compartment. Power requirements are low and can be controlled through thle resistance of the electrolyte. The technique can also be used for pumping and accurate metering.
https://openalex.org/W1992718863,"A wide variety of instruments are available for measuring both the total pressure and the partial pressures of gases present in vacuum systems. Vacuum gages serve many purposes; some of them merely measure the range of the gas density. If it is desired to know the gas density within 5 percent or better, many details concerning ion gage calibration must be given careful consideration. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2090510111,"The path is a long one between the conception of a scientific instrument for space exploration and the goal of obtaining scientific measurements from space, from the moon, or from the atmosphere or the surface of a planet. These instruments must be designed to meet the scientific objectives under adverse environmental conditions and within the constraints of a complex spacecraft system. The limitations of weight, power, telemetry, integnation, and reliability must be assessed and appropriately dealt with in the design, development, fabrication, testing, and calibration of the instrument. The instrument must operate satisfactorily in a vacuum-thermal environment for long periods after having been subjected to extreme shock and vibration during the launch amd injection sequences. To successfully fly a scientific instrument in space is an achievement involving a considerable number of man-years and dollars. Such an effort and expenditure of funds must be properly compensated through the attainment of scientific information. If billions of dollars are to be expended on the exploration of interplanetary space and of the moon and the planets, every possible effort must be made to see that this money is profitably spent.
