https://openalex.org/W1993211211,"MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK2 are critical signalling mediators of the TLR/IL1-R superfamily. Here we report the crystal structure of the MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 death domain (DD) complex, which surprisingly reveals a left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4 and 4 IRAK2 DDs. Assembly of this helical signalling tower is hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of these Myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites are required for recruitment of the individual DDs in the complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified signalling mutations. Specificities in Myddosome formation are dictated by both molecular complementarity and correspondence of surface electrostatics. The MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 complex provides a template for Toll signalling in Drosophila and an elegant mechanism for versatile assembly and regulation of DD complexes in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2133706686,"An open chromatin architecture devoid of compact chromatin is thought to be associated with pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. Establishing this distinct epigenetic state may also be required for somatic cell reprogramming. However, there has been little direct examination of global structural domains of chromatin during the founding and loss of pluripotency that occurs in preimplantation mouse development. Here, we used electron spectroscopic imaging to examine large-scale chromatin structural changes during the transition from one-cell to early postimplantation stage embryos. In one-cell embryos chromatin was extensively dispersed with no noticeable accumulation at the nuclear envelope. Major changes were observed from one-cell to two-cell stage embryos, where chromatin became confined to discrete blocks of compaction and with an increased concentration at the nuclear envelope. In eight-cell embryos and pluripotent epiblast cells, chromatin was primarily distributed as an extended meshwork of uncompacted fibres and was indistinguishable from chromatin organization in embryonic stem cells. In contrast, lineage-committed trophectoderm and primitive endoderm cells, and the stem cell lines derived from these tissues, displayed higher levels of chromatin compaction, suggesting an association between developmental potential and chromatin organisation. We examined this association in vivo and found that deletion of Oct4, a factor required for pluripotency, caused the formation of large blocks of compact chromatin in putative epiblast cells. Together, these studies show that an open chromatin architecture is established in the embryonic lineages during development and is sufficient to distinguish pluripotent cells from tissue-restricted progenitor cells."

In the absence of exogenous insulin, patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit a variety of metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia, glycosurea, accelerated ketogenesis, and muscle wasting due to increased proteolysis. We analyzed plasma from type 1 diabetic (T1D) humans during insulin treatment (I+) and acute insulin deprivation (I-) and non-diabetic participants (ND) by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The aim was to determine if this combination of analytical methods could provide information on metabolic pathways known to be altered by insulin deficiency. Multivariate statistics differentiated proton spectra from I- and I+ based on several derived plasma metabolites that were elevated during insulin deprivation (lactate, acetate, allantoin, ketones). Mass spectrometry revealed significant perturbations in levels of plasma amino acids and amino acid metabolites during insulin deprivation. Further analysis of metabolite levels measured by the two analytical techniques indicates several known metabolic pathways that are perturbed in T1D (I-) (protein synthesis and breakdown, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, amino acid oxidation, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and oxidative stress). This work demonstrates the promise of combining multiple analytical methods with advanced statistical methods in quantitative metabolomics research, which we have applied to the clinical situation of acute insulin deprivation in T1D to reflect the numerous metabolic pathways known to be affected by insulin deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W1996234606,"The molecular mechanisms underlying microtubule participation in autophagy are not known. In this study, we show that starvation-induced autophagosome formation requires the most dynamic microtubule subset. Upon nutrient deprivation, labile microtubules specifically recruit markers of autophagosome formation like class III-phosphatidylinositol kinase, WIPI-1, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, and LC3-I, whereas mature autophagosomes may bind to stable microtubules. We further found that upon nutrient deprivation, tubulin acetylation increases both in labile and stable microtubules and is required to allow autophagy stimulation. Tubulin hyperacetylation on lysine 40 enhances kinesin-1 and JIP-1 recruitment on microtubules and allows JNK phosphorylation and activation. JNK, in turn, triggers the release of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2-Beclin 1 complexes and its recruitment on microtubules where it may initiate autophagosome formation. Finally, although kinesin-1 functions to carry autophagosomes in basal conditions, it is not involved in motoring autophagosomes after nutrient deprivation. Our results show that the dynamics of microtubules and tubulin post-translational modifications play a major role in the regulation of starvation-induced autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W1991393609,"Type II topoisomerases are required for the management of DNA tangles and supercoils, and are targets of clinical antibiotics and anti-cancer agents. These enzymes catalyse the ATP-dependent passage of one DNA duplex (the transport or T-segment) through a transient, double-stranded break in another (the gate or G-segment), navigating DNA through the protein using a set of dissociable internal interfaces, or 'gates'. For more than 20 years, it has been established that a pair of dimer-related tyrosines, together with divalent cations, catalyse G-segment cleavage. Recent efforts have proposed that strand scission relies on a 'two-metal mechanism', a ubiquitous biochemical strategy that supports vital cellular processes ranging from DNA synthesis to RNA self-splicing. Here we present the structure of the DNA-binding and cleavage core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II covalently linked to DNA through its active-site tyrosine at 2.5A resolution, revealing for the first time the organization of a cleavage-competent type II topoisomerase configuration. Unexpectedly, metal-soaking experiments indicate that cleavage is catalysed by a novel variation of the classic two-metal approach. Comparative analyses extend this scheme to explain how distantly-related type IA topoisomerases cleave single-stranded DNA, unifying the cleavage mechanisms for these two essential enzyme families. The structure also highlights a hitherto undiscovered allosteric relay that actuates a molecular 'trapdoor' to prevent subunit dissociation during cleavage. This connection illustrates how an indispensable chromosome-disentangling machine auto-regulates DNA breakage to prevent the aberrant formation of mutagenic and cytotoxic genomic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1982538300,"Background ETS transcription factors regulate important signaling pathways involved in cell differentiation and development in many tissues and have emerged as important players in prostate cancer. However, the biological impact of ETS factors in prostate tumorigenesis is still debated. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed an analysis of the ETS gene family using microarray data and real-time PCR in normal and tumor tissues along with functional studies in normal and cancer cell lines to understand the impact in prostate tumorigenesis and identify key targets of these transcription factors. We found frequent dysregulation of ETS genes with oncogenic (i.e., ERG and ESE1) and tumor suppressor (i.e., ESE3) properties in prostate tumors compared to normal prostate. Tumor subgroups (i.e., ERGhigh, ESE1high, ESE3low and NoETS tumors) were identified on the basis of their ETS expression status and showed distinct transcriptional and biological features. ERGhigh and ESE3low tumors had the most robust gene signatures with both distinct and overlapping features. Integrating genomic data with functional studies in multiple cell lines, we demonstrated that ERG and ESE3 controlled in opposite direction transcription of the Polycomb Group protein EZH2, a key gene in development, differentiation, stem cell biology and tumorigenesis. We further demonstrated that the prostate-specific tumor suppressor gene Nkx3.1 was controlled by ERG and ESE3 both directly and through induction of EZH2. Conclusions/Significance These findings provide new insights into the role of the ETS transcriptional network in prostate tumorigenesis and uncover previously unrecognized links between aberrant expression of ETS factors, deregulation of epigenetic effectors and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The link between aberrant ETS activity and epigenetic gene silencing may be relevant for the clinical management of prostate cancer and design of new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2032080482,"BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1) is a membrane-tethered member of the aspartyl proteases, essential for the production of beta-amyloid, a toxic peptide that accumulates in the brain of subjects affected by Alzheimer disease. The BACE1 C-terminal fragment contains a DXXLL motif that has been shown to bind the VHS (VPS27, Hrs, and STAM) domain of GGA1-3 (Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ARF-binding proteins). GGAs are trafficking molecules involved in the transport of proteins containing the DXXLL signal from the Golgi complex to endosomes. Moreover, GGAs bind ubiquitin and traffic synthetic and endosomal ubiquitinated cargoes to lysosomes. We have previously shown that depletion of GGA3 results in increased BACE1 levels and activity because of impaired lysosomal degradation. Here, we report that the accumulation of BACE1 is rescued by the ectopic expression of GGA3 in H4 neuroglioma cells depleted of GGA3. Accordingly, the overexpression of GGA3 reduces the levels of BACE1 and beta-amyloid. We then established that mutations in the GGA3 VPS27, Hrs, and STAM domain (N91A) or in BACE1 di-leucine motif (L499A/L500A), able to abrogate their binding, did not affect the ability of ectopically expressed GGA3 to rescue BACE1 accumulation in cells depleted of GGA3. Instead, we found that BACE1 is ubiquitinated at lysine 501 and is mainly monoubiquitinated and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitinated. Finally, a GGA3 mutant with reduced ability to bind ubiquitin (GGA3L276A) was unable to regulate BACE1 levels both in rescue and overexpression experiments. These findings indicate that levels of GGA3 tightly and inversely regulate BACE1 levels via interaction with ubiquitin sorting machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2079290839,"As we know from modern species, nursery areas are essential shark habitats for vulnerable young. Nurseries are typically highly productive, shallow-water habitats that are characterized by the presence of juveniles and neonates. It has been suggested that in these areas, sharks can find ample food resources and protection from predators. Based on the fossil record, we know that the extinct Carcharocles megalodon was the biggest shark that ever lived. Previous proposed paleo-nursery areas for this species were based on the anecdotal presence of juvenile fossil teeth accompanied by fossil marine mammals. We now present the first definitive evidence of ancient nurseries for C. megalodon from the late Miocene of Panama, about 10 million years ago.We collected and measured fossil shark teeth of C. megalodon, within the highly productive, shallow marine Gatun Formation from the Miocene of Panama. Surprisingly, and in contrast to other fossil accumulations, the majority of the teeth from Gatun are very small. Here we compare the tooth sizes from the Gatun with specimens from different, but analogous localities. In addition we calculate the total length of the individuals found in Gatun. These comparisons and estimates suggest that the small size of Gatun's C. megalodon is neither related to a small population of this species nor the tooth position within the jaw. Thus, the individuals from Gatun were mostly juveniles and neonates, with estimated body lengths between 2 and 10.5 meters.We propose that the Miocene Gatun Formation represents the first documented paleo-nursery area for C. megalodon from the Neotropics, and one of the few recorded in the fossil record for an extinct selachian. We therefore show that sharks have used nursery areas at least for 10 millions of years as an adaptive strategy during their life histories."
https://openalex.org/W2018017154,"Progranulin deficiency is thought to cause some forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a major early-onset age-dependent neurodegenerative disease. How progranulin (PGRN) expression is regulated is largely unknown. We identified an evolutionarily conserved binding site for microRNA-29b (miR-29b) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the human PGRN (hPGRN) mRNA. miR-29b downregulates the expression of luciferase through hPGRN or mouse PGRN (mPGRN) 3'UTRs, and the regulation was abolished by mutations in the miR-29b binding site. To examine the direct effect of manipulating endogenous miR-29b on hPGRN expression, we established a stable NIH3T3 cell line that expresses hPGRN under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Ectopic expression of miR-29b decreased hPGRN expression at the both mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-29b with locked nucleic acid increased the production and secretion of hPGRN in NIH3T3 cells. Endogenous hPGRN in HEK 293 cells was also regulated by miR-29b. These findings identify miR-29b as a novel posttranscriptional regulator of PGRN expression, raising the possibility that miR-29b or other miRNAs might be targeted therapeutically to increase hPGRN levels in some FTD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2038969444,"To identify and functionally annotate cell type-specific gene expression in the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a key tissue involved in age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa.RPE, photoreceptor and choroidal cells were isolated from selected freshly frozen healthy human donor eyes using laser microdissection. RNA isolation, amplification and hybridization to 44 k microarrays was carried out according to Agilent specifications. Bioinformatics was carried out using Rosetta Resolver, David and Ingenuity software.Our previous 22 k analysis of the RPE transcriptome showed that the RPE has high levels of protein synthesis, strong energy demands, is exposed to high levels of oxidative stress and a variable degree of inflammation. We currently use a complementary new strategy aimed at the identification and functional annotation of RPE-specific expressed transcripts. This strategy takes advantage of the multilayered cellular structure of the retina and overcomes a number of limitations of previous studies. In triplicate, we compared the transcriptomes of RPE, photoreceptor and choroidal cells and we deduced RPE specific expression. We identified at least 114 entries with RPE-specific gene expression. Thirty-nine of these 114 genes also show high expression in the RPE, comparison with the literature showed that 85% of these 39 were previously identified to be expressed in the RPE. In the group of 114 RPE specific genes there was an overrepresentation of genes involved in (membrane) transport, vision and ophthalmic disease. More fundamentally, we found RPE-specific involvement in the RAR-activation, retinol metabolism and GABA receptor signaling pathways.In this study we provide a further specification and understanding of the RPE transcriptome by identifying and analyzing genes that are specifically expressed in the RPE."
https://openalex.org/W1964845760,"The tumor suppressor p53 protein is tightly regulated by a ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation mechanism. Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, including MDM2 (mouse double minute 2), have been reported to play an essential role in the regulation of p53 stability. However, it remains unclear how the activity of these E3 ligases is regulated. Here, we show that the HECT-type E3 ligase Smurf1/2 (Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1/2) promotes p53 degradation by enhancing the activity of the E3 ligase MDM2. We provide evidence that the role of Smurf1/2 on the p53 stability is not dependent on the E3 activity of Smurf1/2 but rather is dependent on the activity of MDM2. We find that Smurf1/2 stabilizes MDM2 by enhancing the heterodimerization of MDM2 with MDMX, during which Smurf1/2 interacts with MDM2 and MDMX. We finally provide evidence that Smurf1/2 regulates apoptosis through p53. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that Smurf1/2 functions as a factor to stabilize MDM2 protein rather than as a direct E3 ligase in regulation of p53 degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2041244144,"Background Many cave-dwelling animal species display similar morphologies (troglomorphism) that have evolved convergent within and among lineages under the similar selective pressures imposed by cave habitats. Here we study such ecomorphological evolution in cave-dwelling Sclerobuninae harvestmen (Opiliones) from the western United States, providing general insights into morphological homoplasy, rates of morphological change, and the temporal context of cave evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings We gathered DNA sequence data from three independent gene regions, and combined these data with Bayesian hypothesis testing, morphometrics analysis, study of penis morphology, and relaxed molecular clock analyses. Using multivariate morphometric analysis, we find that phylogenetically unrelated taxa have convergently evolved troglomorphism; alternative phylogenetic hypotheses involving less morphological convergence are not supported by Bayesian hypothesis testing. In one instance, this morphology is found in specimens from a high-elevation stony debris habitat, suggesting that troglomorphism can evolve in non-cave habitats. We discovered a strong positive relationship between troglomorphy index and relative divergence time, making it possible to predict taxon age from morphology. Most of our time estimates for the origin of highly-troglomorphic cave forms predate the Pleistocene. Conclusions/Significance While several regions in the eastern and central United States are well-known hotspots for cave evolution, few modern phylogenetic studies have addressed the evolution of cave-obligate species in the western United States. Our integrative studies reveal the recurrent evolution of troglomorphism in a perhaps unexpected geographic region, at surprisingly deep time depths, and in sometimes surprising habitats. Because some newly discovered troglomorphic populations represent undescribed species, our findings stress the need for further biological exploration, integrative systematic research, and conservation efforts in western US cave habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2086923132,"Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive decline in cognitive functions and the deposition of aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) into senile plaques and the protein tau into tangles. In addition, a general state of oxidation has long been known to be a major hallmark of the disease. What is not known however, are the mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to the pathology of AD. Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study, we used a mouse model of AD and genetically boosted its ability to quench free radicals of specific mitochondrial origin. We found that such manipulation conferred to the AD mice protection against vascular as well as neuronal deficits that typically affect them. We also found that the vascular deficits are improved via antioxidant modulation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme primarily responsible for the production of nitric oxide, while neuronal deficits are improved via modulation of the phosphorylation status of the protein tau, which is a neuronal cytoskeletal stabilizer. Conclusions/Significance These findings directly link free radicals of specific mitochondrial origin to AD-associated vascular and neuronal pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2004753542,"The focal adhesion protein vinculin is an actin-binding protein involved in the mechanical coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. An autoinhibitory interaction between the N-terminal head (Vh) and the C-terminal tail (Vt) of vinculin masks an actin filament side-binding domain in Vt. The binding of several proteins to Vh disrupts this intramolecular interaction and exposes the actin filament side-binding domain. Here, by combining kinetic assays and microscopy observations, we show that Vt inhibits actin polymerization by blocking the barbed ends of actin filaments. In low salt conditions, Vt nucleates actin filaments capped at their barbed ends. We determined that the interaction between vinculin and the barbed end is characterized by slow association and dissociation rate constants. This barbed end capping activity requires C-terminal amino acids of Vt that are dispensable for actin filament side binding. Like the side-binding domain, the capping domain of vinculin is masked by an autoinhibitory interaction between Vh and Vt. In contrast to the side-binding domain, the capping domain is not unmasked by the binding of a talin domain to Vh and requires the dissociation of an additional autoinhibitory interaction. Finally, we show that vinculin and the formin mDia1, which is involved in the processive elongation of actin filaments in focal adhesions, compete for actin filament barbed ends."
https://openalex.org/W2015422863,"Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a Ca2+ sensor protein that has been implicated in the regulation of various aspects of neuronal development and neurotransmission. It exerts its effects through interactions with a range of target proteins one of which is interleukin receptor accessory protein like-1 (IL1RAPL1) protein. Mutations in IL1RAPL1 have recently been associated with autism spectrum disorders and a missense mutation (R102Q) on NCS-1 has been found in one individual with autism. We have examined the effect of this mutation on the structure and function of NCS-1. From use of NMR spectroscopy, it appeared that the R102Q affected the structure of the protein particularly with an increase in the extent of conformational exchange in the C-terminus of the protein. Despite this change NCS-1(R102Q) did not show changes in its affinity for Ca2+ or binding to IL1RAPL1 and its intracellular localisation was unaffected. Assessment of NCS-1 dynamics indicated that it could rapidly cycle between cytosolic and membrane pools and that the cycling onto the plasma membrane was specifically changed in NCS-1(R102Q) with the loss of a Ca2+ -dependent component. From these data we speculate that impairment of the normal cycling of NCS-1 by the R102Q mutation could have subtle effects on neuronal signalling and physiology in the developing and adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2115625797,"An effective therapeutic vaccine that could augment immune control of HIV-1 replication may abrogate or delay the need for antiretroviral therapy. AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5187 was a phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 DNA vaccine (VRC-HVDNA 009-00-VP) in subjects treated with antiretroviral therapy during acute/early HIV-1 infection. (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00125099)Twenty healthy HIV-1 infected subjects who were treated with antiretroviral therapy during acute/early HIV-1 infection and had HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/mL were randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Following vaccination, subjects interrupted antiretroviral treatment, and set-point HIV-1 viral loads and CD4 T cell counts were determined 17-23 weeks after treatment discontinuation.Twenty subjects received all scheduled vaccinations and discontinued antiretroviral therapy at week 30. No subject met a primary safety endpoint. No evidence of differences in immunogenicity were detected in subjects receiving vaccine versus placebo. There were also no significant differences in set-point HIV-1 viral loads or CD4 T cell counts following treatment discontinuation. Median set-point HIV-1 viral loads after treatment discontinuation in vaccine and placebo recipients were 3.5 and 3.7 log(10) HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, respectively.The HIV-1 DNA vaccine (VRC-HIVDNA 009-00-VP) was safe but poorly immunogenic in subjects treated with antiretroviral therapy during acute/early HIV-1 infection. Viral set-points were similar between vaccine and placebo recipients following treatment interruption. However, median viral load set-points in both groups were lower than in historical controls, suggesting a possible role for antiretroviral therapy in persons with acute or early HIV-1 infection and supporting the safety of discontinuing treatment in this group.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00125099."
https://openalex.org/W2048664325,"The transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) induces the expression of antioxidant gene products that neutralize reactive oxygen species and restore redox homeostasis. Nrf2 is constitutively degraded by the ubiquitin proteolytic system in unperturbed cells, but this turnover is arrested in response to oxidative stress, thereby leading to Nrf2 accumulation. Yet, a mechanistic understanding of how Nrf2 stabilization and transcriptional activation are coupled remains to be determined. We have discovered that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcM2 is a novel regulator of Nrf2. Recombinant Nrf2 and UbcM2 form a complex upon alkylation of a non-catalytic cysteine in UbcM2, Cys-136. Substitution of this cysteine with a phenylalanine (C136F) to mimic cysteine oxidation/alkylation results in constitutive binding of UbcM2 to Nrf2 and an increased half-life of the transcription factor in vivo. We provide evidence that UbcM2 and Nrf2 form a nuclear complex utilizing the DNA binding, Neh1 domain, of Nrf2. Finally, we demonstrate that UbcM2 can enhance the transcriptional activity of endogenous Nrf2 and that Cys-136 and the active-site cysteine, Cys-145, jointly contribute to this regulation. Collectively, these data identify UbcM2 as a novel component of the Nrf2 regulatory circuit and position cysteine 136 as a putative redox sensor in this signaling pathway. This work implicates UbcM2 in the restoration of redox homeostasis following oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2163317698,"Here, we present a novel method for culturing kidneys in low volumes of medium that offers more organotypic development compared to conventional methods. Organ culture is a powerful technique for studying renal development. It recapitulates many aspects of early development very well, but the established techniques have some disadvantages: in particular, they require relatively large volumes (1–3 mls) of culture medium, which can make high-throughput screens expensive, they require porous (filter) substrates which are difficult to modify chemically, and the organs produced do not achieve good cortico-medullary zonation. Here, we present a technique of growing kidney rudiments in very low volumes of medium–around 85 microliters–using silicone chambers. In this system, kidneys grow directly on glass, grow larger than in conventional culture and develop a clear anatomical cortico-medullary zonation with extended loops of Henle."
https://openalex.org/W2155608634,"Background Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders continue to be a significant problem. In efforts to understand and alleviate neurocognitive deficits associated with HIV, we used an accelerated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model of NeuroAIDS to test whether minocycline is neuroprotective against lentiviral-induced neuronal injury. Methodology/Principal Findings Eleven rhesus macaques were infected with SIV, depleted of CD8+ lymphocytes, and studied until eight weeks post inoculation (wpi). Seven animals received daily minocycline orally beginning at 4 wpi. Neuronal integrity was monitored in vivo by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and post-mortem by immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin (SYN), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and neuronal counts. Astrogliosis and microglial activation were quantified by measuring glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1), respectively. SIV infection followed by CD8+ cell depletion induced a progressive decline in neuronal integrity evidenced by declining N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr), which was arrested with minocycline treatment. The recovery of this ratio was due to increases in NAA, indicating neuronal recovery, and decreases in Cr, likely reflecting downregulation of glial cell activation. SYN, MAP2, and neuronal counts were found to be higher in minocycline-treated animals compared to untreated animals while GFAP and IBA-1 expression were decreased compared to controls. CSF and plasma viral loads were lower in MN-treated animals. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, oral minocycline alleviates neuronal damage induced by the AIDS virus."
https://openalex.org/W2067266483,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is composed of a hypoxia-inducible α subunit (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) and a constitutively expressed β subunit (HIF-1β). HIF mediates the adaptation of cells and tissues to low oxygen concentrations. It also plays an important role in tumorigenesis and constitutes an important therapeutic target in anti-tumor therapy. We have screened a number of reported HIF inhibitors for their effects on HIF-transcriptional activity and found that the DNA damage inducing agents camptothecin and mitomycin C produced the most robust effects. Camptothecin is a reported inhibitor of HIF-1α translation, while mitomycin C has been reported to induce p53-dependent HIF-1α degradation. In this study we demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of mitomycin C on HIF-1α protein expression is not dependent on p53 and protein degradation, but also involves HIF-1α translational regulation. Initiation of a DNA damage response with the small molecule p53 activator NSC-652287 (RITA) has been reported to inhibit HIF-1α protein synthesis by increasing the phosphorylation of eIF2α. However, we show here that even when eIF2α phosphorylation is prevented, the DNA damage inducing drugs mitomycin C, camptothecin and NSC-652287 still inhibit HIF-1α protein synthesis to the same extent. The inhibitory effects of camptothecin on HIF-1α expression but not that of mitomycin C and NSC-652287 were dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase activity. In conclusion, specific types of DNA damage can bring about selective inhibition of HIF-1α protein synthesis. Further characterization of the involved mechanisms may reveal important novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2039898934,"High fish consumption and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake are suggested to benefit mental well-being but the current evidence is conflicting. Our aim was to evaluate whether a higher level of fish consumption, a higher intake of omega-3 PUFAs, and a higher serum concentration of omega-3 PUFAs link to a lower 12-month prevalence of depressive episodes.We used data from the nationwide Health 2000 Survey (n = 5492) and the Fishermen Study on Finnish professional fishermen and their family members (n = 1265). Data were based on questionnaires, interviews, health examinations, and blood samples. Depressive episodes were assessed with the M-CIDI (the Munich version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and a self-report of two CIDI probe questions, respectively. Fish consumption was measured by a food frequency questionnaire (g/day) and independent frequency questions (times/month). Dietary intake (g/day) and serum concentrations (% from fatty acids) of PUFAs were determined. Fish consumption was associated with prevalence of depressive episodes in men but not in women. The prevalence of depressive episodes decreased from 9% to 5% across the quartiles of fish consumption (g/day) in men of the Health 2000 Survey (p for linear trend = 0.01), and from17% to 3% across the quartiles of fish consumption (times/month) in men of the Fishermen Study (p for linear trend = 0.05). This association was modified by lifestyle; in the Health 2000 Survey a higher level of fish consumption was related to a lower prevalence of depressive episodes in men who consumed the most alcohol, were occasional or former smokers, or had intermediate physical activity. The associations between depressive episodes and the intake or serum concentrations of omega-3 PUFAs were not consistent.In men, fish consumption appears as a surrogate for underlying but unidentified lifestyle factors that protect against depression."
https://openalex.org/W2159728216,"Two soluble forms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, sVEGFR-1 and sVEGFR-2, are physiologically released and overproduced in some pathologies. They are known to act as anti-VEGF agents. Here we report that these soluble receptors contribute to vessel maturation by mediating a dialogue between endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells that leads to blood vessel stabilization. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we provide evidence that these soluble VEGF receptors promote mural cell migration through a paracrine mechanism involving interplay in ECs between VEGF/VEGFR-2 and sphingosine1-phosphate type-1 (S1P)/S1P1 pathways that leads to endothelial nitric oxyde synthase (eNOS) activation. This new paradigm is supported by the finding that sVEGFR-1 and -2 perform the following actions: 1) induce an eNOS-dependent outgrowth of a mural cell network in an ex vivo model of angiogenesis, 2) increase the mural cell coverage of neovessels in vitro and in vivo, 3) promote mural cell migration toward ECs, and 4) stimulate endothelial S1P1 overproduction and eNOS activation that promote the migration and the recruitment of neighboring mural cells. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms regulating physiological and pathological angiogenesis and vessel stabilization.—Lorquet, S., Berndt, S., Blacher, S., Gengoux, E., Peulen, O., Maquoi, E., Noël, A., Foidart, J.-M., Munaut, C., Pèqueux, C.

https://openalex.org/W1972992576,"Peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) is an enzyme which releases N-linked glycans from glycopeptides/glycoproteins. This enzyme plays a role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway in yeast and mice, but the biological importance of this activity remains unknown.In this study, we characterized the ortholog of cytoplasmic PNGases, PNGase-like (Pngl), in Drosophila melanogaster. Pngl was found to have a molecular weight of approximately 74K and was mainly localized in the cytosol. Pngl lacks a CXXC motif that is critical for enzymatic activity in other species and accordingly did not appear to possess PNGase activity, though it still retains carbohydrate-binding activity. We generated microdeletions in the Pngl locus in order to investigate the functional importance of this protein in vivo. Elimination of Pngl led to a serious developmental delay or arrest during the larval and pupal stages, and surviving mutant adult males and females were frequently sterile. Most importantly, these phenotypes were rescued by ubiquitous expression of Pngl, clearly indicating that those phenotypic consequences were indeed due to the lack of functional Pngl. Interestingly, a putative ""catalytic-inactive"" mutant could not rescue the growth-delay phenotype, indicating that a biochemical activity of this protein is important for its biological function.Pngl was shown to be inevitable for the proper developmental transition and the biochemical properties other than deglycosylation activity is important for its biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2011358486,"Background [FeFe] hydrogenase enzymes catalyze the production and dissociation of H2, a potential renewable fuel. Attempts to exploit these catalysts in engineered systems have been hindered by the biotechnologically inconvenient properties of the natural enzymes, including their extreme oxygen sensitivity. Directed evolution has been used to improve the characteristics of a range of natural catalysts, but has been largely unsuccessful for [FeFe] hydrogenases because of a lack of convenient screening platforms. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe an in vitro screening technology for oxygen-tolerant and highly active [FeFe] hydrogenases. Despite the complexity of the protocol, we demonstrate a level of reproducibility that allows moderately improved mutants to be isolated. We have used the platform to identify a mutant of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [FeFe] hydrogenase HydA1 with a specific activity ∼4 times that of the wild-type enzyme. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using the screen presented here for large-scale efforts to identify improved biocatalysts for energy applications. The system is based on our ability to activate these complex enzymes in E. coli cell extracts, which allows unhindered access to the protein maturation and assay environment."

The vesicles convert rapidly to coated tubules whose morphology reflects the local concentration of endophilin. Their diameters and curvature resemble those of synaptic vesicles in situ. Three-dimensional reconstructions of quasicylindrical tubes revealed arrays of BAR dimers, flanked by densities that we equate with amphipathic helices whose folding and membrane insertion were attested by EPR. We also observed the compression of bulbous coated tubes into 70-Å-wide cylindrical micelles, which appear to mimic the penultimate (hemi-fission) stage of endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2105686213,"An often reported, but nevertheless persistently striking observation, formalized as the Newcomb-Benford law (NBL), is that the frequencies with which the leading digits of numbers occur in a large variety of data are far away from being uniform. Most spectacular seems to be the fact that in many data the leading digit 1 occurs in nearly one third of all cases. Explanations for this uneven distribution of the leading digits were, among others, scale- and base-invariance. Little attention, however, found the interrelation between the distribution of the significant digits and the distribution of the observed variable. It is shown here by simulation that long right-tailed distributions of a random variable are compatible with the NBL, and that for distributions of the ratio of two random variables the fit generally improves. Distributions not putting most mass on small values of the random variable (e.g. symmetric distributions) fail to fit. Hence, the validity of the NBL needs the predominance of small values and, when thinking of real-world data, a majority of small entities. Analyses of data on stock prices, the areas and numbers of inhabitants of countries, and the starting page numbers of papers from a bibliography sustain this conclusion. In all, these findings may help to understand the mechanisms behind the NBL and the conditions needed for its validity. That this law is not only of scientific interest per se, but that, in addition, it has also substantial implications can be seen from those fields where it was suggested to be put into practice. These fields reach from the detection of irregularities in data (e.g. economic fraud) to optimizing the architecture of computers regarding number representation, storage, and round-off errors."
https://openalex.org/W2049680503,"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune mediated disease associated with deregulation of many cell types. It has been reported that different T cell subsets have opposite effects in disease pathogenesis, in particular Th17 and Treg cells.We investigated whether non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, which have been reported as pro-tolerogenic, can lead to protection from chronic autoimmune arthritis in SKG mice--a recently described animal model of RA--by influencing the Th17/Treg balance. We found that non-depleting anti-CD4 prevented the onset of chronic autoimmune arthritis in SKG mice. Moreover, treated mice were protected from the induction of arthritis up to 60 days following anti-CD4 treatment, while remaining able to mount CD4-dependent immune responses to unrelated antigens. The antibody treatment also prevented disease progression in arthritic mice, although without leading to remission. Protection from arthritis was associated with an increased ratio of Foxp3, and decreased IL-17 producing T cells in the synovia. In vitro assays under Th17-polarizing conditions showed CD4-blockade prevents Th17 polarization, while favoring Foxp3 induction.Non-depleting anti-CD4 can therefore induce long-term protection from chronic autoimmune arthritis in SKG mice through reciprocal changes in the frequency of Treg and Th17 cells in peripheral tissues, thus shifting the balance towards immune tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2138823311,"Background Epidemiological studies link organophosphorus pesticide (OP) exposures to asthma, and we have shown that the OPs chlorpyrifos, diazinon and parathion cause airway hyperreactivity in guinea pigs 24 hr after a single subcutaneous injection. OP-induced airway hyperreactivity involves M2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction on airway nerves independent of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, but how OPs inhibit neuronal M2 receptors in airways is not known. In the central nervous system, OPs interact directly with neurons to alter muscarinic receptor function or expression; therefore, in this study we tested whether the OP parathion or its oxon metabolite, paraoxon, might decrease M2 receptor function on peripheral neurons via similar direct mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings Intravenous administration of paraoxon, but not parathion, caused acute frequency-dependent potentiation of vagally-induced bronchoconstriction and increased electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions in isolated trachea independent of AChE inhibition. However, paraoxon had no effect on vagally-induced bradycardia in intact guinea pigs or EFS-induced contractions in isolated ileum, suggesting mechanisms other than pharmacologic antagonism of M2 receptors. Paraoxon did not alter M2 receptor expression in cultured cells at the mRNA or protein level as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and radio-ligand binding assays, respectively. Additionally, a biotin-labeled fluorophosphonate, which was used as a probe to identify molecular targets phosphorylated by OPs, did not phosphorylate proteins in guinea pig cardiac membranes that were recognized by M2 receptor antibodies. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that neither direct pharmacologic antagonism nor downregulated expression of M2 receptors contributes to OP inhibition of M2 function in airway nerves, adding to the growing evidence of non-cholinergic mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity."

The preferential induction of tumor cell death by penetratin (Antp)-directed peptides (PNC27 and PNC28), however, suggests that the CPP Antp may contribute to the preferential cytotoxicity of these peptides. Using PNC27 as a molecular model, we constructed three novel peptides (PT, PR9, and PD3) by replacing the leader peptide Antp with one of three distinct CPPs (TAT, R9, or DPV3), respectively. The IC50 values of PNC27 in tumor cells were 2–3 times lower than in normal cells. However, all three engineered peptides demonstrated similar cytotoxic effects in tumor and normal cells. Another three chimeric peptides containing the leader peptide Antp with different mitochondria-disrupting peptides (KLA-Antp (KGA), B27-Antp (BA27), and B28-Antp (BA28)), preferentially induced apoptosis in tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2005603864,"Macropinocytosis, which is a constitutive cellular process of fluid and macromolecule uptake, is regulated by actin cytoskeleton rearrangements near the plasma membrane. Activation of Rac1, which is proposed to act upstream of the actin polymerization regulatory Wave 2 complex, has been found to correlate with enhanced macropinocytosis. One of the components of the Wave 2 complex is Abi1. Multiple, alternatively spliced isoforms of Abi1 are expressed in mammalian cells, but the functional significance of the various isoforms is unknown.Here, using flow cytometric assay analysis for Alexa Fluor 647, we demonstrate that Abi1 isoforms 2 and 3 differentially regulate macropinocytosis. LNCaP cells expressing isoform 3 had increased macropinocytic uptake that correlated with enhanced cell spreading and higher Rac1 activation in comparison to cells expressing isoform 2. Isoform 2 expressing cells had decreased macropinocytic uptake, but demonstrated greater sensitivity to Rac1 activation. Moreover, more isoform 2 was localized within the cytoplasm in comparison to isoform 3, which was more associated with the plasma membrane. Activated Rac1 was found to specifically bind to a site in exon 10 of isoform 2 in vitro. Because of alternative mRNA splicing, exon 10 is absent from isoform 3, precluding similar binding of activated Rac1. Both isoforms, however, bound to inactive Rac1 through the same non-exon 10 site. Thus, Abi1 isoform 3-containing Wave 2 complex exhibited a differential binding to activated vs. inactive Rac1, whereas isoform 2-containing Wave 2 complex bound activated or inactive Rac1 comparably.Based on these observations, we postulate that Abi1 isoforms differentially regulate macropinocytosis as a consequence of their different relative affinities for activated Rac1 in Wave 2 complex. These findings also raise the possibility that isoform-specific roles occur in other Abi1 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2075728723,"MADD plays an essential role in cancer cell survival. Abrogation of endogenous MADD expression results in significant spontaneous apoptosis and enhanced susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. However, the regulation of MADD function is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous MADD is phosphorylated at three highly conserved sites by Akt, and only the phosphorylated MADD can directly interact with the TRAIL receptor DR4 thereby preventing Fas-associated death domain recruitment. However, in cells susceptible to TRAIL treatment, TRAIL induces a reduction in MADD phosphorylation levels resulting in MADD dissociation from, and Fas-associated death domain association with DR4, which allows death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation leading to apoptosis. Thus, the pro-survival function of MADD is dependent upon its phosphorylation by Akt. Because Akt is active in most cancer cells and phosphorylated MADD confers resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, co-targeting Akt-MADD axis is likely to increase efficacy of TRAIL-based therapies."

In humans, malfunction of Notch signaling results in diseases and congenital disorders. Structural information is essential for gaining insight into the mechanism of the receptor as well as for potentially interfering with its function for therapeutic purposes. Methodology/Principal Findings We used the Affinity Grid approach to prepare specimens of the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) of the Drosophila Notch and human Notch1 receptors suitable for analysis by electron microscopy and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction. The resulting 3D density maps reveal that the NECD structure is conserved across species. We show that the NECD forms a dimer and adopts different yet defined conformations, and we identify the membrane-proximal region of the receptor and its ligand-binding site. Conclusions/Significance Our results provide direct and unambiguous evidence that the NECD forms a dimer. Our studies further show that the NECD adopts at least three distinct conformations that are likely related to different functional states of the receptor. These findings open the way to now correlate mutations in the NECD with its oligomeric state and conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2113453747,"Background The information processing capacity of the human mind is limited, as is evidenced by the attentional blink (AB) - a deficit in identifying the second of two temporally-close targets (T1 and T2) embedded in a rapid stream of distracters. Theories of the AB generally agree that it results from competition between stimuli for conscious representation. However, they disagree in the specific mechanisms, in particular about how attentional processing of T1 determines the AB to T2. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study used the high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the AB. Our research approach was to design T1 and T2 stimuli that activate distinguishable brain areas involved in visual categorization and representation. ROI and functional connectivity analyses were then used to examine how attentional processing of T1, as indexed by activity in the T1 representation area, affected T2 processing. Our main finding was that attentional processing of T1 at the level of the visual cortex predicted T2 detection rates Those individuals who activated the T1 encoding area more strongly in blink versus no-blink trials generally detected T2 on a lower percentage of trials. The coupling of activity between T1 and T2 representation areas did not vary as a function of conscious T2 perception. Conclusions/Significance These data are consistent with the notion that the AB is related to attentional demands of T1 for selection, and indicate that these demands are reflected at the level of visual cortex. They also highlight the importance of individual differences in attentional settings in explaining AB task performance."
https://openalex.org/W2165829386,"Influenza viruses have to overcome the type I interferon induced antiviral response to successfully propagate in target cells. A major antiviral factor induced by interferons is the protein kinase R (PKR) that is further activated by dsRNA and phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). This results in inhibition of protein translation thereby limiting viral replication. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which influenza A viruses escape the antiviral action of PKR. We demonstrate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs) MK2 and MK3 are activated on virus infection and, in their active form, directly interact with the repressor of the inhibitor of PKR p88(rIPK). This leads to recruitment of a tetrameric protein complex consisting of p88(rIPK), the inhibitor of PKR p58(IPK) and PKR itself, and finally results in inhibition of the kinase. The importance of MKs for influenza virus propagation was further underscored by demonstrating reduced viral progeny in cells genetically deficient in MK2 or MK3 genes as well as in highly proliferating tumor cells, in which expression of MKs was diminished by specific small interfering RNA. Accordingly, knockdown of MKs resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of PKR and its substrate eIF2α."

Here we generate a sensor that allows imaging activation of CREB in the nucleus of single live cells and use it to study the role of the anchor protein AKAP79/150 (AKAP79 is the human, AKAP150 the rodent variant) in CREB signaling. “A kinase anchor proteins” (AKAPs) have been identified as strategic scaffold proteins that regulate the architecture and spatiotemporal properties of signal transduction pathways (39.Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). They do so by organizing the assembly of signaling complexes that recruit key enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, and some of their substrates to distinct subcellular environments. AKAP79/150 is a multivalent anchor protein that simultaneously binds PKA, calcineurin, and protein kinase C (PKC) (40.Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D.

The involvement of AKAP79/150-dependent signaling complexes in organizing pathways converging on CREB thus appeared as a suitable testing ground to demonstrate usefulness of ICAP. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein A kinase anchoring protein CREB-binding protein cyan fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer indicator of CREB activation due to phosphorylation brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein kinase A calmodulin kinase mitogen-activated protein α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate N-methyl-d-aspartate isobutylmethylxanthine short hairpin RNA kinase-inducible domain KID interaction domain. Amino acids 121–160 of the kinase-inducible domain (KID) and amino acids 586–662 of CREB-binding protein (CBP), including the linker GGSGGT, were generated by standard PCR from the full-length CREB cDNA. Both fragments were cloned into pRSET B (Invitrogen), the KID fragment with SphI/KpnI and the KIX fragment with KpnI/SacI, between CFP (BamHI/SphI) and Citrine (SacI/EcoRI). All cloning enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Site-directed mutagenesis was done with the QuikChange Kit from Stratagene. For expression in mammalian cells the construct was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Nucleus targeting was achieved by fusing the amino acid sequence PKKKRKVEDA to the N terminus of the CFP. The VIVIT-TagRFP construct was generated by standard PCR using the forward primer, 5′-GGA TCC ATG GCT GGC CCT CAT CCT GTG ATC GTG ATC ACC GGT CCT CAT GAA GAA ATG GTG TCT AAG GGC GAA GAGC and the reverse primer, 5′-GAATTC TTA ATT AAG TTT GTG CCC CAG TTT GC and cloned, as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment, to pcDNA3. The mCherry fluorescent protein was PCR amplified from pRSET-B-mCherry with BamHI/NotI. The pEGFP-N1-AKAP79-mCherry was constructed by replacing the yellow fluorescent protein gene in the pEGFP-N1-AKAP79 vector with mCherry. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described previously (45.Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Polyhistidine-tagged ICAP expressed using the plasmid vector pRSETB (Invitrogen) had a molecular mass of 71 kDa (versus 69.5 kDa for NLS-ICAP expressed in mammalian cells). ICAP in vitro fluorescence measurements were performed in a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Darmstadt, Germany). The purified construct was treated with the catalytic subunit of PKA (New England Biolabs, 2.5–5 units/μl) and CaMK IV (Millipore, 2.5 units/μl) in the corresponding kinase reaction buffer at room temperature. ATP was purchased from Sigma. Samples were excited at 432 nm and emission was scanned from 440 to 600 nm. Traces shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. For Western blot analysis the purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and initially probed using an anti-GFP antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc., MA). The membrane was subsequently stripped of the probe via the use of a stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 100 mm 2-mecaptoethanol, 2% SDS, pH 6.8) incubated at 50 °C for 30 min before labeling with an anti-phosphoserine 133 specific antibody (New England Biolabs). HeLa cells were plated onto sterile glass bottom dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 6% CO2. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and left for 24 h at 37 °C. Prior to Western blotting the cells were serum starved for 3 h in 0.5% fetal bovine serum followed by stimulation with 50 μm forskolin (Sigma) and 1 mm IBMX (Sigma) for 0, 2-, 5-, 10-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min time points. Additional untransfected HeLa cells were also stimulated with forskolin and IBMX as a further control. For Western blotting cells were lysed in a SDS lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and initially probed with an anti-phosphoserine 133 specific antibody (New England Biolabs) before probing with an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) loading control antibody. Western blots were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to the 0-min control. Hippocampal neurons were prepared from 17–18-day-old rat embryos and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation for 1–4 h. Neurons were imaged 1–2 days after transfection and before imaging were held at room temperature for 30 min. All biochemicals were purchased from Sigma and used in the indicated concentrations. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was a gift of S. Lang, MPI for Neurobiology, Munich. Neurons were pretreated at least 30 min with the indicated inhibitor. U0126 and KN-62 were used at 10 μm, H-89 at 25 μm unless indicated differently. Nimodipine was used at 5 μm, St-Ht31 and St-Ht31pro at 10 μm. For knock-down of endogenous AKAP150 plasmids coding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) (AKAP 150 shRNA or control AKAP 150 shRNA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were introduced into P1 hippocampal neurons using Lipofectin 2000-mediated transfection. Neurons were stained and analyzed 9–11 days after transfection. Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) (5 μm) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/pluronic acid and cells were incubated 30 min with the solution, then washed and allowed to recover for 30 min. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 35M microsope with a charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap, Roper Scientific, AZ). The imaging setup was controlled by Metafluor version 4.6 software (Universal Imaging, Puchheim, Germany). For ratio imaging, a 440/20 excitation filter, a 455-dichroic long-pass mirror, and two emission filters (485/35 for CFP, 535/25 for Citrine) operated in a filter wheel (Sutter instruments, CA) were used. For fura-2 imaging, 350 and 380 nm excitation filters and a 500/20 emission filter were used. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed Student's t test. All error bars indicate mean ± S.E. Image processing was done using Image J. DIV9–11 neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% normal goat serum. Neurons were stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody to AKAP150 (1:300, Upstate, NY) and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500, Invitrogen) secondary antibody and coverslipped in Fluoromount (Sigma). All images were acquired as single layers using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica SP2, Wetzlar, Germany) with a ×40 oil immersion objective. Our intention was to construct sensors that reliably report phosphorylation of the critical serine 133 by using FRET between mutants of GFP. The KIX domain (CREB interaction domain) of CBP was considered a specific module recognizing serine 133-phosphorylated KID and was incorporated into the sensor to initiate a specific conformational change upon phosphorylation of KID. Thus, to monitor CREB activation in living cells we fused amino acids 121–160 of the kinase-inducible domain (KID) of CREB, together with a flexible linker GGSGGT, to amino acids 586–662 of CBP (KIX), and sandwiched this construct between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and the yellow fluorescent protein variant Citrine (45.Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This final variant, after a few tens of constructs to optimize signal strength, was called ICAP (indicator of CREB activation due to phosphorylation). We purified the protein and tested its properties in vitro (Fig. 1). ICAP started out with high FRET under basal conditions. Addition of recombinant PKA or CaMK IV reduced FRET, thus increasing the emission intensity of CFP and decreasing that of Citrine (Fig. 1, B and E). The maximal ratio change was 35–40%. Interestingly, substitution of Citrine with the circularly permuted variant Citrine cp174 (46.Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11241-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 47.Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

J. 2006; 90: 1790-1796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) completely reverted the response behavior of ICAP. ICAP-cp174 showed lower FRET under basal conditions, which increased after phosphorylation with PKA, demonstrating that it is possible to tune the response behavior of genetically encoded sensors in more fundamental ways than previously expected (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the conformational change is specifically dependent on phosphorylation of serine 133 and on PKA and ATP, which are the components of the in vitro assay, we performed control experiments. In vitro kinase assays with one of the components excluded from the reaction or the crucial serine 133 mutated to alanine (S133A) did not result in a FRET change after 60 min in vitro (Fig. 1E). Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for phosphoserine 133-CREB verified that the sensor is phosphorylated in vitro under our assay conditions (Fig. 1F). Overall, these experiments show that the sensors are specifically activated in vitro by phosphorylation of serine 133 (data not shown). Further in vitro characterization addressing pH sensitivity and overall FRET efficiency within ICAP is provided in supplemenatal Fig. 1. Using a similar strategy, replacement of the KID domain of CREB within the sensor with the homologous KID domains of ATF-1 or CREM, resulted in functional sensors of ATF-1 or CREM activation. These sensors showed maximal ratio changes of 22–40 and 20–30%, respectively, when stimulated with PKA (supplemental Fig. 2). We fused a nuclear localization sequence to the sensor to specifically express ICAP in the nucleus of living cells (Figs. 1A and 2A). Transfection of the NLS-ICAP into hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2A) or HeLa cells reported activation of CREB by forskolin or histamine in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B), which was completely abolished by the S133A mutation within ICAP. To verify that the activation of ICAP corresponds well to the activation of endogenous CREB we performed Western blot analysis using lysates of forskolin-IBMX-stimulated HeLa cells transfected with ICAP. Endogenous CREB phosphorylation and ICAP phosphorylation could be well discriminated due to the difference in molecular mass of 43 and 69 kDa of endogenous CREB and the biosensor, respectively (Fig. 2C). The overall time course of phosphorylation of endogenous CREB and ICAP corresponded well. When transfected into primary hippocampal neurons NLS-ICAP reported three pathways with different activation kinetics converging on CREB, a fast high potassium-induced CREB activation and slower activations induced by forskolin or the neurotrophin BDNF (Fig. 3A). The high potassium-induced activation could be dissected in a fast component blocked by KN-62, an antagonist of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases, and a slower remaining activation blocked by UO126, an inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 3, B and C). These results obtained with high potassium stimulation are in good agreement with previous studies that examined the time course of phosphorylation of endogenous CREB after depolarization and another demonstration that ICAP signals are an excellent measure for activation of endogenous CREB (16.Wu G.Y.

Activation by forskolin was efficiently blocked by the PKA antagonist H-89 (Fig. 3C), whereas the BDNF-induced activation was inhibited by the MAP kinase blocker U0126 (Fig. 3C) (51.Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 52.Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E.

Time constants for the rise were 2.2 ± 0.42 min for the fast high potassium-mediated activation, and 47 ± 0.28 and 52.5 ± 0.43 min for the slow forskolin and BDNF-induced activations, respectively. Decay times were more heterogeneous in nature. In stimulations with high potassium, CREB activation persisted significantly after stimulations had ended. Stimulation with 1 μm NMDA, however, led to the rapid return of CREB to baseline levels within 5–10 min after wash-out of the drug (Fig. 3D), which has been attributed to induction of a CREB shut-off pathway (54.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar) and was a good demonstration of the reversibility of ICAP signals in vivo. ICAP, furthermore, faithfully reported developmentally regulated CREB activation via GABAa and GABAb receptors and build-up and summation of CREB activation by succeeding repetitive calcium spikes (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). To assess background signals due to bleaching or residual activation in the absence of stimulation we transfected NLS-ICAP into HeLa cells and imaged cells for 30 min in 30-s intervals. Under these conditions we observed a slight increase in CFP emission and decrease in Citrine emission presumably due to preferential bleaching of the acceptor protein (supplemental Fig. 5).FIGURE 3Validation of ICAP in living hippocampal neurons. A, three pathways with different temporal features converge on CREB in primary hippocampal neurons. A fast high potassium-mediated CREB activation can be differentiated from slower activations by forskolin (50 μm) or the neurotrophin BDNF (100 ng/ml). B, the high potassium-mediated activation is dissected into a fast calcium-calmodulin kinase-mediated pathway that is blocked by KN-62 (50 μm) and a slower component mediated by the MAP kinase pathway that is blocked by U0126 (50 μm). C, summary of the pharmacology of CREB activation (mean ± S.E.) after stimulation with high potassium, forskolin, and BDNF. CREB activation was determined 30 min after stimulation in the presence or absence of the various compounds.

Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We used ICAP to investigate to what extent AKAP79/150 influences CREB activation. Indeed, the scaffold protein had a significant effect on CREB (Fig. 4). Co-expression of AKAP79-mCherry with ICAP in hippocampal neurons initially appeared to enhance forskolin-induced CREB activation after 10 min of application. After 30 min, however, the effect was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A). To achieve the opposite effect of disrupting the anchoring of PKA to AKAP79/150 we applied the stearated peptide St-Ht31, which mimics the binding site of AKAP79/150 for PKA (58.Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is membrane permeant and thus simply could be added to the extracellular solution. Disruption of PKA anchoring to AKAP79/150 dramatically reduced forskolin-induced CREB activation (n = 6) (Fig. 4A), thus demonstrating the need for strategic positioning of PKA to affect signaling to the nucleus. A biologically inactive analogue of St-Ht31 (St-Ht31pro) did not have an effect (n = 6, Fig. 4A). St-Ht31 application did not affect depolarization-induced CREB activation (n = 5) (Fig. 4B). As an alternative way to study involvement of AKAP79/150 in PKA-mediated CREB activation we knocked down expression of the rodent form of AKAP150 using shRNAs. When transfected into hippocampal neurons 1 day after plating this procedure efficiently inhibited expression of AKAP150, which typically is strongly induced in hippocampal neurons during the first week in vitro (59.Robertson H.R.

https://openalex.org/W2149617265,"The purpose of this study was to investigate how surfactant membranes can be perturbed by C-reactive protein (CRP) and whether surfactant protein A (SP-A) might overcome CRP-induced surfactant membrane alterations. The effect of CRP on surfactant surface adsorption was evaluated in vivo after intratracheal instillation of CRP into rat lungs. Insertion of CRP into surfactant membranes was investigated through monolayer techniques. The effect of CRP on membrane structure was studied through differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy using large and giant unilamellar vesicles. Our results indicate that CRP inserts into surfactant membranes and drastically increases membrane fluidity, resulting in surfactant inactivation. At 10% CRP/phospholipid weight ratio, CRP causes disappearance of liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered phase coexistence distinctive of surfactant membranes. SP-A, the most abundant surfactant lipoprotein structurally similar to C1q, binds to CRP (K(d)=56±8 nM), as determined by solid-phase binding assays and dynamic light scattering. This novel SP-A/CRP interaction reduces CRP insertion and blocks CRP effects on surfactant membranes. In addition, intratracheal coinstillation of SP-A+CRP into rat lungs prevents surfactant inhibition induced by CRP, indicating that SP-A/CRP interactions might be an important factor in vivo in controlling harmful CRP effects in the alveolus."
https://openalex.org/W1993702496,"Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of tumor. Because malignant melanoma is difficult to treat once it has metastasized, early detection and treatment are essential. The search for reliable biomarkers of early-stage melanoma, therefore, has received much attention. By using a novel method of screening tumor antigens and their auto-antibodies, we identified bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (BPAG1) as a melanoma antigen recognized by its auto-antibody. BPAG1 is an auto-antigen in the skin disease bullous pemphigoid (BP) and anti-BPAG1 auto-antibodies are detectable in sera from BP patients and are used for BP diagnosis. However, BPAG1 has been viewed as predominantly a keratinocyte-associated protein and a relationship between BPAG1 expression and melanoma has not been previously reported. In the present study, we show that bpag1 is expressed in the mouse F10 melanoma cell line in vitro and F10 melanoma tumors in vivo and that BPAG1 is expressed in human melanoma cell lines (A375 and G361) and normal human melanocytes. Moreover, the levels of anti-BPAG1 auto-antibodies in the sera of melanoma patients were significantly higher than in the sera of healthy volunteers (p<0.01). Furthermore, anti-BPAG1 auto-antibodies were detected in melanoma patients at both early and advanced stages of disease. Here, we report anti-BPAG1 auto-antibodies as a promising marker for the diagnosis of melanoma, and we discuss the significance of the detection of such auto-antibodies in cancer biology and patients."
https://openalex.org/W2069365183,"Identification of human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) restricted cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes from influenza virus is of importance for the development of new effective peptide-based vaccines.In the present work, bioinformatics was used to predict 9mer peptides derived from available influenza A viral proteins with binding affinity for at least one of the 12 HLA-I supertypes. The predicted peptides were then selected in a way that ensured maximal coverage of the available influenza A strains. One hundred and thirty one peptides were synthesized and their binding affinities for the HLA-I supertypes were measured in a biochemical assay. Influenza-specific T cell responses towards the peptides were quantified using IFNgamma ELISPOT assays with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from adult healthy HLA-I typed donors as responder cells. Of the 131 peptides, 21 were found to induce T cell responses in 19 donors. In the ELISPOT assay, five peptides induced responses that could be totally blocked by the pan-specific anti-HLA-I antibody W6/32, whereas 15 peptides induced responses that could be completely blocked in the presence of the pan-specific anti-HLA class II (HLA-II) antibody IVA12. Blocking of HLA-II subtype reactivity revealed that 8 and 6 peptide responses were blocked by anti-HLA-DR and -DP antibodies, respectively. Peptide reactivity of PBMC depleted of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells prior to the ELISPOT culture revealed that effectors are either CD4(+) (the majority of reactivities) or CD8(+) T cells, never a mixture of these subsets. Three of the peptides, recognized by CD4(+) T cells showed binding to recombinant DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401 or DRA1*0101/DRB5*0101 molecules in a recently developed biochemical assay.HLA-I binding 9mer influenza virus-derived peptides induce in many cases CD4(+) T cell responses restricted by HLA-II molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2125529746,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and nephritis in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are two common forms of glomerulonephritis in which genetic findings are of importance for disease development. We have recently reported an association of IgAN with variants of TGFB1. In several autoimmune diseases, particularly in SLE, IRF5, STAT4 genes and TRAF1-C5 locus have been shown to be important candidate genes. The aim of this study was to compare genetic variants from the TGFB1, IRF5, STAT4 genes and TRAF1-C5 locus with susceptibility to IgAN and lupus nephritis in two Swedish cohorts.We genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genetic loci in 1252 DNA samples from patients with biopsy proven IgAN or with SLE (with and without nephritis) and healthy age- and sex-matched controls from the same population in Sweden.Genotype and allelic frequencies for SNPs from selected genes did not differ significantly between lupus nephritis patients and SLE patients without nephritis. In addition, haplotype analysis for seven selected SNPs did not reveal a difference for the SLE patient groups with and without nephritis. Moreover, none of these SPNs showed a significant difference between IgAN patients and healthy controls. IRF5 and STAT4 variants remained significantly different between SLE cases and healthy controls. In addition, the data did not show an association of TRAF1-C5 polymorphism with susceptibility to SLE in this Swedish population.Our data do not support an overlap in genetic susceptibility between patients with IgAN or SLE and reveal no specific importance of SLE associated SNPs for the presence of lupus nephritis."
https://openalex.org/W2053100903,"Background Cell-surface receptors play essential roles in anthrax toxin action by providing the toxin with a high-affinity anchor and self-assembly site on the plasma membrane, mediating the toxin entry into cells through endocytosis, and shifting the pH threshold for prepore-to-pore conversion of anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) to a more acidic pH, thereby inhibiting premature pore formation. Each of the two known anthrax toxin receptors, ANTXR1 and ANTXR2, has an ectodomain comprised of an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A domain (VWA), which binds PA, and an uncharacterized immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig) that connects VWA to the membrane-spanning domain. Potential roles of the receptor Ig domain in anthrax toxin action have not been investigated heretofore. Methodology/Principal Findings We expressed and purified the ANTXR2 ectodomain (R2-VWA-Ig) in E. coli and showed that it contains three disulfide bonds: one in R2-VWA and two in R2-Ig. Reduction of the ectodomain inhibited functioning of the pore, as measured by K+ release from liposomes or Chinese hamster ovary cells or by PA-mediated translocation of a model substrate across the plasma membrane. However, reduction did not affect binding of the ectodomain to PA or the transition of ectodomain-bound PA prepore to the pore conformation. The inhibitory effect depended specifically on reduction of the disulfides within R2-Ig. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that disulfide integrity within R2-Ig is essential for proper functioning of receptor-bound PA pore. This finding provides a novel venue to investigate the mechanism of anthrax toxin action and suggests new strategies for inhibiting toxin action."
https://openalex.org/W1974477734,"Mechanoelectric feedback (MEF) describes the modulation of electrical activity by mechanical activity. This may occur via the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs). MEF has not previously been investigated in fish ventricular tissue even though fish can greatly increase ventricular end diastolic volume during exercise which should therefore provide a powerful mechanical stimulus for MEF.When the ventricles of extrinsically paced, isolated working trout hearts were dilated by increasing afterload, monophasic action potential (MAP) duration was significantly shortened at 25% repolarisation, unaltered at 50% repolarisation and significantly lengthened at 90% repolarisation. This observation is consistent with the activation of cationic non-selective MSCs (MSC(NS)s). We then cloned the trout ortholog of TRPC1, a candidate MSC(NS) and confirmed its presence in the trout heart.Our results have validated the use of MAP technology for the fish heart and suggest that, in common with amphibians and mammals, MEF operates in fish ventricular myocardium, possibly via the activation of mechanosensitive TRPC1 ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2032814558,"Cell number changes during normal development, and in disease (e.g., neurodegeneration, cancer). Many genes affect cell number, thus functional genetic analysis frequently requires analysis of cell number alterations upon loss of function mutations or in gain of function experiments. Drosophila is a most powerful model organism to investigate the function of genes involved in development or disease in vivo. Image processing and pattern recognition techniques can be used to extract information from microscopy images to quantify automatically distinct cellular features, but these methods are still not very extended in this model organism. Thus cellular quantification is often carried out manually, which is laborious, tedious, error prone or humanly unfeasible. Here, we present DeadEasy Mito-Glia, an image processing method to count automatically the number of mitotic cells labelled with anti-phospho-histone H3 and of glial cells labelled with anti-Repo in Drosophila embryos. This programme belongs to the DeadEasy suite of which we have previously developed versions to count apoptotic cells and neuronal nuclei. Having separate programmes is paramount for accuracy. DeadEasy Mito-Glia is very easy to use, fast, objective and very accurate when counting dividing cells and glial cells labelled with a nuclear marker. Although this method has been validated for Drosophila embryos, we provide an interactive window for biologists to easily extend its application to other nuclear markers and other sample types. DeadEasy MitoGlia is freely available as an ImageJ plug-in, it increases the repertoire of tools for in vivo genetic analysis, and it will be of interest to a broad community of developmental, cancer and neuro-biologists."
https://openalex.org/W2042376106,"Background Sequencing full-length cDNA clones is important to determine gene structures including alternative splice forms, and provides valuable resources for experimental analyses to reveal the biological functions of coded proteins. However, previous approaches for sequencing cDNA clones were expensive or time-consuming, and therefore, a fast and efficient sequencing approach was demanded. Methodology We developed a program, MuSICA 2, that assembles millions of short (36-nucleotide) reads collected from a single flow cell lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer to shotgun-sequence ∼800 human full-length cDNA clones. MuSICA 2 performs a hybrid assembly in which an external de novo assembler is run first and the result is then improved by reference alignment of shotgun reads. We compared the MuSICA 2 assembly with 200 pooled full-length cDNA clones finished independently by the conventional primer-walking using Sanger sequencers. The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%. We also applied MuSICA 2 to full-length cDNA clones from Toxoplasma gondii, to confirm that its ability was competent even for non-human species. Conclusions The entire sequencing and shotgun assembly takes less than 1 week and the consumables cost only ∼US$3 per clone, demonstrating a significant advantage over previous approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2114146646,"Enzymatic catalysis of biochemical reactions is essential to all living systems. The ""lock and key"" and ""induced fit"" models were early contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the reaction between an enzyme and its substrate. However, whether a given substrate-induced conformation is rigid or remains flexible has not yet been determined. By measuring the enzyme activity and intrinsic fluorescence of a nonspecific Eisenia fetida protease-I with different chromogenic substrates, we show that in subsequent reactions of protease with substrates, both the ""lock and key"" and ""induced fit"" mechanisms are used depending on the degree of conformational change required. Chromozym-Th- or chromosym-Ch-induced protease conformations were unable to bind chromozym-U. The chromosym-U-induced protease conformation remained flexible and could be further induced by chromozym-Th and chromozym-Ch. When low concentrations of guanidine HCl were used to disturb the conformation of the enzyme, only small changes in intrinsic fluorescence of the chromozym-Th-induced protease were detected, in contrast to the native enzyme whose intrinsic fluorescence markedly increased. This indicates that the substrate-induced enzyme was relatively rigid compared with the native protease. Utilizing a lock and key mechanism for secondary substrate reactions may have adaptive value in that it facilitates high efficiency in enzymatic reactions."

To study substrate recognition by APC, active site-mutated APC (APC(S360A)) was used, which lacks proteolytic activity but exhibits anticoagulant activity. Experiments in model systems and in plasma show that APC(S360A), and not its zymogen protein C(S360A), expresses anticoagulant activities by competing with activated coagulation factors X and IX for binding to FVa and FVIIIa, respectively. APC(S360A) bound to FVa with a KD of 0.11 ± 0.05 nm and competed with active site-labeled Oregon Green activated coagulation factor X for binding to FVa. The binding of APC(S360A) to FVa was not affected by protein S but was inhibited by prothrombin. APC(S360A) binding to FVa was critically dependent upon the presence of Arg506 and not Arg306 and additionally required an active site accessible to substrates. Inhibition of FVIIIa activity by APC(S360A) was >100-fold less efficient than inhibition of FVa. Our results show that despite exosite interactions near the Arg506 cleavage site, binding of APC(S360A) to FVa is almost completely dependent on Arg506 interacting with APC(S360A) to form a nonproductive Michaelis complex. Because docking of APC to FVa and FVIIIa constitutes the first step in the inactivation of the cofactors, we hypothesize that the observed anticoagulant activity may be important for in vivo regulation of thrombin formation.

APC is a serine protease that, together with its cofactor, protein S, down-regulates thrombin formation by inactivating the activated forms of the coagulation factors V and VIII (FVa and FVIIIa) via limited proteolysis. The protein C pathway is vital to normal hemostasis, as is indicated by the severe thrombotic events observed in individuals with homozygous or compound homozygous protein C deficiency (1.Marlar R.A.

Another commonly observed (∼5% of Caucasians) impairment of the anticoagulant properties of protein C is associated with the factor VLeiden missense mutation (FV(R506Q)), causing the ablation of one of two APC cleavage sites, the other being at Arg306.

Interactions between APC and its substrates (FVa and FVIIIa) are largely dependent on three exposed surface loops (the 37-loop: Lys191(37)–Lys193(39); the 60-loop: Lys217(62) and Lys218(63); and the 70–80-loop: Arg229(74), Arg230(75), and Lys233(78)) that together form an electropositive exosite on APC (5.Friedrich U.

Several epitopes on the surface of FVa contribute to the interaction with APC at the Arg506 and the Arg306 cleavage sites (10.Segers K. Dahlbäck B. Rosing J. Nicolaes G.A. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis studies suggest the presence of an extended exosite on FVa near Arg506, which is much less prominent around the Arg306 cleavage site (10.Segers K. Dahlbäck B. Rosing J. Nicolaes G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22573-22581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data are in line with three-dimensional molecular models for the complexes between FVa and APC (at Arg506 and Arg306), which suggest that exosite-mediated contacts are more important for docking of APC at Arg506 than for docking at Arg306, by virtue of the extended character of the surface loop in which Arg306 is located (12.Nicolaes G.A.

The affinity of APC for FVa has not been measured directly but can be inferred from the apparent Kmfor the proteolysis at Arg506 in native FVa of between 2 and 20 nm and for cleavage at Arg306 in FVaLeiden, which is ∼10-fold higher (Km = 196 nm (12.Nicolaes G.A.

Note that the value of Km for both cleavage sites is influenced by the ionic strength and the source of APC, explaining the differences in reported Km values for Arg506. In the present study, we have investigated the interactions between APC and FVa or FVIIIa using an APC variant that lacks catalytic activity caused by a mutation of the active site Ser360(195) to Ala (APC(S360A)). Catalytically inactive S195A mutants of proteinases or proteinases with chemically modified active sites have been used to study substrate-proteinase complex formation (15.Mather T. Oganessyan V.

In recent studies of prothrombin substrate recognition by prothrombinase, S195A FXa in combination with prothrombin mutants containing Arg to Gln-substituted cleavage sites allowed discrimination of the roles of exosite engagement and active site docking in the mechanism of sequential Arg320 and Arg271 cleavage during prothrombin activation (18.Hacisalihoglu A.

A similar mechanism also applies to the extrinsic tenase complex (19.Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Analysis of protein C substrate recognition by the thrombin·(soluble) TM complex, for which crystallographic and mutagenesis studies implicate exosite interactions, however, shows that protein C binding to thrombin depends strongly on interactions between protein C and the active site of thrombin when the latter is bound to TM (21.Lu G. Chhum S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15471-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we report that an analogous situation occurs with APC(S360A) recognition of the cleavage site at Arg506 in FVa. The effects of this APC mutant on coagulation were quantitated, both in systems of purified components and plasma-based assay systems. Our results show that APC(S360A) binds with high affinity to a FXa binding site on FVa but not on FVaLeiden and as a result of this binding expresses proteolysis-independent anticoagulant activity in plasma. Human FV and FVLeiden from plasma of a normal individual and an individual homozygous for the FV R506Q mutation, respectively, and FVa2 were prepared as described (14.Nicolaes G.A. Tans G.

Two variants were expressed: FVa Q306R506Q679, in which Arg306 and Arg679 were replaced by glutamine and FVa R306Q506Q679, in which Arg506 and Arg679 were replaced by glutamine. FXa, α-thrombin, protein S, wild type APC (wt-APC), and prothrombin were purchased from Kordia Lab Supplies. All of the coagulation factors were of human origin, unless otherwise stated. Purified factor VIII and a polyclonal goat anti-human FVIII inhibitory antibody were kindly provided by Dr. P. Turecek (Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria). α-FXa, purified as described (22.Bock P.E.

FPR-CH2Cl (100 μm) was added to inhibit any traces of active FXa. The free thiol on the inhibitor was generated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m NH2OH, 50 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, in the presence of 540 μm 5- (and 6)-iodoacetamido-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein (Oregon Green 488-iodoacetamide) and incubation in the dark for 3 h. Free probe was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and dialysis against 50 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Probe incorporation was 1.4 mol of probe/mol of FXa, measured as described previously (23.Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Kroh H.K. Briggs J. Tans G. Bode W. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described (24.Nicolaes G.A. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13584-13591Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Synthetic lipids 1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS), 1,2 dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama). The chromogenic substrates pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2366) and H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2238) were obtained from Chromogenix (Milan, Italy). Recombinant protein C(S360A) was obtained by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/RSV (Invitrogen), expressed in HEK293 cells (CRL-1573 ATCC), purified, and characterized essentially as described earlier (25.Sun Y.H.

Protein C concentrations were quantified by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm using an absorption coefficient of 14.5 (280 nm, 1%, 1 cm). Protein C was further quantified using a protein C ELISA, employing the anti-human protein C polyclonal antibody Dako 0370 (Dako, Denmark) as a catcher antibody and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human protein C polyclonal DAKO P0374 as a detecting antibody. Dilutions of normal pooled plasma were used to calibrate the assay, assuming that plasma contains 64.5 nm protein C (4.Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S. Kleiss A.J. Wideman C. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Protein C(S360A) was activated with bovine thrombin, and the thrombin was removed by chromatography, essentially as described previously (27.Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31086-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Complete removal of thrombin was ascertained by the measured absence of a difference in amidolytic activity between measurement with S-2238 of the APC preparation in the presence and absence of hirudin. APC concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm and by the above-described protein C ELISA. FVa activity was determined from the rate of FXa-catalyzed prothrombin activation, as described previously (14.Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, prothrombin activation in a reaction mixture containing 0.5 μm prothrombin, a limiting concentration of FVa (≤ 83 pm), 5 nm FXa, 40 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:90, DOPS:DOPC, mol:mol), 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 2 mm CaCl2 was incubated for 1 min at 37 °C, after which thrombin was measured from the rate of S-2238 hydrolysis. FVa inactivation by APC was determined by following the loss of FXa cofactor activity of FVa in the prothrombinase complex as a function of time. Routinely, 0.8 nm of plasma-derived FVa or FVaLeiden was preincubated with 25 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:90, DOPS:DOPC, mol:mol) in 25 mm HEPES buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5 (Buffer I), to which 3 mm CaCl2 was added for 5 min at 37 °C. Inactivation was started by the addition of APC, and the progressive loss of FVa activity was monitored by transferring aliquots of the inactivation mixture into the FVa assay described above. FVIIIa activity was determined from the rate of FIXa-catalyzed FX activation. Briefly, 3 nm recombinant FVIII was activated with 2 nm thrombin in 50 mm HEPES buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.5 (Buffer II), for 60 s. Thrombin was inhibited with recombinant hirudin (20 nm), and the activation mixture was diluted 25-fold into a reaction mixture containing 40 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:90, DOPS:DOPC, mol:mol) in Buffer II. Because FVIIIa stability measurements showed that FVIIIa activity reached a stable value after ∼10 min of incubation at 37 °C, FX activation was started after 15 min of incubation by the addition of FIXa (1 nm) and FX (400 nm). At varying time points, aliquots were taken from the reaction mixture, and the concentration of FXa was determined from the rate of Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2765) hydrolysis. FVIIIa inactivation by APC was determined by following the loss of FIXa cofactor activity of FVIIIa as a function of time by transferring aliquots into the FVIIIa assay described above. Thrombin generation in clotting plasma was monitored by calibrated automated thrombinography (CAT), where conversion of a low affinity fluorogenic substrate (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) by thrombin was followed with time in a Fluoroskan Ascent® microtiter plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with 390-nm excitation and 460-nm emission (28.Hemker H.C.

Thrombin generation curves and the area under the curve, the endogenous thrombin potential, were calculated using Thrombinoscope software (Thrombinoscope B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands). Thrombin formation was routinely initiated in the absence or presence of APC by the addition of various concentrations of recombinant TF (0.4–13.6 pm), 16 mm CaCl2, and 30 μm phospholipid vesicles (DOPS:DOPC:DOPE, 20:60:20, mol:mol:mol), and 50 μg/ml corn trypsin inhibitor. Likewise, intrinsic activation of coagulation was triggered in the absence of corn trypsin inhibitor by the addition of 1 volume of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) reagent (Chromogenix) that was diluted 2-fold in Buffer I to 1 volume of plasma as described by the manufacturer. Thrombin formation was initiated in the presence or absence of APC by the addition of 1 volume of CaCl2 (final concentration, 8.3 mm; Chromogenix), as advised by the manufacturer. PMS-APC was prepared by incubation of 2 μm APC in 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer III) with 3.8 mm freshly prepared PMSF at room temperature. The amidolytic activity of the solution was monitored by subsampling of aliquots into 1 ml of 189 μm S-2366 and measurement of the initial rate of hydrolysis at 405 nm. The incubation was continued until amidolytic activity had decreased to that of a blank measurement. Excess inhibitor was removed with a ZebaTM spin column (Pierce), and the PMS-APC was dialyzed against Buffer III overnight. The concentration of PMS-APC was determined with the protein C ELISA. FPR-APC was prepared by incubating 2.4 μm APC for 20 min at room temperature followed by 10 min at 37 °C with a 10-fold excess of PPACK (FPR-CH2Cl; Calbiochem) in Buffer III, and the progress of inhibition was monitored as described for PMS-APC. Free inhibitor was removed with a ZebaTM column. FPR-APC was prepared freshly prior to the experiment, and the concentration was determined using the ELISA. Fluorescence was measured with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer in the ratio mode, using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. All of the experiments were performed in 50 mm HEPES, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. Equilibrium binding studies of Oregon Green-labeled FXa (OG-FXa) binding to FVa were performed by titrating OG-FXa with human FVa and measuring the fluorescence change at 520 nm with excitation at 491 nm (8-nm band passes). Fluorescence changes, expressed as (Fobs − Fo)/Fo = ΔF/Fo, as a function of total FVa concentration were fit by the quadratic binding equation to obtain the maximum fluorescence change ((Fmax − Fo)/Fo = ΔFmax/Fo), the dissociation constant for the probe (OG-FXa) interaction (KP), and the stoichiometric factor (n) (29.Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Binding experiments for APC(S360A) competing with OG-FXa for FVa were performed by measurement of the OG-FXa fluorescence change at different fixed concentrations of FVa, followed by titration with APC(S360A). The direct titrations of FVa binding to OG-FXa and the competitive displacement curves at various FVa concentrations were analyzed simultaneously by fitting of the cubic binding equation for tight competitive binding to obtain KC and the stoichiometric factor (m) for the competitor binding to FVa. KP and/or ΔFmax/Fo for FVa binding to OG-FXa were allowed in some cases to vary to optimize the fit, with n fixed at its determined value. Nonlinear least square fitting was performed with SCIENTIST software (MicroMath). Fluorescence measurements were corrected for dilution and for background (≤10%) by subtraction of a buffer blank. Experimental error in the parameters represents ± 2 S.D. The Protein Data Bank coordinate file 1AUT for γ-carboxyglutamic acid domainless human APC (15.Mather T. Oganessyan V. Hof P. Huber R. Foundling S. Esmon C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6822-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was retrieved. This APC structure was energy-minimized, using the What If-Yasara twinset (Yasara Biosciences, Graz, Austria) employing the Yamber3 force field. Given that Protein Data Bank code 1AUT contains FPR-CH2Cl covalently attached to the active site, this structure was subsequently described as FPR-APC. Removal of the inhibitor from the molecule and subsequent energy minimization yielded a free APC structure. The free APC structure was used as a template to build a model for PMS-APC. To this end, the structural coordinates of PMSF were retrieved from the deposited structure of the PMSF-inhibited serine protease, human chymase (Protein Data Bank code 1KLT). After structural overlay of the catalytic domains of free APC and human chymase, the PMSF molecule was grafted onto Ser360(195) of APC. The resulting structure was energy-minimized and was subsequently described as PMS-APC. The free APC structure was likewise used as a template for creating a model of the active site-mutated APC(S360A). The free APC structure was mutated in silico at position Ser360(195) into Ala. The mutated structure was energy-minimized to calculate the optimal structure after mutation. The resulting structures of APC variants were analyzed using the What If-Yasara Twinset, CONCOORD (30.de Groot B.L. van Aalten D.M. Scheek R.M. Amadei A. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1997; 29: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and the ICM-Pro package (Molsoft, La Jolla, CA). The volume of the active site region for the different APC forms tested was calculated essentially as described previously (31.Segers K. Rosing J. Nicolaes G.A. Proteins. 2006; 64: 968-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using a cut-off distance of 8 Å from the catalytic site residues. Protein C variants were expressed under serum-free conditions at levels of ∼5 mg/liter and purified with overall recoveries of ∼40%. On SDS-PAGE, protein C(S360A) migrated with a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa. After reduction, the light chain as well as the α, β, and γ isoforms of the heavy chain were seen (data not shown). Upon activation by thrombin, the heavy chain isoforms shifted to slightly lower migration positions, consistent with full activation (>95%) as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified APC(S360A) preparation contained no measurable (<0.03%) amidolytic activity toward the chromogenic substrates S-2366 or S-2238. To establish further the functional integrity of the APC(S360A) mutant, its capacity to compete with wt-APC for inactivation of FVa was evaluated in a reaction system containing purified proteins and phospholipid vesicles. APC(S360A) competed with wt-APC in a dose-dependent manner, with inactivation of 0.5 nm FVa by 0.16 nm wt-APC half-maximally inhibited by 1.1 nm APC(S360A) (data not shown). The effect of APC(S360A) on the activity of the prothrombinase complex was tested by incubation of APC(S360A) (0–9.5 nm) with FVa, Ca2+, and phospholipid vesicles in the presence of varying concentrations of FXa (25 pm to 5 nm) before initiation of thrombin generation by the addition of prothrombin. In the presence of 5 nm FXa, 0–9.5 nm APC(S360A) only had a marginal effect on prothrombin activation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, at a low FXa concentration (25 pm) prothrombinase activity was reduced to ∼50% by 1.0 nm APC(S360A). Under these conditions, protein S (0–200 nm) had no effect on the inhibition of prothrombin activation by APC(S360A). Upon variation of the prothrombin concentration at a fixed concentration of FXa (50 pm), the effect of APC(S360A) was most prominent at low prothrombin concentrations (Fig. 1B), with a calculated half-maximal inhibition of prothrombin activation at 1.9–7.2 nm APC(S360A) in the presence of 0.5 and 10 μm prothrombin, respectively. At the near physiological concentration of 1.0 μm prothrombin, the concentration of APC(S360A) required to inhibit prothrombin activation by 50% was 2.5 nm. Because proteolytic inactivation of FVa by APC mainly proceeds through cleavage of two peptide bonds in FVa (Arg506 and Arg306), we used recombinant FV variants that can only be cleaved at one site to determine whether the effects observed with native (plasma-derived) FVa could be attributed specifically to one of these two cleavage sites. To this end, 7.2 pm of recombinant wild type FVa, FVa Q306R506Q679 (a recombinant FVaCambridge-like molecule) or FVa R306Q506Q679 (a recombinant FVaLeiden-like molecule) were incubated with phospholipid vesicles, 50 pm FXa, and increasing concentrations of APC(S360A). Residual FVa activity was determined by thrombin generation following the addition of 1 μm prothrombin. Inhibition of the cofactor activity of FVa Q306R506Q679 by APC(S360A) was virtually the same as that of wild type FVa (Fig. 1C). In contrast, inhibition of FVa R306Q506Q679 required APC(S360A) concentrations that were 2 orders of magnitude higher, indicating that the expression of the proteolysis-independent anticoagulant effect of APC(S360A) required the presence of Arg506. To quantitate the effect of APC(S360A) on the stability of the FVa·FXa complex, we performed fluorescence experiments with FXa that was active site-labeled with Oregon Green, linked by FPR-CH2Cl (OG-FXa). Analysis of data pooled from six titrations of 1.2 nm OG-FXa with native FVa gave KP of 0.14 ± 0.10 nm for binding to 0.82 ± 0.18 mol of FVa/mol of OG-FXa, accompanied by a 36 ± 2% enhancement in fluorescence (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W2088342137,"Posterior mapping is an increasingly popular hierarchical Bayesian based method used to infer character histories and reconstruct ancestral states at nodes of molecular phylogenies, notably of morphological characters. As for all Bayesian analyses specification of prior values is an integrative and important part of the analysis. He we provide an example of how alternative prior choices can seriously influence results and mislead interpretations.For two contrasting discrete morphological characters, namely a slow and a fast evolving character found in the plant family Annonaceae, we specified a total of eight different prior distributions per character. We investigated how these prior settings affected important summary statistics. Our analyses showed that the different prior distributions had marked effects on the results in terms of average number of character state changes. These differences arise because priors play a crucial role in determining which areas of parameter space the values of the simulation will be drawn from, independent of the data at hand. However, priors seemed to fit the data better if they would result in a more even sampling of parameter space (normal posterior distribution), in which case alternative standard deviation values had little effect on the results. The most probable character history for each character was affected differently by the prior. For the slower evolving character, the same character history always had the highest posterior probability independent of the priors used. In contrast, the faster evolving character showed different most probable character histories depending on the prior. These differences could be related to the level of homoplasy exhibited by each character.Although our analyses were restricted to two morphological characters within a single family, our results underline the importance of carefully choosing prior values for posterior mapping. Prior specification will be of crucial importance when interpreting the results in a meaningful way. It is hard to suggest a statistically sound method for prior specification without more detailed studies. Meanwhile, we propose that the data could be used to estimate the prior value of the gamma distribution placed on the transformation rate in posterior mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2036250566,"Cdk8 and its partner cyclin C form part of the mediator complex which links the basal transcription machinery to regulatory proteins. The pair are required for correct regulation of a subset of genes and have been implicated in control of development in a number of organisms including the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. When feeding, Dictyostelium amoebae are unicellular but upon starvation they aggregate to form a multicellular structure which develops into a fruiting body containing spores. Cells in which the gene encoding Cdk8 has been deleted fail to enter aggregates due to a failure of early gene expression.We have monitored the expression levels of cyclin C protein during development and find levels decrease after the multicellular mound is formed. This decrease is triggered by extracellular cAMP that, in turn, is working in part through an increase in intracellular cAMP. The loss of cyclin C is coincident with a reduction in the association of Cdk8 with a high molecular weight complex in the nucleus. Overexpression of cyclin C and Cdk8 lead to an increased rate of early development, consistent with the levels being rate limiting.Overall these results show that both cyclin C and Cdk8 are regulated during development in response to extracellular signals and the levels of these proteins are important in controlling the timing of developmental processes. These findings have important implications for the role of these proteins in controlling development, suggesting that they are targets for developmental signals to regulate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2050905185,"Background During transcription, the nontranscribed DNA strand becomes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which can form secondary structures. Unpaired bases in the ssDNA are less protected from mutagens and hence experience more mutations than do paired bases. These mutations are called transcription-associated mutations. Transcription-associated mutagenesis is increased under stress and depends on the DNA sequence. Therefore, selection might significantly influence protein-coding sequences in terms of the transcription-associated mutability per transcription event under stress to improve the survival of Escherichia coli. Methodology/Principal Findings The mutability index (MI) was developed by Wright et al. to estimate the relative transcription-associated mutability of bases per transcription event. Using the most stable fold of each ssDNA that have an average length n, MI was defined as (the number of folds in which the base is unpaired)/n×(highest –ΔG of all n folds in which the base is unpaired), where ΔG is the free energy. The MI values show a significant correlation with mutation data under stress but not with spontaneous mutations in E. coli. Protein sequence diversity is preferred under stress but not under favorable conditions. Therefore, we evaluated the selection pressure on MI in terms of the protein sequence diversity for all the protein-coding sequences in E. coli. The distributions of the MI values were lower at bases that could be substituted with each of the other three bases without affecting the amino acid sequence than at bases that could not be so substituted. Start codons had lower distributions of MI values than did nonstart codons. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the majority of protein-coding sequences have evolved to promote protein sequence diversity and to reduce gene knockout under stress. Consequently, transcription-associated mutagenesis increases protein sequence diversity more effectively than does random mutagenesis under stress. Nonrandom transcription-associated mutagenesis under stress should improve the survival of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2050469398,"Background With epidemics of influenza A virus infection, people and medical professionals are all concerned about symptoms or syndromes that may indicate the infection with influenza A virus. Methodology/Principal Findings A prospective study was performed at a community clinic of a metropolitan area. Throat swab was sampled for 3–6 consecutive adult patients with new episode (<3 days) of respiratory tract infection every weekday from Dec. 8, 2005 to Mar. 31, 2006. Demographic data, relevant history, symptoms and signs were recorded. Samples were processed with multiplex real time PCR for 9 common respiratory tract pathogens and by virus culture. Throat swab samples were positive for Influenza A virus with multiplex real time PCR system in 12 of 240 patients. The 12 influenza A positive cases were with more clusters and chills than the other 228. Certain symptoms and syndromes increased the likelihood of influenza A virus infection. The syndrome of high fever plus chills plus cough, better with clustering of cases in household or workplace, is with the highest likelihood (positive likelihood ratio 95; 95% CI 12–750). Absence of both cluster and chills provides moderate evidence against the infection (negative likelihood ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.29–0.90). Conclusions/Significance Syndromic recognition is not diagnostic but is useful for discriminating between influenza A infection and common cold. In addition to relevant travel history, confirmatory molecular test can be applied to subjects with high likelihood when the disease prevalence is low."
