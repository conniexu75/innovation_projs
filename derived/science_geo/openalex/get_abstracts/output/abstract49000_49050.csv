https://openalex.org/W2122740168,"We have found a novel activity in Tetrahymena cell free extracts that adds tandem TTGGGG repeats onto synthetic telomere primers. The single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (TTGGGG)4 and TGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGG, consisting of the Tetrahymena and yeast telomeric sequences respectively, each functioned as primers for elongation, while (CCCCAA)4 and two nontelomeric sequence DNA oligomers did not. Efficient synthesis of the TTGGGG repeats depended only on addition of micromolar concentrations of oligomer primer, dGTP, and dTTP to the extract. The activity was sensitive to heat and proteinase K treatment. The repeat addition was independent of both endogenous Tetrahymena DNA and the endogenous alpha-type DNA polymerase; and a greater elongation activity was present during macronuclear development, when a large number of telomeres are formed and replicated, than during vegetative cell growth. We propose that the novel telomere terminal transferase is involved in the addition of telomeric repeats necessary for the replication of chromosome ends in eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2131770328,"We describe a new protein that binds to DNA and activates gene transcription in yeast. This protein, LexA-GAL4, is a hybrid of LexA, an Escherichia coli repressor protein, and GAL4, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional activator. The hybrid protein, synthesized in yeast, activates transcription of a gene if and only if a lexA operator is present near the transcription start site. Thus, the DNA binding function of GAL4 can be replaced with that of a prokaryotic repressor without loss of the transcriptional activation function. These results suggest that DNA-bound LexA-GAL4 and DNA-bound GAL4 activate transcription by contacting other proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1981601576,"The yeast GCN4 gene product is necessary for the transcriptional induction of many amino acid biosynthetic genes in response to conditions of amino acid starvation. We synthesized radioactively pure GCN4 protein by in vitro translation of mRNA produced by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase. GCN4 protein binds specifically to the 20 bp region of the HIS3 gene that is critical for transcriptional regulation in vivo and contains the TGACTC sequence common to coregulated genes. A synthetic GCN4 mutant protein lacking the 40 C-terminal amino acids fails to bind DNA; this correlates with a gcn4 mutant gene that is nonfunctional in vivo. Finally, GCN4 protein binds to the promoter regions of coordinately regulated genes, but not to analogous regions of other genes. We suggest that GCN4 protein is a specific transcription factor, and we describe a molecular model for the general control of amino acid biosynthetic genes."

https://openalex.org/W1480686961,"The effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on protein kinase C was studied by metabolically labeling GH3 cells with [35S]methionine and using a polyclonal antibody raised against rat brain protein kinase C to immunoprecipitate the enzyme. PMA accelerates the loss of immunologically reactive protein kinase C from the cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The half-life of the enzyme in cells treated with 400 nM PMA was 2 h whereas in control cells 60-70% of the enzyme was still detectable after 24 h. The concentration of PMA required to reduce cellular protein kinase C 50% after 24 h was 130 nM. PMA also induced the translocation of [35S]Met-labeled protein kinase C from the cytosol to the membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. Less protein kinase C was translocated to membranes when cells were treated with 20 nM PMA than when they were exposed to 400 nM PMA. In the latter case, most of the labeled protein kinase C became membrane-associated. Maximal translocation was evident after 15 min of incubation with either concentration of PMA and was followed by degradation of the membrane-associated enzyme. The rate of degradation of membrane-associated protein kinase C was the same with both concentrations of PMA. In cells treated with 20 nM PMA, disappearance of [35S]Met-labeled protein kinase C from the cytosolic fraction occurred in two phases, a rapid decrease characteristic of the membrane-associated enzyme, followed by a slower loss similar to that seen in control cells. The results indicate that turnover of protein kinase C is enhanced by membrane association."
https://openalex.org/W1993341657,"We have analyzed the localization of the human c-myc product (p62c-myc) at steady state in cells by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. We show that p62c-myc is extracted from nuclei by mild salt concentrations (below 200 mM), without affecting gross nuclear structure or causing extraction of major chromatin components. We observe no association between p62c-myc and the nuclear matrix. We also demonstrate that p62c-myc is a member of a discrete subset of nuclear proteins that are all rendered irreversibly insoluble in situ by exposure of isolated nuclei to physiological temperatures (37 degrees C). p62c-myc is sequestered into a similar insoluble complex in cells that have been subjected to heat shock. Finally, we show that avian v-myc and v-myb proteins in isolated nuclei also become insoluble after exposure to temperatures above 37 degrees C. We discuss the possible implications of these results."

https://openalex.org/W1555196812,"Rabbit alveolar macrophages rapidly internalize and degrade mannosylated bovine serum albumin (125I-mannose-BSA). Trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products appear in the cells as early as 6 min after uptake at 37 degrees C, and in the extracellular medium after 10 min. Incubation of endocytic vesicles containing this ligand in isotonic buffers at pH 7.4 + ATP resulted in intravesicular proteolysis, which was inhibited by monensin, nigericin, or ammonium chloride. At pH 5.0, degradation proceeded rapidly and was abolished by lysis of the vesicles with 0.1% Triton X-100. Readdition of lysosomes to the incubation mixture did not increase the rate of prelysosomal degradation. Proteolysis of 125I-mannose-BSA was optimal at pH 4.5, and inhibited by low concentrations of the cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A. After subcellular fractionation of the macrophages on Percoll gradients, 125I-mannose-BSA sedimented with prelysosomal vesicles and was not transported to secondary lysosomes. Addition of pepstatin A to extracellular medium during internalization of prebound 125I-mannose-BSA partially inhibited degradation of ligand, and resulted in transfer of undegraded 125I-mannose-BSA to lysosomes after 20 min. Using 125I-bovine serum albumin as a substrate for the protease in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, we have shown that as much as 36% of the total pepstatin A-sensitive activity sediments with nonlysosomal membranes. After intraendosomal iodination using lactoperoxidase, a labeled protease was isolated by affinity chromatography on pepstatin-agarose. The labeled protease, which had a subunit size of 46 kDa, was detected in endocytic vesicles after 5 min of internalization. These results suggest that a cathepsin D-like protease is responsible for the degradation of 125I-mannose-BSA in macrophages, and that this ligand is degraded in a prelysosomal vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W2094230374,"A yeast genomic DNA expression library in Î»gt11 and antibody prepared against yeast DNA polymerase I were used to isolate the gene encoding DNA polymerase I. The identity of the DNA polymerase I gene was determined by several criteria. First, the clone-encoded protein is immunologically related to DNA polymerase I. Second, cells containing the gene cloned in the high copy number plasmid YEp24 overproduce the polymerase activity 4- to 5-fold as measured in yeast extracts. Finally, insertion of the gene downstream from a bacteriophage T7 promoter allows synthesis of yeast DNA polymerase I in Escherichia coli. Gene disruption and Southern hybridization experiments show that the polymerase is encoded by an essential, single copy gene. Examination of the germinated spores containing the disrupted gene reveals a defect in nuclear division and a terminal phenotype typical of replication mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1566898379,"Neuronal cells from 1-day-old rat brain in primary culture have been utilized in the present study to characterize insulin-binding sites and a possible action of insulin on these cells. Binding of 125I-insulin to neuronal cultures was 90% specific and time-dependent and reached equilibrium in 120 min. Specific binding was reversible with greater than 90% of binding dissociable within 120 min with a t1/2 of dissociation of 15 min. Various insulin analogues competed for 125I-insulin binding to neuronal cultures according to their known biological potencies. Scatchard analysis of competition data yielded a typical curvilinear plot providing a class of high affinity (Kd = 11 nM) and low affinity (Kd = 65 nM) binding sites. Light microscopic autoradiographic analysis of 125I-insulin bound to neuronal cultures revealed the presence of silver grains predominantly on the neurites with occasional occurrence on the cell soma. Insulin had no effect on neuronal 2-deoxyglucose uptake in contrast with our previous findings demonstrating a 2-fold stimulation of 2-dGlc uptake into astrocyte glial cells from rat brain (Clarke, D.W., Boyd, F.T., Jr., Kappy, M.S., and Raizada, M. K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11672-11675). Incubation of neuronal cultures with insulin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine uptake with significant inhibition occurring at 1.67 X 10(-11) M. These findings demonstrate that: 1) neuronal cells in primary culture possess specific insulin receptors which are predominantly located on neurites and 2) insulin modulates monoamine uptake in these cultures which suggests that insulin may modulate neural signaling via specific neuronal insulin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1489869268,"Procollagen carboxyl-terminal proteinase, the enzyme which cleaves the carboxyl-terminal propeptides from type I procollagen, was extensively purified in a yield of 25% from pooled culture media of 17-day-old chick embryo tendons using a procedure which involved chromatography on Green A Dye matrix gel, concanavalin A-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose, and filtration gels of Sephacryl S-300 and S-200. The purified enzyme is a neutral, Ca2+-dependent proteinase which is inhibited by metal chelators, but not by inhibitors for serine and cysteine proteinases. Calcium in a concentration of 5-10 mM is required for optimal activity. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 97,000-110,000 by gel filtration and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Other properties of the carboxyl-terminal proteinase are: 1) the Km for the type I procollagen is 96 nM at pH 7.5 and 35 degrees C; 2) the activation energy for the reaction with type I procollagen is 21,000 cal mol-1; 3) amino acid sequencing of the released carboxyl-terminal propeptide indicated the enzyme specifically cleaves an -Ala-Asp- bond in both the pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains; 4) the enzyme specifically cleaves the carboxyl-terminal propeptides of a homotrimer of pro-alpha 1(I) chains and type II and III procollagens, but it does not cleave type IV procollagen. The results suggest that the enzyme is involved in the processing of type I procollagen in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1990157475,"Mutations in the yeast gene ARD1 lead to inability to respond to alpha-factor, inability to enter stationary phase, and inability to sporulate, suggesting an important role for the ARD1 gene product in controlling the switch between the mitotic cell cycle and alternative cell fates. MATa, ard1 cells seem to be defective in the expression of all a-specific functions, whereas MAT alpha, ard1 cells respond normally to a-factor. We propose that ARD1 is required for the expression of genes involved in a-mating functions, stationary phase, and sporulation. The ARD1 gene has been cloned and sequenced; there is weak homology between the C terminus of the ARD1 protein, the C-terminal region of MAT alpha 2, and the homeo box."

https://openalex.org/W1592699099,"Temperature-sensitive mutants of Salmonella typhimurium that are defective in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate are known to accumulate disaccharide precursor(s) of lipid A at 42 degrees C (Rick, P. D., Fung, L. W.-M., Ho, C., and Osborn, M. J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4904-4912). We have devised new methods for purifying this material by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and silicic acid columns and have fractionated it into eight related anionic components that fall into four sets, as judged by their charge. Substances IA and IB have an apparent net charge of -1, IIA and IIB of -2, IIIA and IIIB of -3, and IVA and IVB of -4. Negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry reveals that the simplest component is IVA [( M - H]- at m/z 1404). Compound IVA is also the most abundant, representing 30-50% of the accumulated lipids after 3 h at 42 degrees C. Structural studies of IVA, including NMR spectroscopy described in the accompanying paper, reveal that it consists of O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1â-6)-2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha - D-glucose, acylated at positions 2, 3, 2', and 3' with beta-hydroxymyristoyl moieties and bearing phosphate groups at positions 1 and 4'. Compound IIIA ([M - H]- at m/z 1527) contains an additional phosphoethanolamine residue, while IIA ([M - H]- m/z 1535) bears an aminodeoxypentose substituent, presumably 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose. Compound IA ([M - H]- at m/z 1658) bears both a phosphoethanolamine and an aminodeoxypentose. The compounds of the less abundant B series are further derivatized with an ester-linked palmitoyl moiety. Our results demonstrate that these precursors are far more heterogeneous than previously suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2029210883,"Phosphatidylinositol turnover has recently been implicated in the regulation of proliferation and transformation. Its role in differentiation has now been investigated using Friend erythroleukemia cells, which can be induced to differentiate along the erythroid pathway by dimethylsulfoxide and certain other agents. We have found that levels of the phosphatidylinositol metabolites inositol-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol significantly decrease within 2 hr of induction of Friend cell differentiation. These decreases precede decreased expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene and its protein product. Phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate, which can mimic diacylglycerol, blocked differentiation without reversing the decrease in phosphatidylinositol metabolite levels. Two synthetic diacylglycerols, L-alpha-1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, also blocked differentiation and commitment. Diacylglycerol regulation of kinase C activity may play a key role in control of c-myc expression and Friend cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2126764789,"We have examined the distribution of the antigen-specific, major histocompatibility complex-restricted receptor on mouse thymocytes in situ, using immunohistochemical techniques and the monoclonal antibody KJ16-133. This antibody reacts with the beta chain of the receptors on about 20% of peripheral murine T cells. Of the cortical thymocytes reacting with KJ16-133, cells with only cytoplasmic staining were most frequently observed. Such cytoplasmic staining was not observed in the medulla. Occasional cortical cells had low levels of surface expression, which was almost invariably patched in the region of contact with epithelial cell processes. KJ16-133+ medullary thymocytes had high levels of uniform surface labeling. These results suggest that thymic selection of MHC restriction and/or tolerance may occur in the cortex, where the receptors on maturing thymocytes interact with MHC proteins on epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559225650,"The Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli has previously been shown to utilize two unique glucosamine (GlcN)-derived phospholipids in the biosynthesis of lipid A disaccharides (Bulawa, C.E., and Raetz, C. R.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4846-4851; Ray, B. L., Painter, G.L., and Raetz, C.R.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4852-4859. We now present evidence that these compounds, UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN and 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-phosphate (2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P), are generated in extracts of E. coli by fatty acylation of UDP-GlcNAc. The initial reaction is an O-acylation of the glucosamine ring, presumably of the 3-OH group, with (R)-beta-hydroxymyristate, followed by removal of the acetyl moiety, and further fatty acylation of the N atom with (R)-beta-hydroxymyristate to yield UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN. Hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bridge in this molecule gives 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P + UMP. In vivo pulse labeling with 32Pi supports this postulated pathway, since UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN is labeled prior to 2,3-diacyl-GlcN-1-P. UDP-glucosamine is inactive as a substrate in the initial acylation reaction. These acylations show an absolute specificity for fatty acyl moieties activated with acyl carrier protein. No reaction is detected with fatty acyl-CoA or free fatty acid. The fatty acylation of sugar nucleotides has not been reported previously in E. coli or any other organism."
https://openalex.org/W1530516996,"Matrix vesicles (MV) can be readily isolated from culture media of chicken growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes grown in primary culture. The chondrocytes maintain normal morphology and synthesize type II collagen throughout the culture period. The culture-derived MV are morphologically indistinguishable from MV seen in situ and are rich in alkaline phosphatase. Formation of alkaline phosphatase-rich MV is strongly influenced by the stage of culture: large numbers are released shortly after cell seeding; marked decline is seen during cell spreading and rapid cell division; notable resurgence in alkaline phosphatase-rich MV production occurs as the cells attain confluency. Increasing the initial chondrocyte seeding density proportionately increases MV production. Cells derived from the hypertrophic region are much more capable of forming alkaline phosphatase-rich MV than those from the proliferating zone, indicating that MV formation is dependent on cellular differentiation. MV released by the cultured chondrocytes were compared in protein and phospholipid composition and in their ability to accumulate mineral ions, with plasma membrane fractions and collagenase-released MV obtained from the same tissue. Electrophoretic patterns of proteins, and the phospholipid profiles, suggest that significant modification of the plasma membrane occurs during MV formation. The vesicles are capable of accumulating large amounts of mineral ions from a metastable synthetic cartilage lymph when supplied with alkaline phosphatase substrates. This culture system thus appears to be a useful model for isolating native MV and characterizing factors required for vesicle formation and mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W155521478,"Eight anionic disaccharide precursors of lipid A accumulate at 42 degrees C in 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid-deficient temperature-sensitive mutants of Salmonella typhimurium. These compounds comprise a series of lipids based on the minimal structure, O-[2-amino-2-deoxy-N2,O3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranos yl] -(1â-6)-2-amino-2-deoxy-N2, O3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranose 1,4'- bisphosphate (designated lipid IVA) that differ from each other by the presence of an additional phosphoethanolamine moiety (IIIA), or an aminodeoxypentose moiety (IIA), or both (IA). A homologous set of metabolites is further derivatized with a palmitoyl function; these are designated IVB, IIIB, IIB, and IB (Raetz, C. R. H., Purcell, S., Meyer, M. V., Qureshi, N., and Takayama, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 16080-16088). The attachment of the palmitoyl moiety, known to be on the reducing terminal GlcN residue by mass spectrometry, was determined to be O-beta of the N2-linked beta-hydroxymyristoyl group of that residue of IVB by 13C NMR and two-dimensional 1H chemical shift correlation spectroscopy experiments. 31P NMR indicated the presence of diphosphodiester moieties in IIIA, IIIB, and IA and monophosphodiester moieties in IIA and IA. Selective 1H decoupling of the 31P spectrum of IIIA demonstrated that the O-diphosphoethanolamine moiety is attached to the O4' position in IIIA. On the basis of the observed 31P chemical shifts it was concluded that the aminodeoxypentose is located at position 1 in IIA and IA, while diphosphoethanolamine is most likely located at O-4' in IA and IIIB, as in IIIA."

https://openalex.org/W2003349457,"Most secretory proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are synthesized from a precursor with an amino-terminal extension of 20 to 25 amino acid residues called a signal peptide. These signal peptides are removed during translocation of the secretory proteins across the membrane. When two precursor structures are fused, the internalized second signal peptide was found to exert two different roles, depending upon either the distance between the two signal peptides, or whether the first signal peptide functions cotranslationally or posttranslationally. One role is to function as the usual signal peptide to translocate the protein downstream of the internal signal peptide. The other role is to function as a stop-transfer signal to create a transmembrane protein with the second signal peptide anchoring the protein in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1518819591,"Gene 8 of bacteriophage M13 codes for procoat, the precursor of its major coat protein. Gene 8 has been cloned into a plasmid and mutagenized. We have isolated mutants of this gene in which procoat is synthesized but is not processed to coat protein. We now describe mutants in the leader region of procoat, at positions -6, -3, and -1 with respect to the leader peptidase cleavage site. These positions are quite conserved among the leader peptides of various pre-proteins. Each of these mutant procoats is synthesized at a normal rate and inserts correctly into the plasma membrane, as judged by its accessibility to protease in intact spheroplasts. Procoat accumulates, largely in its transmembrane form, and is not cleaved to coat. In detergent extracts, the mutant procoats are very poor substrates for added leader peptidase. We conclude that these 3 residues are not conserved for insertion across the membrane but are part of an essential recognition site for the leader peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1581154961,"Yeast RNA polymerase C purified by a simple large scale method was resolved into multiple components by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specific antibodies directed against each polypeptide chain were prepared in rabbits and used as structural and functional probes. With minor exceptions, each antibody recognized specifically the corresponding polypeptide by blot-immunodetection. Cross-reactions with purified RNA polymerases A and B confirmed our previous description of the subunits shared by the three nuclear RNA polymerases. Immunoadsorption of RNA polymerase C at different stages of purification using antibodies to subunits C160 and C128 yielded the same collection of polypeptides as found in the purified enzyme: C160, C128, C82, C53, C40, C37, C34, C31, C27, C25, C23, C19, C14.5, C12.5, and C10. Subunit-specific antibodies were used to probe the activity of RNA polymerase C in a specific, reconstituted transcription system as well as on a nonspecific template. Transcription of the tRNAGlu3 gene in vitro was inhibited when RNA polymerase C was preincubated with antibodies directed to C128, C82, C53, C34, C23, or C19. Antibodies to C82, C53, and C34 were much less inhibitory in the nonspecific assay. Inhibition by anti-C128 or anti-C23 was relieved by preincubation of enzyme C with plasmid DNA prior to antibody addition. These results are discussed in terms of the participation of these polypeptides to the active enzyme molecule, and of their possible role in DNA binding or transcription factor recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1589850719,"Experiments were conducted to investigate the action of insulin alone on the induction of a specific mRNA referred to as p33. In 24-h serum-deprived rat liver hepatoma cells (H4) grown in monolayer cultures, insulin induced a 3-fold increase in the levels of p33 mRNA within 30 min, and a maximum 10-fold increase was observed by 1 h. The effects of insulin were evident at concentrations as low as 10(-12) M and were maximal at 0.5-1 X 10(-8) M. The effect of insulin was specific, since the level of mRNA for the histocompatibility complex, H2d, was unaffected by insulin. The increase in p33 mRNA was not due to an effect of insulin on the stabilization of mRNA, since insulin did not alter the half-life of this message. In addition, two different RNA synthesis inhibitors blocked the stimulation of p33 mRNA production by insulin. These data suggest that insulin may specifically stimulate the synthesis of p33 mRNA which results in an increased accumulation of total cellular p33 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1671970356,"Monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against DNA polymerase-alpha substantially inhibit nuclear DNA replication in lysolecithin-permeabilized cultured human fibroblasts. The degree of inhibition of DNA synthesis is proportional to antibody concentration, and the effect is specific in that RNA synthesis measured under the same experimental conditions is unperturbed. Autoradiographic data demonstrate that the magnitude of the inhibition measured in the mass culture reflects the uniform response of all the constituent cells in the target population. These observations confirm the participation of DNA polymerase-alpha in replicative DNA synthesis and identify a versatile, novel approach to the dissection of mammalian processes of DNA replication and repair."

https://openalex.org/W192672120,"The biosynthesis and post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing and core glycosylation, of the human renin precursor have been studied in vitro in a cell-free system. For this purpose, highly enriched renin mRNA was isolated from a renin-producing juxtaglomerular cell tumor and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of dog pancreas microsomal membranes. Fluorographic analysis of the radioactive translation products, immunoprecipitated and then resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that the primary translation product, preprorenin (Mr = 45,000), is initially processed to glycosylated prorenin (Mr = 47,000) during or shortly after its sequestration into the lumen of the microsomal membranes. The vectorial translocation across the membrane was confirmed by the observation that the proform was resistant to digestion with trypsin while preprorenin was sensitive. Radiosequencing and the use of prorenin-specific antibodies established the cleavage points of the pre- and profragment and showed that the in vitro precursor of human renin contains a 23-residue signal peptide and a 43-residue prosegment. The post-translational modification which, despite the removal of signal peptide, resulted in an increase in apparent Mr, reflects the glycosylation as examined using Xenopus oocytes microinjected with renin mRNA in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation. Four anti-peptide antibodies which specifically recognize the NH2 terminus (Pro 1), two middle parts (Pro 2A and Pro 2B), and COOH terminus (Pro 3) of the prosegment, respectively, have been raised and used to characterize plasma prorenin. Renin precursors (pre- and prorenin) synthesized in vitro or in the kidney reacted with these antibodies (anti-Pro 1, anti-Pro 2A, anti-Pro 2B, and anti-Pro 3). However, quite unexpectedly, human plasma prorenin was recognized only by anti-Pro 3, indicating that plasma prorenin is a truncated version of intact prorenin, which lacks a large portion of the NH2 terminus of the prosegment and may represent an activation intermediate. This somewhat surprising result may lead to a better understanding of the exact roles and activation mechanisms of plasma prorenin existing in a relatively large amount."

https://openalex.org/W1678690938,"We have studied the susceptibility of fibrils formed from fetal bovine skin type III collagen to proteolytic enzymes known to cleave within the helical portion of the molecule (vertebrate and microbial collagenase, polymorphonuclear elastase, trypsin, thermolysin) and to two general proteases of broad specificity (plasmin, Pronase). Fibrils reconstituted from neutral salt solutions, at 35 degrees C, were highly resistant to nonspecific proteolysis by general proteases such as polymorphonuclear elastase, trypsin, and thermolysin but were rapidly dissolved by bacterial and vertebrate collagenases at rates of 12-45 mol X mol-1 X h-1. In solution, type III collagen was readily cleaved by each of the proteases (with the exception of plasmin), as well as by the true collagenases, although at different rates. Turnover numbers determined by viscometry at 35 degrees C were: human collagenase, approximately equal to 1500 h-1; microbial (clostridial) collagenase, approximately equal to 100 h-1; and general proteases, 23-52 h-1. In addition it was shown that pronase cleaves type III collagen in solution at 22 degrees C by attacking the same Arg-Gly bond in the alpha 1(III) chain as trypsin. However, like other proteases, Pronase was rather ineffective against fibrillar forms of type III collagen. It was also shown that transition of type III collagen as well as type I collagen to the fibrillar form resulted in a significant gain of triple helical thermostability as evidenced by a 6.8 degrees C increase in denaturation temperature (Tm = 40.2 degrees C in solution; Tm = 47.0 degrees C in fibrils)."
https://openalex.org/W1540586501,"The function of the NH2-terminal signal peptide in the translocation of beta-lactamase across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli has been studied by characterization of 15 signal sequence mutants. Three amino acid substitutions (Pro 20 to Ser, Pro 20 to Phe, and Cys 18 to Tyr) in the 23-amino acid signal sequence each cause, to varying degrees, a defect in the proteolytic processing of pre-beta-lactamase, abnormal growth of the host strain, and a severe reduction in the expression of beta-lactamase in vivo but not in vitro. The results are consistent with a model for protein secretion in E. coli that parallels the pathway proposed for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum in eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2124009438,"We have investigated the assembly of the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) subunits after their processing and segregation into the periplasmic space as mature LT A and LT B polypeptides. LT B starts associating into oligomers during or immediately after translocation through the cytoplasmic membrane. Binding to LT A occurs immediately after oligomerization. Over 80% of the LT B subunits have oligomerized, and over 50% have associated with LT A into holotoxin within 1 min after synthesis. The fate of newly synthesized LT A is totally different. There is an extensive overproduction of LT A relative to LT B and after membrane translocation it becomes part of a periplasmic pool of free LT A. It is then bound by LT B oligomers or degraded at such a rate that the free periplasmic LT A disappears from the pool with a half-time of 20-25 min. About half of the LT A is incorporated into holotoxin, while the other half is degraded. We conclude that LT subunits are translocated and processed in a ratio of about 2 A to 5 B. Since free LT A is either degraded slowly or bound to newly synthesized LT B oligomers, the net result is a steady state of 1.4 to 1.7 A subunits to 5 B subunits in the periplasm. About 60% of this LT A is bound by LT B to form periplasmic holotoxin with a subunit ratio of about 1 A to 5 B. The remaining 40% of periplasmic LT A occurs free."
https://openalex.org/W1518926372,"Interaction of Phe-tRNA.elongation factor Tu.GTP with poly(U)-programmed ribosomes containing an occupied P site can be described by a three-step kinetic mechanism. Initial binding is followed by the cleavage of GTP, and then a new peptide bond is formed. Rate constants controlling the first and third of these reactions are known, but only a lower limit for the rate constant of the cleavage step has been reported. We have determined this rate constant to be 20 s-1 at 5 degrees C, 30 s-1 at 15 degrees C, and 50 s-1 at 25 degrees C. This is much faster than the reverse step of the initial binding process and implies that the intrinsic accuracy of the ribosome in the initial selection step is sacrificed in favor of speed. The similarity of the kinetic and chemical mechanism of this GTP cleavage step with other nucleoside 5'-triphosphatases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1570667731,"The motor nerves to rat soleus and epitrochlearis muscles were sectioned 1-3 days before the muscles were incubated in vitro to assess insulin action and binding. The hormonal stimulation of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen in both muscles was decreased by over 80% after 3 days of denervation. Associated with the reductions in glycogen synthesis were losses in the ability of insulin to activate glycogen synthase. Even so, denervated and control muscles bound the same amounts of 125I-labeled insulin over a wide range of insulin concentrations. Scatchard analysis indicates that denervation changed neither receptor numbers nor affinities. The results presented strongly suggest that the loss of the ability of insulin to stimulate glycogen synthesis following denervation is the result of a postreceptor defect."
https://openalex.org/W1968554925,"In certain strains of mice, bone marrow grafts from parental donors fail to grow in first-generation hybrid mice. This ""hybrid resistance"" of nonsensitized F1 hybrid mice to the engraftment of parental hematopoietic transplants contradicts the classical laws of transplantation and is dependent on a radioresistant but immunogenetically specific effector mechanism. Studies in a new in vitro model reveal that committed hematopoietic precursors of parental origin can be inactivated by direct contact with natural killer-like splenic effectors from F1 mice. The reaction requires genetically restricted recognition, since only parental competitors syngeneic to the target bone marrow cells partially reversed this inactivation. Models of this type may be useful in studying the possible role of natural resistance in bone marrow transplantation in humans."
https://openalex.org/W38815917,"DNA affinity chromatography has been used to identify the major single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins (SSBs) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There are five abundant species having molecular masses of 50, 45, 31, 23, and 20 kDa. Four of these proteins are cytoplasmic and one is mitochondrial. To date, three of the proteins have been purified to homogeneity. The purified proteins are designated SSB-m, SSB-1, and SSB-2, with molecular masses of 20, 45, and 50 kDa, respectively. SSB-m is found only in mitochondrial subcellular fractions. SSB-1 stimulates purified yeast DNA polymerase I, while SSB-2 inhibits DNA polymerase I. An antibody against SSB-1 has been prepared in rabbits and purified by SSB-1-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified antibody specifically inhibits DNA synthesis in an in vitro replication system, suggesting that SSB-1 may be involved in DNA replication in vivo. SSB-2 has the highest affinity for single-stranded DNA of all three proteins. It may represent a new class of eukaryotic SSB, on the basis of molecular weight, inhibition of DNA polymerase and antigenicity. Antibodies have also been prepared against SSB-2. The immunological reagents have been used to show that SSB-1, SSB-2, and SSB-m are antigenically distinct, as well as to study the relationship of these three SSBs to other proteins in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1589580730,"Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase catalyzes the adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent conversion of ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and ammonia. During this reaction, a hydrogen atom migrates from the carbinol carbon of ethanolamine to the methyl carbon of acetaldehyde. Previous studies have shown that this migrating hydrogen equilibrates with the hydrogens on the 5'-(cobalt-linked) carbon of the cofactor. On the basis of those studies, a two-step mechanism for hydrogen transfer has been postulated in which the migrating hydrogen is first transferred from the substrate to the cofactor, then in a subsequent step is returned from the cofactor to the product. We now show that this migrating hydrogen is transferred not only to the cofactor, but also to a second acceptor at the active site. Hydrogens on this acceptor do not exchange with water during the course of the reaction, but are released to water when the enzyme is denatured. The catalytic significance of this second hydrogen acceptor was demonstrated by the findings that the transfer of hydrogen to this acceptor required both AdoCbl and active enzyme and that hydrogen at the second acceptor site could be washed out by unlabeled ethanolamine. On the basis of these results, we propose an expanded hydrogen transfer mechanism in which AdoCbl and the second acceptor site serve as alternative intermediate hydrogen carriers during the course of ethanolamine deamination."

A. 82, 3959-3963) previously isolated lactose carrier mutants which were able to transport maltose. All of the mutants were found to be single amino acid substitutions for alanine 177 or for tyrosine 236. In the present study, we have examined the ability of these mutants to transport maltose, lactose, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, methyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and H+. Both the position 177 and 236 mutants have enhanced rates of maltose transport and exhibit apparent Km values for maltose which are substantially less than that of the wild-type strain. The position 177 mutants transport lactose and other galactosides at a normal rate and with normal affinity during downhill transport and show counterflow transport rates which are faster than the wild-type strain. Interestingly, these mutants are markedly defective in accumulating substrates against a concentration gradient, yet retain a normal H+:galactoside stoichiometry. The position 236 mutants appear to be defective in the downhill, uphill, and counterflow transport of galactosides but exhibit a normal H+:galactoside stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W1974021446,"The pathway of RNA polymerase entry at the lac promoter was studied by investigating the relationship between the promoter and a weak, overlapping polymerase interaction site (P2). If polymerase is made to enter the DNA by binding in vitro at this P2 site, cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) actively removes polymerase and redirects it to the promoter. A template competition experiment demonstrates that RNA polymerase initially bound at P2 does not slide the 22 base pairs along the DNA from this ""entry"" site to the promoter, but must locate the promoter by first leaving the template. We infer that CRP works by binding DNA in a way that both clears the promoter and modifies it to assume a form that is a better receptor for the binding of RNA polymerase from free solution."
https://openalex.org/W1531976882,"Methionyl-tRNA synthetase has been purified from a yeast strain carrying the MES1 structural gene on a high copy number plasmid (pFL1). The purified enzyme is a monomer of Mr = 85,000 in contrast to its counterpart from Escherichia coli which is a dimer made up of identical subunits (Mr = 76,000; Dardel, F., Fayat, G., and Blanquet, S. (1984) J. Bacteriol. 160, 1115-1122). The yeast enzyme was not amenable to Edman's degradation indicating a blocked NH2 terminus. Its primary structure as derived from the DNA sequence (Walter, P., Gangloff, J., Bonnet, J., Boulanger, Y., Ebel, J.P., and Fasiolo, F. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 2437-2441) has been confirmed using the fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric method. This method was applied to tryptic digests of the carboxymethylated enzyme and the corresponding data provided extensive coverage of the translated DNA sequence, thus confirming its correctness. The ambiguity concerning which of the three NH2-terminally located methionine codons is the initiation codon was easily resolved from peptides identified in this region. It was possible to show that the first methionine had been removed and that the new NH2 terminus, serine, had been acetylated. A comparison between the yeast and E. coli sequences shows that the former has an N-terminal extension of about 200 residues as compared to the latter. It also lacks the C-terminal domain which is responsible for the dimerization of the E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1555215750,"Maltose binding protein, like most periplasmic proteins, is resistant to a variety of proteinases. Treatment of pre-maltose binding protein with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or proteinase K removes an amino-terminal domain of the same approximate size as the leader sequence without degrading the mature portion of the protein. In addition, pre-maltose binding protein is as active as mature in binding maltose (Ferenci, T., and Randall, L.L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9979-9981). By these criteria, the precursor and mature proteins are in the same conformation except for the exposed leader sequence on the precursor. We have compared the ability of these proteins to interact with amphipaths, such as detergents. The precursor protein binds to Triton X-100, while the mature protein does not. We propose that the leader domain is responsible for detergent binding. Mutations in the leader region of the precursor which block export in vivo prevent detergent binding in vitro. A mutant with a mild export defect can still bind detergent. This correlation between detergent binding by precursors with related leaders and export efficiency of each precursor suggests that hydrophobic partition of the leader may initiate pre-protein transfer across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1555716516,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Escherichia coli and subcomplexes derived from it by selective removal of component enzymes have been subjected to quaternary structural analysis by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Scanning transmission electron microscopic images of the intact complex (E1E2E3), the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase-dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E2E3) subcomplex, and the E2 core enzyme appear as cubic particles in various orientations. Mass distributions within this complex and its subcomplexes have been determined by radial mass analysis of similarly oriented scanning transmission electron microscopic images of each type. The data show that mass attributable to dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) is well integrated into the structural framework of the E2 core, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, whereas mass attributable to pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is located about the periphery of the core enzyme. The mass distributions are fully consistent with a structural model in which 6 E3 dimers are integrated into the six faces of the cubic E2 core, and 12 E1 dimers are associated along the 12 edges of the core enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W10998373,"Pyruvate oxidase is a flavoprotein dehydrogenase isolated from Escherichia coli which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetate and CO2. In vivo, the enzyme can bind to the bacterial membrane and reduce ubiquinone-8, feeding electrons into the respiratory chain. The purified enzyme has been shown previously to bind to phospholipids and detergents and, upon doing so, is activated. The turnover with ferricyanide as an electron acceptor increases 20- to 30-fold upon lipid binding. In this work, initial velocity and stop-flow kinetics are used to investigate the activation of this enzyme. It is shown that the unactivated form of the enzyme is markedly hysteretic. Progress curves at low substrate concentrations show an initial acceleration in enzyme turnover. This is consistent with the results of stop-flow experiments. Rates obtained for either the reduction of the unactivated flavoprotein by pyruvate or its reoxidation by ferricyanide in single turnover experiments are much slower than the rates predicted by observed turnover in initial velocity studies, in some cases by more than 2 orders of magnitude. The data are best explained by the slow interconversion between two forms of the enzyme, one with low turnover and one which rapidly turns over. As isolated, the enzyme is highly unreactive, as revealed by the stop-flow experiments. During turnover, even in the absence of lipid activators, some of the enzyme converts to the rapid-turnover form. This slow interconversion is shown by kinetic simulation to preclude a steady state from being established. Lipid activators appear to shift the equilibrium to favor the rapid-turnover form of the enzyme. Once the enzyme is locked into an activated conformation, the hysteresis is no longer observed, and the stop-flow results are in agreement with data obtained from initial velocity experiments. Activation appears to result in both increased rates of electron transfer into and out of the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W166082187,Effects of peripheral venous injection of glucagon and insulin on [1-13C]glucose incorporation into hepatic glycogen of rats were studied by 13C NMR in vivo. Each animal was given a continuous somatostatin infusion and a 100-mg intravenous injection of [1-13C] glucose in NMR experiments or unlabeled glucose in parallel experiments for determination of serum glucose. Insulin administration caused serum glucose to fall below basal levels and accelerated the loss of hepatic [1-13C]glucose; these effects were counteracted by the addition of glucagon. Glucagon administration alone did not affect serum glucose or hepatic [1-13C] glucose but caused the loss of [1-13C]glucose from glycogen and inhibited [1-13C]glucose incorporation into glycogen. Insulin did not alter [1-13C]glucose incorporation into glycogen when given alone or in combination with glucagon. The data are consistent with a model in which liver glycogen synthesis increases linearly with hepatic glucose concentration above a threshold glucose concentration. Insulin did not alter the rate constant or the threshold for synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W1593769894,"A membrane preparation from porcine platelets catalyzed the hydrolysis of [2-3H]glycerol-labeled lysophosphatidylinositol to form monoacylglycerol and inositol phosphates. The hydrolysis was optimal at pH 9. The addition of Ca2+ did not enhance the hydrolysis, but the enzyme was inhibited completely by EGTA. The EGTA-inactivated enzyme was partially reactivated by Ca2+; Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ were much less effective or ineffective for the reactivation. The phospholipase C was apparently specific for lysophosphatidylinositol; phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidic acid were not hydrolyzed at significant rates under the conditions used. Phospholipase C with these properties has not been reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W1591219465,"The mechanism underlying the increased insulin binding found in hepatic plasma membranes from streptozotocin-diabetic rats was evaluated by measuring insulin binding to intact and Triton X-100-soluble extracts of plasma membranes prepared from the livers of control rats and rats administered streptozotocin (85 mg/kg). In addition, to assess whether the cellular content of hepatic insulin receptors is also increased in diabetic animals, we measured insulin-binding activity in intact and soluble extracts of total hepatic cellular membrane preparations (100,000 X g cellular pellets). The data indicate that while insulin binding is increased (52 +/- 3%) in intact hepatic plasma membranes from diabetic rats compared to control rats, there is no comparable increase in insulin binding in intact total cellular membranes or in Triton X-100-soluble extracts of plasma membranes or total cellular membranes. We therefore conclude that the enhanced insulin binding found in the livers of diabetic rats is the result of a local redistribution of plasma membrane insulin receptors from cryptic to exposed sites. Finally, the data suggest the presence of a negative modulator of insulin-binding affinity in intact plasma and total cellular membranes."

The alpha-32P derivative of this photo-labile compound is used to derivatize a site on the sigma subunit of the holoenzyme (E sigma) using either T7 delta D111 or poly[d(A-T)] as a DNA template. The incorporation of the 32P label into the sigma subunit could be prevented by the addition of either 5'-AMP or 5'-ATP. The results are suggested to support the existence of a unique initiation binding site, topographically distinct from the sites employed during the elongation phase."
