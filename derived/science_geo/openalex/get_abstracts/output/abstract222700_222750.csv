https://openalex.org/W2062240599,"Over a century ago, Freud proposed that unwanted memories can be excluded from awareness, a process called repression. It is unknown, however, how repression occurs in the brain. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural systems involved in keeping unwanted memories out of awareness. Controlling unwanted memories was associated with increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation, reduced hippocampal activation, and impaired retention of those memories. Both prefrontal cortical and right hippocampal activations predicted the magnitude of forgetting. These results confirm the existence of an active forgetting process and establish a neurobiological model for guiding inquiry into motivated forgetting."
https://openalex.org/W2019891142,"We report a virus-based scaffold for the synthesis of single-crystal ZnS, CdS, and freestanding chemically ordered CoPt and FePt nanowires, with the means of modifying substrate specificity through standard biological methods. Peptides (selected through an evolutionary screening process) that exhibit control of composition, size, and phase during nanoparticle nucleation have been expressed on the highly ordered filamentous capsid of the M13 bacteriophage. The incorporation of specific, nucleating peptides into the generic scaffold of the M13 coat structure provides a viable template for the directed synthesis of semiconducting and magnetic materials. Removal of the viral template by means of annealing promoted oriented aggregation-based crystal growth, forming individual crystalline nanowires. The unique ability to interchange substrate-specific peptides into the linear self-assembled filamentous construct of the M13 virus introduces a material tunability that has not been seen in previous synthetic routes. Therefore, this system provides a genetic toolkit for growing and organizing nanowires from semiconducting and magnetic materials."

Two layers of mesh cover the surface uniformly after high-temperature exposure of the clean rhodium surface to borazine (HBNH)3. The two layers are offset in such a way as to expose a minimum metal surface area. Hole formation is likely driven by the lattice mismatch of the film and the rhodium substrate. This regular nanostructure is thermally very stable and can serve as a template to organize molecules, as is exemplified by the decoration of the mesh by C60 molecules."

We report here the detection of the 2.8-second pulsar J0737-3039B as the companion to the 23-millisecond pulsar J0737-3039A in a highly relativistic double neutron star system, allowing unprecedented tests of fundamental gravitational physics. We observed a short eclipse of J0737-3039A by J0737-3039B and orbital modulation of the flux density and the pulse shape of J0737-3039B, probably because of the influence of J0737-3039A's energy flux on its magnetosphere. These effects will allow us to probe magneto-ionic properties of a pulsar magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2129666171,"A phylogenetic analysis of 1125 global human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences permitted positioning of all nucleotide substitutions according to their order of occurrence. The relative frequency and amino acid conservation of internal branch replacement mutations was found to increase from tropical Africa to temperate Europe and arctic northeastern Siberia. Particularly highly conserved amino acid substitutions were found at the roots of multiple mtDNA lineages from higher latitudes. These same lineages correlate with increased propensity for energy deficiency diseases as well as longevity. Thus, specific mtDNA replacement mutations permitted our ancestors to adapt to more northern climates, and these same variants are influencing our health today."

https://openalex.org/W2038652554,"Centromeres are the last frontiers of complex eukaryotic genomes, consisting of highly repetitive sequences that resist mapping, cloning and sequencing. The centromere of rice Chromosome 8 (Cen8) has an unusually low abundance of highly repetitive satellite DNA, which allowed us to determine its sequence. A region of approximately 750 kb in Cen8 binds rice CENH3, the centromere-specific H3 histone. CENH3 binding is contained within a larger region that has abundant dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3-Lys9), consistent with Cen8 being embedded in heterochromatin. Fourteen predicted and at least four active genes are interspersed in Cen8, along with CENH3 binding sites. The retrotransposons located in and outside of the CENH3 binding domain have similar ages and structural dynamics. These results suggest that Cen8 may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of centromeres from genic regions, as in human neocentromeres, to fully mature centromeres that accumulate megabases of homogeneous satellite arrays."
https://openalex.org/W1983092575,"FTY720 is an immunosuppressant that reduces circulating levels of naïve lymphocytes by increasing their localization and sequestration in secondary lymphoid organs. It is considered to be an agonist for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) after phosphorylation at micromolar concentrations. We now describe its nonagonist and noncompetitive inhibitory activity at low nanomolar concentrations for types 1 and 5 S1P-GPCRs and of moderate potency for type 2 S1P-GPCRs. FTY720 blocks S1P signaling through S1P1,2,5 by inducing their internalization and intracellular partial degradation without affecting S1P3 or S1P4. S1P-R internalization is maximal several hours after only seconds of incubation with FTY720 at 37 degrees C and washing, and continues for days before recovery of surface expression and functions. The timing and extent of S1P-R internalization are highly dependent on FTY720 concentration. FTY720 is therefore an S1P-GPCR-selective and noncompetitive inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action."

Independent radiometric dating of events correlated to GISP2 suggests that the calibration is accurate. Reconstructed 14C activities varied substantially during the last glacial period, including sharp peaks synchronous with the Laschamp and Mono Lake geomagnetic field intensity minimal and cosmogenic nuclide peaks in ice cores and marine sediments. Simulations with a geochemical box model suggest that much of the variability can be explained by geomagnetically modulated changes in 14C production rate together with plausible changes in deep-ocean ventilation and the global carbon cycle during glaciation."
https://openalex.org/W2150295764,"Wnt signaling has recently emerged as a key factor in controlling stem cell expansion. In contrast, we show here that Wnt/beta-catenin signal activation in emigrating neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) has little effect on the population size and instead regulates fate decisions. Sustained beta-catenin activity in neural crest cells promotes the formation of sensory neural cells in vivo at the expense of virtually all other neural crest derivatives. Moreover, Wnt1 is able to instruct early NCSCs (eNCSCs) to adopt a sensory neuronal fate in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Thus, the role of Wnt/beta-catenin in stem cells is cell-type dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2029479550,"It has been historically assumed that the pineal gland is the major source of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) in vertebrates. Melatonin plays a central role in fine-tuning circadian rhythms in vertebrate physiology. In addition, melatonin shows a remarkable functional versatility exhibiting antioxidant, oncostatic, antiaging, and immunomodulatory properties. Melatonin has been identified in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to human beings. Its biosynthesis from tryptophan involves four well-defined intracellular steps catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, serotonin-N-acetyltransferase, and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase. Here, for the first time, we document that both resting and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes synthesize and release large amounts of melatonin, with the melatonin concentration in the medium increasing up to five times the nocturnal physiological levels in human serum. Moreover, we show that the necessary machinery to synthesize melatonin is present in human lymphocytes. Furthermore, melatonin released to the culture medium is synthesized in the cells, because blocking the enzymes required for its biosynthesis or inhibiting protein synthesis in general produced a significant reduction in melatonin release. Moreover, this inhibition caused a decrease in IL-2 production, which was restored by adding exogenous melatonin. These findings indicate that in addition to pineal gland, human lymphoid cells are an important physiological source of melatonin and that this melatonin could be involved in the regulation of the human immune system, possibly by acting as an intracrine, autocrine, and/or paracrine substance."
https://openalex.org/W2119347382,"Observations of internal wave velocity fluctuations show that enhanced turbulent mixing over rough topography in the Southern Ocean is remarkably intense and widespread. Mixing rates exceeding background values by a factor of 10 to 1000 are common above complex bathymetry over a distance of 2000 to 3000 kilometers at depths greater than 500 to 1000 meters. This suggests that turbulent mixing in the Southern Ocean may contribute crucially to driving the upward transport of water closing the ocean's meridional overturning circulation, and thus needs to be represented in numerical simulations of the global ocean circulation and the spreading of biogeochemical tracers."
https://openalex.org/W1968011510,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is highly expressed in postmitotic neurons, but its function in the nervous system was previously unknown. We report that the inhibition of Cdh1-APC in primary neurons specifically enhanced axonal growth. Cdh1 knockdown in cerebellar slice overlay assays and in the developing rat cerebellum in vivo revealed cell-autonomous abnormalities in layer-specific growth of granule neuron axons and parallel fiber patterning. Cdh1 RNA interference in neurons was also found to override the inhibitory influence of myelin on axonal growth. Thus, Cdh1-APC appears to play a role in regulating axonal growth and patterning in the developing brain that may also limit the growth of injured axons in the adult brain."

https://openalex.org/W2135597217,"During genetic recombination and the recombinational repair of chromosome breaks, DNA molecules become linked at points of strand exchange. Branch migration and resolution of these crossovers, or Holliday junctions (HJs), complete the recombination process. Here, we show that extracts from cells carrying mutations in the recombination/repair genes RAD51C or XRCC3 have reduced levels of HJ resolvase activity. Moreover, depletion of RAD51C from fractionated human extracts caused a loss of branch migration and resolution activity, but these functions were restored by complementation with a variety of RAD51 paralog complexes containing RAD51C. We conclude that the RAD51 paralogs are involved in HJ processing in human cells."

How this hypomethylated state is maintained during oogenesis and the role of CTCF, if any, in this process are not understood. With the use of a transgenic RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach to generate oocytes with reduced amounts of CTCF protein, we found increased methylation of the H19 DMD and decreased developmental competence of CTCF-deficient oocytes. Our results suggest that CTCF protects the H19 DMD from de novo methylation during oocyte growth and is required for normal preimplantation development."
https://openalex.org/W2143719721,"The development of osteoporosis involves the interaction of multiple environmental and genetic factors. Through combined genetic and genomic approaches, we identified the lipoxygenase gene Alox15 as a negative regulator of peak bone mineral density in mice. Crossbreeding experiments with Alox15 knockout mice confirmed that 12/15-lipoxygenase plays a role in skeletal development. Pharmacologic inhibitors of this enzyme improved bone density and strength in two rodent models of osteoporosis. These results suggest that drugs targeting the 12/15-lipoxygenase pathway merit investigation as a therapy for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2003653107,"The lasting effects of neuronal activity on brain development involve calcium-dependent gene expression. Using a strategy called transactivator trap, we cloned a calcium-responsive transactivator called CREST (for calcium-responsive transactivator). CREST is a SYT-related nuclear protein that interacts with adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) and is expressed in the developing brain. Mice that have a targeted disruption of the crest gene are viable but display defects in cortical and hippocampal dendrite development. Cortical neurons from crest mutant mice are compromised in calcium-dependent dendritic growth. Thus, calcium activation of CREST-mediated transcription helps regulate neuronal morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994561103,"Flap EndoNuclease-1 (FEN-1) and the processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) are central to DNA replication and repair. To clarify the molecular basis of FEN-1 specificity and PCNA activation, we report here structures of FEN-1:DNA and PCNA:FEN-1-peptide complexes, along with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and mutational results. FEN-1 binds the unpaired 3' DNA end (3' flap), opens and kinks the DNA, and promotes conformational closing of a flexible helical clamp to facilitate 5' cleavage specificity. Ordering of unstructured C-terminal regions in FEN-1 and PCNA creates an intermolecular beta sheet interface that directly links adjacent PCNA and DNA binding regions of FEN-1 and suggests how PCNA stimulates FEN-1 activity. The DNA and protein conformational changes, composite complex structures, FRET, and mutational results support enzyme-PCNA alignments and a kinked DNA pivot point that appear suitable to coordinate rotary handoffs of kinked DNA intermediates among enzymes localized by the three PCNA binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2147163870,"Eukaryotic chromosomes possess multiple origins of replication, whereas bacterial chromosomes are replicated from a single origin. The archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi also appears to have a single origin, suggesting a common rule for prokaryotes. However, in the current work, we describe the identification of two active origins of replication in the single chromosome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. Further, we identify conserved sequence motifs within the origins that are recognized by a family of three Sulfolobus proteins that are homologous to the eukaryotic initiator proteins Orc1 and Cdc6. We demonstrate that the two origins are recognized by distinct subsets of these Orc1/Cdc6 homologs. These data, in conjunction with an analysis of the levels of the three Orc1/Cdc6 proteins in different growth phases and cell cycle stages, lead us to propose a model for the roles for these proteins in modulating origin activity."

https://openalex.org/W2048748976,"Flower development begins as floral meristems arise in succession on the flank of the inflorescence meristem. Floral meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) promote establishment and maintenance of floral identity in newly formed floral primordia1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Without their activity, the floral primordia develop with inflorescence characteristics. The underlying molecular-genetic mechanism is unknown. Here we show that these phenotypes are due in large part to the ectopic expression of AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), a central regulator of floral meristem identity. We present evidence that AGL24 is an early target of transcriptional repression by LFY and AP1. Without such repression, continued AGL24 expression in floral meristems is sufficient to cause floral reversion regardless of the activation of floral organ identity genes. This indicates that LFY and AP1 promote floral development not only by positively regulating genes activated in flower development, but also by repressing AGL24, a promoter of inflorescence fate."

https://openalex.org/W2148158102,"Lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with various blinding retinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The major lipofuscin fluorophor A2-E is thought to play an important pathogenetic role. In previous studies A2-E was shown to severely impair lysosomal function of RPE cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remained obscure. Using purified lysosomes from RPE cells we now demonstrate that A2-E is a potent inhibitor of the ATP-driven proton pump located in the lysosomal membrane. Such inhibition of proton transport to the lysosomal lumen results in an increase of the lysosomal pH with subsequent inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases. An essential task of the lysosomal apparatus of postmitotic RPE for normal photoreceptor function is phagocytosis and degradation of membranous discs shed from photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and of biomolecules from autophagy. When the lysosomes of cultured RPE cells were experimentally loaded with A2-E, we observed intracellular accumulation of exogenously added POS with subsequent congestion of the phagocytic process. Moreover, the autophagic sequestration of cytoplasmic material was also markedly reduced after A2-E loading. These data support the hypothesis that A2-E-induced lysosomal dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of AMD and other retinal diseases associated with excessive lipofuscin accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2016747503,"A family of unusual proteins is deposited in flat, structural platelets in reflective tissues of the squid Euprymna scolopes. These proteins, which we have named reflectins, are encoded by at least six genes in three subfamilies and have no reported homologs outside of squids. Reflectins possess five repeating domains, which are highly conserved among members of the family. The proteins have a very unusual composition, with four relatively rare residues (tyrosine, methionine, arginine, and tryptophan) comprising approximately 57% of a reflectin, and several common residues (alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine) occurring in none of the family members. These protein-based reflectors in squids provide a marked example of nanofabrication in animal systems."

https://openalex.org/W2031138807,"We report here that HtrA1, a candidate tumor suppressor, is downregulated in ovarian cancer. Expression of HtrA1 is downregulated in five of seven ovarian cancer cell lines. In total, 59% of primary ovarian tumors have either a complete absence or markedly reduced levels of HtrA1 expression compared to the brushings of ovarian surface epithelium. Primary ovarian tumors show high frequencies of loss of an allele at microsatellite markers near htrA1 locus on 10q26. Downregulation of HtrA1 in SKOV3 by antisense transfection promotes anchorage-independent growth, while exogenous expression of HtrA1 in OV202 induces cell death. HtrA1-induced cell death is not inhibited by the broad caspase inhibitor, zVAD(OMe)fmk, but instead reflects serine protease activity associated with HtrA1. These observations raise the possibility of HtrA1 as a candidate tumor suppressor involved in promoting serine-protease-mediated cell death and that downregulation of HtrA1 in ovarian cancer may contribute to malignant phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2018836029,"DNA hypomethylation is one of the major epigenetic alterations in human cancers. We have previously shown that genes identified as hypomethylated in pancreatic cancer are expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines, but not in normal pancreatic ductal epithelium and can be reexpressed in nonexpressing cells using 'epigenetic modifying agents' such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. To identify additional targets for aberrant hypomethylation in pancreatic cancer, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to screen for genes that displayed expression patterns associated with hypomethylation. This analysis identified a substantial number of candidates including previously reported hypomethylated genes. A subset of eight genes were selected for further methylation analysis, and two cancer-related genes, maspin and S100P, were found to be aberrantly hypomethylated in a large fraction of pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary pancreatic carcinomas. Combined treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidie and trichostatin A resulted in synergistic induction of maspin and S100P mRNA in MiaPaCa2 cells where both genes were methylated. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between methylation and mRNA expression level for maspin and S100P in a large panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines. We also found a significant difference in the methylation patterns of maspin and two previously identified hypomethylated genes (trefoil factor 2 and lipocalin 2) between pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines, suggesting cancer-type specificity for some hypomethylation patterns. Thus, our present results confirm that DNA hypomethylation is a frequent epigenetic event in pancreatic cancer, and suggest that gene expression profiling may help to identify potential targets affected by this epigenetic alteration."

Calibration of Holocene size patterns with environmental parameters and comparisons with Cenozoic paleoproxy data show a consistently positive correlation between test size and surface-water stratification intensity. We infer that the observed macroevolutionary increase in test size of planktic foraminifera through the Cenozoic was an adaptive response to intensifying surface-water stratification in low latitudes, which was driven by polar cooling."

Pulsing occurs both in conjunction with and independent of transient slip from larger earthquakes. It extends to depths of approximately 10 to 11 kilometers but may be deeper, and it may be related to similar phenomena occurring in subduction zones. Over much of the study area, pulse onset periods also show a higher probability of larger earthquakes, which may provide useful information for earthquake forecasting."
https://openalex.org/W2108656317,"Choline is an essential nutrient for animals and humans. Previous studies showed that supplementing the maternal diet with choline during the second half of gestation in rats permanently enhances memory performance of the adult offspring. Here we show that prenatal choline supplementation causes a 3-day advancement in the ability of juvenile rats to use relational cues in a water maze task, indicating that the treatment accelerates hippocampal maturation. Moreover, phosphorylation and therefore activation of hippocampal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in response to stimulation by glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, or depolarizing concentrations of K+ were increased by prenatal choline supplementation and reduced by prenatal choline deficiency. These data provide the first evidence that developmental plasticity of the hippocampal MAPK and CREB signaling pathways is controlled by the supply of a single essential nutrient, choline, during fetal development and point to these pathways as candidate mechanisms for the developmental and long-term cognitive enhancement induced by prenatal choline supplementation."

Bryant A. Stevens D. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 784-790Google Scholar). AT belongs to a distinctive class of related cytolytic toxins whose prototype is aerolysin, secreted by the Gram-negative bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila (4Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Google Scholar). Interestingly, enterolobin, a cytolytic protein derived from the Brazilian Enterolobium contortisiliquum tree also appears to be related to aerolysin (5de Sousa M.V. Morhy L. An. Acad. Bras.

The mechanisms of AT and aerolysin have been shown to be highly similar. Both toxins bind to cells via glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein receptors (7Gordon V.M. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T.

Immun. 2002; 70: 4353-4361Google Scholar), although aerolysin appears to bind to some receptors that are not recognized by AT and vice versa. Following cell binding both toxins are activated by the proteolytic cleavage of an amino-terminal propeptide by furin or furin-like protease (9Gordon V.M. Benz R. Fujii K. Leppla S.H. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4130-4134Google Scholar, 10Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Buckley J.T. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32656-32661Google Scholar). Activation then allows the toxin monomers to oligomerize on the membrane and form a pore (11Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.-L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 627-634Google Scholar, 12Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 336-340Google Scholar). The difference seen in receptor specificity of the two toxins appears to be linked to the presence of an amino-terminal peptide of aerolysin that is not conserved in AT. The crystal structure of aerolysin, the only member of this toxin family whose crystal structure has been solved (13Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Google Scholar), shows that it is a bi-lobal protein consisting of four distinct domains (D1-D4), three of which are rich in β-sheet structure (see Fig. 1). The small lobe of aerolysin is missing from the amino terminus in AT, and this implies that AT is a single-lobed structure consisting of three domains that are homologous to D2-D4 of aerolysin (see Fig. 1). The small lobe of aerolysin (D1) contains a lectin-binding domain that enables it to bind to various receptors that are not recognized by AT (14Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R.J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Google Scholar, 15Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Google Scholar). However, fusion of D1 of aerolysin to the amino terminus of AT converts it to a molecule with aerolysin-like receptor specificity and activity (15Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Google Scholar). Comparatively little is known about the cytolytic mechanism of enterolobin, but its primary structure appears to be more related to aerolysin than AT. Enterolobin displays sequence similarity with both the small and large lobes of aerolysin and appears to form a dimer in solution (6Fontes W. Sousa M.V. Aragao J.B. Morhy L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 201-207Google Scholar, 16Bittencourt S.E. Silva L.P. Azevedo R.B. Cunha R.B. Lima C.M. Ricart C.A. Sousa M.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 47-51Google Scholar). Although many aspects of the cytolytic mechanism of AT and aerolysin have been elucidated, the one or more domains of these toxins directly involved in the formation of the pore have yet to be identified. Two structural motifs used by pore-forming toxins to span membranes are amphipathic β-strands and α-helices. Both motifs have been identified in toxins as the secondary structures used to cross the membrane during pore formation. For example, the pore-forming domain of the colicins and the T-domain of diphtheria toxin use a pair of amphipathic α-helices to span the membrane (17Parker M.W. Pattus F. Tucker A.D. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1989; 337: 93-96Google Scholar, 18Oh K.J. Zhan H. Cui C. Hideg K. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1996; 273: 810-812Google Scholar), whereas the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin (19Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Google Scholar), the α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus (20Song L.Z. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Google Scholar, 21Valeva A. Weisser A. Walker B. Kehoe M. Bayley H. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1857-1864Google Scholar), and perfringolysin O from Clostridium perfringens (22Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Google Scholar, 23Shatursky O. Heuck A.P. Shepard L.A. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Cell. 1999; 99: 293-299Google Scholar) all use amphipathic β-strands that contribute to the formation of a transmembrane β-barrel (see Fig. 1). However, identification of the TMD has not been necessarily easy or without controversy. The TMD of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) was first suggested to be comprised of a β-sandwich (24Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Google Scholar), or an amphipathic α-helix (25Palmer M. Saweljew P. Vulicevic I. Valeva A. Kehoe M. Bhakdi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26664-26667Google Scholar) and Gilbert et al. (26Gilbert R.J.C. Jiménez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I.J. Rossjohn J. Parker M. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Google Scholar) suggested that the CDCs did not penetrate the membrane at all. The pore-forming region of the CDCs was unambiguously shown to be comprised of two amphipathic β-hairpins located in D3 of the perfringolysin O crystal structure that are derived from six short α-helices of the soluble monomer (22Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Google Scholar, 23Shatursky O. Heuck A.P. Shepard L.A. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Cell. 1999; 99: 293-299Google Scholar, 24Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Google Scholar). It was previously hypothesized that the D4 β-sandwich of aerolysin penetrates the membrane and forms the TMD of aerolysin (13Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Google Scholar). More recently, Tsitrin et al. (27Tsitrin Y. Morton C.J. el-Bez C. Paumard P. Velluz M.C. Adrian M. Dubochet J. Parker M.W. Lanzavecchia S. van der Goot F.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 729-733Google Scholar) also suggested that the D4 β-sandwich forms the TMD of aerolysin based on an electron density map of what was proposed to be a soluble oligomer of aerolysin. However, to date, no experimental data have been reported that directly demonstrate the interaction of a specific region of aerolysin, or the related AT or enterolobin, with the membrane. The aerolysin-based structural model of AT and the aerolysin crystal structure exhibit a conspicuous amphipathic loop that is found in D2 of AT and the corresponding D3 of aerolysin (Fig. 1). Using multiple fluorescent and biochemical approaches, we have confirmed that this amphipathic loop in D2 of AT, comprised of residues Lys-203 to Gln-232, forms an amphipathic β-hairpin that spans the membrane and is necessary for pore formation. Similar analyses of residues in the D3 β-sandwich of AT, corresponding to the D4 region of aerolysin indicates that it is only peripherally associated with the membrane and is unlikely to participate directly in the formation of the transmembrane β-barrel. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Cell Lines, and Chemicals—The gene for AT was cloned into the pET-22(b)+ expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) (designated pBRS10) and placed into Escherichia coli BLR-DE3 cells for high level expression as previously described (28Sellman B.R. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 551-558Google Scholar). The SupT1 cell line was a generous gift of Dr. William Hildebrand (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and all enzymes from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD) unless otherwise specified. Generation of Deletion and Point Mutations—All deletion mutations in AT were generated using a four-primer site-directed PCR mutagenesis procedure previously described (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) except that pBRS10 was used as the template and Pfu turbo thermostable polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was substituted for Taq. PCR overlap products were purified using the Quantum-Prep PCR Kleen Spin columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), digested with NcoI and XhoI, and ligated into pET-22(b)+ digested with NcoI and XhoI. An active, cysteine-less derivative of AT, termed ATC86A, was generated using the above mutagenesis procedure, and the resulting plasmid was designated pBRS20. All cysteine substitutions were produced using pBRS20 as template, using either the four-primer PCR mutagenesis procedure above or QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Expression and Purification of AT—The growth and harvesting of Escherichia coli BLR-DE3 expressing polyhistidine-tagged native AT and the various AT derivatives were performed according to Sellman et al. (28Sellman B.R. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 551-558Google Scholar). The cell pellets were resuspended in 150 ml of buffer A (10 mm MES; Research Organics, Cleveland, OH), 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. Lysis of cells was carried out in an EmulsiFlex-C5 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario) at 15,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min. Purification of the His-tagged AT from the supernatant was accomplished using a cobalt-chelating column, and cation-exchange column was done as previously described (28Sellman B.R. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 551-558Google Scholar). AT-containing fractions eluted from the cation-exchange column were combined in a Micro-ProDiCon System (Spectrum, Gardena, CA) with a 10,000 MWCO Micro-ProDiCon membrane for simultaneous dialysis and concentration. Samples were dialyzed against 10 mm MES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5 (buffer B) overnight at 4 °C. For cysteine-substituted proteins, 1 mm dithiothreitol was included in the dialysis buffer. 10% glycerol was added to the concentrated toxin before storage at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 63,000 m-1 cm-1. 2R. K. Tweten, unpublished data. SupT1 Membrane Preparation—SupT1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin. Four roller bottles of cells were grown to ∼2 × 106 cells/ml, the cells were harvested, pelleted at 250 × g for 10 min, and resuspended to a final volume of 50 ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Membranes were prepared by lysing the cell suspension in an EmulsiFlex-C5 high pressure homogenizer set at 15,000 p.s.i. Cell membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatant was removed, and the cell membranes were washed five times by resuspending the membrane pellet in 30 ml of buffer C (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuging at 30,000 × g for 20 min. Following the final wash, the membranes were resuspended with buffer C to an A600 of 10. Construction of the AT Homology Model—The homology model of AT was based on the 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of proaerolysin. 3S. C. Feil, J. Rossjohn, J. T. Buckley, and M. W. Parker, unpublished results. The sequence alignment, which included the related toxin, enterolobin, and subsequent homology model, were generated using the aerolysin structure as a template within the HOMOLOGY module of Insight II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 Maximum Impact Work station. The model was built in two stages: (i) identification of significant regions of sequence identity between AT and aerolysin and assigning coordinates to these regions and (ii) assigning coordinates to the homology model where the sequence identity to aerolysin is less convincing using a data base of peptide fragments. The models were visually checked to remove any steric clashes within the software package `O' (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), using the lego side chain and lego main chain options. This was followed by energy minimization (500 cycles of Powell minimization with tight harmonic restraints on the Cα atoms, followed by 500 cycles with no harmonic restraints) using X-PLOR (version 3.851) (31Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Google Scholar). The quality of the model was assessed using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. (42)) and the 3D-1D environment plot (32Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Google Scholar). The similar molecular mechanism, the pairwise sequence identity, the good stereochemistry, and three-dimensional profiles of the AT model, are factors indicative of a good quality homology model. Modification of Cysteine-substituted AT with NBD or IAF—All cysteine-substituted mutants of AT were stored in 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Therefore, excess DTT was removed before labeling the unique cysteines of each AT mutant with the sulfhydryl-specific derivative of the fluorescent dye N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3,-diazoyl)ethylenediamine (NBD) or 5-iodoacetamidofluoroscein (IAF) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Approximately 1 mg of toxin was passed through a gel filtration column (1.5-cm inside diameter × 20 cm) containing Sephadex G-50 equilibrated in buffer C at room temperature. NBD or IAF was then added to the protein to a 20-fold molar excess. The reaction was incubated in the dark for 1 h at room temperature and passed again over a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in buffer C to remove unbound dye. The extent of labeling was determined spectroscopically using an ϵ478 nm of 25,000-1m-1 cm-1 for NBD or an ϵ492 nm of 75,000-1m-1 cm-1 for IAF (33Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 63,000 m-1 cm-1. 2R. K. Tweten, unpublished data. SupT1 Cell Viability Assay—SupT1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin. SupT1 cells at 500,000 cells/ml were placed into the wells of a flat-bottom microtiter plate in 100-μl aliquots for a total number of cells per well of ∼50,000. Toxin was diluted in a separate round-bottom microtiter plate in which the wells were prefilled with 10 μl of HBSS. Toxin (1 μg) was placed into the first well of a single row and brought up to 20 μl of final volume with HBSS. The toxin was carried through 2-fold serial dilutions in the remaining wells of the row. Next, 10 μl from each well was added to respective wells of the flat-bottom plate containing the SupT1 cells and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, 10 μl of Cell Counting Kit-8 reagent (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The plates were read at A450 nm, and the concentration of toxin that resulted in 50% cell death (tissue culture lethal dose 50%) determined. Results from cells treated with mutant toxins were expressed as a percentage of the value obtained from cells treated with wild type AT. Steady-state Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Steady-state fluorescence was measured using an SLM 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorometer with a double monochromator in the excitation light path, a single emission monochromator, cooled PMT housings, and a 450-watt xenon lamp (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY), with the band-pass set at 4 nm. The emission wavelength was 540 nm, and the excitation wavelength was 480 nm. Emission scans were taken at 1-nm intervals between 500 and 600 nm for both monomeric and oligomeric forms of each mutant. For each NBD-labeled residue tested, the net NBD-intensity was determined by subtracting the fluorescence intensity of an equivalent NBD-free sample. For each sample, toxin was pre-activated with trypsin at a 1:3500 ratio (w/w; trypsin:toxin) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of a 30-fold molar excess of the protease inhibitor TLCK. 10 μg of pre-activated toxin was incubated alone (monomer) or in the presence of 50 μl of SupT1 membranes (oligomeric) and brought up to 400 μl of final volume with buffer C. All samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark to allow binding, oligomerization, and insertion to go to completion. For intensity measurements, reactions were placed into quartz cuvettes (1 × 1 cm) filled with 1.6 ml of buffer C at 37 °C and placed into the spectrofluorometer set at a constant temperature of 37 °C. Quenching of NBD Emission by Membrane-restricted Spin-labeled Phospholipids—To determine if a particular NBD dye was present within the nonpolar core of the bilayer, we incorporated nitroxides into the SupT1 membrane suspensions as follows. 5-DOXYL-stearic acid and 16-DOXYL-stearic acid (DSA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were suspended together to a final concentration (each) of 50 mg/ml in methanol. SupT1 membrane suspensions were made 4% in the DSA solution by directly adding the DSA mixture to the membranes. The membranes were vortexed immediately for ∼30 s and rocked at room temperature for 1 h. For each experiment, 10 μg of pre-activated toxin was incubated with 50 μl of DSA-containing membranes in a total volume of 400 μl (brought up to volume with buffer C) overnight at 37 °C in the dark. The samples were placed into quartz cuvettes (1 × 1 cm) prefilled with 1.6 ml of buffer C at 37 °C and placed into the spectrofluorometer sample holder set at a constant temperature of 37 °C. Emission scans were taken at 1-nm intervals between 500 and 600 nm with an integration time of 1 s. Due to the fact that the DSA is dissolved in methanol, samples containing membranes made 4% in methanol alone were used as controls for net NBD intensity on membranes. Emission scans of NBD-free samples were taken and subtracted from the equivalent NBD-labeled samples to determine the net NBD intensity. Saturable Binding of ATT224C-IAF and Kd Determination—The affinity of ATT224C-IAF for SupT1 cells was determined using a liquid phase binding assay. Increasing amounts of ATT224C-IAF (10-500 nm) were incubated with 1 × 106 SupT1 cells, brought up to 100-μl final volume in ice-cold HBSS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Following incubation, cells were pelleted and washed once with 200 μl of ice-cold HBSS to remove unbound toxin and brought up to a final volume of 400 μl with ice-cold HBSS. The geometric mean fluorescence of the cells was determined by analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Flow Cytometry and Confocal Microscopy Laboratory, Williams Medical Research Institute, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK) equipped with a 488-nm laser. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate, and all data points represent the mean of four independent experiments. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding 25 μm unlabeled toxin to each amount of labeled toxin tested, and this value was subtracted from that obtained with labeled toxin alone to calculate specific binding. GraphPad Prism software, version 3.0, was used for nonlinear regression, curve-fitting analysis to determine an approximate Kd. Competitive Binding Assay and Ki Determination—The ability of wild type toxin or deletion mutants to compete for binding with ATT224C-IAF to SupT1 cells was determined using a modified version of the above liquid phase binding assay. ATT224C-IAF at 208 nm was mixed with increasing concentrations of either unlabeled wild type or mutant toxin (0.5 nm to 10 μm) and brought up to a final volume of 100 μl in ice-cold HBSS before adding to 1 × 106 SupT1 cells. Cells incubated with ATT224C-IAF alone were considered maximum binding, and the mean fluorescence value was set at 100%. Each ligand concentration was analyzed in duplicate. To determine the inhibition constants (Ki) for each competing toxin, the geometric mean fluorescence of the cells was plotted versus the concentration of competitor toxin. GraphPad Prism, version 3.0, was used for nonlinear regression, curve-fitting analysis for determination of Ki values for each competitor with a Kd for ATT224C-IAF set at 92 nm. Activation and Oligomerization of TMD Deletion Mutants and ATS220C-S269C on SupT1 Membranes—Activation and oligomerization of toxin in the presence of membranes was carried out as follows. Wild type and mutant protoxin (ATPro) (5 μg) was activated using trypsin at a ratio of 1:1000 trypsin:toxin (w/w). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the trypsin was inhibited by the addition of a 30-fold molar excess of the protease inhibitor TLCK. SupT1 membranes (10 μl) were added to the activated toxin, and the volume was adjusted to 30 μl with buffer C and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. SDS sample buffer (8 μl 6×) and 7 μl of 10% SDS were added to the samples, boiled at 90 °C for 2 min, and separated on a 4-15% gradient gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and the blot was incubated with affinity-purified anti-AT antibody. After 1 h, unbound primary antibody was removed by washing the blot three times in buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and then secondary antibody, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was added to the blot, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 45 min. The blot was again washed three times in buffer D to remove unbound antibody. Colorimetric development of the bands recognized by the antibody was accomplished by developing the blot with the color development solution 4-chloro-1-naphthol according to manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Residues between Lys-203 and Gln-232 Alternate between Nonpolar and Polar Environments—Membrane-interactive amphipathic α-helices and β-strands are defined by the periodicity of the interaction of their side chains with the membrane and aqueous environments; approximately every 3.5 residues of an amphipathic α-helix interacts with the membrane (18Oh K.J. Zhan H. Cui C. Hideg K. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1996; 273: 810-812Google Scholar), whereas alternating residues of an amphipathic β-strand interact with the membrane (22Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Google Scholar). Residues Lys-203 to Gln-232 of AT exhibit characteristics of an amphipathic transmembrane β-hairpin. The fluorescence-based method of Shepard et al. (22Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Google Scholar) was used to determine if this loop penetrates the membrane and then to examine the periodicity, and therefore its secondary structure, if it is inserted into the membrane. This technique takes advantage of the environmentally sensitive properties of the sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent dye iodoacetamide-NBD (NBD). The fluorescence intensity (FI) of NBD is quenched when it is in an aqueous environment, such as the channel of the pore, but increases when it is in a nonpolar environment, such as the core of the bilayer. Residues Lys-203 to Gln-232 were individually mutated to cysteines, and the proteins were purified and labeled with NBD. The FI of each NBD-labeled mutant was examined in the absence and presence of SupT1 cell-derived membranes that contain one or more receptors for AT (7Gordon V.M. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Stevens V.L. Tweten R.K. Elwood P.C. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27274-27280Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows example emission scans from adjacent residues, Glu-227 and Phe-228, in the monomeric and membrane-bound forms. In an amphipathic β-hairpin the side chain of Phe-228 is predicted to interact with the bilayer during pore formation, whereas the side chain of Glu-227 is predicted to reside in the hydrophilic channel of the pore. Consistent with this prediction, no significant increase in FI was seen for ATE227C-NBD following its incubation with membranes (Fig. 2A), whereas the FI of ATF228C-NBD increased ∼3-fold under the same conditions (Fig. 2B). The combined fluorescence data for NBD, when attached to the individual cysteines that were substituted for all residues within this region, are summarized in Fig. 2C. The change in the emission intensity of NBD was determined from the ratio of the FI in the membrane-bound (Fmemb) and soluble (Fsoluble) states. These data reveal an alternating pattern of FI in which the side chains of these residues appear to weave in and out of a nonpolar environment."
https://openalex.org/W1964050666,"Maintenance of telomeres is essential for chromosome stability. In the absence of telomerase, telomeres shorten with cell division until they approach a stability threshold, at which point cells enter senescence. When senescence-signaling pathways are inactive, further telomere shortening leads to chromosome instability characterized by telomeric fusions and breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. Since the distribution of telomere lengths among chromosome extremities is heterogeneous, we wondered about the impact of such variability on the stability of particular chromosome arms. We correlated the initial length of individual telomeres in telomerase-negative-transformed cells with the stability of the corresponding chromosome arms during the precrisis period. We show that arms carrying the shortest telomeres are the first to become unstable and this instability affects the chromosome homologues with shorter telomeres almost exclusively. The analysis of several postcrisis cell populations, which had stabilized their telomeres by re-expressing telomerase, showed that the karyotypic outcome is strongly influenced by the initial telomere length heterogeneity. The timing of telomerase re-expression also seems to play a role in limiting the extent of karyotypic changes, probably by reducing the frequency of telomeric fusions and hence BFB. Since the distribution of telomere lengths within somatic cells is proper to every individual, our results predict that the risk for a particular chromosome arm of becoming unstable early in tumorigenesis will differ between individuals and contribute directly to the heterogeneity of chromosome aberrations found in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2060172889,"The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (Cebpd, also known as C/EBPdelta, CRP3, CELF, NF-IL6beta) is implicated in diverse cellular functions such as the acute phase response, adipocyte differentiation, learning and memory, and mammary epithelial cell growth control. Here, we report that lack of Cebpd causes genomic instability and centrosome amplifications in primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from 129S1 mice. Upon spontaneous immortalization, Cebpd-deficient fibroblasts acquire transformed features such as impaired contact inhibition and reduced serum dependence. These data identify a novel role for Cebpd in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and suggest a potential tumor suppressor function in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1972852906,"Ty elements of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements related to retroviruses. Normal levels of Ty1 transposition require Dbr1p, a cellular enzyme that cleaves 2'-5' RNA bonds. We show that Ty1 RNAs lacking identifiable 5' ends accumulate in virus-like particles (VLPs) in dbr1 mutants. Debranching this RNA in vitro with Dbr1p creates an uncapped version of the normal Ty1 RNA 5' end. We show that the 5' nucleotide (nt) of Ty1 RNA forms a 2'-5' bond with a nt near the 3' end of the same RNA, creating a lariat. The properties of the lariat suggest it forms by a novel mechanism and that branching and debranching may play roles in Ty1 reverse transcription at the minus-strand transfer step."
https://openalex.org/W2105560147,"High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) alleviates dramatically motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, and recently it has been suggested that zona incerta (ZI) stimulation might be as beneficial to patients. We used in situ cytochrome oxidase (CoI) mRNA hybridization to investigate and compare the effects of HFS of the STN and the ZI on metabolic activity of the STN, globus pallidus (GP), and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) in normal rats as well as in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion, an animal model of Parkinson's disease. In normal rats, HFS of the STN, as well as of the ZI, induced a significant decrease in CoI mRNA expression within the STN and SNr but an increase within the GP. In 6-OHDA rats, HFS of the STN reversed dopamine denervation-induced changes in the expression of CoI mRNA in the STN, SNr, and GP. Similar results were obtained with HFS of the ZI except for the STN, which showed only a trend toward normalization. These data suggest that the ZI, as well as the STN, are implicated in the functional mechanism of HFS supporting the involvement of GABA transmission for the reduction of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia output structures."
https://openalex.org/W2151890982,"Tumor-induced angiogenic responses lead to complex phenotypic changes in vascular endothelial cells, which must coordinate the expression of both proteases and protease inhibitors prior to the proliferation and invasion of surrounding stroma. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which degrades Type IV collagen, is produced as proMMP2. proMMP2 is activated in part through its interactions with membrane Type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2). In this study, we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent inducer of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and invasion, which is attenuated by PAF receptor antagonists, and that PAF receptor antagonists inhibit the migration and invasion of HUVEC mediated by medium conditioned by a prostatic carcinoma cell line. We confirm that PAF receptor antagonists inhibit proliferation of HUVEC grown in rich growth medium. We show that PAF increases mRNA levels for MT1-MMP and TIMP2, followed by increased temporal conversion of latent proMMP2 to MMP2. Finally, we demonstrate that the ratio of MT1-MMP to TIMP2 in membrane preparations from PAF-stimulated HUVEC is 1.6:1, approximating the hypothesized ideal ratio of 2:1 necessary for the conversion of proMMP2 to MMP2. Our data support the involvement of PAF in vascular endothelial cell migration and invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2132335188,"The 92-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-9) contributes to tissue remodeling in both physiology and pathology. Previous studies on the transcriptional regulation of this gene have used transiently transfected promoter-reporter constructs. However, this approach suffers from several limitations including (a) multiple copies of the plasmid and (b) the plasmid is not genomically integrated and consequently poorly chromatinized. We developed a novel system for studying MMP-9 transcription in which a single copy of a MMP-9 promoter-luciferase construct(s) is integrated at an identical genomic locus in HT1080 cells by homologous recombination. We report that the activity of a genomic-integrated 2.2 kb MMP-9 promoter sequence mirrors expression of the endogenous MMP-9 gene in response to both physiological and pharmacological (curcumin) cues. Further, when constrained into chromatin, the integrated NF-kappaB-mutated MMP-9 promoter is repressed by PMA, a situation not apparent using nonintegrated plasmids. Thus, we have developed a novel method for studying MMP-9 expression that overcomes some of the limitations associated with transient transfection approaches and which may be of utility in screening for agents that repress the expression of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1996504780,"We identified seven putative splice variants of the human IG20 gene. Four variants namely, IG20, MADD, IG20-SV2 and DENN-SV are expressed in human tissues. While DENN-SV is constitutively expressed in all tissues, expression of IG20 appears to be regulated. Interestingly, overexpression of DENN-SV enhanced cell replication and resistance to treatments with TNFalpha, vinblastine, etoposide and gamma-radiation. In contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased susceptibility to the above treatments. Moreover, cells that were resistant and susceptible to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis exclusively expressed endogenous DENN-SV and IG20, respectively. When PA-1 ovarian cancer cells that are devoid of endogenous IG20 variant, but express higher levels of DENN-SV, were transfected with IG20, they showed reduced cell proliferation and increased susceptibility to apoptosis induced by TNFalpha, TRAIL and gamma-radiation. This indicated that overexpression of IG20 can override endogenous DENN-SV function. CrmA reversed the effects of IG20, but not DENN-SV. In contrast, dominant-negative-I-kappa B reversed the effects of DENN-SV, but not IG20, and showed that DENN-SV most likely exerted its effects through NFkappaB activation. Together, our data show that IG20 gene can play a novel and significant role in regulating cell proliferation, survival and death through alternative mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2109832653,"The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of countless cell oscillators distributed throughout the body and central pacemakers regulating temporal physiology and behavior. Peripheral clocks display circadian rhythms in gene expression both in vivo and in culture. We examined the biosynthesis of phospholipids as well as the expression of the clock gene period 1 (Per1) and its potential involvement in the regulation of the phospholipid metabolism in cultured quiescent NIH 3T3 cells synchronized by a 2 h serum shock. A 30 min pulse of radiolabeled precursor was given at phases ranging from 0.5 to 62 h after serum treatment. We observed a daily rhythm in the phospholipid labeling that persisted at least for two cycles, with levels significantly decreasing 29 and 58 h after treatment. Per1 expression exhibited a rapid and transient induction and a daily rhythmicity in antiphase to the lipid labeling. After Per1 expression knockdown, the rhythm of phospholipid labeling was lost. Furthermore, in cultures of CLOCK mutant fibroblasts--cells with a clock mechanism impairment--PER1 was equally expressed at all times examined and the phospholipid labeling did not oscillate. The results demonstrate that the biosynthesis of phospholipids oscillates daily in cultured fibroblasts by an endogenous clock mechanism involving Per1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2158002680,"A conserved positive residue in the seventh transmembrane domain of the mammalian proton-coupled di- and tripeptide transporter PepT1 has been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be a key residue for protein function. Substitution of arginine 282 with a glutamate residue (R282E-PepT1) gave a protein at the plasma membrane of Xenopus laevis oocytes that was able to transport the non-hydrolyzable dipeptide [3H]d-Phe-l-Gln, although unlike the wild type, the rate of transport by R282E-PepT1 was independent of the extracellular pH level, and the substrate could not be accumulated above equilibrium. The binding affinity of the mutant transport protein was unchanged from the wild type. Thus, R282E-Pept1 appears to have been changed from a proton-driven to a facilitated transporter for peptides. In addition, peptide transport by R282E-PepT1 still induced depolarization as measured by microelectrode recordings of membrane potential. A more detailed study by two-electrode voltage clamping revealed that R282E-PepT1 behaved as a peptide-gated non-selective cation channel with the ion selectivity series lithium > sodium > N-methyl-d-glucamine at pH 7.4. There was also a proton conductance (comparing pH 7.4 and 8.4), and at pH 5.5 the predominant conductance was for potassium ions. Therefore, it can be concluded that changing arginine 282 to a glutamate not only uncouples the cotransport of protons and peptides of the wild-type PepT1 but also creates a peptide-gated cation channel in the protein.

Proton-coupled transport of di- and tripeptides is well established as the major route for absorption of dietary nitrogen across the intestinal epithelium as well as reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney (1Meredith D. Boyd C.A.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 754-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the membrane transport protein responsible for uptake in the intestine and renal cortical proximal tubule (PepT1) has been cloned, first from rabbit small intestine (2Fei Y.J.

Physiol. 2003; 447: 610-618PubMed Google Scholar). The PepT1 gene encodes a protein of 707 amino acids that spans 12 transmembranes, for which there is no direct structural information except for the confirmation of the membrane topology (4Covitz K.M.

Indirect approaches to elucidating the protein structure have led to the proposal of a template for transported substrates (5Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. Collier I.D. Meredith D. Morgan K.M.

One residue of interest is Arg-282 because it is highly conserved as a positively charged residue between species and also represents a charged residue in a transmembrane region (TM)7. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane region; Mes, 2-(N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane region; Mes, 2-(N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. From the topology model, this residue would be predicted to be toward the cytoplasmic end of TM7 with our working hypothesis suggesting that Arg-282 might be involved in the gating of PepT1, possibly by charge-pairing to another negatively charged residue. 2P. D. Bailey, personal communication. 2P. D. Bailey, personal communication. A study by Bolger et al. (6Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T.

This was in agreement with their computer modeling that predicted that Arg-282 was involved in regulating translocation. During the preparation of this manuscript, it was reported that an R282E mutation in human PepT1 reduced uptake activity (7Kulkarni A.A. Haworth I.S. Lee V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but no kinetic characterization was performed. Here it is reported that rabbit PepT1 with an R282E mutation still transports dipeptides but in a manner analogous to facilitated diffusion. R282E-PepT1 also demonstrates a peptide-gated, nonspecific cation conductance pathway. Therefore, it is proposed that Arg-282 plays an essential role in the proton-coupling of peptide transport by rabbit PepT1. Preliminary results from this study have been published in abstract form (8Meredith D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 130Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized (Sigma-Genosys, Haverhill, Cambridgeshire UK) for the following sequences (residues in bold are changed from wild-type PepT1). R282E-PepT1 forward was 5′-CAGATCAAGATGGTTACGGAGGTGCTGTTCCTGTACATC-3′, and R282E-PepT1 reverse was 5′-GATGTACAGGAACAGCACCTCCGTAACCATCTTGATCTG-3′. Site-directed mutants were generated using the QuikChange protocol (Promega, Southampton, UK), and the resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (carried out at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). cRNA Synthesis and Oocyte Injection—Constructs were linearized with XbaI (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, Hertfordshire UK), and cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Cambridgeshire, UK). Healthy looking Xenopus laevis oocytes (stages V and VI) were obtained by previously described methods (9Meredith D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. Bailey P.D. Morgan K.M. Collier I.D. Temple C.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 629-634Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and maintained at 8° C in modified Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.42 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μg ml–1 gentamicin (Fluka, Poole, UK), adjusted to a pH of 7.6 with NaOH). Transport measurements were performed at least 72 h after microinjection of oocytes with 27.6 nl of cRNA (1 μg/μl) with medium changed daily. Transport Experiments—Uptake of [3H]d-Phe-l-Gln (17.4 Ci/mmol, custom synthesized by Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Stockton-on-Tees, UK) was performed as previously described (9Meredith D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. Bailey P.D. Morgan K.M. Collier I.D. Temple C.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 629-634Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, five oocytes were incubated in 100 μl of uptake medium (95 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.42 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4, or Tris/4-Mes, pH 5.5) with tracer (0.4 μm) [3H]d-Phe-l-Gln. After incubation, the oocytes were washed sequentially five times in 1 ml of ice-cold uptake medium, then lysed individually with 100 μl of 2% (w/v) SDS, and counted by liquid scintillation. When used for collapsing the membrane potential, the high K+ uptake medium had the following composition: 97 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.42 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4. Trans-stimulation experiments were performed by preinjecting the oocytes with 4.6 nl of [3H]d-Phe-l-Gln. The oocytes were allowed to recover for 15 min in 1 ml of uptake medium, pH 5.5, before being transferred to 100 μl of uptake medium, pH 5.5, containing 20 mm Gly-l-Gln (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK). As a control, oocytes were also incubated in uptake medium without Gly-l-Gln. After incubation for 90 min, the oocytes were washed, lysed, and counted by scintillation as described above. Electrophysiology—Membrane potential was measured using a Dagan CA-1B amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Oocytes impaled with a AgCl/3 m KCl-filled glass microelectrode (resistance ∼0.5 megohm) were superfused with uptake medium containing 2 mm Gly-l-Gln or uptake medium alone as a control. The changes in membrane potential as recorded against a second microelectrode close to the oocyte in the bath were recorded on a chart recorder. A two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using the Dagan CA-1B amplifier in clamp mode with two electrodes impaling the oocyte and the bath electrode positioned as close as possible to the oocyte. Step changes from the holding membrane potential of –50 mV were made over a range of +40 to –150 mV in 10-mV increments, held for 100 ms (using the Clampex program), and analyzed with the Clampfit software (pCLAMP 6.0 software suite, Axon Instruments, Inc., CA). Uptake of d-Phe-l-Gln by R282E-PepT1 Compared with wt-PepT1 at pH 5.5 and 7.4 —The uptake of dipeptide by wt-PepT1 at pH 5.5 was 2.3-fold that at pH 7.4, whereas the uptake for R282E-PepT1 at both pH 5.5 and 7.4 was almost equal (Fig. 1). The absolute uptake by R282E-PepT1 was 42 ± 7% and 71 ± 6% compared with that of wt-PepT1 at pH 5.5 and 7.4, respectively (n = 3). Although uptake was no longer stimulated by an inwardly directed proton gradient, peptide transport by R282E-PepT1 was still sensitive to the histidine-modifying reagent diethylpyrocarbonate (5 mm, 10-min preincubation, data not shown) as is the wild type (10Meredith D. Temple C.S. Boyd C.A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 65Google Scholar). The transport of dipeptide by R282E-PepT1 was also unaffected by the replacement of sodium ions in the medium with lithium (Fig. 1). Kinetic Determination of R282E-PepT1—To ascertain whether the binding affinity for R282E-PepT1 was altered from that of wt-PepT1, inhibition studies were performed using increasing concentrations of the neutral dipeptide Gly-l-Gln at both pH 5.5 and 7.4 (Fig. 2). As can be seen, both R282E-PepT1 and wt-PepT1 show the same Ki for Gly-l-Gln against the uptake of d-Phe-l-Gln at pH 5.5 (∼0.2 mm) and 7.4 (∼0.1 mm). Rates of Trans-stimulation by R282E-PepT1 and wt-PepT1— Despite having the same Ki for Gly-l-Gln, under trans-stimulation conditions there was a greater percentage of trans-stimulation for R282E-PepT1 than for wt-PepT1 under the same conditions, pH 5.5 (Fig. 3). Taken together with the finding that uptake is not stimulated by external acidification, the fact that there was a faster efflux of labeled element from the R282E-PepT1-expressing oocytes, despite the conditions favoring uptake (i.e. pH 5.5 plus membrane potential), is strongly suggestive that transport is not pH-driven. Time Course of Uptake at pH 5.5 Versus pH 7.4 —In the wild-type PepT1, transport is driven by both the proton gradient plus the membrane potential (11Temple C.S. Bronk J.R. Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A.R. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this allows dipeptides to be concentrated above the extracellular level. This can be seen in Fig. 4, in which the uptake of dipeptide by wt-PepT1 at pH 5.5 is linear over 4 h and reaches ∼4 times the concentration expected for the simple equilibration of a neutral substrate (assuming an intra-oocyte volume of 1 μl). In contrast, in the absence of a proton gradient, only the membrane potential is driving uptake, and as can be seen there is little concentrative uptake. By comparison, the R282E-PepT1 mutant shows no uptake above equilibrium at either pH 5.5 or 7.4, indicating that the uptake of peptide is no longer coupled to the proton gradient. Electrophysiological Characterization of R282E-PepT1— Electrophysiology was used to measure membrane potential by impaling the oocyte with a single glass electrode. The membrane potentials measured (Table I) show there was no difference between the resting potentials for wt-PepT1 or R282E-PepT1 expressing oocytes. At pH 7.4, the resting potential was slightly lower than it was at pH 5.5. This may be explained by an increased proton current through the membrane at pH 5.5, causing a depolarization. As would be expected, in the wild type there was a significant depolarization of membrane potential on application of 2 mm Gly-l-Gln, caused by the electrogenic cotransport of dipeptide and protons. This was seen at both pH 5.5 (–17.7 to +8.7 mV) and 7.4 (–25.0 to –2.0 mV). For the R282E-PepT1 mutant, the depolarization at pH 5.5 was larger than that for the wild type (at –16.3 to +31.0 mV) despite the rate of peptide uptake being less than half as great under these conditions. At pH 7.4, the mutant R282E-PepT1 again showed a larger depolarization (–23.7 to +9.0 mV) than the wild type, and the overall depolarization was smaller at +33 mV compared with that seen at pH 5.5 (+47 mV). The fact that the R282E-PepT1 oocytes depolarized to more positive potentials (+9.0 ± 1.0 mV) at an external pH level of 7.4 than the wt-PepT1 (–2.0 ± 4.4 mV) suggested that there were additional currents being generated by the mutant transporter.Table ISteady-state membrane potential valuespHResting EmEm + 2 mm Gly-l-GlnDepolarizationmVmVmVwt5.5-17.7 ± 1.8+8.7 ± 3.8+26.3 ± 3.0R282E5.5-16.3 ± 2.3+31.0 ± 2.3+47.3 ± 6.0NIaNI, non-injected.5.5-9.7 ± 0.7-9.7 ± 0.70wt7.4-25.0 ± 4.0-2.0 ± 4.4+23.0 ± 1.4R282E7.4-23.7 ± 4.5+9.0 ± 1.0+32.7 ± 4.5a NI, non-injected. Open table in a new tab To further characterize these peptide-induced currents, R282E-PepT1 expressing oocytes were voltage-clamped, and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were investigated (Fig. 5). As can be seen from looking at the reversal potentials, the current appears to be generated from the nonspecific movement of cations. this conclusion is reached from the following observations. (i) Changing the external pH from 7.4 to 8.4 shifts the reversal potential more negatively (approximately +15 to –20 mV, respectively), indicating the involvement of proton movement. (ii) Replacing the sodium with lithium (at pH 7.4) shifted the reversal potential to a much more positive value, indicating that lithium has a greater permeability than sodium. (iii) The permeability to sodium inferred from (ii) is confirmed by the effect of replacing sodium with N-methyl-d-glucamine (both pH 7.4), which gives a much more negative reversal potential. (iv) At pH 5.5 the reversal potential is approximately –120 mV, indicating that under these conditions the predominant ion movement is that of potassium. In the absence of a crystal structure for PepT1, the structure of the protein, its binding site, and the mechanism of operation can only be determined by indirect approaches. In all known mammalian isoforms of PepT1 there is absolute conservation of a positively charged amino acid in TM7, consisting of an arginine in humans, rabbit, pig, and sheep or a lysine in dog, mouse, and rat. Interestingly, PepT2 isoforms in the mouse and rat have an arginine at the homologous position (Arg-301 in rabbit PepT2). In this study, site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-282 of the rabbit PepT1 sequence to a negatively charged glutamate residue has provided an interesting insight into the way in which PepT1 functions. Uptake of the model dipeptide d-Phe-l-Gln by R282E-PepT1 was shown to be uncoupled from the obligatory cotransport with protons of the wild type, with the mutant transporter no longer able to concentrate substrate above the extracellular level. A similar result was found for the Escherichia coli lactose permease when a TM arginine (Arg-302) was mutated to a leucine; the ability of E. coli to concentrate lactose was abolished whereas the proton flux was increased, although in this case the Km value was increased by almost 10-fold (12Matzke E.A. Stephenson L.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19095-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is strong biochemical evidence that Glu-325 is protonated during the transport cycle and that an interaction between Arg-302 and Glu-325 is responsible for the release of this proton into the cytoplasm (13Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6068-6073Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Very recently (14Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of the E. coli lactose permease has been resolved, showing Arg-302 to be in a hydrophobic environment, which, because there are no hydrogen bond donors in the immediate vicinity, would favor its being in the protonated state. In the crystal structure, Arg-302 is ∼7 Å away from Glu-325, meaning that a large side chain rearrangement would be necessary for these two residues to form a direct salt bridge, although the authors proposed that these residues may interact via hydrogen bonds to Tyr-236. Intriguingly, in PepT1 there is a conserved tyrosine (Tyr-167) in TM5 that has been shown to be essential for PepT1 transport activity (6Bolger M.B. Haworth I.S. Yeung A.K. Ann D. von Grafenstein H. Hamm-Alvarez S. Okamoto C.T. Kim K.J. Basu S.K. Wu S. Lee V.H. J. Pharm. Sci. 1998; 87: 1286-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and a conserved glutamate, Glu-594, in TM10 that is also essential (E594D-PepT1 was expressed at the plasma membrane but had no transport activity in Xenopus oocytes (see Ref. 8Meredith D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 130Google Scholar)), although this has previously been proposed to act as the binding site for the N terminus of the substrate (5Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. Collier I.D. Meredith D. Morgan K.M. Temple C.S. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 506-508Crossref Google Scholar). There is also a conserved aspartate residue (Asp-341) in TM8 that may be involved, and future experiments will investigate this. The depolarization observed with R282E-PepT1 could be caused by the movement of a number of ions through an uncoupled but peptide-gated pathway in the mutant PepT1 transporter protein in which protons, sodium or calcium ions entering or chloride ions exiting the oocyte, could all account for the observed charge movements. Because of the observations that the level to which the R282E-PepT1 oocyte is depolarized is greatly reduced from +31 to +9 mV when pHout is changed from 5.5 to 7.4, respectively, and that the overall observed current is decreased, the most likely candidate is protons. The lower resting potential would be predicted to increase the driving forces for chloride efflux and sodium influx, assuming that the properties of the ion-conducting pathway through R282E-PepT1 remain unaffected by extracellular pH, whereas the opposite is observed. In contrast, the decrease in the magnitude of the peptide-induced depolarization on raising pHout is exactly as would be predicted for a proton entry pathway because the chemical gradient for entry will be reduced as pH is raised from 5.5 to 7.4, and proton entry is driven solely by the membrane potential. The hypothesis that protons are involved in the current is supported by the two-electrode voltage clamp data, but there is also evidence for movement of other cations as well. The currents and reversal potentials seen for pH 7.4 indicate that the conductance has the permeability series lithium > sodium > N-methyl-d-glucamine. The conductance seen at pH 5.5 suggests that protonation of residues in the PepT1 protein cause an increase in the ion permeability to potassium, hence the highly negative reversal potential. These findings are in contrast with studies in this laboratory (17Beattie L.A. Electrophysiological Analysis of the Epithelial H+/Oligopeptide Transporter, PEPT1. 2001; (D.Phil. thesis, University of Oxford)Google Scholar) and with electrophysiological studies of wild-type rabbit PepT1, in which all the charge movement was attributable to the movement of protons (15Steel A. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Boyd C.A.R. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 563-569Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The dissociation of transport and ion movement is not without precedent. In the lactose permease of E. coli, mutation of a transmembrane region arginine (Arg-302) to a leucine has been found not only to abolish the ability of E. coli to concentrate lactose but also to cause a sugar-dependent proton leak (12Matzke E.A. Stephenson L.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19095-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that mutation of arginine 445 to a serine in the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 to non-positive residues results in reduced transport of glutamate along with uncoupled movements of the cations sodium and potassium (16Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, as with the mutation in the lactose permease, the affinity of R445S-EAAC1 is much lower than that of the wild type, suggesting that in both cases these residues are involved in substrate binding. This is not the case for R282E-PepT1, in which the affinity is the same for both the mutant and the wild type, indicating that this arginine residue is not directly involved in the substrate binding site but is involved in the proton-coupling pathway. The finding that mutation of a single amino acid residue in PepT1 changes its mode of action from an active (i.e. proton-coupled) to a facilitated peptide transporter (with a peptide-induced cation current) shows how close the protein sequence can be between different types of transporter.

https://openalex.org/W1996612750,"Renovascular hypertension is characterized by stenosis of the renal artery and high plasma renin levels. The renal phenotype is characterized by high levels of renin in the hypoperfused kidney due to the recruitment of renin-producing cells along the afferent arterioles. This increase in myoepithelioïd cells is due mainly to the differentiation of existing smooth muscle cells with acquisition of a secretory phenotype. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in this recruitment, we used the established rat model of renovascular hypertension known as the two-kidney, one-clip model in the Lewis rat. Renal arterioles were isolated using magnetized iron suspension. Differential proteomic analysis was performed using 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. Comparative analysis of soluble proteins extracted from afferent arterioles of clipped and contralateral kidneys showed 14 proteins significantly differentially expressed by at least a factor of 2. These proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The most striking protein revealed by proteomics is troponin T, which is down-regulated in the afferent arterioles of the clipped kidney. Confocal microscopy showed that troponin T is specific of the smooth muscle phenotype and absent in the myoepithelioïd phenotype. Our data suggest that troponin T is only present in renal smooth muscle cells."

In fundal strips from rats pre-treated with endotoxin (40 microg/kg, i.p. 30 min), mechanical activity was analyzed and the source of nitric oxide (NO) was visualized by confocal microscopy of tissue loaded with the fluorescent dye DAF-FM. NOS expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, and enzyme activity by the citrulline assay. Strips from endotoxin-treated rats were hypo-contractile. This was prevented by pre-incubation with the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, the gangliar blocker hexamethonium, or non-selective and neuronal-specific NOS inhibitors (L-NOARG and TRIM, respectively). The soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ and the inhibitor of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels apamin prevented relaxation induced by endotoxin, nicotine, exogenous NO (DETA-NONOate), and the NO-independent sGC activator BAY 41-2272. NO synthesis was observed in neuronal soma, axons, and nerve endings of the myenteric plexus in the fundus of endotoxin-treated rats and was prevented by L-NAME, tetrodotoxin, and hexamethonium. nNOS and iNOS mRNA and protein contents were unchanged. Our findings demonstrate synthesis of NO in post-ganglionic myenteric neurons during early endotoxemia that mediates gastric hypo-contractility. The effect of NO is mediated via sGC and small conductance Ca2+-activated K+channels."
https://openalex.org/W1996049797,"Myc proteins are transcriptional activators, but also repress transcription through initiator (Inr) elements. Repression requires the conserved Myc Box II, but the cis-acting element(s) required for c-myc autorepression have eluded definition. Since the gene has a candidate Inr at the P2 promoter, we tested whether Myc autorepression operates through the Inr/BoxII mechanism. Overexpression of c-Myc but not a Box II deletion mutation represses both c-myc P2 reporter genes and endogenous c-myc, as does Mxi1 expression. Only 45 nucleotides surrounding the P2 start suffice to mediate autorepression, but Myc and Mxi1 also downregulate P2 Inr mutations, suggesting other core promoter sequence requirements for autorepression. We tested the importance of conserved E2F sites, based on known Myc interaction with the pRb-related p107 and on the transrepressive effects of Rb family proteins. Myc, Mxi1, and p107 repress c-myc somewhat less well in the absence of E2F binding sites, while an E2F+Inr double mutation is not repressed at all by these gene products. Further, Myc repression at the c-myc P2 core promoter is augmented by p107, but not by pRb or p130, nor by p107 lacking the conserved pocket domain. Our data suggest that Myc autorepression requires both the c-myc Inr and E2F sites in cis, as well as p107 in trans. Consistent with this, we found that retrovirally transduced c-Myc cannot downregulate endogenous c-myc in p107-null fibroblasts, and show evidence that both Myc and p107 are present in a complex assembled at the c-myc P2 core promoter."
