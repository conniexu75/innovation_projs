https://openalex.org/W2073872893,"Giving Electrocatalysts an Edge Platinum (Pt) is an excellent catalyst for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and electrolyzers, but it is too expensive and scarce for widespread deployment, even when dispersed as Pt nanoparticles on carbon electrode supports (Pt/C). Alternatively, Chen et al. (p. 1339 , published online 27 February; see the Perspective by Greer ) made highly active ORR catalysts by dissolving away the interior of rhombic dodecahedral PtNi 3 nanocrystals to leave Pt-rich Pt 3 Ni edges. These nanoframe catalysts are durable—remaining active after 10,000 rounds of voltage cycling—and are far more active than Pt/C."
https://openalex.org/W2043565262,"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a tool for visualizing protein expression that is employed as part of the diagnostic workup for the majority of solid tissue malignancies. Existing IHC methods use antibodies tagged with fluorophores or enzyme reporters that generate colored pigments. Because these reporters exhibit spectral and spatial overlap when used simultaneously, multiplexed IHC is not routinely used in clinical settings. We have developed a method that uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to image antibodies tagged with isotopically pure elemental metal reporters. Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is capable of analyzing up to 100 targets simultaneously over a five-log dynamic range. Here, we used MIBI to analyze formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast tumor tissue sections stained with ten labels simultaneously. The resulting data suggest that MIBI can provide new insights into disease pathogenesis that will be valuable for basic research, drug discovery and clinical diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W1964049834,"Numerous studies have examined the neuronal inputs and outputs of many areas within the mammalian cerebral cortex, but how these areas are organized into neural networks that communicate across the entire cortex is unclear. Over 600 labeled neuronal pathways acquired from tracer injections placed across the entire mouse neocortex enabled us to generate a cortical connectivity atlas. A total of 240 intracortical connections were manually reconstructed within a common neuroanatomic framework, forming a cortico-cortical connectivity map that facilitates comparison of connections from different cortical targets. Connectivity matrices were generated to provide an overview of all intracortical connections and subnetwork clusterings. The connectivity matrices and cortical map revealed that the entire cortex is organized into four somatic sensorimotor, two medial, and two lateral subnetworks that display unique topologies and can interact through select cortical areas. Together, these data provide a resource that can be used to further investigate cortical networks and their corresponding functions."
https://openalex.org/W2058689904,"Brain metastasis is an ominous complication of cancer, yet most cancer cells that infiltrate the brain die of unknown causes. Here, we identify plasmin from the reactive brain stroma as a defense against metastatic invasion, and plasminogen activator (PA) inhibitory serpins in cancer cells as a shield against this defense. Plasmin suppresses brain metastasis in two ways: by converting membrane-bound astrocytic FasL into a paracrine death signal for cancer cells, and by inactivating the axon pathfinding molecule L1CAM, which metastatic cells express for spreading along brain capillaries and for metastatic outgrowth. Brain metastatic cells from lung cancer and breast cancer express high levels of anti-PA serpins, including neuroserpin and serpin B2, to prevent plasmin generation and its metastasis-suppressive effects. By protecting cancer cells from death signals and fostering vascular co-option, anti-PA serpins provide a unifying mechanism for the initiation of brain metastasis in lung and breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2106855445,"Mucus production by goblet cells of the large intestine serves as a crucial antimicrobial protective mechanism at the interface between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells of the mammalian intestinal ecosystem. However, the regulatory pathways involved in goblet cell-induced mucus secretion remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the NLRP6 inflammasome, a recently described regulator of colonic microbiota composition and biogeographical distribution, is a critical orchestrator of goblet cell mucin granule exocytosis. NLRP6 deficiency leads to defective autophagy in goblet cells and abrogated mucus secretion into the large intestinal lumen. Consequently, NLRP6 inflammasome-deficient mice are unable to clear enteric pathogens from the mucosal surface, rendering them highly susceptible to persistent infection. This study identifies an innate immune regulatory pathway governing goblet cell mucus secretion, linking nonhematopoietic inflammasome signaling to autophagy and highlighting the goblet cell as a critical innate immune player in the control of intestinal host-microbial mutualism. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2148937727,"Atherosclerotic lesions develop preferentially at sites of disturbed blood flow. As shown by Christian Weber and his coworkers, this predilection stems from effects of disturbed blood flow on endothelial expression of the microRNA miR-126-5p, which maintains the proliferative reserve of endothelial cells through repression of the Notch pathway inhibitor Dlk1. Atherosclerosis, a hyperlipidemia-induced chronic inflammatory process of the arterial wall, develops preferentially at sites where disturbed laminar flow compromises endothelial cell (EC) function. Here we show that endothelial miR-126-5p maintains a proliferative reserve in ECs through suppression of the Notch1 inhibitor delta-like 1 homolog (Dlk1) and thereby prevents atherosclerotic lesion formation. Endothelial recovery after denudation was impaired in Mir126−/− mice because lack of miR-126-5p, but not miR-126-3p, reduced EC proliferation by derepressing Dlk1. At nonpredilection sites, high miR-126-5p levels in endothelial cells confer a proliferative reserve that compensates for the antiproliferative effects of hyperlipidemia, such that atherosclerosis was exacerbated in Mir126−/− mice. In contrast, downregulation of miR-126-5p by disturbed flow abrogated EC proliferation at predilection sites in response to hyperlipidemic stress through upregulation of Dlk1 expression. Administration of miR-126-5p rescued EC proliferation at predilection sites and limited atherosclerosis, introducing a potential therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1986947784,"The generation of large numbers of functional human hepatocytes for cell-based approaches to liver disease is an important and unmet goal. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to hepatic lineages could offer a solution to this problem but so far has only been achieved with mouse cells. Here, we generated human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps) from fibroblasts by lentiviral expression of FOXA3, HNF1A, and HNF4A. hiHeps express hepatic gene programs, can be expanded in vitro, and display functions characteristic of mature hepatocytes, including cytochrome P450 enzyme activity and biliary drug clearance. Upon transplantation into mice with concanavalin-A-induced acute liver failure and fatal metabolic liver disease due to fumarylacetoacetate dehydrolase (Fah) deficiency, hiHeps restore the liver function and prolong survival. Collectively, our results demonstrate successful lineage conversion of nonhepatic human cells into mature hepatocytes with potential for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2132484969,"David Altshuler and colleagues report genotyping or sequencing of ∼150,000 individuals from several population-based cohorts, identifying 12 rare protein-truncating variants in SLC30A8, encoding a pancreatic islet zinc transporter. Carriers of these rare protein-truncating variants in SLC30A8 show reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and reduced glucose levels. Loss-of-function mutations protective against human disease provide in vivo validation of therapeutic targets1,2,3, but none have yet been described for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Through sequencing or genotyping of ∼150,000 individuals across 5 ancestry groups, we identified 12 rare protein-truncating variants in SLC30A8, which encodes an islet zinc transporter (ZnT8)4 and harbors a common variant (p.Trp325Arg) associated with T2D risk and glucose and proinsulin levels5,6,7. Collectively, carriers of protein-truncating variants had 65% reduced T2D risk (P = 1.7 × 10−6), and non-diabetic Icelandic carriers of a frameshift variant (p.Lys34Serfs*50) demonstrated reduced glucose levels (−0.17 s.d., P = 4.6 × 10−4). The two most common protein-truncating variants (p.Arg138* and p.Lys34Serfs*50) individually associate with T2D protection and encode unstable ZnT8 proteins. Previous functional study of SLC30A8 suggested that reduced zinc transport increases T2D risk8,9, and phenotypic heterogeneity was observed in mouse Slc30a8 knockouts10,11,12,13,14,15. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in humans provide strong evidence that SLC30A8 haploinsufficiency protects against T2D, suggesting ZnT8 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in T2D prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1974489853,"Oncogenic Suspect Exposed It can be difficult logistically to study the genomics of rare variants of common cancers. Nevertheless, Honeyman et al. (p. 1010 ) studied fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a rare and poorly understood liver tumor that affects adolescents and young adults and for which there is no effective treatment. FL-HCCs from 15 patients all expressed a chimeric RNA transcript and protein containing sequences from a molecular chaperone fused in frame with sequences from the catalytic domain of protein kinase A. The chimeric protein retained kinase activity in vitro. Such recurrent gene fusions in cancer may signal a role in pathogenesis and provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2116999868,"Multiple sensory cues emanating from humans are thought to guide blood-feeding female mosquitoes to a host. To determine the relative contribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) detection to mosquito host-seeking behavior, we mutated the AaegGr3 gene, a subunit of the heteromeric CO2 receptor in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Gr3 mutants lack electrophysiological and behavioral responses to CO2. These mutants also fail to show CO2-evoked responses to heat and lactic acid, a human-derived attractant, suggesting that CO2 can gate responses to other sensory stimuli. Whereas attraction of Gr3 mutants to live humans in a large semi-field environment was only slightly impaired, responses to an animal host were greatly reduced in a spatial-scale-dependent manner. Synergistic integration of heat and odor cues likely drive host-seeking behavior in the absence of CO2 detection. We reveal a networked series of interactions by which multimodal integration of CO2, human odor, and heat orchestrates mosquito attraction to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2020663470,"Ribosomes that stall before completing peptide synthesis must be recycled and returned to the cytoplasmic pool. The protein Dom34 and cofactors Hbs1 and Rli1 can dissociate stalled ribosomes in vitro, but the identity of targets in the cell is unknown. Here, we extend ribosome profiling methodology to reveal a high-resolution molecular characterization of Dom34 function in vivo. Dom34 removes stalled ribosomes from truncated mRNAs, but, in contrast, does not generally dissociate ribosomes on coding sequences known to trigger stalling, such as polyproline. We also show that Dom34 targets arrested ribosomes near the ends of 3' UTRs. These ribosomes appear to gain access to the 3' UTR via a mechanism that does not require decoding of the mRNA. These results suggest that ribosomes frequently enter downstream noncoding regions and that Dom34 carries out the important task of rescuing them."
https://openalex.org/W1987835971,"The identification of activating NOTCH1 mutations in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) led to clinical testing of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) that prevent NOTCH1 activation. However, responses to these inhibitors have been transient, suggesting that resistance limits their clinical efficacy. Here we modeled T-ALL resistance, identifying GSI-tolerant 'persister' cells that expand in the absence of NOTCH1 signaling. Rare persisters are already present in naive T-ALL populations, and the reversibility of their phenotype suggests an epigenetic mechanism. Relative to GSI-sensitive cells, persister cells activate distinct signaling and transcriptional programs and exhibit chromatin compaction. A knockdown screen identified chromatin regulators essential for persister viability, including BRD4. BRD4 binds enhancers near critical T-ALL genes, including MYC and BCL2. The BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 downregulates expression of these targets and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in persister cells, at doses well tolerated by GSI-sensitive cells. Consistently, the GSI-JQ1 combination was found to be effective against primary human leukemias in vivo. Our findings establish a role for epigenetic heterogeneity in leukemia resistance that may be addressed by incorporating epigenetic modulators in combination therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2060810779,"The ventral pallidum is centrally positioned within mesocorticolimbic reward circuits, and its dense projection to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) regulates neuronal activity there. However, the ventral pallidum is a heterogeneous structure, and how this complexity affects its role within wider reward circuits is unclear. We found that projections to VTA from the rostral ventral pallidum (RVP), but not the caudal ventral pallidum (CVP), were robustly Fos activated during cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking--a rat model of relapse in addiction. Moreover, designer receptor-mediated transient inactivation of RVP neurons, their terminals in VTA or functional connectivity between RVP and VTA dopamine neurons blocked the ability of drug-associated cues (but not a cocaine prime) to reinstate cocaine seeking. In contrast, CVP neuronal inhibition blocked cocaine-primed, but not cue-induced, reinstatement. This double dissociation in ventral pallidum subregional roles in drug seeking is likely to be important for understanding the mesocorticolimbic circuits underlying reward seeking and addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2166840595,"Global downregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is commonly observed in human cancers and can have a causative role in tumorigenesis. The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we show that YAP, the downstream target of the tumor-suppressive Hippo-signaling pathway regulates miRNA biogenesis in a cell-density-dependent manner. At low cell density, nuclear YAP binds and sequesters p72 (DDX17), a regulatory component of the miRNA-processing machinery. At high cell density, Hippo-mediated cytoplasmic retention of YAP facilitates p72 association with Microprocessor and binding to a specific sequence motif in pri-miRNAs. Inactivation of the Hippo pathway or expression of constitutively active YAP causes widespread miRNA suppression in cells and tumors and a corresponding posttranscriptional induction of MYC expression. Thus, the Hippo pathway links contact-inhibition regulation to miRNA biogenesis and may be responsible for the widespread miRNA repression observed in cancer.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI1YWYxYmMzMDExODhlYjUyZWIwYjQ5Y2U3MGQ4OTc1MyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDU2MTYxfQ.fmsSt5_btGpyRwJed8XjhZd9SbW5nGSik9BKQ8LRyZ3cXcYpXzyapGVKqK7UErztBmm708k8H-MyVPliO_L6cp3BYxEVYU8xSqfWreQpikpCXUs8k-X9OsdLNdLYkdn4NiUPpxOA9txgqKZJUA4z02D1zFz6OtUw4AljfcshXV0K5-oG61fcPLmUDfb_Em_xKet-cHcOSljfvu0dSqv2ibJP55Gtg5IlZGX61l2Luwmv-RGVYPRp3w4fIoFVCPR5YVqHTpwB3Kn-Y9FwZ4PHstna8kV_0GOq6cz0A2ATfm-DRLqtA1xn8fdzeNT8PvKE6MiB37Ynlz05iWlk7swK4w(mp4, (18.24 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2072981794,"Concomitant inhibition of multiple cancer-driving kinases is an established strategy to improve the durability of clinical responses to targeted therapies. The difficulty of discovering kinase inhibitors with an appropriate multitarget profile has, however, necessitated the application of combination therapies, which can pose major clinical development challenges. Epigenetic reader domains of the bromodomain family have recently emerged as new targets for cancer therapy. Here we report that several clinical kinase inhibitors also inhibit bromodomains with therapeutically relevant potencies and are best classified as dual kinase-bromodomain inhibitors. Nanomolar activity on BRD4 by BI-2536 and TG-101348, which are clinical PLK1 and JAK2-FLT3 kinase inhibitors, respectively, is particularly noteworthy as these combinations of activities on independent oncogenic pathways exemplify a new strategy for rational single-agent polypharmacological targeting. Furthermore, structure-activity relationships and co-crystal structures identify design features that enable a general platform for the rational design of dual kinase-bromodomain inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1968832732,"Obtaining fully functional cell types is a major challenge for drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Currently, a fundamental solution to this key problem is still lacking. Here, we show that functional human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps) can be generated from fibroblasts by overexpressing the hepatic fate conversion factors HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF6 along with the maturation factors ATF5, PROX1, and CEBPA. hiHeps express a spectrum of phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes and phase III drug transporters. Importantly, the metabolic activities of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are comparable between hiHeps and freshly isolated primary human hepatocytes. Transplanted hiHeps repopulate up to 30% of the livers of Tet-uPA/Rag2(-/-)/γc(-/-) mice and secrete more than 300 μg/ml human ALBUMIN in vivo. Our data demonstrate that human hepatocytes with drug metabolic function can be generated by lineage reprogramming, thus providing a cell resource for pharmaceutical applications."

Xu et al. (p. 1025 ) analyzed a signaling pathway involving ABP1 (auxin-binding protein 1) that affects the cytoskeleton and endocytosis in Arabidopsis without changing gene transcription. Instead, ABP1 functions at the cell surface to bind auxin and a family of membrane kinases, thereby activating intracellular guanosine triphosphatases to initiate important developmental changes in cell shape."
https://openalex.org/W2012974517,"Repeat Silencing Fragile X syndrome, a genetic cause of many cases of autism and mental retardation, involves expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Working with human embryonic stem cells, Colak et al. (p. 1002 ) found that the expanded repeat region was transcribed into the untranslated region of FMR1 messenger RNA, which then bound to the DNA repeat region in the FMR1 gene, inactivating the gene. The findings explain how the trinucleotide repeat expansion causes RNA-directed gene silencing during development in fragile X syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1993050837,"Protein folding in the cell relies on the orchestrated action of conserved families of molecular chaperones, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 systems. Hsp70 acts early and Hsp90 late in the folding path, yet the molecular basis of this timing is enigmatic, mainly because the substrate specificity of Hsp90 is poorly understood. Here, we obtained a structural model of Hsp90 in complex with its natural disease-associated substrate, the intrinsically disordered Tau protein. Hsp90 binds to a broad region in Tau that includes the aggregation-prone repeats. Complementarily, a 106-Å-long substrate-binding interface in Hsp90 enables many low-affinity contacts. This allows recognition of scattered hydrophobic residues in late folding intermediates that remain after early burial of the Hsp70 sites. Our model resolves the paradox of how Hsp90 specifically selects for late folding intermediates but also for some intrinsically disordered proteins-through the eyes of Hsp90 they look the same."
https://openalex.org/W2133775329,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an extended polyglutamine repeat in the N terminus of the Huntingtin protein (HTT). Reactive microglia and elevated cytokine levels are observed in the brains of HD patients, but the extent to which neuroinflammation results from extrinsic or cell-autonomous mechanisms in microglia is unknown. Using genome-wide approaches, we found that expression of mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) in microglia promoted cell-autonomous pro-inflammatory transcriptional activation by increasing the expression and transcriptional activities of the myeloid lineage-determining factors PU.1 and C/EBPs. We observed elevated levels of PU.1 and its target genes in the brains of mouse models and individuals with HD. Moreover, mHTT-expressing microglia exhibited an increased capacity to induce neuronal death ex vivo and in vivo in the presence of sterile inflammation. These findings suggest a cell-autonomous basis for enhanced microglia reactivity that may influence non-cell-autonomous HD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2053812241,"The kinetochore is the macromolecular protein complex that directs chromosome segregation in eukaryotes. It has been widely assumed that the core kinetochore consists of proteins that are common to all eukaryotes. However, no conventional kinetochore components have been identified in any kinetoplastid genome, thus challenging this assumption of universality. Here, we report the identification of 19 kinetochore proteins (KKT1-19) in Trypanosoma brucei. The majority is conserved among kinetoplastids, but none of them has detectable homology to conventional kinetochore proteins. These proteins instead have a variety of features not found in conventional kinetochore proteins. We propose that kinetoplastids build kinetochores using a distinct set of proteins. These findings provide important insights into the longstanding problem of the position of the root of the eukaryotic tree of life."
https://openalex.org/W2071940205,Polymer Film Behavior An ongoing debate in the understanding of the behavior of thin-film glassy polymers is whether there is nanoconfinement of large molecules or enhanced mobility near a free surface. Chai et al. (p. 994 ; see the Perspective by Chen et al. ) prepared polymer films with a sharp step in the profile by depositing broken film fragments onto a uniform underlay. Atomic force microscopy revealed changes to the overall film profile with time at various temperatures. A transition was observed from localized motions to relaxation of the entire film at a temperature close to that of the bulk glass transition temperature.
https://openalex.org/W2029920356,"Obesity is marked by a state of low-grade inflammation, including the accumulation of macrophages in the adipose tissue, which results in insulin resistance. Kathryn Moore and her colleagues now show that the neuronal guidance molecule, netrin-1, is upregulated in fat cells during obesity and leads to the retention of macrophages in this tissue. They also show that its genetic deletion in mice prevents the development of insulin resistance by a high-fat diet. During obesity, macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue propagates the chronic inflammation and insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes. The factors, however, that regulate the accrual of macrophages in adipose tissue are not well understood. Here we show that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is highly expressed in obese but not lean adipose tissue of humans and mice, where it directs the retention of macrophages. Netrin-1, whose expression is induced in macrophages by the saturated fatty acid palmitate, acts via its receptor Unc5b to block their migration. In a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we show that adipose tissue macrophages exhibit reduced migratory capacity, which can be restored by blocking netrin-1. Furthermore, hematopoietic deletion of Ntn1 facilitates adipose tissue macrophage emigration, reduces inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity. Collectively, these findings identify netrin-1 as a macrophage retention signal in adipose tissue during obesity that promotes chronic inflammation and insulin resistance."

This ""genotype-first"" approach for complex disease necessitates the development of large, highly integrated networks of researchers, clinicians, and patient families, with the promise of improved therapies for subsets of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2076177169,"Simultaneous performance of two tasks often leads to deficits in the component tasks, an effect thought to depend on the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Here, the authors recorded single-neuron activities in monkey LPFC during two simultaneous tasks, providing direct neurophysiological evidence for models of dual-task interference and capacity limitation. Simultaneous performance of two tasks often leads to performance deficits in the component tasks. This effect, known as dual-task interference, is thought to be a proof of capacity limitation in cognition, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) has been highlighted as its putative neural substrate. Here we recorded single-neuron activities in LPFC while monkeys performed dual tasks that required the simultaneous performance of a varying-load spatial attention task and a spatial memory task. We found that the performance of the monkeys exhibited dual-task interference, and prefrontal neuron activities showed a decreased ability to represent task-relevant information to a degree proportional to the increased demand of the concurrent counterpart task. The locus of the interference was shown to originate in the simultaneous, overloaded recruitment of the same LPFC neural population by the two tasks. These results provide direct neurophysiological evidence for, and constraints to, psychological models of dual-task interference and capacity limitation."
https://openalex.org/W1964268598,"Recent studies recognize a vast diversity of noncoding RNAs with largely unknown functions, but few have examined interspersed repeat sequences, which constitute almost half our genome. RNA hybridization in situ using C0T-1 (highly repeated) DNA probes detects surprisingly abundant euchromatin-associated RNA comprised predominantly of repeat sequences (C0T-1 RNA), including LINE-1. C0T-1-hybridizing RNA strictly localizes to the interphase chromosome territory in cis and remains stably associated with the chromosome territory following prolonged transcriptional inhibition. The C0T-1 RNA territory resists mechanical disruption and fractionates with the nonchromatin scaffold but can be experimentally released. Loss of repeat-rich, stable nuclear RNAs from euchromatin corresponds to aberrant chromatin distribution and condensation. C0T-1 RNA has several properties similar to XIST chromosomal RNA but is excluded from chromatin condensed by XIST. These findings impact two ""black boxes"" of genome science: the poorly understood diversity of noncoding RNA and the unexplained abundance of repetitive elements."
https://openalex.org/W2054722813,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays anaphase until all chromosomes are bioriented on the mitotic spindle. Under current models, unattached kinetochores transduce the SAC by catalyzing the intramitotic production of a diffusible inhibitor of APC/C(Cdc20) (the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator Cdc20, a large ubiquitin ligase). Here we show that nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in interphase cells also function as scaffolds for anaphase-inhibitory signaling. This role is mediated by Mad1-Mad2 complexes tethered to the nuclear basket, which activate soluble Mad2 as a binding partner and inhibitor of Cdc20 in the cytoplasm. Displacing Mad1-Mad2 from nuclear pores accelerated anaphase onset, prevented effective correction of merotelic errors, and increased the threshold of kinetochore-dependent signaling needed to halt mitosis in response to spindle poisons. A heterologous Mad1-NPC tether restored Cdc20 inhibitor production and normal M phase control. We conclude that nuclear pores and kinetochores both emit ""wait anaphase"" signals that preserve genome integrity."

We provide pharmacologic, molecular, and genetic evidence establishing the liver-X nuclear hormone receptor (LXR) as a therapeutic target in melanoma. Oral administration of multiple LXR agonists suppressed melanoma invasion, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. Molecular and genetic experiments revealed these effects to be mediated by LXRβ, which elicits these outcomes through transcriptional induction of tumoral and stromal apolipoprotein-E (ApoE). LXRβ agonism robustly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis across a diverse mutational spectrum of melanoma lines. LXRβ targeting significantly prolonged animal survival, suppressed the progression of established metastases, and inhibited brain metastatic colonization. Importantly, LXRβ activation displayed melanoma-suppressive cooperativity with the frontline regimens dacarbazine, B-Raf inhibition, and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody and robustly inhibited melanomas that had acquired resistance to B-Raf inhibition or dacarbazine. We present a promising therapeutic approach that uniquely acts by transcriptionally activating a metastasis suppressor gene."

RNase L forms a crossed homodimer stabilized by ankyrin (ANK) and kinase homology (KH) domains, which positions two kinase extension nuclease (KEN) domains for asymmetric RNA recognition. One KEN protomer recognizes an identity nucleotide (U), whereas the other protomer cleaves RNA between nucleotides +1 and +2. The coordinated action of the ANK, KH, and KEN domains thereby provides regulated, sequence-specific cleavage of viral and host RNA targets by RNase L."
https://openalex.org/W2056671529,"When exposed to proteotoxic environmental conditions, mammalian cells activate the cytosolic stress response in order to restore protein homeostasis. A key feature of this response is the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1)-dependent expression of molecular chaperones. Here, we describe the results of an RNA interference screen in HeLa cells to identify modulators of stress response induction and attenuation. The modulator proteins are localized in multiple cellular compartments, with chromatin modifiers and nuclear protein quality control playing a central regulatory role. We find that the acetyltransferase, EP300, controls the cellular level of activatable HSF1. This involves acetylation of HSF1 at multiple lysines not required for function and results in stabilization of HSF1 against proteasomal turnover. Acetylation of functionally critical lysines during stress serves to fine-tune HSF1 activation. Finally, the nuclear proteasome system functions in attenuating the stress response by degrading activated HSF1 in a manner linked with the clearance of misfolded proteins."

Using this criteria and immunopurification, we identified an Ago-dependent class of noncanonical miRNAs derived from protein-coding gene promoters, which we name transcriptional start site miRNAs (TSS-miRNAs). A subset of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complexes produces hairpin RNAs that are processed in a DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (Dgcr8)/Drosha-independent but Dicer-dependent manner.

Both intensity and duration of external signals are critical factors in determining what response is initiated. To understand how intracellular signaling networks process such multidimensional information, we studied the AtRGS1-mediated glucose response system of Arabidopsis. By combining experiments with mathematical modeling, we discovered a reciprocal dose and duration response relying on the orchestrated action of three kinases (AtWNK1, AtWNK8, and AtWNK10) acting on distinct timescales and activation thresholds. Specifically, we find that high concentrations of D-glucose rapidly signal through AtWNK8 and AtWNK10, whereas low, sustained sugar concentration slowly activate the pathway through AtWNK1, allowing the cells to respond similarly to transient, high-intensity signals and sustained, low-intensity signals. This “dose-duration reciprocity” allows encoding of both the intensity and persistence of glucose as an important energy resource and signaling molecule.

By combining experiments with mathematical modeling, we discovered a reciprocal dose and duration response relying on the orchestrated action of three kinases (AtWNK1, AtWNK8, and AtWNK10) acting on distinct timescales and activation thresholds. Specifically, we find that high concentrations of D-glucose rapidly signal through AtWNK8 and AtWNK10, whereas low, sustained sugar concentration slowly activate the pathway through AtWNK1, allowing the cells to respond similarly to transient, high-intensity signals and sustained, low-intensity signals. This “dose-duration reciprocity” allows encoding of both the intensity and persistence of glucose as an important energy resource and signaling molecule. Cells constantly sense and respond to changes in their extracellular environment (Rué et al., 2012Rué P. Domedel-Puig N. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Pons A.J.

Information theory based approaches to cellular signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1810: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The heterogeneous and fluctuating nature of the microenvironment requires that cells possess complex signaling pathways to interpret and respond to a broad range of environmental conditions. Therefore, an important problem in cell biology is to understand the design principles of the intracellular signaling networks that allow cells to process multidimensional information, such as the amplitude and duration of external signals, and respond appropriately. There are numerous examples in which both signal amplitude and duration play critical roles in cellular decision making (Purvis and Lahav, 2013Purvis J.E. Lahav G. Encoding and decoding cellular information through signaling dynamics.Cell. 2013; 152: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These include (1) the discovery that an incoherent feedforward loop between three transcriptional regulators enhances the inflammatory response of immune cells during short-term bacterial infection but dampens inflammation if the infection becomes protracted (Litvak et al., 2009Litvak V. Ramsey S.A. Rust A.G. Zak D.E. Kennedy K.A. Lampano A.E. Nykter M. Shmulevich I. Aderem A. Function of C/EBPdelta in a regulatory circuit that discriminates between transient and persistent TLR4-induced signals.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), (2) the observation that both the intensity and duration of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity are critical factors in regulating the differentiation of thymocytes into mature T lymphocytes (Mariathasan et al., 2001Mariathasan S. Zakarian A. Bouchard D. Michie A.M. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. Ohashi P.S. Duration and strength of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signals are altered during positive versus negative thymocyte selection.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4966-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and (3) the demonstration that, in B cells, an acute spike of intracellular calcium induces activation of the transcriptional activator NF-κB, whereas low sustained calcium levels signal through another transcriptional activator nuclear factor of activated T cells (Dolmetsch et al., 1997Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Differential activation of transcription factors induced by Ca2+ response amplitude and duration.Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). These examples clearly demonstrate the importance of both signal intensity and duration in determining cell fate. However, the regulatory mechanisms that allow cells to interpret and respond to these properties are for the most part unknown. Plants also must be able to respond to continuously changing environmental conditions. For example, sugars produced from photosynthesis vary not only under regular night/day cycles but also in the presence of unpredictable weather conditions and other random changes in the light environment. Thus, the microenvironment experienced by plant cells contains sugar levels that are constantly fluctuating from micromolar to high millimolar concentrations over timescales that can range from minutes to hours (Deuschle et al., 2006Deuschle K. Chaudhuri B. Okumoto S. Lager I. Lalonde S. Frommer W.B. Rapid metabolism of glucose detected with FRET glucose nanosensors in epidermal cells and intact roots of Arabidopsis RNA-silencing mutants.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the sugar response system of plants evolved mechanisms to filter out small transient fluctuations while at the same time responding to sustained sugar concentrations. To investigate this possibility, we studied signaling through the D-glucose response pathway in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our initial investigation suggested that plants possess dose-duration reciprocity in sugar sensing that allows them to respond similarly to transient, high-intensity and sustained, low-intensity sugar signals. Therefore, we set out to determine the regulatory mechanisms that underlie dose-duration reciprocity. There are at least three main glucose-sensing and signaling pathways in Arabidopsis, including a plasma membrane heterotrimeric G protein system pathway, a hexokinase enzymatic activity independent pathway, and a glycolysis-dependent SnRK1/TOR pathway (Smeekens et al., 2010Smeekens S.

Here, we focused on the G-protein-mediated D-glucose pathway. Heterotrimeric G proteins regulate various physiological processes including growth and development, host defense, and hormonal responses in mammals, fungi, and plants (Gilman, 1987Gilman A.G.

Distinct from mammalian G proteins, which require ligand-bound G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the Arabidopsis Gα (AtGPA1) readily exchanges guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) without a GPCR (Johnston et al., 2007Johnston C.A.

Instead, the D-glucose-induced G protein activation is mediated primarily through endocytosis of the regulator of G protein signaling 1 (AtRGS1) (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat.

Chem. 2011; 286: 13143-13150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Under D-glucose treatment, AtRGS1 and the heterotrimeric G protein temporarily favor formation of the AtRGS1-AtGPA1 complex over the AtRGS1-heterotrimer complex (Johnston et al., 2007Johnston C.A. Taylor J.P. Gao Y. Kimple A.J. Grigston J.C. Chen J.G. Siderovski D.P. Jones A.M. Willard F.S. GTPase acceleration as the rate-limiting step in Arabidopsis G protein-coupled sugar signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 17317-17322Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), resulting in the accumulation of free Gβγ dimers. The Gβγ heterodimer then recruits with no lysine (WNK) kinases that phosphorylate AtRGS1 at its C-terminal region (amino acids 400–459). The phosphorylated AtRGS1 undergoes endocytosis, allowing AtGPA1 to self-activate and initiate, along with Gβγ dimers, the downstream signaling (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This effect of D-glucose on AtRGS1 endocytosis is stereospecific to D-glucose and is not an osmotic stress (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). By integrating experimental investigations and mathematical modeling, we determined that dose-duration reciprocity is achieved through the orchestrated action of three kinases (AtWNK1, AtWNK8, and AtWNK10) acting on distinct timescales and activation thresholds. Specifically, we found that high concentrations of D-glucose rapidly signal through AtWNK8 and AtWNK10, whereas low, sustained sugar concentrations slowly activate the pathway through AtWNK1. Our results demonstrate how plant cells encode both the intensity and the temporal information of extracellular sugar concentrations to initiate appropriate responses. To investigate the relationship between sugar-induced dose response and duration response, the dynamic profiles of AtRGS1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) endocytosis in Arabidopsis hypocotyl epidermal cells were measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy (see Experimental Procedures). In terms of the maximum AtRGS1 internalization level, only 9% internalization was observed with treatment of water, whereas approximately 95% internalization was obtained under 6% D-glucose. Increasing D-glucose concentration increased the rate (Figure 1A) and the amount of internalization of AtRGS1 (Figure 1B). The AtRGS1 internalization time courses reveal a reciprocal relationship between sugar dose and treatment duration required to reach maximum internalization. Specifically, the data demonstrate that near-saturating internalization is achieved by either high or low doses of sugar; however, drastically different exposure times are required to reach steady state. For example, 6% D-glucose induced a maximum steady-state internalization of AtRGS1 within 30 min of treatment, whereas with 4% D-glucose, a similar steady-state level was reached after 24 hr (Figures 1C and 1D). Treatment with 2% D-glucose led to over 60% of AtRGS1 being internalized within 3 days (Figure 1D), and this percentage increased to 70% after 4 days (Figure 2B). Note that treatment with 1% D-glucose for 1 day reached maximum internalization around 25%, and further extension of the sugar duration to 3 days did not significantly boost AtRGS1 internalization (30%; p > 0.1; Student’s t test); therefore, it is likely that the dose-duration reciprocity operates above 1% of D-glucose. These data demonstrate millimolar levels are the minimum concentration of D-glucose required for pathway activation (1% D-glucose = 55 mM). The rate at which AtRGS1 is removed from the G protein complex depends on the D-glucose concentration. However, a single glucose-dependent rate is insufficient to explain the observed dose-duration reciprocity. To illustrate this point, consider a simple two-state model in which the internalization rate of AtRGS1 is directly proportional to the concentration of D-glucose (Figure 2A). In this model, the steady-state fraction of internalized AtRGS1 is Fss = [D-glc]/(K + [D-glc]), where K = k−1/k1 and the characteristic timescale for the system to reach steady state is τ = 1/(k1([D-glc] + K)). If Fss » 1, then this implies [D-glc] >> K. In this situation τ » 1/(k1[D-glc]). Therefore, with this model, a 10-fold increase in the D-glucose concentration leads to a 10-fold decrease in the time to reach steady state. However, as noted above, an increase from 4% to 6% D-glucose reduced the time to reach steady state from around 24 hr to 30 min, a greater than 50-fold change. Therefore, this simple “ligand-receptor” model cannot account for both the near full activation of the pathway over a wide range of D-glucose concentrations and the dependence of the time to reach steady state on the D-glucose concentration (Figure 2B). To further verify this conclusion, we attempted to fit this simple model to the internalization time course data using an evolutionary algorithm (see Experimental Procedures). However, none of the 900,000 parameter sets generated by the algorithm produced a satisfactory fit to the data (Figure S1 available online).Figure S1Simple Reaction Kinetic Is Not Able to Provide the Observed Dose-Duration Reciprocity on a Large Number of Parameter Searches, Related to Figure 2Show full captionA thorough parameter search based on evolutionary algorithm (900,000 trials, see Experimental Procedures) was carried out to fit the simple model (equation shown in Figure 2A) fit into the AtRGS1 internalization data (Figure 1A).

(D) The Top 50 scored parameter sets did not yield a good fit with the data (top score = 0.8878). To investigate potential mechanisms for dose-duration reciprocity, we developed a detailed mathematical model to quantitatively describe the dynamics of AtRGS1-mediated G protein signaling. The model consists of 14 key signaling components in the G protein activation pathway (Figure 3A; Tables S1 and S2), capturing five different G protein states: GαGDPβγ, GαGTPβγ, GαGDP, GαGTP, and Gβγ. Each of these subunits (except perhaps the last one, Gβγ) forms a complex with AtRGS1. There are two major chemical cycles in the model: one containing AtRGS1-bound G proteins (“inactive cycle”; the left cycle in Figure 3A) and one containing free G proteins (“active cycle”; the right cycle in Figure 3A). In the absence of D-glucose, the majority of G proteins participate in the inactive cycle, i.e., in complexes with AtRGS1. In the presence of D-glucose, Gβγ is released from the AtRGS1:GαGTPβγ complex. Free Gβγ then recruits a kinase (e.g., AtWNK8) to phosphorylate AtRGS1, which triggers the trafficking of AtRGS1 from the plasma membrane to endosomes, leaving GαGTP at the plasma membrane to initiate signaling. In this way, AtRGS1 trafficking redistributes the G protein pool from the inactive cycle into the active cycle (Figure 3A). Because the free GαGTP and perhaps internalized AtRGS1 are responsible for downstream signaling and sugar-induced gene expression (Chen et al., 2003Chen J.-G. Willard F.S. Huang J. Liang J. Chasse S.A. Jones A.M. Siderovski D.P. A seven-transmembrane RGS protein that modulates plant cell proliferation.Science. 2003; 301: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), these variables are the key outputs of the model. We made the following assumptions in developing the model: (1) Because no evidence supports direct binding of D-glucose to AtRGS1, the model incorporates a hypothetical protein X that binds D-glucose and initiates signaling. (2) AtRGS1 endocytosis is triggered by phosphorylation. AtRGS1 phosphorylation is necessary for its endocytosis (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). (3) In addition to the kinase-dependent AtRGS1 endocytosis pathway, the model also includes a basal level of endocytosis. (3) The model allows tonic cycling (a D-glucose-independent background cycling) of AtRGS1, in which endocytosed AtRGS1 trafficks back to the plasma membrane as free AtRGS1. (4) Finally, the model is based on the total amount of G protein subunits remaining the same following sugar stimulation as supported by immunoblot analysis (Figure S2). The model assumes that AtRGS1 steady-state level does not change following D-glucose stimulation. We refer to this model as the one-kinase model, because it assumes a single kinase is responsible for phosphorylating AtRGS1. The model parameters were either taken from the literature (Table S3) or estimated by fitting the model to the AtRGS1 internalization data in Figure 1A. Parameter estimation was again performed using our evolutionary algorithm (Experimental Procedures). The top 50 estimated parameter sets were chosen out of a total 9 million trials generated by the algorithm. Interestingly, despite the intensive parameter search, these top-scored parameter sets (Figure 3B) only generated a dose-duration behavior that is qualitatively similar to that of the simple model discussed in Figures 2 and S1. The median of the top 50 parameter sets (Md1kinasetop50) is shown in Table S3. This result indicates that there are additional elements required to obtain the observed dose-duration reciprocity. Our previous study showed that sugar-induced endocytosis of AtRGS1 requires kinase phosphorylation at its C-terminal region (amino acids 400–459; Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). D-glucose favors the AtRGS1-AtGPA1 complex over AtRGS1-heterotrimer complex, resulting in accumulation of freed Gβγ dimers. The latter then recruits AtWNK kinases, including AtWNK8 and perhaps AtWNK10, to phosphorylate AtRGS1 for endocytosis (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, one potential strategy to generate dose-duration reciprocity is through an integrated action of multiple kinases that are differentially activated by Gβγ and/or phosphorylate AtRGS1 on different timescales. This regulatory mechanism represents a Gβγ-mediated positive feedback loop (Figure 3A). To test this hypothesis, we modified the detailed model to include two kinase groups, kinase 1 and kinase 2, which are activated by freed Gβγ and mediate AtRGS1 internalization (Figure 3A; red lines present kinase 2). The combined activity of both kinases determines the phosphorylation status of AtRGS1. We again used our evolutionary algorithm to fit the two-kinase model to our AtRGS1 internalization data. The model successfully generated the observed dose-duration reciprocity (Figures 3D and S3A). The median values of the top 50 scored parameter sets (Md2kinasetop50) was taken as the final parameter set for the two-kinase model (Table S3). Time courses for signaling components in the network were calculated (Figure S3B). The simulations revealed that there are two critical requirements for the model to capture the data: (1) the two kinases are activated on different timescales (kinase 1 is quickly activated by Gβγ whereas the activation of kinase 2 is slow) and (2) they have different activation thresholds (Km) with kinase 1 activated by high sugar concentrations (large Km) and kinase 2 activated under lower concentration (small Km; Figure 3C, top). Note that plotting the response time τ as a function of D-glucose concentration demonstrates the qualitatively different behavior of the two-kinase model as compared to the one-kinase model and the simple kinetic model (Figure 3C, bottom). The model predicted that blocking kinase 2 (the slow kinase) would result in the dose and duration relationship predicted by the simple kinetic model (Figure 3E). On the other hand, the model predicts blocking kinase 1 (the fast kinase) would result in a delay in AtRGS1 endocytosis under acute sugar stimulation (Figure 3F). Consequently, the internalization under high-dose D-glucose (e.g., 6%) would be reduced at an early phase of glucose stimulation (e.g., 30 min; Figure 3F). Note that this prediction is consistent with decreased AtRGS1 internalization shown with mutants lacking either AtWNK8 or AtWNK10 following 6% D-glucose for 30 min (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, AtWNK8 and AtWNK10 are good candidates for kinase 1 in mediating the dose-duration reciprocity. We validated the quantitative two-kinase model using wash-out experiments. Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to D-glucose (either 6% for 30 min or 2% for 24 hr), and then the seedlings were washed with water. AtRGS1 internalization was then monitored for 2 hr following washout (Figure 4). Following both concentrations, the model predicted fast relaxation dynamics, in which AtRGS1 internalization returns to basal levels within 1 hr. This prediction is in good qualitative agreement with the wash-out data, demonstrating the ability of the model to capture AtRGS1 endocytosis dynamics under novel experimental conditions. AtWNK8 and AtWNK10 phosphorylates AtRGS1 at its C terminus, and this phosphorylation is critical for its endocytosis (Urano et al., 2012aUrano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the double mutant wnk8-1/wnk10-1 still showed partial internalization of AtRGS1 by sugar (Figure 6C). This suggests other kinases are involved in the process of AtRGS1 endocytosis. To test whether kinases outside the WNK family are involved in the D-glucose-induced AtRGS1 endocytosis, we blocked total WNK kinase activity with the inhibitor PP1 (Yagi et al., 2009Yagi Y.I. Abe K. Ikebukuro K. Sode K. Kinetic mechanism and inhibitor characterization of WNK1 kinase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10255-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PP1 almost completely blocked AtRGS1 endocytosis (Figures 5A and 5B ), indicating that one or more other WNK kinases are required for AtRGS1 endocytosis. Thus, it follows that a set of WNK kinases may be activated in a coordinate fashion to mediate the dose-duration reciprocity. This hypothesis was tested genetically. The Arabidopsis genome encodes ten AtWNK kinases (Wang et al., 2008Wang Y. Liu K. Liao H. Zhuang C. Ma H. Yan X. The plant WNK gene family and regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis.Plant Biol (Stuttg). 2008; 10: 548-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, five of these were excluded from the test due to their incongruent expression pattern, leaving AtWNK1, AtWNK2, AtWNK5, along with AtWNK8 and AtWNK10 as candidate kinases responsible for the dose-duration reciprocity property. Genetic ablation of AtWNK2 or AtWNK5 had no effect on D-glucose-induced AtRGS1 internalization (Figure S4). Both dose and duration of D-glucose was manipulated with cells transiently expressing AtRGS1-YFP in either the wnk1 single or"
https://openalex.org/W2037710471,"Olfactory representations are shaped by brain state and respiration. The interaction and circuit substrates of these influences are unclear. Granule cells (GCs) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) are presumed to sculpt activity reaching the cortex via inhibition of mitral/tufted cells (MTs). GCs potentially make ensemble activity more sparse by facilitating lateral inhibition among MTs and/or enforce temporally precise activity locked to breathing. Yet the selectivity and temporal structure of wakeful GC activity are unknown. We recorded GCs in the MOB of anesthetized and awake mice and identified state-dependent features of odor coding and temporal patterning. Under anesthesia, GCs were sparsely active and strongly and synchronously coupled to respiration. Upon waking, GCs desynchronized, broadened their tuning and largely fired independently from respiration. Thus, during wakefulness, GCs exhibited stronger odor responses with less temporal structure. We propose that during wakefulness GCs may shape MT odor responses through broadened lateral interactions rather than respiratory synchronization."

Coevolution between the emergent miRNAs and their targets suggested that novel miRNAs became integrated into ancient gene circuitry to exert additional control over proliferation. We conclude that multiple cell-cycle regulatory events contribute to the emergence of primate-specific cortical features, including the OSVZ, generated enlarged supragranular layers, largely responsible for the increased primate cortex computational abilities."

https://openalex.org/W1982418282,"Cancer cell proliferation is a metabolically demanding process, requiring high glycolysis, which is known as ""Warburg effect,"" to support anabolic growth. Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), a steroid receptor coactivator, is overexpressed and/or amplified in multiple cancer types, including non-steroid targeted cancers, such as urinary bladder cancer (UBC). However, whether SRC-3 regulates the metabolic reprogramming for cancer cell growth is unknown. Here, we reported that overexpression of SRC-3 accelerated UBC cell growth, accompanied by the increased expression of genes involved in glycolysis. Knockdown of SRC-3 reduced the UBC cell glycolytic rate under hypoxia, decreased tumor growth in nude mice, with reduction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and lactate dehydrogenase expression levels. We further revealed that SRC-3 could interact with hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which is a key transcription factor required for glycolysis, and coactivate its transcriptional activity. SRC-3 was recruited to the promoters of HIF1α-target genes, such as glut1 and pgk1. The positive correlation of expression levels between SRC-3 and Glut1 proteins was demonstrated in human UBC patient samples. Inhibition of glycolysis through targeting HK2 or LDHA decelerated SRC-3 overexpression-induced cell growth. In summary, overexpression of SRC-3 promoted glycolysis in bladder cancer cells through HIF1α to facilitate tumorigenesis, which may be an intriguing drug target for bladder cancer therapy."

However, mass accretion can also be converted into kinetic energy via mechanical outflow. Using x-ray observations, Soria et al. (p. 1330 , published online 27 February; see the Perspective by King and the cover) identified a compact shock-ionized radio/optical nebula in spiral galaxy M83, powered by a black hole, inferred that the black hole emits a spherical wind that exceeds the Eddington limit tenfold and succeeded in estimating it's mass in the range of 5 to 15 solar masses. It is possible that rapidly accreting black holes have greater influence on their host galaxy than once appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W1977069279,"Enzymes of the sulfur assimilation pathway are potential targets for improving nutrient content and environmental stress responses in plants. The committed step in this pathway is catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase, which synthesizes adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) from sulfate and ATP. To better understand the molecular basis of this energetically unfavorable reaction, the x-ray crystal structure of ATP sulfurylase isoform 1 from soybean (Glycine max ATP sulfurylase) in complex with APS was determined. This structure revealed several highly conserved substrate-binding motifs in the active site and a distinct dimerization interface compared with other ATP sulfurylases but was similar to mammalian 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthetase. Steady-state kinetic analysis of 20 G. max ATP sulfurylase point mutants suggests a reaction mechanism in which nucleophilic attack by sulfate on the α-phosphate of ATP involves transition state stabilization by Arg-248, Asn-249, His-255, and Arg-349. The structure and kinetic analysis suggest that ATP sulfurylase overcomes the energetic barrier of APS synthesis by distorting nucleotide structure and identifies critical residues for catalysis. Mutations that alter sulfate assimilation in Arabidopsis were mapped to the structure, which provides a molecular basis for understanding their effects on the sulfur assimilation pathway."

Thus, the GltPh structures represent excellent models for the brain transporters. transmembrane domain analysis of variance copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3.

Comparison of outward- and inward-facing GltPh structures shows that the transport domain traverses the membrane by approximately 15 Å during the translocation (12.Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. et al.Structure of a glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii.Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 13.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D.

Ginter C. Boudker O. et al.Transport mechanism of a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters.Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A clue on the anion conducting mode comes from an “intermediate” GltPh structure, where the transport domain has moved by only 3.5 Å relative to the outward-facing structure (Fig. 1A) (15.Verdon G. Boudker O. et al.Crystal structure of an asymmetric trimer of a bacterial glutamate transporter homolog.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast to the outward- and inward-facing structures, the intermediate structure shows a cavity potentially accessible to both the extracellular and cytoplasmic media (15.Verdon G. Boudker O. et al.Crystal structure of an asymmetric trimer of a bacterial glutamate transporter homolog.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because GltPh is also capable of substrate-dependent anion conduction (30.Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. et al.The uncoupled chloride conductance of a bacterial glutamate transporter homolog.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the intermediate structure was hypothesized to be similar to the anion conducting conformation. A prediction of this idea is that if the relative movement of the transport domain will be restricted to less than 5–7 Å, transport should be abolished, but the ability of the substrate to gate the anion conductance should remain intact. Here we show that this phenotype is indeed observed in the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, when cysteine residues are introduced in the extracellular parts of TM5 and 8 at positions close enough to enable the formation of a disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions in both outward-facing and intermediate conformations.

Transport of d-[3H]aspartate was done as described (33.Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. et al.Glutamate 404 is involved in the substrate discrimination of GLT-1, a (Na+ + K+)-coupled glutamate transporter from rat brain.J. Biol.

Briefly, HeLa cells were plated on 24-well plates and washed with transport medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2. Each well was then incubated with 200 μl of transport medium supplemented with 0.4 μCi of the substrate d-[3H]aspartate for 10 min, followed by washing, solubilization of the cells with SDS, and scintillation counting. Effects of CuPh and DTT on transport were monitored after washing the cells expressing the indicated constructs once with choline solution (150 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2) followed by a 5-min preincubation with the concentrations of these reagents in the media indicated in the figure legends. The solutions of CuPh and DTT were prepared just prior to each individual experiment. In the case of CuPh this was done from a frozen aliquot of a stock solution prepared by mixing 0.4 ml of 1.25 m CuPh in water/ethanol (1:1) with 0.6 ml of 250 mm CuSO4. Statistical evaluations utilized a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test. In the case of the effects by Cd2+ there was no preincubation, and d-[3H]aspartate transport was measured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Cd2+. cRNA was transcribed using mMESSAGE-mMACHINE (Ambion) and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, which were maintained as described (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. et al.Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two agarose-cushioned micropipettes (1% 2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 3 megohms), voltage clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments), and digitized using Digidata 1322 (Axon Instruments) both controlled by the pClamp9.0 suite (Axon Instruments). Voltage jumping was performed using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (32.Borre L. Kanner B.I. et al.Arginine 445 controls the coupling between glutamate and cations in the neuronal transporter EAAC-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The standard buffer, termed ND96, was composed of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5. The composition of other perfusion solutions is indicated in the figure legends. Offset voltages in chloride substitution experiments were avoided by use of an agarose bridge (1% 2 m KCl) that connected the recording chamber to the Ag/AgCl ground electrode. Before applying the DTT or CuPh, at the concentrations in the figure legends, the flow was stopped, the oocyte was unclamped, and the grounding electrode was removed. Subsequently, these reagents were applied directly into the bath. After 2 or 5 min of incubation with DTT or CuPh, respectively, the oocyte was perfused with 150–200 ml of ND96 before measuring the transport currents. For radioactive uptake, eight to ten oocytes, expressing EAAC1-WT or EAAC1-W441C/K269C, were preincubated with CuPh or DTT as above, followed by an incubation for 20 min in ND96 containing d-[3H]aspartate as described previously (24.Borre L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All current-voltage relations represent steady-state substrate-elicited net currents ((Ibuffer+substrate) − (Ibuffer)) and were analyzed by Clampfit version 8.2 or 9.0 (Axon instruments), and the data have been normalized as indicated in the figure legends. To restrict the movement of the transport domain relative to the trimerization domain, we introduced a cysteine residue in each, followed by oxidative cross-linking. We searched for positions in the GltPh structure, predicted to be close enough so that the introduced cysteine residues potentially could form a disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions. To increase the probability of accessibility to oxidizing reagents, positions at the external parts of these domains were selected. As can be seen, both Val-216 and Gln-220 from TM5 (trimerization domain) are close to Ala-391 from TM8 (transport domain) in the outward-facing (Fig. 1B) and intermediate structures (Fig. 1C). However, the paired residues are far from each other in the inward-facing structure (Fig. 1D). Therefore, cysteine residues were introduced at the corresponding positions of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1, yielding the mutants K269C, V273C, and W441C. Because we used inhibition of d-[3H]aspartate uptake by CuPh as an indirect read-out of cross-linking, the transport activity of the mutants needs to be significant. Therefore, we did not use mutant combinations involving R445C, which is the EAAC1 counterpart of Met-395 of GltPh, located one α-helical turn “below” Ala-391 and close to Ile-213 and Val-216. Substitution of Arg-445 by serine results in very low transport rates (32.Borre L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and transport activity of R445C was only 15.7 ± 5.2% of EAAC1-WT (n = 4). This is the reason that only W441C/K269C and W441C/V273C were considered for our subsequent studies. Because of the highly variable transporter expression in Xenopus oocytes, we studied the effect of CuPh and other reagents on radioactive transport in HeLa cells (but see Fig. 8 for experiments with oocytes). We used d-[3H]aspartate for these studies because with this transporter substrate the background levels in the HeLa cell expression system are lower than with l-[3H]aspartate or with l-[3H]glutamate. The transport activity of W441C and V273C was somewhat higher than that of EAAC1-WT (Fig. 2A). However, the activity of K269C and the double mutants W441C/K269C and W441C/V273C was lower, but their transport activity was nevertheless sufficient to perform reliable measurements (Fig. 2A). Transport by W441C/K269C was inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of CuPh. Preincubation of the cells expressing this double mutant with 1 μm CuPh resulted already in an inhibition of d-[3H]aspartate transport of 60–70% (Figs. 2B and 3). No such inhibition was observed with cells expressing the double mutant W441C/V273C, EAAC1-WT, and the single mutants K269C and V273C (Fig. 2B). However, some inhibition was seen with W441C (Fig. 2B), but as can be seen from analysis of the concentration dependence of inhibition by CuPh, the inhibition seen with W441C was much lower than with W441C/K269C (Fig. 3). No inhibition was seen with W441A/K269C (Fig. 2B), indicating that the effect of CuPh on W441C/K269C is unlikely to be caused by the cross-linking of cysteine 269 with a previously buried endogenous cysteine, which became exposed as a consequence of the replacement of Trp-441 with a smaller amino acid residue. The modest inhibition seen with W441C/K269V is similar to that of W441C alone (Fig. 2B), and thus in the background of W441C, potent inhibition only is observed with a cysteine residue present at position 269. Finally, when W441C and K269C were coexpressed using different plasmids (W441C + K269C), the same small inhibition was observed as with W441C (Fig. 2B), indicating that for potent inhibition the two cysteine residues need to be present on the same polypeptide chain. To examine the possibility that part of the cells expressing W441C/K269C transporters was already cross-linked, even prior to treatment with CuPh, the cells were assayed for transport after incubation with 12 mm DTT. However, this resulted only in a minor stimulation of transport activity, which was 111.2 ± 5.3% of the untreated control compared with 106.2 ± 1.2% in the case of EAAC1-WT (n = 3).FIGURE 3.Sensitivity of W441C/K269C to CuPh. HeLa cells expressing the indicated mutants were preincubated in NaCl-containing medium with the indicated concentrations of CuPh for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently the cells were washed and assayed for d-[3H]aspartate transport as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Values are given as percentage of activity in the absence of CuPh.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide additional evidence that positions 441 and 269 could be close in space, the ability of the W441C/K269C double mutant to form a high affinity Cd2+ binding site was examined. This divalent cation interacts with cysteinyl side chains (37.Pérez-Garcia M.T. Chiamvimonvat N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. et al.Structure of the sodium channel pore revealed by serial cysteine mutagenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38.Glusker J.P. et al.Structural aspects of metal liganding to functional groups in proteins.Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the affinity of the interaction is dramatically increased when the Cd2+ can be coordinated by two cysteines (39.Bénitah J.P. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. et al.Adjacent pore-lining residues within sodium channels identified by paired cysteine mutagenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consistent with the oxidative cross-linking data, transport by W441C/K269C was also extremely sensitive to Cd2+ (Fig. 4). The activity of K269C was not inhibited by Cd2+, at least not in the concentration range tested, whereas W441C was only slightly sensitive (Fig. 4). The degree of cross-linking between the cysteine residues introduced at positions 269 and 441 of EAAC1 is expected to depend on the conformation of the transporters. Therefore, the preincubation step with 1 μm CuPh was done in the presence and absence of transporter ligands. The highest sensitivity was observed when the preincubation medium contained sodium, either in the presence or in the absence of the substrate l-aspartate (Fig. 5). A significant protection against the inhibition was observed in the presence of potassium, whereas intermediate sensitivity was observed when choline was present in the preincubation medium (Fig. 5).

https://openalex.org/W1963739152,"The small GTPase Rab27A is a crucial regulator of actin-based melanosome transport in melanocytes, and functionally defective Rab27A causes human Griscelli syndrome type 2, which is characterized by silvery hair. A GTPase-deficient, constitutively active Rab27A(Q78L) mutant has been shown to act as an inhibitor of melanosome transport and to induce perinuclear aggregation of melanosomes, but the molecular mechanism by which Rab27A(Q78L) inhibits melanosome transport remained to be determined. In this study, we attempted to identify the primary cause of the perinuclear melanosome aggregation induced by Rab27A(Q78L). The results showed that Rab27A(Q78L) is unable to localize on mature melanosomes and that its inhibitory activity on melanosome transport is completely dependent on its binding to the Rab27A effector Slac2-a/melanophilin. When we forcibly expressed Rab27A(Q78L) on mature melanosomes by using a novel melanosome-targeting tag that we developed in this study and named the MST tag, the MST-Rab27A(Q78L) fusion protein behaved in the same manner as wild-type Rab27A. It localized on mature melanosomes without inducing melanosome aggregation and restored normal peripheral melanosome distribution in Rab27A-deficient cells. These findings indicate that the GTPase activity of Rab27A is required for its melanosome localization but is not required for melanosome transport."

https://openalex.org/W2092639250,"Histone variants play specific roles in maintenance and regulation of chromatin structures. H2ABbd, an H2A variant, possesses a highly divergent structure compared with canonical H2A and is highly expressed in postmeiotic germ cells, but its functions in the regulation of gene expression are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the cellular phenotype associated with enforced H2ABbd expression. Among H2A variants, H2ABbd specifically caused growth defect in human cells and induced apoptosis. H2ABbd expression resulted in degradation of inhibitor of κB-α and translocation of NF-κB into nuclei, indicating the activation of NF-κB. Intriguingly, NF-κB activity was essential for H2ABbd-induced apoptosis. H2ABbd overexpression resulted in DNA damage after release from G1/S, progressed through the S phase slowly, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, gene expression microarray analysis revealed that expression of H2ABbd activates groups of genes involved in apoptosis and postmeiotic germ cell development, suggesting that H2ABbd might influence transcription. Taken together, our data suggest that H2ABbd may contribute to specific chromatin structures and promote NF-κB activation, which could in turn induce apoptosis in mammalian cells."
